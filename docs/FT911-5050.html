			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: A modern genius cut off after his prime Seurat, the major exhibition that now occupies the Grand Palais in Paris (until August 12, then to New York: sponsored in Paris by Aerospatiale and IBM), continues the programme the Reunion des musees nationaux has sustained now over rather more than a decade, of the definitive celebration of the great figures of French art. With Georges Seurat the prospect is especially enticing, for he was hardly the most prolific of painters and here would seem to be our chance to see him clearly and see him whole. In thus presenting his essential achievement, the event is no disappointment, but while it confirms his central importance as an artist it leaves the nature of that achievement, if anything, more ambiguous than before. Along with Van Gogh, Schiele and Modigliani, all of them lately the subject of major individual studies, we again have a case of the artist cut off prematurely and in his prime. The only difference is that with Seurat the cruel and unworthy thought lingers on, not of genius frustrated and promise unfulfilled, but rather of the great work over and in a real sense complete. We find it, moreover, rounded off by a palpable change of direction and real shift in sensibility. Who can say what would have come of it, but as it stands in the last Circus paintings, it signifies only a decline towards the mannered and the decorative, the over-theoretical and technically suspect. After the magisterial monumentality of all that had gone before, culminating in the Poseuses of 1888, and the associated studies, the contrast afforded by latest Seurat could not be more poignant. Born in 1859, he died early in 1891, it is thought of a diptheria, barely nine months after Van Gogh's suicide, who was by some six years his senior and whom he knew. The careers of the two men marched thus somewhat together, though it was Seurat's that was the more orthodox in its origins, began earlier and was to prosper, comparatively, in his lifetime. It is astonishing here to recognise quite how quickly he came to his full maturity as an artist. He began his studies at the Atelier Lequien in 1876, going on to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1878. Here among the drawings that represent those beginnings are two academic studies of the male nude, standing, full-length, both cast in a strong light, in which the abstracted simplicities of the later drawings are already immanent. Une baignade, Asnieres, the huge composition now at the National Gallery in London, was completed in 1884, when Seurat was all of 25, Un dimanche a la Grande Jatte, similarly huge and now at the Art Institute of Chicago, only two years later. Both paintings are present only in full-size reproduction in black-and-white, as is the Poseuses in the Barnes Foundation at Philadelphia, which is an undoubted pity. Opportunity missed, however, serves to place a full and necessary emphasis on the preparatory material, of which an extraordinary amount has been brought together. And it is the relation in which this mass of drawings, studies and sketches stands to the finished works, with all their overt formal control and technical considerations, that is the heart of the matter, and the key to Seurat. He was never simply an artist responsive to the external, visible world. In a sense no artist ever is, for everything must be ordered, simplified, and to an extent rendered through a system - vide the impressionists quasi-scientific concern with light and its effects. But Seurat was always also a moralist, and it is important in this connection to remember the central importance of symbolism, so long disregarded by our later reading of modern art, to Seurat's own generation of modern artists. The first room of drawings, and a number of studies, all of the early 1880s, make clear the positive interest he took in the work of Millet and Puvis de Chavannes, a conscious influence he shared with Van Gogh. But the sheer painterliness of impressionism he evidently found irresistible, with its clear, clean colour, the rich, fat paint and the mark free and open upon the surface. How was one to reconcile such hedonism to more serious purpose? His first answer was to abstract and simplify, always searching out the essential horizontal and vertical in the image, always presenting it repetitively, formal and frontal, as though to keep his distance. No particular is celebrated for itself but only in that it should serve the grand design. There would be no seeking to fix the petit sensation of the cornfield or the river-bank sur le motif, like Cezanne, for him. No wonder that the artists of the Independants, with whom he showed the Baignade in 1885, should be disconcerted by what seemed so blatant a shift of principle and practice. Theory mattered, and with the Baignade, pointillist neo-impressionism had arrived. Gauguin and Van Gogh, Cezanne and Seurat, so we were always taught, were together the four pillars of post-impressionism: how interesting that Seurat, the youngest, should be the first. The Fauves are coming to London later in the summer, and how useful it is to see Seurat now, a sort of fauve avant la lettre, in relation to early Matisse and Derain. What is more fascinating, however, is to see the degree to which, in these smaller works, Seurat remained so much the instinctive painter still, even while consulting his larger formal interests. The tiny studies he made along the Seine through the middle 80s, those for la Grande Jatte especially, despite the repetitive, systematic simplicity by which they can be slotted in to their place in the great composition, are among the most perfect, direct and unaffected examples of high impressionism. The light shimmers across the water; a girl sits sewing beneath the trees; other figures stand Marienbad-like, anchored to their shadows, bustle and parasol in strong silhouette; we almost smell the sun on warm earth and grass.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Stockbrokers see blue skies in Hong Kong - The driving forces behind the colony's equity market gains IT was hard to find people willing to talk down the Hong Kong stock market yesterday. After six consecutive days of rises in the Hang Seng index - the barometer of market sentiment - all brokers could talk about was blue skies, as far as the eye could see. And they have a point. The Hang Seng finished yesterday 11.75 higher at 4,522.21 - another all-time peak for the index - and more than 5 per cent better than the closing level for 1991 just three weeks ago. Property developers and banks have led the way, but the whole market is on a rising trend. Last year, Hong Kong was second only to Mexico among top performers in the FT-Actuaries World Indices. It put on more than 44 per cent in local currency terms in 1991, against gains of 27.4 per cent for the US, 15.4 per cent for the UK and just 0.3 per cent for Japan. In 1990, too, it did well, rising by 3.9 per cent against a World Index fall of 23.6 per cent. So what is the driving force in Hong Kong? First, it had a long way to recover, following the global stock market crash of 1987, and the aftermath of the Chinese student uprising in 1989. In general, the answer would appear to be a combination of economics and politics. At the economic level there are three powerful forces at work: negative real interest rates in Hong Kong of the order of 8 per cent; the continuing boom in the southern Chinese economy (industrial production there grew by more than 20 per cent last year and much of it is owned by Hong Kong companies); and buoyant economic activity in the colony itself. Real GDP growth in Hong Kong is expected to top 5 per cent this year. The last two factors underpin some fairly bullish predictions for corporate earnings growth in the colony of anywhere from 16 per cent to 20 per cent depending on whether you are an optimist or a pessimist. With the market currently trading on an historic price/earnings ratio of around 12.5, 20 per cent growth in earnings puts it at a prospective p/e of just over 10 and, at that level, undervalued. The cost of money in the colony is also cheap and likely to get cheaper in the short term, as the money markets follow US interest rates lower. In Hong Kong cheap money has only two places to go: the property market or the stock market. But, with the government and banks ganging up against property developers through tighter lending controls on home buyers (a prospective purchaser now has to stump up 30 per cent of the valuation of the property to obtain a mortgage) the stock market has been the main beneficiary. The main political influence upon the market was last week's settlement between the US and China over America's 'Special 301' claim against the Chinese for the infringement of intellectual property rights. Hong Kong had a whiff of the deal in the air all last week - the market improved 62 points before it became public on Friday - and once it happened, share prices rose sharply. Foreign fund managers, who had preferred to wait last week, piled into the market on Monday and continued their buying spree yesterday when the market weakened; some local fund managers, heard to mumble 'toppish' after the market broke through 2,500 on Monday, are sitting back counting profits. Looking further ahead, US-China trade rows still have the potential to upset sentiment. President George Bush has to approve China's most favoured nation status by June and there are further 301 disputes in the pipeline over US access to China's market. Inflation in southern China is also seen as a potential problem for Hong Kong. If inflation were to get out of control in the south, as it did in 1989, the Beijing authorities - who favour the sledgehammer approach to economic fine tuning - will seek to dampen economic expansion. That would hurt growth prospects for the colony. So, where will the equity market go from here? 'We are entering volatile times,' says Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie. 'But the market has got a head of steam up and is still trying to go higher.'</p>

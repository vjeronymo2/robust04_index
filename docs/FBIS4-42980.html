			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Commission </F> Says U.S. Decisions Will Help China's Membership in GATT, Shares  View That There Is No Direct Link Between Trade and Human  Rights"]    [Text] Brussels, 27 May (Agence Europe) -- The spokesman  for the European Commission commented favorably on the decisions  made by President Clinton extending certain trade measures  (namely the clause of most favored nation [MFN]) towards China,  and this from a dual point of view:     -  Anything contributing  to the opening and liberalization of trade with China will  facilitate China's membership in GATT. Sir Leon Brittan said on  several occasions that the European Union favors this membership  if the indispensable conditions are met. Two weeks ago, GATT  Director General Peter Sutherland, after talks in Beijing,  indicated that a lot of technical problems remained to be solved  and that negotiations were difficult. At present, they may be  accelerated;    -  The Commission shares the view that there should be  no direct link between the respect of human rights and trade  sanctions. Certainly, the fundamental objective of obtaining an  improvement in matters of democracy and human rights remains  valid, and some too serious offenses could not be tolerated.  But in general the link must not be automatic.     EUROPE adds that Mr. Sutherland recently declared that  Taiwan's membership in the GATT has no connection with China's.  According to him, Taiwan is a country in full expansion, its  membership would boost the development of the world trade  system, negotiations are being held in two separate groups, and  Taiwan will be able to join as soon as it has obtained two  thirds of the votes."</p>

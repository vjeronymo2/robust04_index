			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Retail recovery 'remote' RETAIL SALES volumes will not start to recover until the second half of next year and will grow at only a modest pace in the three following years, Verdict, the retailing market research company, says, Guy de Jonquieres writes. It forecasts that sales volumes will grow by 7.5 per cent between 1991 and 1996 - barely half the rate during the previous five years - and that in real terms sales per sq ft at the end of the period will still be below the 1988 peak. According to Verdict, retailing is suffering from a surplus of capacity caused by over-rapid expansion in the 1980s. Although the number of shops fell by 44,000 to 271,000 during the decade, total selling space increased by 72m sq ft to about 460m sq ft - a level last seen in 1950. In spite of the recession, the number of shop closures this decade will be lower than in the 1960s and 1970s, Verdict says. In the next five years, selling space is forecast to grow by about 3 per cent, almost half the increase being accounted by multiple grocers.

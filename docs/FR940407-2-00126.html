			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. In addition to the current class of Existing Shares, the Fund may offer several classes of New Shares: (1) In connection with a distribution plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 (a ``Distribution Plan'') and/or (2) in connection with a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan (``Shareholder Services Plan''). Shares offered subject to the Distribution Plan are referred to as the ``Distribution Shares.'' The Distribution Plan and the Shareholder Services Plan are collectively referred to herein as ``Plans.'' The Fund may offer an unlimited number of classes of shares, either in connection with a Plan, with more than one Plan, or without any of the Plans. All classes of shares issued by the Fund in connection with any order granted in response to the application will comply with all representations and conditions contained herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Under each of the Distribution Plan and the Shareholder Services Plan, either the Fund or the Distributor enters into servicing agreements (``Service Agreements'') with banks, broker-dealers, or other institutions, including the Distributor if the Fund so elects (``Service Organizations''), concerning the provision of certain account administration services to the customers (``Customers'') of the Service Organizations. Service Agreements under the Distribution Plan also contemplate an asset-based sales charge to compensate Service Organizations for the distribution of Distribution Shares and the provision of certain additional shareholder liaison services to Customers, which services arguably could be considered to be distribution-related. The Shareholder Services Plan would be used with respect to Service Organizations authorized to provide only personal and account maintenance services under a Shareholder Services Plan, and the Distribution Plan would be used with respect to the Service Organizations authorized to provide the distribution and distribution-related and liaison services under the Distribution Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Under each Plan, depending on whether either the Fund or the Distributor was a party to a Service Agreement with a Service Organization, the Fund or the Distributor (which would be reimbursed by the Fund) would pay a Service Organization for its services and assistance in accordance with the terms of the relevant Plan and the particular Service Agreement (``Service Payments''). Service Payments with respect to a Shareholder Services Plan are ``service fees,'' and Service Payments with respect to a Distribution Plan are ``service fees'' or ``asset-based sales charges'' or both, as defined in Article III, section 26 of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Rules of Fair Practice. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Any front-end load, asset-based sales charge, service fee, or contingent deferred sales load will comply with section 26(d), Article III of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. In the event that a Distribution Plan and a Shareholder Services Plan are adopted with respect to a single class of shares, the Directors will apply the analysis required under rule 12b&hyph;1(d) to the aggregate amount paid under such Plans in order to assure that, to the extent that the Plans may be deemed to overlap in some respects, compensation shall not be duplicative as a result of the use of both Plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Under the proposed arrangement, each New Share or Existing Share in a particular Portfolio, regardless of class, would represent an interest in the same portfolio of investments and would have identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights, preferences, powers, restrictions, limitations, qualifications, designations and terms and conditions, except that: (a) Each class of New Shares would have a different class designation; (b) each class of New Shares offered in connection with a Plan (or Plans) would bear the expense of the Service Payments that would be made under the Service Agreements that are entered into with respect to such class; (c) each class of shares could also bear certain expenses described in condition 1 below (the ``Class Expenses'') that are directly attributable only to the class; (d) only the holders of the shares of the class or classes involved would be entitled to vote on matters pertaining to a Plan and any related agreements relating to such class or classes (for example, the adoption, amendment or termination of a Plan in accordance with the provisions of rule 12b&hyph;1 or the terms of the Plan); and (e) each class would have different exchange privileges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

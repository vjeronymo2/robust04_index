			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Jurors in the New York trial of Joel Steinberg, accused of killing his  6-year-old adopted daughter, deliberated for a seventh day amid predictions of  a manslaughter verdict. Acting Justice Harold Rothwax told the state Supreme  Court jury not to weigh lesser charges unless it decided to acquit Steinberg of  second-degree murder, and the jury sought repeated instructions on a  manslaughter verdict. The panel sent out a note indicating it was unable to  find that Steinberg intended serious injury to Lisa Steinberg, who slipped into  a coma and died after he allegedly punched her in the head. The jury also asked  to hear again testimony from Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's former live-in lover,  who gave the most damaging testimony against him.  </P></p>

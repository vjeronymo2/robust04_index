			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leonid Kapelyushnyy: "Ukrainian Supreme Council </F> in Addition to 124 Important Issues Will Examine a Paramount,  125th Issue: Electing a Speaker"]    [Text] Kiev -- Before electing a speaker the Ukrainian  parliamentarians have decided to instruct a provisional working  presidium of five people to hold the first session.    Their candidacies have been discussed in the factions and in  a certain sense they reflected the parliament's multilevel  composition. And complex composition. When the five sat down  at the table the auditorium guffawed loudly -- the central seat  was taken by Vasil Durdinets, who heads the centrists' faction.  To the right was Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the socialists and  a presidential candidate. On the left was Vitaliy Masol, first  premier of the independent Ukraine, who was "swallowed up" by  the students' hunger strike. To his left was Petr Simonenko,  leader of the Ukrainian Communists, who gained 86 seats out of  350 in the parliament and represent the most powerful faction.  And next to them was Vyacheslav Chornovil, the eternal  opposition member and romantic knight of anticommunism. The  People's Rukh which he heads received about 30 seats and in the  present situation could seriously influence the adoption of  important decisions.    The word faction is a new one in the Ukrainian dictionary of  party work. The old Supreme Rada was quite homogenous. At the  new elections the candidates ran not on party lists but under  party slogans and now in the first hours of its work the session  has raised the tough question of identifying allegiances.    The more than 100 deputies who are reluctant to join anyone  and, like Kipling's cat, prefer to "walk by themselves" are of  some inconvenience to the members of all five factions. Without  particularly consulting with them they are trying to unite them  into a mixed group whose status and rights are not completely  clear to anyone.    One of the most curious documents in the first package of  documents proposed to the deputies is the guideline list of the  most important issues for examination at the first session.  There are 124 of them. They include acute, socially painful  questions of privatization, price formation, the use of nuclear  energy and radiation energy, the credit and monetary system, and  others. The rayon to which the village of Shumlyany in Ternopol  Oblast will belong is probably also a very important question  for the village's inhabitants but without curbing corruption and  crime, without checking inflation and creating an effective  system for all branches of power, Ukraine will simply cease to  exist as an independent state.    The 124 questions include a report by Leonid Kravchuk on the  political and socioeconomic situation, a Ukrainian Government  report, the formation of the government, and many other truly  fateful questions. Like, for instance, the point on additions  to the law on the demarcation of powers between the organs of  state power of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, they contain  only a hint of their acute nature. Yet the Crimean pickets  arrived before anyone at the Mariyinskyy Palace and were the  last to leave. But in contrast to the Sevastopol inhabitants  with their red flags and portraits of Lenin and Stalin, to whom  we are accustomed, these stood with yellow and blue banners and  demanded that the Ukrainian Parliament protect Crimea's  Ukrainian population from psychological terrorism. The demand  of a deputation of Crimean public and political organizations  that the question of the situation in Crimea be included on the  agenda for the first session was distributed among the deputies  and journalists. Otherwise, the petition-bearers threaten, they  are prepared to declare a long-term hunger strike in front of  the Supreme Council, to appeal to the world public and Ukrainian  people for support, to urge the people to civil disobedience,  and to create in Crimea an alternative representative organ of  Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, claiming that all responsibility  "for the further development of events in Crimea will rest with  the Ukrainian Supreme Council."    The deputies' outward lack of haste and boring  meticulousness on questions of standing orders and procedural  details are not concealing the tension behind the scenes. One  of the main issues of the first session is the election of a  chairman and his deputies. In the opinion of analysts Aleksandr  Moroz, Vasil Durdinets, and Ivan Plyushch, who is still in the  shadows, have the greatest chances of becoming speaker. The  very important question of holding presidential and local  council elections or, as Leonid Kravchuk insists, of putting  them off until later, is also so far outside the picture.</p>

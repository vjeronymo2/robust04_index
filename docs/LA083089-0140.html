			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BENTSEN WEIGHS CAPITAL GAINS CUT  </P> <P> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is  examining ways to reduce capital gains taxes, it was reported today.  </P> <P> Bentsen told the Wall Street Journal in a telephone interview that he intends  to ask his tax-writing committee to devise a bill that would raise federal  revenues about $8 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Such an increase would extend several tax breaks that are about to expire,  including the credit for research and development expenditures.  </P> <P> Bentsen said a capital gains tax cut "is one of those things we'll have to take  a look at" as part of the tax package.  </P></p>

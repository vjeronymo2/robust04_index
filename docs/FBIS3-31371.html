			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 16 (AFP) -- UNPROFOR's leadership  stressed Wednesday [16 February] that Serb and Moslem forces  must put heavy arms under UN control before Monday and said if  they took the weapons back, air strikes would be launched  against them.    General Jean Cot of France, commander-in-chief of the UN  Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia, said the weapons must be put  under armed control "within 10 days", meaning before the Sunday  midnight ultimatum laid down by NATO expires.    "I expect all the heavy weapons from both sides to be placed  under our control before February 20," he added, speaking at a  joint news conference at Sarajevo airport.    Ten mortars from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army are already  under guard of armed UN peacekeepers, held in a barracks used by  the Ukrainian UNPROFOR contingent in Sarajevo.    However 36 heavy weapons that the Serbs agreed to place  under  UN control are at present only being guarded by unarmed UN  military observers.    A senior UNPROFOR officer revealed to AFP Tuesday that the  UNPROFOR military leadership had asked several times to put  armed guards outside the two hangars where the arms are held but  that the Serbs refused.    General Andre Soubirou, UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo,  said  "three additional areas for storing heavy weapons are being  sought and a certain amount of weapons are being taken under  control."    General Sir Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection  Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for his part said: "We're not here  to fight a war. If they, by force of arms or superior force of  arms get their weapons back, we will use air [power] against  them. We'll use force if they take their weapons back from the  designated positions."    Cot said that at meetings Wednesday with the  commander-in-chief of the Bosnian Army, General Rasim Delic, and  Tuesday with the Serb forces' chief General Ratko Mladic, "they  made a solemn commitment to respect the process undertaken here  by General Rose."    He reiterated there were no conflicting aims between  UNPROFOR  and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that any decision  to carry out air strikes would be taken "here, on the ground, by  General Rose and myself."    Earlier in Brussels, NATO reiterated warnings that the  deadline for the demilitarization of Sarajevo would be enforced  by air strikes if necessary and denied any differences with UN  peacekeepers over the meaning of "control" of Serb heavy weapons  around the city.    Earlier in Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said NATO and the United  Nations saw eye-to-eye on how to control heavy weapons of  Bosnian Serbs in the Sarajevo area.    "Coordination meetings between NATO and the UN have sorted  out all points," Peter MacFarlane, a spokesman for the United  Nations Protection Force, told a press conference here.    His comments contrasted with reports from Brussels that NATO  was becoming increasingly critical of apparently inadequate UN  plans to monitor the Serb artillery around the city.</p>

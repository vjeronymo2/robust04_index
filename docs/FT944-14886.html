			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sysco increases 21% at Dollars 58.4m Sysco, the biggest US distributor of food to restaurants, hotels, schools and other places where people eat away from home, reported a 21 per cent increase in net profits to Dollars 58.4m in its first quarter, writes Richard Tomkins. The comparison was flattered by an extra tax charge of Dollars 4.9m in the comparable quarter which reduced net profits to Dollars 48.1m. But Sysco said the pre-tax figure was more than 10 per cent ahead even after incurring start-up costs on significant new business. In the latest quarter, sales increased by 10 per cent to Dollars 2.98bn. Mr John Woodhouse, chairman, said that real volumes, after adjusting for food price inflation of 1.8 per cent, were up 8.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Hong Wen (1738 2429): "The British Hong Kong </F> Authorities Have No Right To Extend the Terms of Office of  Legislative Council Members Beyond 1997"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 9 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Although  the Chinese side recently had reiterated time and again that the  three-tier councils of Hong Kong would definitely have to be  dismissed and reelected in 1997, Hong Kong Government officials  insisted at a Legislative Council [Legco] meeting today that the  term of office for would-be council members would still be four  years, and thus could straddle 1997. Some Legco members have  therefore questioned this statement by the Hong Kong Government,  which could mislead candidates and discourage them from viewing  the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 as a fundamental change.    The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 will be a change  which involves a transfer of sovereignty, which is substantially  different from events such as a certain party's stepping down  while another rises to power in the UK. Therefore, generally, a  new legislative body will have to be formed in 1997.    However, there are indications that even now the Hong Kong  Government has no intention of changing its stand on the issue  concerning the term of office for Legco members. Instead, it is  insisting on the four-year term of office for members of the  three-tier councils, as provided in Chris Patten's  constitutional reform package. Legco member Chim Pui-chung  maintains that the above provision is obviously based on wishful  thinking and may mislead the candidates.    According to the set election schedule, by 30 June 1997,  newly elected district board members will have been in office  for not more than 32 months, while Legco members will have been  in office for only 22 months. For both categories, the terms of  office will be less than 4 years. Therefore, some public  figures have pointed out that now that the Sino-British talks on  the constitutional system have broken off, the Chinese side will  definitely perform its duty to "set up another kitchen"  according to the Basic Law by 1997. The British Hong Kong  authorities have no right to unilaterally set a four-year term  of office for Legco members, because, if they do, they could be  accused of disregarding China's sovereignty.    Chim Pui-chung noted that the British Hong Kong authorities  are juggling with words in order to extend their influence  beyond 1997. This reflects the lack of frankness and sincerity  on the part of the British Hong Kong authorities toward the Hong  Kong people, a mentality which is absolutely harmful to their  administration in Hong Kong before 1997. Chim urged the Hong  Kong Government to face the reality squarely and give the  electorate a reasonable and clear explanation on the term of  office for council members.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, April 19 (AFP) -- New clashes erupted on  the outskirts of Bujumbura Tuesday [19 April] between  Tutsi-dominated army forces and Hutu militants, shattering  several weeks of relative calm, official sources said. The  clashes broke out in Hutu-dominated areas of the city, the  sources said. A government statement said Prime Minister  Anatole Kanyenkiko had taken measures to "make those who are  armed lay down their weapons."    Unrest has mounted in some areas on the outskirts of the  city  for the last few days. Sources said sporadic small arms fire  had been reported in the areas for the last few days.    The government called on observers from the Organization of  African Unity (OAU) to be deployed in the areas "to work with  civilian and military officials to create confidence between the  different ethnic groups."    The fresh unrest came two weeks after the death of Burundian  President Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6 in a plane crash in  neighbouring Rwanda, which also killed Rwandan head of state  Juvenal Habyarimana.    Inter-ethnic unrest in Rwanda is reported to have killed  thousands in the two weeks since the plane crash.</p>

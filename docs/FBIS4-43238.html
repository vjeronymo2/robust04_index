			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Thierse, deputy chairman of the </F> Social Democratic Party of Germany, in the Berlin ORF studio by  Wolfgang Hochner in the Vienna ORF studio -- live]    [Text] [Hochner] Good evening, Mr. Thierse.    [Thierse] Good evening.    [Hochner] Mr. Thierse, I do not think you will admit that  the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is in a crisis. But is  it not a critical situation to lose European elections in an  election year when Bundestag elections will be held?    [Thierse] It certainly is a critical situation, even though  I would differentiate here. We lost the elections in the west  rather than in the east, because in the east we won several  percentage points in the European elections and even more in  communal elections, where we even won an additional 6-8 percent.  We should note this difference, which shows that the defeat is  not the same everywhere.    [Hochner] Chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping has admitted  that he made mistakes. He has also been accused of keeping the  party rather disoriented, regarding a possible future coalition,  for instance. You reportedly would like to see the SPD state  very clearly that a coalition with the Greens/Alliance 90 should  be formed.    [Thierse] I think we have decided for good reason not to  conduct an election campaign of coalitions. What we tell the  citizens -- and I still think this is correct -- is that those  who want a change of government in Bonn in order to achieve a  change in policy, must help ensure that the SPD becomes the  strongest party in the Bundestag. This is the only way to bring  about a change of government. The voters and the other parties'  programs will decide with whom we should and could bring about  such a change in government. I say quite frankly that the  programmatic closeness between the SPD and the Greens is greater  than that between the SPD and the Free Democratic Party [FDP],  which has totally subordinated itself to Helmut Kohl and the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU].    [Hochner] You said the situation in the east was different  from that in the west. In the east, the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] has achieved very good results. In East Berlin,  where the writer Stefan Heym will be your rival, the PDS even  reached 40 percent. Is there not the danger that, on the one  hand, you will be worn down between Chancellor Kohl and his CDU,  and on the other, between the discontented who will then vote  for the PDS, in particular in the east?    [Thierse] The danger is really very great. We must keep in  mind, however, that this almost incredible result of 40 percent  in East Berlin is also explained by the fact that the voter  turnout there was less than 50 percent, which relativizes the  figure somewhat. But we are in a very difficult situation. We  are fought by both sides. The CDU is happy about the PDS  election successes, because they weaken the SPD.    The only thing we can do is make clear to the citizens, in a  very passionate and emotional way, what our alternative to the  present government policy is, and tell the east Germans that  east German problems can only be solved within an all-German  framework or not at all, and not by a party that cultivates  resentment against west Germans and wants to make such  resentment the basis of its own party policy success. In the  final analysis, this will only harm rather than help the east  Germans.    This is a sober and realistic message that we should tell  the  people who are furious and disappointed with Kohl's policy and  the huge economic and social problems of German unity in eastern  Germany, and who vote for the PDS rather than for a party like  the SPD which is trying to make feasible suggestions and rejects  a populist approach. That is why I think we need a much more  aggressive party and a much more aggressive election campaign,  which would make the alternatives to Kohl clearer and show that  the Social Democrats are the only ones to address east German  interests within an all-German framework.    [Hochner] But for such an aggressive election campaign, you  need an aggressive top candidate. From the Austrian  perspective, it looks -- excuse me for saying so -- like [Lower  Saxony Minister President] Gerhard Schroeder would have been the  right man, whereas Rudolf Scharping certainly is not.    [Thierse] We made a truly democratic decision in the SPD, a  poll among members. The grassroots members made a decision on  the party chairman and thus also on the chancellor candidate. I  would consider it political suicide for us to exchange the  chancellor candidate now. No, I think Rudolf Scharping is  really doing a good job. It must be clear, however, that the  SPD does not consist of one candidate only, but of many people.  It is led by a very resolute and very energetic candidate who  is in excellent shape. He is not nearly exhausted, he is a very  great fighter. I am sure of this, I have seen it in recent  weeks.    [Hochner] His opponent, Chancellor Kohl, is of course also a  very great fighter.    [Thierse] Certainly.    [Hochner] He is a great fighter who should not be  underrated. We have the impression that Chancellor Kohl is now  being carried by the wave of an incipient or imagined economic  upswing. Could it be that the Germans believe that things are  improving anyway, and that they could try it again with Helmut  Kohl this fall?    [Thierse] We must look at this very realistically. The  upswing about which people are talking is a phenomenon of the  media, because this upswing is not a recovery for all. It does  not create jobs. Now the CDU, or Helmut Kohl, must discuss this  recovery for four months, and then the citizens will start  asking questions. Where is the upswing; will it create a job for  me or my neighbor? The difference between the euphoria and  optimism that Helmut Kohl is systematically trying to spread and  the real situation will become even clearer. But I stress that  the SPD should not try to conduct the election campaign by  painting a gloomy picture, but by offering a convincing  political program that really makes credible suggestions to  overcome the most important German problem, namely mass  unemployment, and second, a program by which more social and  human justice between Germans can be created. I think this is  the most painful experience for Germans, in particular the east  Germans -- the experience of injustice regarding the  distribution of the burdens and advantages of German unity; the  economic crisis and ways to overcome it.    [Hochner] Mr. Thierse, thank you very much for this  interview.</p>

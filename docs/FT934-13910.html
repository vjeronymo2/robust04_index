			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (3): Involuntary price restraint - Stocks and output capacity remain too high ALUMINIUM STOCKS are too high. If producers are to receive better prices they must at least begin to fall. There are two ways for that to be accomplished. Either consumption can increase faster than production, or production can be reduced to a lower level than consumption. All producers have been hoping for the former, and too many have been relying on others to achieve the latter. After rising uninterrupted for 10 years, though more slowly over the past few years, consumption was barely changed between the first half of 1992 and the same period this year. But Anthony Bird Associates, a UK consultancy, described this in the July issue of its Aluminium Analysis as 'a healthy performance'. Bird found it 'impressive enough that consumption should rise by 3 per cent in the very sluggish economic conditions of 1992'. But the maintenance of this high level in early-1993, 'when world industrial production actually contracted slightly', was, it said, 'remarkable'. Bird put this down to aluminium's 'excellent competitive position' against alternative materials. It measured the metal's competitiveness at an index of 99, only just below the level in 1985, the base year, and 40 per cent better than in 'the dangerous year of 1988'. Nevertheless, Bird saw the immediate outlook for consumption as weak and expected to see some decline in the second half of this year from the corresponding 1992 levels, 'bringing consumption for the year down to around the 15.1m (tonnes) mark (from last year's 15.24m).' Thereafter, however, it saw the omens as favourable: 'a strong competitive position, economic recovery, and the prospect that the metal using industries will do better than the average'. The upshot was that it expected consumption to be growing at 3.5 to 4 per cent a year from 1994 onwards and reaching 16.8m tonnes in 1996. A similar picture was painted by Metal Bulletin Research in its September 1 aluminium market update. It saw western world consumption growth picking up in 1994 to 3.8 per cent, with a slowdown to 1.5 per cent in the US being offset by gains of 4.2 per cent in Japan, fuelled by strong gains in the car and packaging sectors, 5.6 per cent in Asia and 4 per cent in western Europe, restrained by a more subdued recovery. According to a third recent assessment, by The Spector Report of the US, western world aluminium shipments rose by 0.5 per cent in the first half of this year. It projected a 1 per cent rise for the second half, giving an advance for the year as a whole of about 0.8 per cent. But it estimated that a 4 per cent rise would be needed next year to get stocks falling and concluded that production cuts remained the only 'quick fix' to the oversupply problem. Most analysts agree that the gap to be bridged is now not that great. Spector calculated that production cuts this year by Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and Reynolds Metals, also of the US, amounting to an annual 356,000 tonnes, had left only 312,000 tonnes of surplus capacity. Time is not on the industry's side, however. 'Like interest on the national debt, each day's delay compounds the eventual solution,' warned Spector. 'In the case of the aluminium industry procrastination, it just adds to the amount of production that eventually has to be cut.' In its July analysis Bird was less gloomy than some about the gravity of the stocks problem. Excess stocks (over and above the 'normal' level of about six weeks' consumption) amounted to about eight weeks' consumption, it calculated. That compared with 13 weeks' consumption in 1982, at the low point of aluminium's last big bear market. It put the current level of oversupply - including continuing large-scale shipments from the former Soviet block - higher than did Spector, at 500,000 tonnes a year. 'Nevertheless,' said Bird, 'aluminium producers must face these short term difficulties before they can reach the - more promising - longer term.' Bird found encouragement in the fact that exchange rate changes since 1992 had pushed American aluminium producers' average costs ahead of those of their counterparts in Europe, 'where it is notoriously difficult to adapt the output of any factory to changing market conditions'. With the Americans now in the costs hot seat it suggested that the aluminium industry could be expected to become 'more responsive to excess stock levels than it has been in recent years'. It thus expected to see output cuts in the west, 'especially in 1994', together with falling exports from the former Soviet Union, as its own aluminium using industries and those of its traditional customers became more buoyant. 'If consumption recovers at the same time in the way we expect,' said Bird, 'there should be a deficit of over 750,000 tonnes in 1994 and more than 1m tonnes in 1995. Indeed as 1995 wears on producers will have to recommission idled capacity.' Metal Bulletin Research agreed that world stocks would fall next year, though by a more modest 525,000 tonnes, from the 3.5m tonnes it projected for the end of this year (against 3.61m tonnes indicated by the International Primary Aluminium Institute as at the end of August). With no new plant start-ups scheduled for more than two years - assuming that the expansion of capacity from 173,000 tonnes to 646,000 tonnes a year at Alusaf of South Africa is completed on time in late 1995 or early 1996 - Bird saw the market becoming tight in early 1996. 'By then,' it said, 'the years of underinvestment in new smelter capacity will be taking their toll. Producers will have to work their existing plants very hard in order to keep up with demand; and they will be seeking to accelerate any tentative smelter projects they may have. In spite of these efforts we expect a period of aluminium shortage to return, accompanied by a significant rise in prices.' All that is in the future, however. For the present the aluminium market languishes, and if producers are to get something more than 'jam tomorrow' (or the day after tomorrow) some will have to follow the lead given by Alcoa and Reynolds - and they need to look sharp about it.</p>

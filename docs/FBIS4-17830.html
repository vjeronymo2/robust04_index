			<p>BFN     [Text] These days, the attention of the world community is  drawn to various appraisals of the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant's [AES] technical condition. This is connected with the  mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], which  has analyzed the operation of the Chernobyl AES.    Participants in an IAEA session discussed the Chernobyl AES  on 22 April in Vienna. Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shamarov,  who headed the Ukrainian delegation, spoke on the results of  this representative meeting with a group of journalists. The  most important result of the IAEA meeting, he stressed, was the  opportunity to once again show that our young state is left  virtually at the mercy of fate in dealing with the aftermath of  the Chernobyl disaster. Given all its economic difficulties,  Ukraine has to earmark 14 percent of its budget to handle the  consequences of the catastrophe. At the same time, we receive  only humanitarian assistance from Western states. It is  necessary to urgently resolve the issues of erecting a new shell  over the unreliable Chernobyl sarcophagus. The cost of the  project is estimated at $500 million. This issue is much more  acute than all the discussions of the technical condition of the  RBMK-type reactor, which was one of the reasons for the initial  Chernobyl explosion. Analysis indicates that, regardless of all  technical blunders, these reactors can be modernized.  Sometimes, emotions make us forget that Ukraine has three such  reactors and Russia -- 11. Ukrainian representatives also  voiced their viewpoints on the power engineering system, which  has no efficient substitute in the foreseeable future. The  modernization of the entire energy network in Ukraine was also  discussed. As a rule, IAEA decisions are only of technical  value, however, they will certainly have an impact on the  positions of (?leading) Western states during the next  high-level meeting of their leaders.</p>

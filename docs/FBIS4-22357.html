			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by A.Ye.: "The Loss Ratio Is One to Eleven"] </F>   [Text] On 27 March, Prime Minister G. Bagratyan  signed a decree on organizing and holding in the second quarter  of 1994 a training session for reserve officers and those liable  for call-up. This event, as well as the scheduled spring draft,  was the topic of a conference convoked yesterday by the  government.    The conference chairman, Minister of State Vazgen Sargisyan,  divided the agenda into two parts. The first was devoted to  measures on organizing the draft. The greater portion of the  time was allocated for this topic; the second topic was  combating desertions.    In his introductory remarks, the minister of state noted  that  the upcoming draft will take place in much more favorable  circumstances than the previous one. He enumerated by name the  heads of local administrations who have completed the plans for  training sessions. The directness with which he made public the  names of top rayon officials who failed in the conduct of last  year's draft was supported by argumentation confirming the  inadequacy of local authorities.    The address of military police chief V. Khorkhoruni dealt  with the problem of draft dodging. According to him, thanks to  the work of competent organs, more than 85 percent of deserters  from the last draft have returned to military units. There are  reasons to believe that this percentage will increase, and,  conversely, the figures reflecting the scale of desertions will  decline.    The most significant part of what Minister of Defense Serge  Sarkisyan said in his address was the figures on the Armenian  forces' losses over the period since the beginning of October of  last year. Over this period of time, we lost 690 soldiers.  During the same time, Azerbaijani forces' casualties amounted to  8,000 killed, 25,000 wounded, and 1,000 missing in action.    Among others who addressed the conference were the Ministry  of Defense's chief of mobilization department, Arutyunyan,  Minister of Internal Affairs V. Siradegyan, and Yerevan City  Council Chairman V. Khachatryan. Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan  also had the floor. The conference wrap-up was conducted by  Republic of Armenia's vice president, Gagik Arutyunyan.</p>

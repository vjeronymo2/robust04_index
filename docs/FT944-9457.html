			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (8): Suppliers pool resources  -Database software companies are standardising communications between networks The global spread of computer networks and 'electronic money' is creating a new form of commerce based on the electronic transaction. At the same time, with the growing use of itemised telephone bills and networked services such as CompuServe, the value of each transaction is diminishing and so cheaper ways must be found to process such transactions. 'We are increasingly dealing with high volume, low value transactions,' says John Spiers, UK marketing director of database software company Sybase. 'We need to combine processing the growing volume of low value transactions with new ways to manage and control them.' Database suppliers such as Sybase have in recent years started to build the mechanisms needed to process financial transactions into their database software with the aim of reducing costs and increasing control. 'You need to be able to capture the value of the data which emanates from transactions so you can exploit the information,' Mr Spiers says. 'A company like American Express, for example, can gear its marketing to individual purchases on a customer's monthly bill. If you hire a car or book a hotel room, it can use this data to provide customers with information about these activities.' Pamela Pipe, a database product manager at software specialist Information Builders, sees the hidden value of the information in financial transactions as an opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge - 'the number of financial transactions is growing and this is driving people to find ways to analyse their data to find the value in it. 'You need the operational performance to process the transactions. But you also need the tools to bring out the information content - to pull out trends, to focus marketing and inform decisions about products.' Mrs Pipe also emphasises the need to draw together different data resources  -possibly from different computer systems - to give a high-level view of a company's information: 'We are working with large financial organisations - banks and insurance companies - to look at the information spread around the network on a variety of databases. They need to blend these together with their legacy systems to get the real value from them,' she explains. In spite of rivalries, database software companies are starting to co-operate in order to bring different data resource together. Information Builders is working with Oracle and IBM, among others, to create the concept of the information warehouse. This allows companies to treat their data as a single coherent database which can be accessed by every employee. For example, databases can now refer to each other using a language called SQL. Originated by IBM, SQL standardises communications between databases and allows a variety of tools to access data from the desktop. SQL, by enabling the spread of databases across different computers, allows companies to take advantage of cheaper hardware. Traditionally financial transactions have been processed and stored on mainframe computers. Increasingly, the same tasks can be carried out on cheaper PC-based hardware. By combining many PC processors in what is called a parallel processor, transactions can be processed and the results stored on much cheaper hardware. Neil Morgan, a marketing manager at Oracle UK, sees parallel processing as the future of high volume transaction processing - 'with Oracle 7.1 we have added parallel query and update processing and we are seeing an order of magnitude improvement in response times and throughout. This means companies will be able to afford to process these low value transactions.' Oracle is also using the flexibility of more powerful PC hardware to lower the cost of setting up new transaction-based systems. Mr Morgan cites the example of a new credit card company. 'They needed to be able to set new members up quickly so they have used a PC as the database server for the customer database. The transactions are processed on a larger systems but the basic set up for new members is carried out on a Pounds 20,000 PC system which supports over 100 users 24 hours a day.' This is possible because Oracle's database software works on different computers, from PCs to mainframes. This is a trend echoed by other database software suppliers including IBM. 'We can offer the same database technology right across the range - including computers from other suppliers,' says Janet Perna, director of database technology at IBM's Toronto laboratory. IBM's DB2 has filtered down from its mainframe computers to its mid-range and personal products, bringing the same features to each level. At the same time, it lets customers access data from other suppliers' database software including Oracle and Sybase. Ms Perna says that customers want better access to their data - wherever it might be. She says the trend towards client/server computing - which gives users desktop power and access to company databases on the network - is a part of this. 'The motivation for client/server computing is to give users a better interface to their data and make new applications easier to use.' However, this approach causes systems management problems. The need to bring a variety of data resources together and make sure that they are used properly makes the underlying software much more complex. Database software suppliers are acutely aware of the problems of coping with the explosive growth of electronic financial transactions and have a wide range of solutions to offer. What is encouraging is that they are all moving in the same direction and making it easier for customers to pick and choose the tools they use to accessing and manage their data.</p>

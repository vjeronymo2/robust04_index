Between 20,000 and 25,000 ROC citizens immigrate to foreign  countries each year, most going to the US, the ministry said.    But the latest statistics show the US is losing its  attraction among ROC citizens seeking life abroad.    Of the some 20,800 ROC citizens who emigrated last year,  only  7,800 went to the US, about 1,600 less than those who chose to  make Canada their new home.    New Zealand came in third, attracting 2,400 ROC immigrants,  followed by Australia, with 770 and South Africa, 300.    The ministry did not speculate on why the US is dwindling in  popularity.</p>

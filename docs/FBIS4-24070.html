			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 22 SAPA -- The five per cent  transition levy had the potential to cause conflict between  workers and the government, the National Council of Trade Unions  [Nactu] warned on Wednesday [22 June]. Reacting to the 1994/5  budget announced by Finance Minister Derek Keys, Nactu said it  believed the levy, its percentage and period should have been  negotiated.    It was "ironic" the minister could tax workers and companies  the same levy and the lack of consultation was "business as  usual from the old apartheid regime style of doing things".    "We don't even know how the R4 billion [rand] of  transitional  costs was incurred," said Nactu Assistant General Secretary  Mahlomola Skhosana.    Nactu had always stood for a negotiated levy towards  specific  programmes such as education and training in the Reconstruction  and Development Programme. The R2.5 billion kick-start to the  programme was a "drop in the ocean compared to the general needs  of people", said Mr Skhosana.    Nactu was also concerned the government would settle the R15  billion debt incurred by the former TVBC [Transkei,  Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states instead of investing it in  the development programme, the statement said.    Nactu welcomed the establishment of a tax commission, saying  it was long overdue. "We hope the commission will act with  integrity and consult every stakeholder and all trade union  national centres, instead of some and not others."</p>

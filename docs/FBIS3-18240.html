Although unanimous in their praise for Swiss aid,  Mr. Cotti's dialogue partners nevertheless reiterated that only  investments could ensure the stability of the country.    "Poland is a priority recipient of Swiss aid to the East,"  said Flavio Cotti at the end of a courtesy visit paid to  President Walesa. Mr. Cotti, head of the Swiss Federal  Department of Foreign Affairs [DFAE] wants Swiss aid to be  accompanied by private sector investments.  <H5>  Upcoming State Visit </H5>   "We are waiting for you, come and do business with us," said  Lech Walesa, addressing his visitors. Furthermore, Mr. Walesa  will have an opportunity to establish contacts with the private  sector during his state visit in May.    President Walesa believes that Europe has not yet found a  solution that could satisfy the countries of the East. "The  postcommunist states still find themselves in a vacuum," he said  regretfully, alluding to the lack of a collective security  system which would include his country. His concern is shared  by Prime Minister Pawlak.    The questions of European security and Polish economic  development also dominated talks between Ms. Cotti and Mr.  Olechowski the day before. Both men emphasized the fundamental  Russian role within the context of a peaceful Europe. "Russian  participation in international peacekeeping efforts must occur  under the mandate and the supervision of a collective security  organization," Mr. Cotti told a Polish daily.    On the economic level, the Polish foreign minister also  launched an appeal to Swiss entrepreneurs to invest more money  in his country. Furthermore, he hoped Western markets would  open up more to Polish products. Switzerland ranks eighth among  principal investors in Poland for 1991-1993, investing 150  million Swiss francs.  <H5>  Swiss Aid </H5>   Poland is one of the main recipients of financial aid  allocated to the new democracies in the East. Switzerland's  commitment to Poland is based on two main axes: technological  cooperation and financial assistance. At the end of 1993,  Switzerland's total commitment amounted to 310.5 million Swiss  francs, of which 25.3 million were designated for cooperation,  and 285.2 million for financial aid.    On Tuesday, Mr. Cotti went to Poznan specifically to see for  himself one of the first projects carried out within the  framework of technological cooperation: the covered market in  Poznan. This accomplishment aims to promote an economic model  for regional supplying.  <H5>  Warsaw's European Option </H5>   The European option constitutes the dominant idea in  Poland's  foreign policy. Its principal objectives include rapid  integration into the European Union [EU], and membership of some  kind of collective defense system. Warsaw has already signed  the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO in the hope that  it will lead to membership of the Atlantic alliance.    With this in mind, [Polish] political leaders are extending  their contacts with their European partners. They want to make  political, cultural, and economic links durable with a view to  guaranteeing Poland's place in West Europe. However, for a  large number of citizens, the division of Europe will endure,  despite the fall of the Berlin Wall: The old Iron Curtain has  turned into a frontier of prosperity.</p>

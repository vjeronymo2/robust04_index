			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Industry chiefs press Clarke for investment Budget Leaders of seven big industry associations have signed an open letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, urging action in next month's Budget to stimulate permanently higher levels of investment and improve the UK's competitiveness. The letter, delivered to Mr Clarke on Friday and faxed to senior Treasury officials, marks the first time manufacturing industry has made a united plea for tax incentives and other steps to boost investment. Timed to reach the chancellor before this week's Tory party conference in Bournemouth, it is part of a campaign to keep manufacturing on the agenda in the run-up to the Budget. The letter is based on an initiative this summer by the Machine Tool Technologies Association. The other six organisations are the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers Federation, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Metcom (the Mechanical and Metal Trades Confederation), Beama (the federation of British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers' Associations) and the Federation of the Electronics Industry The letter says investment levels in the UK have been lower than in most industrial countries for most of the past 30 years. Without permanently higher levels of investment, it says, the UK faces 'the prospect of further boom and bust cycles of the kind we have so often seen and suffered from in the past'. The industry associations want the chancellor in his Budget to: Introduce full first-year capital allowances for at least the first Pounds 200,000 of plant and mach-inery. They say this would benefit smaller companies. Index-link current capital allowances for plant and machinery. Reform capital gains tax for holdings of corporate equity, with the rate reduced according to the period for which the investment has been held. This, they say, would encourage investors to take a longer-term view. At least maintain spending on transport infrastructure, education, training and export support in real terms. Some of the organisations have made their own Budget submissions. But the united plea on investment follows past disappointments when they campaigned separately - notably on capital allowances, where a limited, temporary scheme was allowed to lapse last year.

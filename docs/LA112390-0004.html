			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETE SCHABARUM ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> I read with a good deal of amusement Pete Schabarum's defense of Prop. 140 ("A  Change That Opens State's Political Doors," Commentary, Nov. 13). No doubt  Schabarum is well-qualified to describe the perils arising from the seniority  of elected officeholders -- here's someone whose snout and hoofs have been in  the public trough for several decades.  </P> <P> Now, in an ironic twist, Schabarum has anointed himself as the keeper of the  public conscience, purse and morality -- with a good deal less justification  than those in Sacramento he has chosen to attack. Schabarum has now served five  terms as a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. I would like  to know why Schabarum was an active participant in promoting the same type of  empire-building, self-perpetuation and irresponsibility in the county that he  decries in the Legislature.  </P> <P> LEON COOPER  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

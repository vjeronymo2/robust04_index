			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Management: Temperaments for independence - Diane Summers examines types who strike out on their own By Friday each week a sizeable chunk of the employed population feels tempted to tell the boss to take a running jump - self-employment seems like the only sane option. By Monday morning, as feelings of insecurity take hold, most wage slaves' ardour for independence will have cooled. A handful of individuals, however, will join those forced out of their jobs by the recession and set up in business on their own. The success or failure of those businesses - only 40 per cent of start-ups are still around after five years - will depend in part on the temperaments of their proprietors. According to Annabel Broome, a psychologist who has been carrying out research for BT, the budding entrepreneur needs to scrutinise his or her motivation very closely. 'You have to take a good look at yourself and ask yourself what you really want. If you can get these questions right you lessen the likelihood of failure and disillusionment,' she says. Broome's research has led her to identify four main business types: The solo flyer: This type does not like having a boss or anyone else's hand on the tiller - sets a business course and steers it in a determined way. Resisting outside influences requires minimising risks. Interest in a particular subject may have sparked the decision to go it alone. Goal may be a quiet sense of achievement rather than glorious success. The family-oriented type: May have a long family tradition behind his or her enterprise, or may come from an ethnic group which places great importance on family cohesion. Family may be the most important resource, providing finance, labour and advice. Motivation will come from wanting to improve family wealth and perhaps carve a niche in the local community. The stalker is always calculating a few moves ahead, like a chess player. When the time is right the stalker might risk a pawn or two. Stalkers are thinkers and planners. Motivated by the thought of success, there is nothing flamboyant about their approach. Quiet confidence is born of professionalism. Tycoons want to get rich and be famous. They are bursting with energy, confidence and ideas. If risks they take do not produce cash they will generate publicity. Tycoons love working with others so long as they realise who is boss. They are hard drivers and do not mind treading on a few toes. Why, one may wonder, is BT so interested in employing the services of a psychologist to help them establish the characteristics of these business types? The answer, of course, is so they can target sales of their telecom gadgets. It will come as no surprise to find, for example, that the Solo Flyer would be well advised, according to BT, to purchase answering machines, pagers, mobile telephones, call diversion, faxes 'and other devices which give you maximum independence but keep you in touch'. The Tycoon, on the other hand, could quite legitimately splash out on the latest technology such as a video-phone or colour fax because 'creating an impression will be the key to your business aims'. And the timing of the publication of its research is particularly appropriate. BT announced on Wednesday a sharp increase in its voluntary redundancy programme this year - today is the Friday 19,000 of BT's own staff walk out of the door never to return to their old jobs.

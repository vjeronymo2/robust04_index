			<p>BFN     [Text] The current electricity generation deficit will  continue into next week. The outages will therefore follow a  pattern similar to what has happened lately. The Electric Union  made this announcement this evening. This entity of the Basic  Industry Ministry added that the situation in June is not as  critical as during April and confirmed that Cuba continues to  receive the necessary spare parts and equipment to conduct  projected maintenance programs.    From 2-8 June, the average power output projected is 1,420  megawatts and the projected demand will peak at times at 1,835  megawatts. In other words, there will be deficit similar to that  experienced in the last few weeks.    The Electric Union also announced that a light maintenance  program is scheduled to be conducted on unit No. 4 of the Carlos  Manuel de Cespedes Electric Plant in Cienfuegos. This is one of  the two 150-megawatt generators this plant has under repair. The  repairs are expected to take four days.</p>

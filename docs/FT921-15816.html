			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Skanska to cut forecast of profits by SKr700m SKANSKA, the largest construction and real estate company in Scandinavia, has scaled down its profits forecast for last year by SKr700m to around SKr1bn (Dollars 180m). It made a profit of SKr2.37bn in 1990. Skanska said the main reason for its latest gloomy profits prognosis stemmed from the financial troubles incurred by Selmer, Norway's biggest building company, in which Skanska has a one-third interest. Selmer's other main shareholders are the troubled Norwegian banks, Christiania and den Norske, who joined Skanska in 1990 in a rescue of the company. Skanska also blamed the 'turbulence in the exchange and money markets during the autumn' as well as falling property values for the further revision in its profits forecast. Selmer is estimated to have incurred a loss of SKr750m in 1991 because of difficulty in selling apartments in Oslo and in Spain as well as problems with its energy projects. At a special shareholders' meeting held by Selmer on January 3, it was decided to write down the value of the Norwegian company's capital to zero. This meant a write-off of SKr297m for Skanksa. It was also agreed to make a new share issue in Selmer worth NKr350m, though Skanska has still not made up its mind whether it will participate. Skanska had earlier proposed a financial reconstruction for Selmer based on the provision of further credit for it from the Norwegian banks. However, the banks opposed this and made a counter-offer suggesting that Skanska should guarantee the further credit provisions for Selmer, something that Skanska in turn rejected. Last October, Skanska reported profits (after financial items) for the first eight months of 1991 of SKr1.19bn, against SKr1.71bn. At that time it said it expected a profit for the year of around SKr1.7bn after estimated write-downs of SKr900m.</p>

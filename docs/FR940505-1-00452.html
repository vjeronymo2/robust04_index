			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Diagnosis and repair of malfunctions in computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled close-loop vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Application of emission control theory and diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to the diagnosis and repair of failures of the transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission test and the evaporative system function tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Utilization of diagnostic information on systematic or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated failures observed in the transient emission test and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative system function tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Generalized training on the various subsystems related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to emission control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission test procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Emission tests and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional tests shall be subject to the following requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Flexibly fueled vehicles (i.e., those capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating both on gasoline and other fuels) shall at a minimum be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to testing and shall be tested while operating in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline mode unless the vehicle is never operated with gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An initial test is the emission test that occurs the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first time in a test cycle. The initial test shall be performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without repair or adjustment at the emission inspection station  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the test, except as provided for in the evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system integrity test. An emission inspection performed after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of the initial test in a test cycle shall be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An official test, once initiated, shall be performed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its entirety regardless of intermediate outcomes except in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of an invalid test condition or unsafe conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Tests involving measurements shall be performed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved equipment that has been calibrated according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality control procedures contained in EPA guidance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Vehicles shall not be tested if the exhaust system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> missing or leaking, or if the vehicle is in an unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The vehicle owner or driver shall have access to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area in the inspection station which permits observation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire official inspection procedure. This access may be limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but it may not prevent full observation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) In the inspection process, vehicles that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> altered from their original certified configuration shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested in the same manner as other subject vehicles, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Vehicles with engines other than the engine originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed by the manufacturer, or an identical replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine, shall be subject to the test procedures and standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the chassis type and model year, regardless of the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement, including visual equipment inspections for parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are part of the original certified configuration and part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the normal inspection for such configuration. An exception may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made if the vehicle meets new certification standards for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chassis and model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Vehicles which are switched to a fuel type for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no certified configuration shall be tested according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emission standards established for that vehicle type and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year. Emission control device requirements may be waived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the Administrator determines that the alternatively fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle configuration would meet the new vehicle standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that model year without these devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Subject vehicles shall be tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and passed or failed according to the IM240 cutpoints provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix B of subpart GGG of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (q)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission inspection test report. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The test provider(s)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall provide the vehicle owner or driver with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer-generated emission inspection test report which includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A vehicle description, including license plate number,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle title number, VIN, vehicle make and model and odometer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The date and time of the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The name or identification number of the individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing the tests and the location of the test station and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lane number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The type of tests performed, including emission tests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visual checks for the presence of emission control components,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and functional, evaporative system checks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The applicable test standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The test results, including exhaust concentrations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass/fail results for each mode measured, pass/fail results for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative system checks, and which emission control devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspected were passed, failed or not applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A statement indicating the availability of warranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage as required in section 207 of the Clean Air Act (42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 7525).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

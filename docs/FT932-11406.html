			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (7): 'Red chip' companies are aiming high - Guandong Investment (GI), a pace-setter among mainland companies LAST year saw the emergence of 'red chip' as a term applied to mainland companies listed in Hong Kong with bright prospects, writes Simon Holberton. Of a group of about 20 or so red chips, two stand out: Citic Pacific, which is controlled by China International Trust and Investment Corporation of Beijing, and Guangdong Investment, GI, the provincial government of Guangdong's listed vehicle in the colony. Citic Pacific is by far the bigger of the two. Its market capitalisation is around HKDollars 35bn, thanks mostly to its large minority investments in Hongkong Telecom and Cathay Pacific. GI's market capitalisation is just HKDollars 4.5bn, but, according to Mr Hou Deyou, a director and deputy general manager of the company, 'our objective is to build Guangdong Investment into a very big company like Citic Pacific.' In this objective it has set a cracking pace. GI is 44.6 per cent owned by Guangdong Enterprises, GE, one of the provincial government of Guangdong's main corporations. GE acquired a controlling interest in Union Globe, a listed Hong Kong company, in 1987 and renamed it Guangdong Investments in 1988 and has since been selling it assets, mainly located on the mainland. The 'ownership' of GE is a little unclear. It is technically owned by Guangdong Yue Hai Import and Export Corporation, except that the directors of Yue Hai are appointed by GE. In reality, it seems, the directors of GE are appointments made at the highest level of Guangdong's Communist Party and governmental apparatus. GE, and, by extension GI have only one purpose: the economic development of Guangdong. Although GI has some hotel and property assets in Hong Kong, the bulk of its investments and investment plans concern Guangdong. The company has four core businesses: property development and investment, tourism and hotels, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail distribution. GI has extensive land holdings in Guangdong, equivalent to 34m square feet of developable space, mainly for residential purposes. But its most significant property investment - which overlaps with many of its core interests - is its 33 per cent share of Teem Corporation, a joint venture company, which will develop the Tianhe district of Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong. IN the eastern part of the city, Tianhe has been designated by the Guangzhou authorities as the city's new financial and commercial centre. Mr Hou said that Teem is the first company to be given the right to run wholesale and retail businesses in the city; it plans two large office developments, one of 48 stories and the other of 38 stories, which will include a hotel, office and retail facilities. The Teem investment also underlines the peculiar nature of 'foreign' investment in China. GI's 30 per cent interest in Teem - Yuan500m - was funded with Hong Kong dollars. From an official Chinese perspective it is therefore a foreign joint venture. According to Mr Hou, 'joint ventures are much more flexible than state-owned companies. When a state-owned company wants to pay a bonus it is quite difficult. With a joint venture, if a manager thinks any action is helpful to the business, then he can do it. 'Tax is also lower: in a special economic zone, it is just 15 per cent, in other parts of Guangdong it is 30 per cent and in an open area of Guangdong it is 24 per cent. But for a state-owned company it is 50 per cent.' GI also has sizeable investments in manufacturing in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong. It has 51.6 per cent interest in Guangzhou Malting, the largest producer in Asia of malt for beer. The company produces 60,000 tonnes a year and has plans to expand capacity to 150,000 tonnes by 1995. GI took its interest in beer a stage further with its acquisition in June last year of an effective 24.5 per cent interest in Shenzhen Brewery, whose products Kingsway and Holsten, which it brews under license, have an 80 per cent share of the Shenzhen market. It also has plans to develop public houses in Shenzhen. Its other main manufacturing investment is a 60.8 per cent stake in a washing machine manufacturer, Weili, in Zhongshan city. Weili is China's largest producer of washing machines - making some 1.3m units in 1992, or twice as many as its nearest competitor - and has a market share of 25 per cent nation-wide. As Mr Hou noted, 'we bought one of the best production lines - and the product is good.' As for the future, GI has its eye on infrastructure development in energy and transportation. Its chairman, Mr He Keqin, said recently that it planned investments in power generation and road and bridge construction.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Frankfurt - Other Markets Analysts are looking for a stronger performance from equities, with support coming from the bond market and further interest in cyclicals. UBS expects that after last week's good figures from Thyssen and BASF, the market will react positively to strong third-quarter figures from Bayer today and Hoechst on Wednesday. This should raise interest not only in chemicals but also in other cyclicals, such as capital goods. October industrial production figures are due and James Capel says the strength of orders in September points to a 0.5 per cent month-on-month rise.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER: 'THE BOYS NEXT DOOR';  </P> <P> ABILITY IN ABUNDANCE;  </P> <P> THE PLAY ABOUT FOUR DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED MEN POIGNANTLY BLENDS HUMOR AND  DRAMA.  </P> <P> A stellar event in regional theater took place Aug. 17 with the ribbon-cutting  opening of the Paseo Nuevo shopping mall in downtown Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> The new Center Stage Theater, an intimate, 150-seat black box on the second  level of Paseo Nuevo, had its own ribbons cut at 8 p.m. by Mayor Sheila Lodge.  The glitzy opening night audience, which paid $100 per seat, was treated to the  premiere performance of Anthony Edwards starring in "The Boys Next Door," an  Access Theatre company production about the developmentally disabled.  </P> <P> There's an old superstition about the quality of the first performance in a new  theater conferring a permanent blessing or curse. Those who believe in it can  rest easy, because Edwards and a mostly Equity cast delivered a powerful,  poignant performance that ended in a well-deserved standing ovation.  </P> <P> Is it possible to laugh at the developmentally disabled? Clive Barnes wrote of  the 1987 off-Broadway production of Tom Griffin's "The Boys Next Door": "It's a  funny play and it very adroitly provides its audience with the freedom to  laugh."  </P> <P> There was plenty of laughter Friday night, some of it the kind that hurts.  </P> <P> Edwards plays Jack, a burned-out live-in social worker in an apartment complex  for the developmentally disabled. Edwards' role is essentially a straight man,  and he delivers a solid performance -- a strong wire on which are erratically  strung, like bizarre beads, the character roles of his four housemates.  </P> <P> Norman (Dirk Blocker) is retarded, fat, and addicted to doughnuts, keys and his  retarded girlfriend, Sheila. Lucien (Haven Mitchell) is serverely retarded,  black, and 6 feet, 8 inches tall. He's touchingly proud of his Spider-Man tie,  and he sees no difference between a quarter and a button. Arnold (Richard  Hochberg) is marginally retarded, scrappy, hyperactive/compulsive,has a rug  fetish and is convinced life is better in the Soviet Union. Last is Barry (Marc  Buckland) "a grade-A schizophrenic with a history of institutions," who is  chillingly intense. He is obsessed with the game of golf, and he gives lessons  for $1.14 an hour.  </P> <P> In a series of vignettes that describe the day-to-day life of these five men,  other characters appear briefly, most of them portrayed by physically or  developmentally disabled actors.  </P> <P> In the same way that "Rainman" and "My Left Foot" provided rich opportunities  for actors to delve deep into complex characterizations, so too do these roles,  and Blocker, Buckland, Hochberg and Mitchell, all seasoned Equity actors, make  the most of it. Under the direction of Rod Lathim, these sometimes brave,  sometimes desperate people living on the fringes of society have some heroic  moments.  </P> <P> Mitchell's Lucien (who could step right into "Of Mice and Men" as Lenny) has a  set piece that will linger in the memory. At his Social Security hearing to  have his survival funds restored, he suddenly breaks character, the house goes  dark except for a spot, and he gives a "fantasy" monologue:  </P> <P> "My capacity for rationalization is somewhere between a 5-year-old and an  oyster. I am retarded. I am damaged, I am sick inside from so many days, weeks,  months and years of confusion. I am mystified by faucets, elevators, newspapers  and popular songs. I can't always remember the names of my parents . . . but I  will not wither because the cage is too small. . . ."  </P> <P> As the lights go up and Mitchell crouches back down into his monosyllabic  character, the words hang long in the air.  </P> <P> In a sequence in which his father returns from out of nowhere and strikes him  with a crutch, Buckland dominates a whole scene without speaking or moving.  From his frozen position on a couch he simply exudes more and more intensity  until the scene explodes emotionally.  </P> <P> Hochberg's portrayal is packed with nuance. With the twist of his mouth and a  few fingers he conveys the tragedy of his situation. Blocker's scenes with his  girlfriend (Susan Kern) are poignant and believable.  </P> <P> The beauty of the piece is that one comes away feeling that good actors have  given their all.  </P> <P> Thus the inherent weakness in the fabric of the script -- that it is only  episodic and lacks a strong narrative line -- is in part overcome by the  tension created by high-energy actors on stage.  </P> <P> Technical standards are high. The Complex lighting design and appropriately  tacky set are credited to Theodore Michael Dolas of Santa Barbara Scenic.  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: Santa Barbara's Access Theatre presents "The Boys Next Door"  at the Center Stage Theater at 7O1 State St. in Santa Barbara. Curtain is at 8  p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and at 2 p.m. Sunday. The show runs through  Sept. 9. For tickets and information, call 963-0408.  </P></p>

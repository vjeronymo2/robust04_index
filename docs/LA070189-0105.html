			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE DEFENDS ROLE IN SALE OF 'JUNK BONDS';  </P> <P> SAYS IT TRIED TO STOP ISSUE BY LINCOLN S&amp;L PARENT  </P> <P> California thrift regulators said Friday that they tried last year to halt the  sale of a second issue of "junk bonds" by the parent company of Irvine-based  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan but that the state had no choice other than to  approve the high-risk offering.  </P> <P> The parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, sold the bonds through  Lincoln branches. Many were bought by unsophisticated investors who say they  were given the impression that their investments in the bonds were insured or  had some equivalent protection.  </P> <P> "We expressed our concerns to members of the Department of Corporations (which  reviews the sale of securities in California), but according to the law under  which they operate, they did not have a basis for denying approval," William B.  Davis, chief deputy commissioner of the State Department of Savings and Loan,  said in an interview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heavily Investigated  </P> <P> "When we first heard (American Continental's) ads, we became concerned," Davis  said. "They were selling what we considered fairly high-risk investments, but  the inference from the ads was, 'Come into a Lincoln office.' We could  immediately see the confusion investors might have between a risky investment  and a safer one."  </P> <P> The company's offering in 1988 -- the second of two that raised a total of $200  million for the firm -- was one of the "most investigated" offerings in some  time, said Christine W. Bender, commissioner of the Corporations Department.  The first was approved in late 1986.  </P> <P> American Continental was a healthy company then and had a clean record of  paying back investors, Bender said.  </P> <P> But on April 13 of this year, American Continental filed for protection from  creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. Federal regulators took  over the operations of Lincoln the following day, saying American Continental  was operating it in an unsafe manner and was dissipating its $5.3 billion in  assets.  </P> <P> Likely to lose their investments are about 22,000 people who bought the junk  bonds. More than a dozen class-action lawsuits have been filed seeking the  return of the money.  </P></p>

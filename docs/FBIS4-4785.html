			<p>BFN     [Text] Manpower Minister Leon Wessels says he hopes that  the new government will extend its trade ties to countries in  Southeast Asia, including South Korea. He said in Seoul that  South Africa has in the past virtually ceased trade with eastern  countries due to isolation. Mr. Wessels and three other South  African officials are on a two-day visit to South Korea to  discuss trade ties between the two countries.</p>

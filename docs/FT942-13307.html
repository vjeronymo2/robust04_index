			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Exports to Malaysia up despite row British exports to Malaysia rose slightly last month despite the anti-British trade policy announced by the Malaysian government on February 24. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday exports to Malaysia were Pounds 105m in March compared with Pounds 78m in January and Pounds 102m in February. The CSO's figures showed that the total UK visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union widened slightly to Pounds 675m in March from a revised Pounds 640m in February. The consensus forecast was for a deficit of Pounds 750m. Excluding oil and erratic items - such as aircraft and precious stones  - the deficit widened to Pounds 702m from Pounds 683m in February. Exports to non-EU countries were worth Pounds 5.1bn in March, 2 per cent below February's level. Imports were Pounds 5.7bn, 1 per cent down on the previous month. In the three months to March, exports to non-EU countries increased by 0.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter while imports grew by 2.5 per cent. The visible deficit was Pounds 2.1bn in the first quarter, which compares with a deficit of Pounds 1.8bn in the fourth quarter of 1993. The main reason for the widening of the deficit in March was a decline in exports of semi-manufactured goods. In the three months to March import volumes of semi-manufactured goods rose by 11.0 per cent compared with the previous three months. 'This is a healthy sign that manufacturing production is set to rise very strongly' because companies use semi-manufactures to produce finished goods, said Mr Robert Barrie, UK economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The CSO said import volumes were showing little growth after revising downwards its estimate of import volumes and revising upwards its estimate of import prices. Previously, the CSO had estimated that import volumes were growing at 1 per cent per month. Export prices increased by 2 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994 to a record while import prices rose by 0.5 per cent. Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'It is clear that export prices are rising to offset the deterioration in export volumes.' Between February and March, import volumes excluding oil and erratics rose by 1 per cent while exports excluding oil and erratics fell by 0.5 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES         Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Ex oil and erratics*             Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992        46,682     56,431   -9,749    40,624     48,097   -7,473 1993        57,407     66,919   -9,512    49,910     57,530   -7,620 1993 Q2     14,144     16,305   -2,161    12,048     14,024   -1,976      Q3     14,505     17,002   -2,497    12,635     14,497   -1,862      Q4     15,186     16,960   -1,774    13,530     15,051   -1,521 1994 Q1     15,290     17,410   -2,120    13,161     15,173   -2,012 October      5,257      5,619     -362     4,667      5,033     -366 November     4,863      5,604     -741     4,328      5,005     -677 December     5,066      5,737     -671     4,535      5,013     -478 January      5,044      5,849     -805     4,446      5,073     -627 February     5,173      5,813     -640     4,345      5,028     -683 March        5,073      5,748     -675     4,370      5,072     -702  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CSO.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

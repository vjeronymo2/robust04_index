			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Poll 'won't overturn' Mexican austerity: Finance minister assures Damian Fraser tight economic policies will stay despite 1994 election MEXICO'S government will maintain its tight fiscal and monetary policy throughout next year, and expects little increase in economic growth from this year, according to Pedro Aspe, the finance minister. The austere economic policy, if adhered to, would disappoint those in and out of Mexico expecting a significant relaxation in the approach to the 1994 presidential election. The government intends to run a budget surplus of 1.7 per cent of gross domestic product this year and, through its commitment to a stable exchange rate, has allowed one-year interest rates to rise to about 19.7 per cent - about ten percentage points more than projected year-on-year inflation. The tight economic policy slowed growth last year to an estimated 2.8 per cent, far below the government's original aim, and has been widely criticised for being too cautious. The commitment to maintain the tight programme suggests the government has given up its target of reaching 6 per cent growth by the end of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Mr Aspe said in an interview: 'We are going to stick to exactly the same policy and (expect) growth this year of 3 per cent and next year - maybe a little more but nothing spectacular.' Fiscal and monetary policy 'has been exactly the same in 1989, 90, 91, 92, 93 - and it will be exactly the same in 1994. We do not use stop-go policies.' Mr Aspe remains committed to reduce inflation to single digits which, on an annual basis, may happen as early as next month, and then to the levels of Mexico's main trading partners. The central bank reported inflation of 1.3 per cent in January, which is by tradition a high-inflation month. This was the lowest inflation for January since 1975. The finance minister is not convinced a loosening of policy would help the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in the presidential election. 'People would notice immediately and say: 'Oh my God what are they doing? We are going to have fun for six months and then a mess again.' You cannot fool around with fiscal and monetary policy.' The Mexican government freely admits economic growth in the short term remains at the mercy of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, whose swift passage through the US Congress depends on the Mexican and the US administrations reaching prompt agreement on parallel accords on labour and the environment. If Nafta is passed in the US, capital flows into Mexico would almost certainly increase, and interest rates could be lowered without endangering the exchange rate target of a maximum rolling devaluation of 0.4 of a peso per day (4.6 per cent a year). Indeed, the government is so convinced that Nafta would sharply alter expectations of future growth in Mexico that it has discussed ways to prevent excessive capital inflows fuelling inflation. If Nafta is not passed - which the Mexican government considers highly unlikely - the government may find it difficult to finance the growing current account deficit, expected to be more than Dollars 20bn this year. Government officials, however, are open to increasing the maximum rate at which the peso is devalued, if that looks necessary. The government is not considering a one-off devaluation. The government is also prepared to accelerate economic reforms if Nafta is not passed, in part to reassure financial markets. 'We will have to speed up structural change' if Nafta is not passed, says one senior official. 'I think we can convince people to respond in this way, rather than shoot yourself in the foot (by reversing reforms).' Political analysts have long speculated that rejection of Nafta would lead, in Mexico, to a nationalist backlash and to pressure to slow or overturn some of the present government's economic reforms. According to the official, it would lead to a faster opening of the economy.</p>

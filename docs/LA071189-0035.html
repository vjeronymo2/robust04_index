			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE HOROVITZ: HYBRID FIRM HELPS SIMPLIFY AD WORLD BY 'PACKAGING' DIRECTORS,  STARS  </P> <P> Mariel Hemingway isn't too keen on appearing in commercials. When she was a  teen-ager, she flaunted her high cheekbones in a Noxema skin cream ad. And four  years ago, she cooed over coffee in commercial for Maxwell House. But since  then, the actress has been routinely turning down commercial offers.  </P> <P> Then, six months ago, she got a call from Chaos Ltd. Despite what its name  might suggest, Chaos attempts to bring some order to the world of advertising.  The 9-month-old Pasadena company links celebrities with top-name directors and  "packages" commercials for major advertisers.  </P> <P> "I could go sponsor some product and look really silly doing it," said  Hemingway in a telephone interview from her home in Ketchum, Ida. "But here's  this company that comes along and looks out for the talent that's behind the  ad. I don't know of anyone else doing that."  </P> <P> Chaos placed Hemingway, granddaughter of writer Ernest Hemingway, in a  celebrity-filled TV commercial for Revlon that aired during this year's Academy  Awards. Besides Hemingway, Chaos signed up 26 other celebrities -- from Grace  Jones to Joan Rivers -- to appear in these Revlon ads. In one ad, which poses  the question, "What makes a woman unforgettable?" Hemingway responds, "Great  cheekbones." Besides the celebrities in the Revlon ads, Chaos also brought in  the director of the hit film "Big," Penny Marshall, to direct the commercials.  </P> <P> What exactly is Chaos? Well, it is not an ad agency, a casting agency or a  production company. But it combines elements of all three. Unlike agencies,  however, which strictly represent the advertisers, Chaos is a middleman of  sorts that represents -- and brings together -- directors and commercial stars.  </P> <P> Chaos is a division of the New York production company Independent Artists. The  company is run by a husband-and-wife team, Elvier and Stephen Diehl, two former  fashion models who met in Europe. "We can put anything together," said Elvier  Diehl, who began to establish contacts with top rock stars when she booked  concert tours in London years ago and more recently helped produce music  videos. "When ad agencies call us with requests," she said, "they'll know  within 24 hours if the talent they want is available and how much it will  cost."  </P> <P> But besides matching celebrities with top directors, they must also constantly  massage over-sized egos along the way. "Our main concern is that the talent and  directors are happy," said Stephen Diehl. "If they're not happy, no one is."  </P> <P> The company matched rock star George Michael with the director of the film  "Dangerous Liaisons" for a recent Diet Coke commercial. But the ad, which  intermixes scenes of Michael in concert along with flashes of a matador in a  bullring, did not come together easily.  </P> <P> "George Michael had to be sold on the director," said Stephen Diehl. So  Stephen's wife, Elvier -- who had known the rock star since he was a singer in  the group Wham! -- flew to London to introduce him to director Stephen Frears.  She even arranged a private screening for Michael of "Dangerous Liaisons."  </P> <P> Most recently, Chaos brought together Bill Cosby and jazz singer Betty Carter  in a yet-to-be aired TV commercial for Coke. And when Cosby requested a black  director, Chaos brought in Mustapha Khan, best-known for directing several  Levi's 501 jeans ads.  </P> <P> For years, a number of companies in the film and television industry have  linked stars with top directors and then "sold" these packages to production  studios. But until very recently, this has been generally unheard of in the  advertising business. Just as the style of many commercials tends to mimic what  appears on the screen, the advertising industry is now beginning to copy the  way the TV moguls and film makers do business.  </P> <P> Not that several other companies aren't doing something similar. The New York  company Rockbill, which matches singing stars with advertisers, played a role  in bringing Michael Jackson together with Pepsi several years ago. And the Los  Angeles production company Propaganda Films helped develop a package that  placed singer Sheena Easton in both music videos and advertisements for Holiday  Health Spas. But few companies specialize in digging up top celebrities and  directors then handing them to advertisers on a silver platter.  </P> <P> "This may be the start of a trend," said Gerald McGee, managing director of the  Los Angeles office of the ad firm, Ogilvy &amp; Mather. "They're sort of agents  with a twist -- a twist of creativity."  </P> <P> That creativity does come at a price. Some agencies have paid Chaos six-digit  figures to pull together commercial packages that feature top name singers and  big name directors. And that, of course, is separate from the  multimillion-dollar fees commanded by superstars themselves.  </P> <P> "That's probably the one big negative in this whole thing," said Ogilvy's  McGee, whose agency has yet to work with any commercial matchmakers. "It could  get very, very expensive."  </P> <P> That didn't stop New York ad agency BBDO and its client, Pepsi, from turning to  Chaos earlier this year. Chaos put together a package for a commercial that not  only included singer Robert Palmer but also the director of his music video,  Terence Donovan.  </P> <P> "They are uncompromising in their dedication to get you top talent," said Tony  Frere, vice president and executive producer at BBDO. "It's the only service of  its kind that I know of. They're sort of a directory to hipness."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ogilvy &amp; Mather on a Roll With Hilton  </P> <P> Ogilvy &amp; Mather has hit the jackpot -- for the second time. The agency's  Los Angeles office last week won the estimated $2-million business for Reno's  Flamingo Hilton. Ogilvy already handles advertising for the Las Vegas Hilton.  </P> <P> At the same time, Ogilvy's Los Angeles and Hawaii offices jointly won the  estimated $4-million ad business for Pan Pacific Hotels &amp; Resorts, a chain  of 18 Pacific Rim hotels that operates the Emerald of Anaheim.  </P> <P> With two of Hilton's biggest hotels in its hip pocket, is Ogilvy hoping to  eventually pick up even bigger chunks of the huge Hilton ad business? "I  suppose you could look at it that way," said Gerald McGee, managing director of  Ogilvy's Los Angeles office. "Any job done well runs the chance of being  successful on a larger scale."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abert Newhoff &amp; Burr Buys High-Tech Shop  </P> <P> What do you do when you're an agency that creates ads for all kinds of consumer  products but you also want to latch on to some high-tech clients?  </P> <P> Well, if you're Abert Newhoff &amp; Burr, you go out and buy the small,  high-tech ad firm Brantley &amp; Pawluk. With that purchase -- for an  undisclosed amount -- the Los Angeles ad firm picked up, among other clients,  the Seattle software publisher, Microrim Inc. The agency also named Hal Pawluk  senior vice president. Pawluk helped create the first four years of ads for the  software firm Ashton-Tate.  </P> <P> Mel Newhoff said his agency, which creates ads for Yamaha Motor Corp., plans to  purchase yet another small ad firm soon. "We intend to continue the trend and  maybe we'll own Warner Bros., Paramount and Time Inc. by the year 2050," he  said. "We could call ourselves Omniglom, except that it sounds like an oil  spill."  </P> <P> </P> <P> In-N-Out Cooks Up Agency Review Plan  </P> <P> In-N-Out Burger is looking in-n-out for a new advertising agency. Last week,  the Baldwin Park hamburger chain placed its estimated $4-million ad business up  for review.  </P> <P> Incumbent Los Angeles agency Gumpertz/Bentley/Fried is still in the running,  said Susan Grear, director of advertising at In-N-Out. She said the review is  something the chain intends to do every three years -- regardless of which  agency wins its business.  </P> <P> And for those who are kind of stuck on the chain's familiar theme song --  "In-N-Out, that's what hamburgers are all about" -- fear not. Said Grear:  "That's not going to change."  </P></p>

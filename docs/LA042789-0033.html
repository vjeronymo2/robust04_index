			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE SCANDAL, JAPAN'S RULING PARTY KEEPS LOCK ON POWER  </P> <P> A bribery scandal has devastated the government of Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita, causing one of his most trusted political aides to commit suicide  Wednesday, a day after Takeshita declared his intention to resign in atonement  for alleged fund-raising irregularities.  </P> <P> The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is in disarray, unable to agree on an  untainted successor to assume the reins of government other than a party elder  who is 75 years old and ailing.  </P> <P> Powerful critics in the media are calling for the dissolution of the lower  house of Parliament. The public is outraged by a new 3% consumption tax imposed  by the ruling party, unilaterally and over vehement protest. Questions are  being raised about the government's capacity to conduct foreign policy. And  prosecutors are rumored to be preparing to indict several ruling party  politicians.  </P> <P> In most countries, the situation might provide opposition forces with an  excellent opportunity to make a grab for control of Parliament. But not in  Japan.  </P> <P> Despite diatribes against the ruling party's "money-power politics," the  opposition is hopelessly divided on policy and ill-prepared to ride the wave of  the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal into power. Posturing over the  prospects of a coalition government is simply not credible, analysts say.  </P> <P> Nor can the opposition accurately claim to have unseated Takeshita. The prime  minister faced unprecedented low popularity ratings -- 3.9% in a Kyodo News  Service poll published April 16 -- and was hounded in a media campaign with  disclosures that he and his aides received about $1.12 million in political  donations and stock profits from Recruit Co., an information services, computer  and real estate conglomerate.  </P> <P> "Takeshita made a preemptive attack against the opposition by announcing he  would resign," said Seizaburo Sato, a professor of political science at Tokyo  University. "It's clear that the opposition parties are in a less favorable  position now," Sato said.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying they lost, but they wanted an election under Takeshita. They  would have had a much better chance to gain seats."  </P> <P> The Liberal Democrats will pick a leader to replace Takeshita by the time the  fiscal 1989 budget formally passes Parliament, where the opposition is clinging  to a somewhat dubious strategy of boycotting deliberations while demanding  sworn testimony by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on his role in the  scandal.  </P> <P> The ruling party ignored the opposition boycott and rammed the budget through a  lower house committee this morning, in keeping with its goal of taking it to a  vote in a plenary session of the chamber by the end of the week. It was not  clear whether the opposition would attend the plenary session. The budget is  expected to be acted upon by the upper house, or go into effect automatically,  by the end of May.  </P> <P> Masayoshi Ito, one of the few party stalwarts who has not been accused of  accepting graft, is expected to get the nod as Takeshita's successor, even  though he is frail and suffering from diabetes, a chronic but not necessarily  life-threatening disease. According to the prevailing scenario, Ito would serve  as a caretaker dedicated to reforming political fund-raising practices while  guiding the party through an upper house election in the summer and a ballot  for the lower house that must also be held by next summer.  </P> <P> The cause of political reform received emotional impetus Wednesday when Ihei  Aoki, 58, the aide who handled Takeshita's finances, slit a wrist and hanged  himself with a necktie in his Tokyo apartment.  </P> <P> Aoki and one of Takeshita's relatives traded in unlisted shares of a Recruit  subsidiary along with more than 150 others in political, bureaucratic and  business circles, earning windfall profits that in some cases, prosecutors  allege, constituted bribes.  </P> <P> "I strongly regret (his action)," the Associated Press quoted Takeshita as  telling reporters. "We walked side by side for over 30 years."  </P> <P> Shigezo Hayasaka, a political commentator, said in a televised interview: "We  should take advantage of this tragic incident to focus on the political  landscape where practicing politics costs too much money. People throughout  Japan should bring out their wisdom to truly reform the situation."  </P> <P> Hayasaka was a friend of Aoki. He also was the personal secretary of Kakuei  Tanaka, Takeshita's former mentor and the last prime minister to be forced to  resign because of a fund-raising scandal.  </P> <P> Tanaka quit in 1974 and remained the most powerful figure in Japanese politics,  even after he was arrested in 1976 for receiving a bribe from Lockheed --  unrelated to the allegations that forced him to step down -- and convicted on  the charge in 1983. Tanaka withdrew from the political stage after a crippling  stroke in 1985, but he technically retains a seat in Parliament while his  appeal is pending.  </P> <P> Critics remain skeptical that the ruling party will attempt anything more than  cosmetic changes in the political system. As it stands, massive spending is  required to cultivate support in local constituencies, virtually dictating that  successful politicians must bend the nominal rules on fund-raising.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Scanty Effort'  </P> <P> "The ruling party is talking about political reform, but if you examine the  substance of their plan, all you see is some talk about restricting the sale of  tickets to fund-raising parties -- it's a scanty effort," said Teiko Kihira,  vice chairwoman of the Japan League of Women's Voters.  </P> <P> "Takeshita's resignation announcement doesn't do anything to resolve the  Recruit scandal," Kihira said. "This has tainted nearly the entire leadership  of the Liberal Democratic Party, and even some of the opposition. It's  structural corruption, and it's not going to be rooted out by cutting off the  head."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the hue and cry from the media continues. The newspaper Asahi, which  broke the news of Recruit's ethically questionable stock transactions last  summer and has maintained a lead role in disclosing the company's staggering  program of political contributions, urged in an editorial Wednesday that the  next administration dissolve the lower house and face the verdict of voters.  </P> <P> "The Recruit scandal revealed how rotten some politicians and those close to  the incumbent and former prime ministers are," Asahi said. "This scandal will  remain as an indelible stain in the postwar history of Japanese politics."  </P> <P> Takeshita's resignation "is only the beginning of the cleansing of Japan's  rotten politics," the liberal newspaper said. "It would not be strange if the  party is forced to turn over the helm of national politics to the opposition  parties."  </P> <P> But an editorial in the conservative newspaper Yomiuri was more disparaging  about the opposition.  </P> <P> "Although the support rate for the Takeshita Cabinet has plummeted to an  all-time low, few have expectations of the opposition parties assuming  political leadership," it said. "These parties should take this as severe  public criticism. They are so divided over foreign and domestic policies that  the public will not support an opposition government at this time."  </P> <P> Yet the major opposition parties -- excluding the Communists -- are keeping up  the appearances of solidarity. Last week, leaders of the Japan Socialist Party,  the Komeito or Clean Government Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the  Social Democratic Federation met in Kyoto to map out strategy for a coalition.  </P> <P> But the opposition lacks enough seats to wield any formal leverage to force  dissolution or bring on a lower house election before the Liberal Democrats  want one. It can only appeal to public opinion and try to shame the ruling  party into submitting to an electoral test.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, little is being said about how the opposition parties would  reconcile their formidable differences on policy. The Socialists advocate  scrapping the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and are friendly with North Korea, for  example, while the Democratic Socialist Party adheres to a generally  conservative ideology similar to the ruling party.  </P> <P> The public has expressed its displeasure in several recent local elections,  suggesting that the ruling party will have to contend with a protest vote when  half the seats in the less powerful upper house go up for grabs sometime in the  summer.  </P></p>

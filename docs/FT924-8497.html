			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Madrid in retreat on strike rules MADRID has backed away from plans to impose stiff strike rules on Spain's trade unions, allowing the Socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to reach its first agreement with union leaders since a crippling one-day general strike in December 1988. The Spanish parliament yesterday began a rubber-stamp debate on a controversial strike law after the government and unions agreed on Monday to a law which will define 17 sectors in which minimum services have to be maintained during a strike. To get the agreement signed, the government was forced to drop clauses which would automatically have led to the dismissal of strikers who did not provide the minimum services. The government feared further alienating the unions in the run-up to a general election which must be held by next October. With many unpopular measures already imposed this year - including cuts in unemployment benefit and direct and indirect tax increases - the government's own polls show the Socialist party would lose up to 20 of its 175 seats in parliament if an election were held now. That would rob it of the bare majority it has in parliament and the prospect is already testing party unity. Liberal ministers prefer coalition to relaxing a tough economic convergence programme.</p>

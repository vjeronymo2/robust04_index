			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Reformers in Russia seek new identity LEADING Russian reformers are trying to create a broad alliance of reformist parties to counter-balance the reinvigorated Communist party ahead of elections in the autumn. Despite impressive permutations of western words such as 'republican', 'democratic', and 'liberal', most of Russia's 105 registered parties are little more than the expression of individual politicians' personal ambitions to lead parties. This has made it virtually impossible for them to merge over shared ideas. In contrast, the Communist party, strengthened by 70 years of tradition, has been quick to rebuild itself after its unbanning by the constitutional court. Some of President Boris Yeltsin's close colleagues announced the formation of a political bloc called Russia's Choice last week in an attempt to compensate for their failure to produce a long-promised presidential party. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who launched radical reforms last year, is trying to build a power base around the Association of Privatised and Private Enterprises which he heads. Its aim is to help organise and finance candidates for a 'reformist anti-inflationary parliament' as well to defend the interests of privatised enterprises on a day-to-day basis. 'The idea is to unite people who have been disagreeing with each other even though they share the same interests,' said Mr Gaidar, whose association is likely to join the pro-Yeltsin bloc. Its political and economic programme is due to be published next month. However, not all the groups will necessarily pull together. At the weekend, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist, presided at the founding of a group called 'Entrepreneurs for the Renewal of Russia' at which he presented a list of demands for changes to make the government's market reforms more credible. What all three groups have in common is their reliance on Russia's newly powerful entrepreneurs for money and support. Where members include factory directors, their influence is seen as crucial in obtaining the votes of their workers. The leaders' ultimate goal is to have their own political base when the time comes to replace President Yeltsin in presidential elections further along the road. Many entrepreneurs and managers now being wooed are naturally keen that the new parliament should be pro-business and pro-private property. But Mr Viktor Korovin, the 40-year-old director of Uralmash, a recently privatised flagship of heavy industry which is a member of Mr Gaidar's association, summed up a widespread scepticism about the politicians. 'I want the new parliament to be as depoliticised as possible,' he said, referring to the over-politicised nature of Russian life. For the time being, there appears to be no limit to what can be turned into a party. One of the stranger offshoots of the new trend was the announcement by the deputy prime minister, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, that he was setting up a party to represent regional interests and press for the creation of a genuine federal state. As President Yeltsin's adviser on nationalities, he has set himself the impossible task of rallying 89 regions and republics whose only common aim is to extract as much cash and power from Moscow as possible. Although the constitutional convention, which reconvenes on Saturday, is unlikely to finalise a new democratic constitution, politicians are expecting it to at least come up with an electoral law. This is because new elections are seen as a panacea for Russia's troubles, ushering in a new parliament which would both actively support radical reforms and approve a new constitution. Although it is not yet clear whether Russia will opt for a first-past-the-post electoral rule or a mixed system involving some proportional representation, the main obstacle faced by reformist forces is the absence of strong parties to fill the vacuum left by the once-monolithic Communist party.</p>

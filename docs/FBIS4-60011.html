			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, 17 May (WAKH) -- His Highness Shaykh  Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab  Emirates [UAE], received a telephone call from Yemeni President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih this evening.    The Emirates News Agency said views were exchanged on the  current developments in Yemen and the bloody fighting between  brothers. It added that Shaykh Zayid stressed the urgent need  to stop Yemeni fighting in order to pave the way for the  continuation of his highness's efforts to reconcile the Yemeni  brothers' views.    The UAE president appealed to the Yemeni president to do his  best to put an immediate end to fighting and to exercise maximum  self-restraint in order to spare blood and safeguard the  people's lives. He said there will be no victor or vanquished  among the sons of the one country and that the real loser will  be the Yemeni people, who will suffer from the destruction  inflicted on them.    Shaykh Zayid regretted what is happening as well as the  Yemeni president's failure to respond to the repeated calls to  stop the fighting, stressing that what is taking place is a  disaster for Yemen and the Arab nation.</p>

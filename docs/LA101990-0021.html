			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITION 128;  </P> <P> IMPACT ON FOOD IF 'BIG GREEN' PASSES DEBATED  </P> <P> A California ballot measure that would phase out the use of at least 25  pesticides -- and potentially ban more than twice that number -- could force  major changes in the way food is grown around the nation.  </P> <P> The measure, which will appear on the Nov. 6 ballot as Proposition 128, would  ban pesticides that cause cancer or birth defects if the chemicals are used on  food. Produce and other food commodities from outside the state could not be  sold in California if they were grown with these pesticides.  </P> <P> The rules are among the most controversial provisions of Proposition 128, the  environmental initiative known by its backers as "Big Green," because they ban  pesticides even if they contain only trace levels of carcinogens or  reproductive toxins.  </P> <P> No one is certain how many chemicals eventually might be lost to agriculture  because many have not been fully tested or analyzed. Clouding the picture even  more are widely different interpretations of the initiative by the  environmentalists who wrote it and the California Department of Food and  Agriculture. If the measure is passed, the agency stands to lose some of its  responsibilities for pesticide regulation to the California Department of  Health Services.  </P> <P> "There's an ironic campaign by Food and Ag to make this initiative even more  far reaching than it is," said Al Meyerhoff, a senior attorney for the Natural  Resources Defense Council, an environmental group sponsoring the initiative. "I  know that once this passes . . . they will reverse direction 180 degrees and  claim that the initiative doesn't include anything."  </P> <P> Jim Wells, an assistant chief of the department's pest management division,  said Meyerhoff is "desperate."  </P> <P> "I think the proponents -- when they saw what the impact was -- realized it  would frighten people, and are trying to back away from it and say, 'No, no no,  it won't cover that.' "  </P> <P> But even under the most narrow interpretation, the pesticide provisions would  be far-reaching.  </P> <P> "You are essentially dictating to other states how they can and can't use  pesticides," said Jack Moore, a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  assistant administrator and president of the Irvine-based Institute for  Evaluating Health Risks.  </P> <P> Supporters and opponents predict the initiative would spark renewed efforts in  Congress to curtail states' rights on pesticide regulation. Congress has failed  to muster enough votes to prohibit states from enacting tougher regulations  than those set by the EPA.  </P> <P> But Moore said he believes the initiative would spur Congress to limit states'  rights, "or if not, it would be a close vote." Moore's nonprofit institute,  established a year ago, attempts to determine the potential health effects of  chemicals for government and industry clients.  </P> <P> Out-of-state farmers who used banned pesticides would have to discontinue them,  set up a separate production system for California, stop selling in the state  or continue to use the chemicals and hope that residues could not be detected.  </P> <P> Among the chemicals the initiative would phase out is a herbicide called  alachlor, the most widely used pesticide in the nation, according to the EPA.  </P> <P> The EPA says consumers have about a one-in-a-million risk of getting cancer  from consuming food treated with the chemical -- a risk so small that many  contend it is insignificant. Environmental groups counter that alachlor, which  has been banned in Canada, is a major pollutant of ground water in the Midwest.  </P> <P> Even Proposition 135, a counter initiative largely intended to preserve the  status quo and head off the environmentalists, would reach beyond California,  according to Moore and the Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> That initiative, backed by growers, would substantially increase the amount of  food tested by the department for pesticide residues. The produce could not be  sold if it contained residues of chemicals not permitted in California. State  officials say farmers in other states use a handful of pesticides now  prohibited for food use in California. Foreign countries use about a dozen such  chemicals.  </P> <P> Proposition 135 also would set up a governor-appointed science advisory panel  to advise the department on what it considers safe levels of pesticide use and  repeal $1.5 million in licensing fees paid by produce dealers and food  processors. The general fund would have to make up that revenue.  </P> <P> Production of sterile Mediterranean fruit flies would be doubled to reduce  future aerial pesticide spraying in urban communities and $25 million would be  provided for research into pesticide alternatives.  </P> <P> But the measure still would allow the Department of Food and Agriculture, which  many critics contend places the needs of farmers over public health, to  continue to call most of the shots on pesticide regulation in California.  </P> <P> "I don't see the (farmers) initiative as so much changing the way things are  being done," said Moore, who is familiar with both measures.  </P> <P> Proposition 128 is far more sweeping.  </P> <P> It bans 25 pesticides outright. That number will climb as studies required by  the initiative discover more products that contain carcinogens or reproductive  toxins. Manufacturers also may decide to abandon some products rather than  spend the money for testing.  </P> <P> The EPA, which regulates pesticides for the nation, now allows farmers to use  most of these pesticides but has placed some under special review to determine  whether they should be restricted further because of potential health hazards.  </P> <P> In allowing use of the pesticides, the agency has determined that the benefits  exceed the risks. The EPA says the risks are low because consumers are exposed  to only small amounts of the substances.  </P> <P> "Under Big Green, there is no safe dose," Moore said. "If it is listed as  causing cancer or birth defects, it's gone."  </P> <P> In California, six of the 25 pesticides specifically targeted by the initiative  already are not used on food in California, according to state agricultural  officials. Those six include one that is no longer permitted on food grown in  the United States and another that is no longer manufactured.  </P> <P> According to agricultural researchers at the University of California, there  are substitutes, albeit potentially more costly and less effective, for most of  the other pesticides used on California crops.  </P> <P> There are no identified alternatives for several fungicides needed to combat  diseases on dozens of crops, the researchers say, or for an insecticide now  applied to eight crops that make up only a small share of the state's  agriculture.  </P> <P> "The impact (from the loss of the targeted pesticides) is not going to be as  big as the farm groups say, but it's not going to be nothing either," said  Frank Zalom, director of the statewide integrated pest management project for  the University of California.  </P> <P> "Individual growers are going to have problems with it "but it's really  difficult to say (what will happen) across the whole ag industry."  </P> <P> Experts agree that the loss of fungicides -- chemicals used to kill  fungus-caused diseases -- would hit agriculture hardest.  </P> <P> "In the U.S., some crops can't be grown in certain areas without severe fungus  problems," said William Jordan, chief of policy staff in the EPA's pesticide  program. "I think the list of available substitutes is very small, if there are  any."  </P> <P> The initiative would give farmers in most cases five to eight years to shift to  other chemicals or alternate farming practices if no substitute is available.  Twenty-million dollars would be spent on research to develop alternatives.  </P> <P> Government pesticide regulators argue that five to eight years may not be  enough time to develop, test and register substitutes for use. Representatives  of environmental groups counter that the federal government has previously  yanked pesticides off the market with almost no notice. The supporters also  contend that Proposition 128 will not catch pesticide manufacturers off guard.  </P> <P> "The initiative is not an immediate and total ban," said Meyerhoff of the  Natural Resources Defense Council. "And the writing has been on the wall for  years that the days for most of these products are numbered."  </P> <P> The biggest dispute over the potential impact of "Big Green" revolves around  the number of chemicals it would actually prohibit.  </P> <P> Opponents, who argue that Proposition 128 would raise food prices, speculate  that the initiative could phase out hundreds of pesticides and warn that  alternatives, even if they do not cause cancer or birth defects, could pose  other significant health hazards.  </P> <P> Meyerhoff argues that no more than 50 pesticides would be phased out over the  next 10 to 20 years.  </P> <P> Of major concern to farmers is how many pesticides would be banned by a  provision that prohibits potentially harmful substances that are unavoidably  added to the pesticide during manufacturing.  </P> <P> Jim Wells, the Department of Food and Agriculture official, said he cannot  estimate the loss under that provision.  </P> <P> "I don't know how many (such cases) we have out there," he said, "and we don't  have any way of knowing unless we looked at all the formulations in depth and  did some analyses."  </P> <P> Such uncertainty unnerves farmers, who fear the loss of many of their tools,  and aggravates environmentalists, who distrust government's ability to ensure a  safe food supply. It is exacerbated by conflicting interpretations of which  pesticides would be covered by the measure.  </P> <P> Joel Nelson, president of California Citrus Mutual, a citrus producers trade  association, argues, for example, that "Big Green" will disrupt pest management  practices designed to reduce reliance on pesticides.  </P> <P> Nelson, who is campaigning for the farmers' initiative, said citrus growers  spread an oil-based product on the leaves of citrus trees to smother the eggs  of a pest before hatching. Because a contaminant of the oil is benzene, which  causes cancer, the product would be phased out by Proposition 128, according to  Nelson and officials at the Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> Lawrie Mott, a senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council,  disagrees. She said the product would not be banned because oil is not  considered a pesticide by federal regulators.  </P> <P> The most drastic scenarios for the initiative's impact are based on  misinterpretations, Mott and other sponsors contend.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Department of Food and Agriculture says it interprets one provision  as possibly banning as much as 65% of all pesticides. State agricultural  officials also insist the measure would phase out some insecticides used in the  home and on pets; the sponsors say it only applies to pesticides when they are  used to grow food.  </P> <P> But even among the sponsors, there is occasional confusion about just what the  initiative would do.  </P> <P> According to the Department of Food and Agriculture, at least one formulation  of malathion, a pesticide that is most widely known for its use against the  Mediterranean fruit fly, could be banned because it contains heavy metals.  </P> <P> "If this initiative will ban malathion, that's the best news I have heard in  weeks," said Meyerhoff, the defense council's attorney. "But it's incorrect."  </P> <P> Mott contradicts her colleague. If the formulation of malathion containing  heavy metals were used on food, it would be subject to a five- to eight-year  phase-out, she said.  </P> <P> Veda Federighi, a spokeswoman for the Department of Food and Agriculture, notes  that unless the initiative is passed and regulations adopted, its impact will  remain uncertain. Proponents argue that their intent will shape how the final  rules are developed.  </P> <P> "Like everything else," Federighi said, "it depends on how the regulations are  written to implement it."  </P></p>

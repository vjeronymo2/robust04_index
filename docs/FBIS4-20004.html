			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Elections; Forza Italia To </F> Defend Farm Output"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 23 -- The defense of Italian farm  products will be one of the battle cries of Forza Italia during  the campaign for European [Parliament--EP] elections in June.  Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi and his aides discussed  the matter at a meeting today and next week will also draft  administrative matters.    The protection of Italian farm products both at home and on  European markets means defending job levels in Italy, according  to Forza Italia spokesman Antonio Tajani. He claimed that  production in this important sector of the economy has been  buffeted, above all, by an invasion of South American farm  products.</p>

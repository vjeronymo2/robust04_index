			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOR PRESERVING PIERCE'S FARM  </P> <P> The Calabasas Historical Society strongly urges the preservation of the Pierce  College farm as a most valuable and significant historical landmark.  </P> <P> Creative approaches which can be implemented immediately will result in  increasing prosperity for the college. The preservation of the farm will  benefit the entire community. Its citizens do feel they have a vested interest  in seeing that the farm is maintained and improved as a living green area.  Oxygen and food are essential for human life. Therefore, the Pierce College  farm should be preserved for posterity, the heritage of the future, providing a  variety of educational experiences for students of all ages.  </P> <P> ALICE STELLE  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P></p>

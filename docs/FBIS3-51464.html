			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. National Association of Broadcasters has  demanded that TV Marti, the anti-Cuban television station, be  closed. The association has described the station as  inefficient and illegal. In statements to a special U.S.  Congressional body, created to study the future of TV Marti and  Radio Marti, (William Haratuntam), adviser to the National  Association of Broadcasters, said that TV Marti violates the  international agreements that limit the use of radio and  television signals for domestic use only. The so-called TV  Marti and Radio Marti have been on the air since May 1985 and  March 1990, respectively.</p>

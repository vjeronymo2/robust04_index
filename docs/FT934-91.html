			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Christmas lift for book sales Book publishers have had their best Christmas for at least three years, according to a study by market research group MarketLine International, Raymond Snoddy writes. The retail value of books sold in the UK last year was Pounds 2.52bn, a figure which is estimated to rise to Pounds 2.7bn this year and Pounds 2.95bn in 1994. Consumers spent Pounds 1.7bn on books this year, almost 5 per cent of all recreational spending with every man, women and child buying an average of seven books each. Sixty-seven per cent of revenue comes from consumer books, 25 per cent from academic and professional and 8 per cent from school books. The volume of book sales is expected to rise to 405m copies next year from 401m this. There is no sign of a drop in reading, despite increased competition from electronic media.

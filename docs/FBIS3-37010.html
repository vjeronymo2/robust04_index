Results of Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev's Tour of Central Asian Republics"]    [Text] A joint Russian and Uzbek Foreign Ministry  statement issued 9 February in Tashkent reflects their  principled stance on Afghanistan, where, as you know, an armed  fight for power is flaring up with renewed vigor. In addition  to expressing profound concern at events in the neighboring  state, the statement reaffirms the principles of strict  neutrality and noninterference in the internal affairs of the  Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.    Andrey Kozyrev also discussed a wide range of issues of  mutual interest during his conversation with Kazakhstani  President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He discussed problems involved  in preparing for the meeting of the Commonwealth heads of state  too. What is more, it was decided to set up working groups to  seek a solution to the most burning problems in relations  between the two countries.    Asked by your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent about the  results  of his talks in Almaty, Andrey Kozyrev replied that he did not  have the task of signing any documents. It was a question of  preparing a whole package of treaties and agreements. Primarily  on Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation. The sides  discussed the possibility of dismantling the nuclear weapons  stationed on Kazakhstan's territory and taking them back to  Russia. While agreeing, Kozyrev stressed, appropriate  compensation for the strategic nuclear materials. It was  likewise deemed necessary to formulate an agreement on legal and  humanitarian questions, including a treaty on citizenship. And  a number of other documents dealing with the problems of the  Russian-speaking population. The issue of joint use of the  Baykonur cosmodrome was discussed separately.    "My task," the Russian foreign minister said, "was to  discuss  these matters in detail with the Kazakhstani side and give  President Nazarbayev a personal message from Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin, which I did."    Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that when the bilateral  agreements are signed the scope for demagoguery over many  difficult issues will be exhausted. He pointed to the total  coincidence of views on a whole series of matters under  discussion.    Andrey Kozyrev visited the Baykonur cosmodrome 10 February.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA specifically proposes two options for an operations fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The first option implements a takeoff fee for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general aviation operations in the affected areas. Conceptually,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fee would be high enough to limit general aviation activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without making such activity prohibitively expensive. The second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program option also implements a takeoff fee for all general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation activity in these areas, but would incorporate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifetime fee exemption for engines/aircraft meeting ``clean''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission levels. For example, aircraft engines with emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable to the levels originally required by EPA in 1973 (38  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 19088), but subsequently withdrawn, would be deemed ``clean''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the purpose of this program and would receive a lifetime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption from any FIP general aviation takeoff fees. Certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines/aircraft would be identified by a certificate or decal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with commercial aircraft, EPA proposes an initial fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on $10,000 per ton of pollutant, and will commit in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final FIP to review the effect of this fee and adjust it upwards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if necessary to achieve the target emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions per LTO based on a representative fleet of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation aircraft are: <FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Volume IV, Chapter 5 of EPA's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> VOC_0.394 pounds per LTO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _0.065 pounds per LTO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On this basis the takeoff fee can be calculated as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> ($10,000/ton)&times;(0.394 lbs/LTO) divided by 2,000 lbs/ton=$1.97/LTO for VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ($10,000/ton)&times;(0.065 lbs/LTO) divided by 2,000 lbs/ton=$0.325/LTO for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total fee thus would be $2.30 per LTO. In light of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low dollar amount, and since EPA would plan in any case to adjust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fee upward to get the desired effect, the Agency requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on whether it is reasonable to depart from the $10,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per ton level generally being used for all proposed fee systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this NPRM, and start with a higher fee in the final rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general aviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also requests comment on differentiating the fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reflect the varying pollution potential of different aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., single- versus twin-engined and piston versus turbine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powered). As a further differentiation, EPA requests comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a variable fee structure for specific airports where other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction schemes have been implemented by the airport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proprietor beyond those required by the FIP or other regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This would encourage control measures such as vapor recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A takeoff fee would be assessed by selling one-time takeoff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits. The program would be administered and ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforced by EPA, presumably at each airport. Denial of takeoff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permission is the most practical means of enforcement for most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general aviation applications, given the number of individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilots that would be involved in such a program. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consulting with the FAA in this regard, and requests comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the legal authority for and practical consequences of enlisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA assistance in this program. At uncontrolled public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private airports, proprietors or owners may be able to refuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services such as tie-down facilities or refueling to noncomplying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft. Otherwise, EPA would have to have a presence or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credible prospect of enforcement against noncomplying pilots in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to enforce the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to accurately track and help enforce the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee program, EPA will require owners or operators of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airports in the control areas with general aviation activity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain a general aviation operations certificate and submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seasonal aircraft activity reports during the ozone season. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will provide EPA with the information necessary to verify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general aviation emission reductions are occurring as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Military air bases with general aviation activity will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to these requirements, since such activity will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in an air base's environmental performance evaluation as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section III.D.4.e.(2)(c) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All civilian airports in the control areas with general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation activity will be required to obtain a general aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation certificate no later than December 31, 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications for these certificates will be submitted to EPA by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 20, 2000 and will include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Airport name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Airport location, including latitude and longitude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / German inflation boosts rate cut hopes GERMAN interest rates could be cut further this week even though inflation has increased again, economists in Germany argued yesterday. The cost of living in western Germany rose at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent in the month to mid-July, compared with 4.2 per cent in June, the federal statistics office reported. Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank, noted that in the previous three months consumer prices had increased at a 'moderate' annual rate of 3.1 per cent, thanks partly to cheaper oil. Although money supply growth was still exceeding the Bundesbank's target range the rate of expansion was weakening detectably, and if this continued there was a good chance it would return to within the range of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent annualised growth fixed by the central bank. The broad M3 money supply measure in June grew at an annualised rate of 7.1 per cent. Although the consensus yesterday was that there was more than an even chance of a reduction in German rates, few expect a cut of more than half a percentage point in the key discount rate, currently 6.75 per cent. Dr Hufner added that renewed tension in the European monetary system was an important further argument for an interest rate cut at the central bank's meeting tomorrow, the last before the summer break. The Bundesbank announced yesterday it would accept variable bids from commercial banks for short-term funds in its weekly money market operation. Some dealers believe the cost of borrowing short-term funds should come down today by about 0.15 percentage points to 7 per cent. However in the ERM the Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone came under some selling pressure yesterday afternoon. The French franc weakened slightly against the D-Mark. Germany's July inflation figure, which matched most forecasts, was based on preliminary calculations from four important states. Currencies, Page 33 World stocks, Page 39</p>

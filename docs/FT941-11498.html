			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Row in Moscow over spending on agriculture The Russian government yesterday illustrated its inclination towards a course of spending which would fuel inflation and jeopardise economic recovery. Mr Andrei Illarionov, whose days may be numbered as personal economics adviser to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, severely criticised an agriculture support package as a 'benefit for lobbies' such as the state farms represented by the deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Zaveriukha. He said the package, for instance raising duties on imported sugar when Russian sugar prices were already twice the world level, would hit the consumer hardest. Although the package carried an official price tag of Rbs14,000bn, Mr Illarionov said it would be complemented by an additional Rbs14,000bn to be spent on soft loans for food purchases, and another Rbs6,000bn in loans for farmers to carry out the spring sowing. This meant that at present exchange rates Russia would spend Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn) on its attempts to become self-sufficient in food - or 10 times more than it spent on food imports last year - making the goal of self-sufficiency not worth the expenditure. Mr Chernomyrdin was quoted as asking the package's authors to review the programme, saying it had to be backed up by appropriate resources. He did not explain what constituted appropriate resources in a situation where the government has already decided to double the amount of money it will print in the first quarter of this year to cover the budget deficit.</p>

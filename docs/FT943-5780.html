			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Bill for remand prisoners is Pounds 200m a year Holding prisoners on remand before trial is costing the Prison Service more than Pounds 200m a year, the National Audit Office says in a report published today. The public spending watchdog says half the cost is for prisoners awaiting trial in the Crown Court, which deals with more serious criminal cases in England and Wales. Waiting times for a Crown Court trial averaged 13.7 weeks in 1992. There is a statutory maximum waiting time of eight weeks, but this is treated as advisory, the audit office says. Only 6 per cent of courts met the deadline in 1992. The audit office says that some of the reasons for delays are beyond the control of the courts. These include lawyers not being ready and witnesses not turning up. Many cases listed for trial do not take place - about half because the defendant changes his plea to guilty at the last moment. The cost of a wasted day in the Crown Court can be as high as Pounds 5,900 in fees to lawyers, legal aid and expenses for jurors and witnesses. But more effective use of court resources could reduce delays, the report says. Some courtrooms are unused for up to a third of the time, and courts sit for an average of 4.3 hours a day. The growing number of remand prisoners awaiting trial is the single biggest factor behind prison overcrowding, according to the audit office. Many of those held on remand are not sent to prison when convicted, the report says. Just over half of those found guilty in 1992-93 were given custodial sentences on conviction.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, June 24 (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Party of  Turks (DPTM) is taking advantage of the early census in the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.) to pressure  Moslem Macedonians into declaring themselves as Turks, the  Association of Macedonians of Islam Religion warned on Friday.    A statement released by the Association asks the State  Census  Commission to ban DPTM activists from pressuring Islamized  Macedonians "into falsifying their Macedonian nationality and  native Macedonian language" in order to fully "become  assimilated" and turn Turk.    The Macedonian authorities expect the census, which began on  Tuesday, to show an incomparably smaller number of members of  various nationalities, than leaders of national parties claim.    According to the 1991 census, F.Y.R.O.M. had 2.3 million  inhabitants, including 21 percent ethnic Albanians (427,000),  while Albanian leaders claim that there are between 800,000 and  one million members of that minority.    Also, according to the same census, there are only 50,000  Serbs in that former Yugoslav republic. Serbs do not recognize  the results of that census and a representative of Serbs and  Montenegrins in the F.Y.R.O.M. says there are about 250,000  Serbs there.</p>

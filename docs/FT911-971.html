			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tepid response to ASB plan THE UK'S top finance directors are lukewarm about the Accounting Standards Board's proposals for a radical restructuring of company profit and loss accounts. Last month the ASB released draft guidelines which proposed that companies should give a detailed breakdown of the sources of income and expenditure and publish a prominent statement showing the movement of reserves. The rules also envisage a tightening up of the distinction between extraordinary and exceptional items and would require companies to publish details of discretionary expenditure such as advertising. The technical committee of the 100 Group of senior UK finance directors met earlier this week to consider its response to the proposals and concluded that the document had significant shortcomings. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chairman of the committee and finance director of Reed International, was yesterday at pains to say that finance directors were broadly behind the ASB in its attempts to reform UK financial reporting. However, he indicated that the committee was worried about the complexity of the revised profit and loss account - it would have eight columns of figures  -and had doubts about the principle of disclosing discretionary expenditure. Mr Stapleton said that the committee supported the principle of greater disclosure which lay behind the proposals which would require companies to show details of income and expenditure from continuing businesses, companies acquired during the year and discontinued businesses. But he hoped that the rules would eventually take account of 'materiality', in other words the scale of the figures in relation to the size of the group as a whole. He said the committee was wholly behind the proposed requirement to publish a prominent statement of movements on reserves. Moreover, it welcomed the proposed tightening up of the rules on extraordinary and exceptional items. The draft rules were issued for a brief consultation period which ended on Tuesday. In due course the ASB will issue a formal Exposure Draft which will ultimately become a formal Financial Reporting Standard. Prof David Tweedie, ASB chairman, said earlier this week that so far the response to the draft rules had been broadly favourable.</p>

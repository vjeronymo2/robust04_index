			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Whirlpool sees earnings down 17.2% PROBLEMS in its difficult home market left Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances, reporting a 17.2 per cent fall in first-quarter earnings at Dollars 24m after tax, against Dollars 29m in 1990. Sales fell marginally, to Dollars 1.62bn from Dollars 1.64bn last year. Whirlpool said part of the decline reflected continuing difficulties with its Brazilian affiliates. The Michigan - based company took in a net loss of Dollars 17m from its equity interest here, and said operations were hampered by a price freeze on many consumer durable items. It added that, if the effect of the Brazilian business were excluded, underlying earnings were down by 15 per cent from the first quarter of 1990. Whirlpool distinguished between its European operations, which fared well during the quarter, and the domestic position. On the former, it said sales and earnings from its joint venture with Philips, the Dutch electrical group, improved from the previous year, helped by volume growth and favourable currency translation. In the US, Whirlpool conceded that shipments declined - although it said its own decline was less than the industry average , which showed a 16 per cent fall. Mr David Whitman, chairman, said he expected a 'gradual recovery' in this area.</p>

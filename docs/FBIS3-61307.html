			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Program of the National Unity of Kazakhstan Union"] </F>   [Text] The National Unity of Kazakhstan Union is a national  movement operating within the framework of the constitution and  laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan and uniting on a voluntary  basis citizens of the Republic, regardless of national  affiliation or religious belief.    The SNEK [National Unity of Kazakhstan Union] advocates the  creation of an open-type society, the building in Kazakhstan of  a democratic state based on the rule of law, the formation of a  social market economy, the creation of a genuine multiparty  system, social partnership and civil harmony, political and  internation stability, Kazakhstani patriotism, and mutual  respect and tolerance and an increase in Kazakhstan's political  authority in the world arena and its progress and prosperity.  <H5>  I. Purposes and Main Directions of Activity </H5>   The Union's political tasks have been structured with regard  for historical, national, and geographical factors of  Kazakhstan. Actual social institutions like the family, blood  relations, religion, and territorial structures influence  political processes. A particular role in Kazakhstan is  performed by the small size of the population, the sparse  network of cities, and the low level of availability of  transport. Millions of people, particularly in the countryside,  are cut off from politics. The Union supports the mobilization  of the political will of millions of our fellow citizens and  their involvement in the sphere of assertive political activity  based on the ideas of stability, reforms, and civil harmony.    The Union advocates the creation of a grand political  coalition in Kazakhstan in the transitional period. This  coalition anticipates the surmounting of the confrontation  between the government and the opposition. Whereas in stable  democratic societies an active opposition is a condition of  political balance, in such a transitional society as Kazakhstan  constant opposition to the government could perform a negative  role also. On the other hand, the opposition stands apart from  the structures of state power. The Union proceeds from the fact  that a political coalition is possible between equal political  groups. Stability requires a more even distribution of power  between the current machinery of state and the opposition  parties and movements and close relations between them.    The Union proposes as a principal method of the solution of  contradictions in the political sphere the achievement of  consensus and social accord. Regarding itself as a political  organization of a centrist nature, the Union rejects extremes of  left and right. We are opposed to a situation involving the  social opposition of various forces, which has itself been  brought about by the growing polarization of interests. We do  not claim to substitute for some political parties or  organizations. Party pluralism in a democratic society is  essential. But we are talking about something else: a mechanism  of assuaging conflicts and political contradictions in  present-day Kazakhstan.    We regard civic harmony as the unity of views of various  political groups on specific political problems. It is obvious  that there is some middle, central line of public thinking. This  is a set of issues on which political groups are in accord. This  mode of the solution of political problems is preferable to a  solution merely by way of a simple arithmetical majority, which  could, in turn, lead to regional conflicts. The opinion of  political minorities cannot be ignored. Sooner or later, this  leads to open conflict.    In the sphere of the political arrangement of society the  SNEK firmly supports the formation of a state based on the rule  of law in the form of presidential rule. And this, in our view,  is explicable. The experience of world history shows that in an  era of socioeconomic and political crises and upheavals an  objective need for an increase in the regulatory role of the  state and a strengthening of the executive appears. Our young  state is passing through such a period. An increase in the role  and responsibility of the executive headed by the president in  tackling tasks pertaining to an escape from the crisis and a  strengthening of the vertical line of management are essential  for the pursuit of a common policy and strict coordination.    The SNEK advocates the speediest adoption of the Law "On  Public Service," an increase in the responsibility of state  officials and the mobility and efficiency of the work of the  administrative machinery, and an improvement in the conditions  and an enhancement of the prestige of managerial work. The Union  considers the replacement of personnel and a reduction in the  administrative machinery essential.    The Union supports a strong legislature in the shape of a  compact professional national parliament. The SNEK believes that  the present parliament has done a great deal in the business of  formation of an independent Kazakhstan and the provision of a  legislative base for the reform policy.    In the present times, which are complex and filled with  anxiety for the future and concerns for a resolution of the most  urgent problems, as in the immediate future also, for that  matter, it is hardly possible to expect an increase in voter  activity at the elections. This simultaneously calls very much  in question the possibility of the efficient use at this time of  the absolute-majority head-to-head system. One way or another,  elections employing this system could always face the danger of  failure.    The use, on the other hand, of a relative-majority  head-to-head system, whereby the elections are considered valid  irrespective of the number of voters who have gone to the polls  (although, obviously, a certain minimum  percentage--approximately 35-40 percent, in our view, will have  to be established, all the same) and the candidate is considered  elected if more people have voted for him than for the other  candidates (and some minimum threshold, 25 percent, for example,  is necessary here also, what is more), is both far more  applicable for our conditions and far more efficient. This  system is applied equally well for the elections of both  independent candidates and those who have been nominated by  political parties and grassroots associations and affords an  opportunity for elections to be held without runoffs and a  second round of elections entailing a decline in voter activity  and considerable material and financial outlays.    As far, however, as the use at party-slate elections of the  proportional system of determination of the results is  concerned, it would seem entirely unsuitable in our situation.  First, it is very hard to apply and would be comprehensible to  far from everyone in the vast army of members of the electoral  commissions. Confirmation of this are the repeated breakdowns at  elections involving the use of this system by some of our former  USSR brethren. Second, this system works well in a strongly  politicized society with a highly developed party system, which  we do not yet have nor will we have in the quite distant future  even. Third, this system depersonalizes the elections to a  certain extent, that is, the voter votes not for a specific  personality but for a slate formed by a party, which,  understandably, under the conditions of our democracy, which is  in the development phase, can hardly be considered positive. Nor  either, for that matter, can the proportional system's exclusion  of the possibility of self-nomination for deputy.    For this reason it is expedient at statewide-slate elections  also to use the relative-majority head-to-head system, which  makes it possible to quickly and efficiently chose two deputies  from three candidates in practically all districts.    It is with such an electoral system that the formation of a  professional parliament of the Republic, whose creation, in the  SNEK's opinion, is a most important factor of the development of  parliamentarianism in Kazakhstan and an intensification of the  democratic process in the Republic as a whole, becomes possible.    The SNEK believes that a democratic state is inconceivable  without an autonomous, united, and independent judiciary with  its ramified system. The Union emphasizes here the need for the  assurance of the court's independence of the executive,  legislative, and local authorities, the irreplaceability of  judges, and the electivity of the court. Legal proceedings  should be oral, swift, and direct and ensure the equality of the  parties. The SNEK believes also that they should ensure the  equality before the court and the law of the individual, the  citizen, and the state and legal protection of the rights and  liberties of citizens against the unwarranted interference of  the state.    Each branch of power has its own particular authority  enshrined by the constitution and does not duplicate or  substitute for the other branches of power.    The SNEK regards man as the highest value and advocates the  economic, spiritual, and political freedom of the individual.  The SNEK sees as the main task of the Kazakh state respect for,  defense of, and the creation of the conditions for the  realization in practice of the rights of man and citizen. The  SNEK recognizes the principles proclaimed by the UN Charter  determining basic human rights and enshrined in the Constitution  of the Republic of Kazakhstan:    recognition of the dignity inherent in all members of the  human family and their equal and inalienable rights is the basis  of liberty, justice, and general peace;    these rights ensue from the dignity inherent in the human  personality;    recognition of the fact that, according to the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of the free human  personality enjoying civil and political liberty and freedom  from fear and want may be realized only when the conditions are  created whereby each may avail himself of his economic, social,  and cultural rights in the same way as his civil and political  rights.    Human rights belong to each and everyone, regardless of  civil  affiliation and level of the material development of society.  They are inalienable and sacrosanct. The SNEK maintains that a  violation of human rights is always explained by political, not  economic, factors. As distinct from civil rights, the extent of  which is predetermined by the specific possibilities and  development of society.  <H5>  II. Economic Platform </H5>   In the transitional period the SNEK sees as the main task of  its economic platform the adoption of effective measures to lead  the economy of Kazakhstan out of the devastating economic crisis  and the pursuit of an active policy for protecting against  inflation the commodity producers and the entire population, for  a halt to the decline in production and its subsequent upturn,  and for the social protection of poor and needy citizens.    The SNEK advocates the creation of a Kazakh model of  economic  development ensuing from the particular geopolitical location of  Kazakhstan and the availability of a rich storehouse of natural  resources and skilled and educated personnel potential. The  Kazakhstan model of the economy should aspire to imbibe all that  is most valuable contained in the experience of the economic  reforms of other countries and take account primarily of the  economic interests of the Republic. The SNEK believes that the  raw material focus of our economy can and should benefit, not  harm, the Republic and be the foundation of a restructuring of  production in the direction of manufacturing industry.    The SNEK advocates the fair privatization of state property  excluding the alienation of various groups of the population of  Kazakhstan from the basic producer goods on a racial, national,  socio-class, property, territorial, or some other basis. The  privatization process should provide for equal access to assets  about to be privatized for all citizens of the Republic. The  state and glasnost should be the guarantor of fair privatization.    The Union regards corruption as a dangerous phenomenon for  society and a crime. For this reason it supports an  intensification of the fight against organized crime. With  regard for the corresponding international agreements and  recommendations pertaining to the fight against corruption it is  essential to make immediate adjustments to the current  legislative instruments to create more effective conditions of  the organization of the work on uncovering, forestalling, and  putting a stop to the activity of corrupt criminal groups. The  Union advocates special laws making provision for concerted  measures of the fight against these phenomena. It is essential  also to extend the rights and strengthen the personnel  composition of the law enforcement authorities and to contribute  to an enhancement of its professional level.    The SNEK believes that it is essential to consistently and  resolutely fight against corruption in the sphere of  privatization, against the notorious "grab-ization."    The SNEK supports a policy of the utmost encouragement of  private enterprise and small and medium-sized business. In order  for the program of support for enterprise proclaimed by the  government to be realized it is essential to reconsider the  practice of privileged taxation and the allocation of loans for  private enterprise. We need in this sphere to create propitious  conditions for entrepreneurs for stimulating a growth of  production and the productive accumulation and investment of  capital in promising and socially significant sectors of  production. We proceed from the priority of productive  enterprise over commercial, speculative business and will  further its development by all forces at our disposal.    The SNEK proceeds from the fact that the present system of  pricing is in need of radical revision. We will pursue a  flexible and differentiated price policy. The SNEK believes that  it is essential in respect to the public sector and monopoly  enterprises and also energy producers to set strict limits on  the growth of prices. An unchecked increase in the prices of  their products leads to a growth of inflation and an increase in  the price of all commodities. In the nonstate sector prices  should be established freely, and the government may control  prices here only with the aid of indirect levers: taxes, bank  credit, and customs privileges and restrictions.    In the sphere of finances, monetary circulation, and credit  in the Republic a critical situation caused both by the general  crisis of the economy and the ill-considered steps of the  government has taken shape. In the financial and credit sphere  the SNEK will in the transitional period unswervingly pursue a  policy of a recovery of the financial system, a reduction in the  budget deficit, the formation of a prudent and flexible tax  system, liberalization of the banking system, and a recovery of  monetary circulation. The SNEK believes that to achieve the said  goal it is essential:    to reform the tax system and to switch to a system of  taxation providing for a transition from the fiscal to  stimulatory focus of taxes. Tax policy should be stable and  civilized with a broad base of taxation and favorable to the  proprietors, producers, and the state and should be working to  supplant the criminal circulation of cash and noncash  transactions;    to immediately reform the credit and banking system in the  direction of the creation of most-favored status for enterprise.  The banking system should provide for a flexible, differentiated  credit policy, soft loans for the priority sectors, the funding  of research developments, and the introduction of promising  production engineering programs in the Republic's economy;    to provide for the indexing of personal monetary savings  held  in savings banks and to raise the deposit interest rate to  protect them against inflationary support [as published] and to  attract investments in the economy;    to protect the country's economic interests and safeguard  its  economic independence and security it is essential to perform  preparatory work on the introduction of a national currency.    The impossibility of an independent escape under the  conditions of the postcommunist devastation and the collapse of  interrepublic business relations from the most severe economic  crisis prompted Kazakhstan to sign the treaty on the economic  union of CIS countries and to stay within the ruble zone. The  Union hopes that the treaty will serve as a foundation for new  genuinely mutually profitable and equal economic relations and  support the continued materialization of the country's  independence in the interests of all Kazakhstanis.    In the transitional period the state should render financial  support only to the priority base sectors of production  possessing high export potential and providing for the  scientific and technical and technological updating of the  entire economy.    The SNEK is opposed to the atomization of government funds  around various sectors and departments and supports their  concentration and directed and rational use in the most limited  number of priority sectors possible: the oil and gas complex,  the agro-industrial complex, the conversion mechanical  engineering complex, and utility systems.    The Union consistently advocates the structural  reorganization and accelerated technological renewal of material  production. The SNEK sees as its task the pursuit of a  structural and scientific and technological policy which makes  it possible to accomplish a leap forward in technology and  upgrade enterprises' hopelessly obsolete fixed capital to world  standards. The SNEK is for the re-industrialization of industry  in the promising areas reflecting the long-term conditions of  the world market.    The paramount task is the acceleration of investments in the  manufacturing research-intensive sectors completing a production  engineering cycle: mechanical engineering, petrochemical,  electronics, and aerospace industry and instrument making.    Kazakhstan has quite powerful scientific and technological  groundwork in Aktau, Leninsk, Kurchatov, Stepnogorsk, and other  industrial cities servicing the military-industrial complex.    The SNEK is for conversion and the switch of the  military-industrial complex to service of the Republic's  economy, the formation on this basis of technology and science  parks and engineering-research centers and the preservation and  multiplication of the existing scientific and technological and  personnel potential, preservation of the technopolises that have  evolved, and the high moral and material status of the highly  skilled engineering-technical personnel and specialists.    The SNEK advocates the formation of a self-sufficient  domestic market and reduced technological and commodity  dependence on monopolists, which individual countries have  become following the disintegration of the USSR as a result of  the uneven location of the productive forces on the territory of  the former Union republics.    Integration in the world economy is a decisive condition of  the creation of an efficiently operating economic system. For  this reason the SNEK advocates in the sphere of foreign economic  policy the continued simplification and liberalization of the  conditions of the attraction of foreign capital to the economy  of the Republic within limits determined by the interests of  assurance of its economic security. In order for foreign capital  to have an interest in investing in Kazakhstan's economy it is  essential to create precise legal guarantees for the protection  of foreign investments.  <H5>  III. Social Policy </H5>   The SNEK advocates social partnership and the creation of  the  traditions and institutions of partner relations between the  state and the citizen and employer and employee. The SNEK is for  the resolution of problems that arise by way of civilized  dialogue which prevents an increase in social tension. It is  necessary to use the available potential of social policy itself  for harmonization of the interests of different social groups.  In addition, we consider necessary the creation of arbitral  organizations which defend the interests of the contracting  parties. The Union is for collective contracts and collective  agreements concluded annually at all levels among the  government, the employers, and the working people. The SNEK is  for the enactment of the corresponding law.    The entire system of social protection of the population at  the present stage of the development of the Republic of  Kazakhstan should be geared to a halt to the process of decline  in people's living standard and the creation of the conditions  for an upturn in the latter. For this the SNEK considers it  essential to revise the entire state ideology of social  protection and the attitude toward it as something secondary.  The new model of social policy, which the SNEK will champion,  presupposes implementation of the following measures:    the balanced economic and social development of the cities  and regions;    the decisive surmounting of the residual principle of  investment in the social sphere;    substitution of the formulation of major priority strategic  goals and the solution of fundamental social problems for the  customary practice of "patching up holes" and "putting out  social fires" (stoppages, strikes and so forth);    the concentration of attention and resources on the solution  of a limited number of questions reflecting society's "sore"  points;    renunciation of the overall impersonal format of the  accomplishment of social tasks on a Republic scale and a  differentiated approach to the social problems of town and  country, different regions, small and large cities, and  demographic and professional groups of the populace.    The SNEK believes that the formation and realization in  practice of a new model of social protection rejecting a  leveling and residual approach to the problem as a general  principle would be the basis on which the social orientation of  the economy could be achieved. The SNEK is for a fundamental  revision of the current principle, when the lot of the vast  majority of the people has been uniform poverty, and a thin  stratum of the elite which has monopolized the administration of  social life has satisfied its social requirements at a  relatively high level. We believe that it is essential to  radically change the organizational structures and sources of  funding of the nonproduction sphere (health care, education,  pensions, and housing and municipal services) and to reform the  system of distribution of income as a whole. Personal income  should be regulated via the system of taxation and other  economic regulators. The SNEK is for the development of diverse  systems of insurance as supplementary channels of social  protection.    The SNEK believes that the number of "clients" of social  assistance should be sharply narrowed thanks to the provision of  all groups of the population with decent living conditions based  on active economic behavior and the formation of an effective  mechanism of social security and social insurance. The SNEK is  for each person being accorded economic freedom of the  individual and for the creation of incentives to labor for the  economically active population. All channels of the stimulation  of economic behavior and the encouragement of personal economic  initiative should be engaged.    The SNEK will support social safeguards in respect to  unemployment and the creation of a national fund for assistance  to the unemployed, the handicapped, the poor, and orphans. The  SNEK proposes conversion of the system of social protection in  the following areas:    a ban on a freeze on wages for low-income categories of  employees, the publicly funded categories primarily;    the immediate introduction of an officially established  poverty threshold determined by the minimum consumer basket and  its regular indexation (with regard for the real rate of  inflation, not less than quarterly);    government guarantees of the social security of the citizen  and the establishment of the strict specificity of social  support, when it is channeled to those who cannot provide for  themselves and their families;    a streamlining of the system of social protection, the  elimination of unjustified payments, and differentiation of the  payable benefits;    the creation of an integrated system of guarantees of social  protection at all levels of the Republic, oblasts, rayons,  enterprises, and plant outfits;    a combination of the state system of social protection with  mechanisms of social security at the enterprises;  decentralization of the funding of social programs thanks to a  shift in the center of gravity to nonstate structures and also  to local organs of administration and the enterprises;    compensation for loss of wages, pensions, allowances, and  grants from inflation and an increase in the price of consumer  goods and services which make up the subsistence minimum; the  adoption of measures for the practical realization of and  unswerving compliance with laws adopted previously: "On  Indexation of Monetary Income With Regard for the Increase in  the Price of Consumer Goods and Services," "On Protection of the  Rights of Consumers," "On the Minimum Consumer Budget," and  others; the introduction of indexation of the minimum wage;    increased social assistance for needy citizens who have lost  their jobs as a consequence of the reorganization of production  and reductions in personnel;    the accelerated development of the system of social  safeguards in the sphere of the minimum wage, pensions,  allowances, payments and benefits, and the right to work and  free education and medical services.    The Union recognizes the priority of the legitimate  interests  of the citizens over the interests of manufacturers and vendors.  The SNEK believes that protection of the consumer against  dangers to his life and health is an urgent task and advocates  the implementation by the organs of state power and  administration of efficient measures connected with the  protection of the personal rights of the consumers in terms of  their provision with high-quality commodities, jobs, and  services.    In the sphere of employment policy the SNEK will strive to  minimize the level of unemployment thanks to the development of  jobs and contribute to the employment of and support for  employees laid off in the course of the structural  reorganization of the economy and the transition to market  relations. Particular attention will be paid to state programs  of the employment and retraining of citizens laid off from their  former jobs. This should, of course, be undertaken by the state  with the assistance of a specially created network of courses of  instruction, schools, and so forth. Provision should be made for  tax and other privileges here for enterprises providing for the  reorientation of laid-off employees and securing a growth of  productivity.    The SNEK will promote the organization of the vocational  education of the youth, the creation of jobs for specialists,  and privileges for them in the construction of housing and the  priority promotion of enterprising people to elective  production-management positions. It is essential to pay more  attention to the social problems of the youth and to stimulate  young people's entrepreneurial activity.    The position of retirees has been distorted for many years.  "Old people are held in respect with us everywhere"--this myth  was taken to be the reality. The attitude toward them as  dependents determined the fallaciousness of the direction of  development of the pension system. The fact that the appointed  pension is fixed and does not take account of the increase in  the cost of living is a serious shortcoming. It is necessary,  therefore, to index the pensions depending on the growth of the  consumer price index and the increase in the minimum wage in the  national economy. Provision should be made for the guaranteed  purchase by retirees, mothers of large families, and so forth of  dairy, meat, and bread products and baby food at fixed official  prices.    All the above-mentioned types of safeguards should be  realized at all enterprises, regardless of forms of ownership.  In addition, the SNEK considers essential the elaboration and  adoption of a law guaranteeing social protection at private  enterprises.    The SNEK believes that government support for science,  education, and culture is essential and that they should be  accorded tax privileges. The opening of public and private  educational institutions is encouraged. The Union advocates  autonomy for the higher educational institutions and a  broadening of the rights of student self-government. The SNEK is  for a cardinal reform of education in the countryside, an  increase in government appropriations for the development of the  physical plant of the rural schools, and a rise in the  professional level and prestige of the teacher. We believe that  basic research should be funded by the state.    The Union advocates the creation of conditions conducive to  the dynamic progress of all branches of learning and the  concentration of personnel and material and financial resources  in the most promising areas designed to accelerate the  achievement of economic and social aims and the spiritual  development of society.  <H5>  IV. Nationality Policy </H5>   The SNEK proceeds in its nationality policy from the fact  that Kazakhstan represents a complex, multinational society. The  experience of mononational countries does not work in our case,  therefore. In all countries that have achieved independence the  national movement has performed and will continue to perform a  tremendous role. But two models of the defense of national  interest are possible. The first is based on a radical and most  rapid change in the balance of interests in favor of one's own  nation, which is fraught with conflicts. The second is based on  evolutionary development with the equality of all nationalities  and ethnic groups and the achievement of harmony, with  recognition of the fact that on certain issues the Kazakh  nation, by virtue of the fact that Kazakhstan is the sole  statehood for Kazakhs, has priority. Considering that ethnic  social conflicts could be an impediment to the development of  all nations, we opt for the second path of development. This  means that the Union is opposed in principle to the substitution  for one negative form of the political mobilization of the  masses of another, that is, replacement of the "socialist"  principle of mass support by the "national" principle and the  substitution for class diktat of national diktat.    The Union will seek the formation of the conditions for the  unhindered realization of the creative potential of each  nationality and ethnic group, the full-fledged development of  their national cultures, language, customs, and traditions, the  preservation and development of folklore, and support for the  ethnical and rational principles in the systems of national  education as a part of general pedagogics.    The Union will struggle actively against all manifestations  of national exclusiveness, nationalism, and chauvinism.    The Union will not accept any forms of national enmity and  is  opposed to national-radical methods in policy and supports the  resolution of internation, religious, and other contradictions  and conflicts by measures based on mutual respect and national  and religious tolerance.    The SNEK is for observance of the rights of man, nations,  and  ethnic groups recognized by the world community and for national  minorities being afforded equal opportunities for the  preservation and development of ethnic, linguistic, and  religious distinctiveness without any discrimination.    The SNEK advocates state support for national-cultural  centers-cum-organizational structures adequately expressing  specific requirements of the nationalities constituting the  people of Kazakhstan. National-cultural centers, in the SNEK's  view, are concentrated forms of the expression of national  distinctiveness and ethnic self-awareness and an important  institution of the incipient civil society in polyethnic  Kazakhstan making it possible to conduct a dialogue between the  nations in a spirit of national mutual understanding and mutual  respect. State support for the national-cultural centers is a  principal method of development of the national cultures and  contributes to the achievement of actual stability as an  essential condition of the resolution of national and  internation problems and the achievement of civic peace and  internation harmony.    The formation of real conditions for the full-fledged  development of the national cultures of all nationalities of the  Republic without exception ensuring the political stability of  polyethnic Kazakhstan is the basis for the conception of Kazakh  patriotism, a sense by the representatives of all nationalities  of involvement in the historical destiny of their  motherland--the Republic of Kazakhstan--and assertive action for  its modernization and prosperity.    The SNEK supports the state self-determination of the Kazakh  nation and its continued infusion with real content, which is a  most important factor of the consolidation of both the Kazakh  nation itself and all of Kazakhstani society. The unity of the  Kazakh people and their increased democratic potential in the  political life of the Republic is not only their own concern but  also that of the other nationalities of our country since the  former's political, cultural, economic, and moral health as the  biggest ethnic entity in the state is an important stabilizing  factor in the integration of Kazakhstani society for the  accomplishment of the tasks of the modernization of Kazakhstan  and the building of a democratic society based on the rule of  law. Internation solidarity with the Kazakh people and an  understanding of their problems is important here also. On the  other hand, the activity of the Kazakh people on the development  of their statehood, language, and culture should be determined  by the level of development of national duty, national  obligation, and national conscience understood as a moral  imperative before the other nationalities. Without moral  responsibility and dignity the building of national statehood by  the Kazakh people becomes national egotism transforming national  statehood into an ethnocratic society, the result of which would  be the irreversible disintegration of polyethnic Kazakhstan and  the loss of national statehood itself. Such a thing is, of  course, impermissible both from the standpoints of the essential  interests of the Kazakh nation itself and of the other  nationalities constituting the people of Kazakhstan. For this  reason solidarity between the nationalities of Kazakhstani  society should be a principle of community life and a most  important factor of the integration of our polyethnic state  given by history and the fatherland common to all of us.    The SNEK believes that a practicable method of overcoming  internation conflicts consists not of political confrontation,  which could drag on for decades, but of entirely different  mechanisms.    The first consists of the creation of a new economic  environment. Continued economic crisis would lead to a growth of  political tension and increased unemployment, particularly among  the youth. Without the creation of a strong private-enterprise  sector it will be impossible to overcome the crisis on the labor  market and ensure a sufficiently high level of unemployment.    The second mechanism is the creation of the conditions for  gradual cultural integration. The relationship of the main  national community and the related national communities  affiliated to it is at this stage in many aspects not at the  "intercourse" level, when there is a mutual exchange of cultural  content, but is characterized by the phase of the "circulation"  of cultural content within each national culture. It is  essential to achieve mutual integration. With the practically  universal knowledge of Russian the integrating functions of  Kazakh are manifestly insufficient. The SNEK views this problem  from the viewpoint of integrating, unifying functions. The  Kazakh language and culture should be a powerful factor of the  integration of all Kazakhstanis. This would in itself do away  with a mass of political problems. It is the strategic line to  which our Union adheres. But we are emphatically opposed to  bureaucratic arbitrary action implanting its methods of  imposition of the Kazakh language without regard for the actual  situation and by way of artificial acceleration.    The third mechanism is connected with the prevention of  internation conflicts. We are talking about a combination of  three factors: a truly scientific study of national relations,  the pressure of public opinion on these relations and mechanisms  of the emergency response to internation conflicts. As distinct  from the sham or emotional approach to internation problems in  Kazakhstan, the Union is oriented toward the systematic dialogue  of different groups and viewpoints, an objective analysis of the  causes of internation conflicts, and the active use of the mass  media not for inciting nationalism and chauvinism but for a  constructive escape from the crisis situations. The Union is  oriented also toward the objective coverage of internation  relations in Kazakhstan on the part of foreign media. The SNEK  is oriented toward cooperation with both national and foreign  mass media for the curtailment of provocative and negative  influences on the public consciousness in the plane of  internation relations.  <H5>  V. Foreign Policy Reference Points </H5>   The SNEK believes that the main purpose of foreign policy  should be all-around support for international stability and  Kazakhstan's security for the evolutionary development of  domestic reforms.    The SNEK supports the peace-making efforts of the Republic's  leadership in respect to a settlement of conflicts in the CIS.  The SNEK understands that the threat to peace today arises from  local conflicts. For this reason the Union deems it necessary to  find and adopt solutions before they have begun to escalate and  involve third countries.    For preventing an escalation of tension in Central Asia the  SNEK advocates:    a process of negotiations between states on problems that  arise;    states' freedom of choice of their particular path of  political and socioeconomic development;    unswerving observance of the principle of noninterference in  one another's internal affairs;    common sense in foreign policy.    The SNEK believes that the Republic should continue to  support the inviolability of borders and the right to the  defense of sovereignty of each state, of new countries  particularly. The diversion into a struggle for a recarving of  borders, the tearing away of territories, and internal conflicts  are not only causing enormous losses economically but also,  which is far more tragic, numerous human casualties. A gradual  normalization of relations based on simple and comprehensible  principles would ensure the free development of all countries of  the region.    The SNEK supports Kazakhstan's breakthrough into the world  community. Membership of the United Nations and other  international organizations is creating the conditions for  realization of the reforms. But we are opposed to imposition of  development models on the Republic. We understand that  principles that have been worked out over many centuries are not  always applicable under qualitatively different conditions. No  state and no society can become something new immediately.    The SNEK is opposed to:    a solution of international problems by the power method;    a disregard for the interests of the developing and new  states by the big powers;    the use of force on international issues;    interference in a state's internal affairs;    the imposition of various models of development on the new  states, however attractive they may be;    wars bringing ruin and innumerable casualties.    For the realization of these propositions in the sphere of  foreign policy it is essential:    to perform active work; understand that pressure could be  fatal and just as harmful as a mistaken policy;    to recognize and abide strictly by commitments that have  been  assumed and to display a prudent patience and understanding;    to establish in relations the principle of observance of  noninterference in one another's internal affairs;    to devise an international system of the early detection of  conflicts and of preventive diplomacy.    For contacts between the democratic forces of various  countries of the region the SNEK considers essential the  extensive development of the cooperation of center parties and  movements in the CIS. Today the policy of centrism is a  foundation of a settlement of the domestic political situation  and the stabilization of international relations. The exchange  of experience, joint consultations, and the coordination of  common efforts in support of reforms are an important supplement  to the processes of democratization in all countries.    The SNEK proposes the elaboration and discussion of a  concept  of the foreign policy and a concept of the defense of the  Republic of Kazakhstan which include the following points:    the foreign policy of Kazakhstan should ensure guarantees of  international stability and internation accord for the pursuit  of reform policy and the achievement of the Republic's economic  independence;    a policy of common sense in relations with our immediate  neighbors and the pursuit of an active, pragmatic foreign policy  aimed at the most extensive participation possible in the  settlement of conflicts and the establishment of equal, mutually  beneficial economic and political relations;    assurance of the unity of domestic and foreign policy;  mobilization of the efforts of economic policy for the country's  incorporation in the international division of labor and an  acceleration of economic innovations in the economic system of  Kazakhstan;    the use of participation in international organizations to  attract the resources of other countries for a solution of  domestic problems.    Foreign policy is directly connected with the domestic  situation. In this connection the SNEK believes that the  assurance of domestic stability and security is a key component  of the problem of national security. The SNEK considers it  necessary to struggle to ensure that a threat to peace, our  neighbors, and the people of Kazakhstan themselves not arise on  our own territory.    The SNEK believes that there should be a solution to our  problems not so much thanks to assistance from outside as thanks  to the mobilization of internal possibilities. Kazakhstan has a  base sufficiently well prepared for the introduction of modern  equipment and technology. But it is by no means necessary for  this to follow the lead of some state or group of states.  Kazakhstan should not have a one-sided foreign policy  orientation. We have a single goal--peace and stability and  cooperation between countries and peoples. Each state and each  people should make their contribution to this process.</p>

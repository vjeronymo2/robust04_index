			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Vocational qualifications have yet to come of age This year's school and college league tables are an important staging post in the evolution of vocational qualifications in the UK. The tables include statistics on achievement in vocational courses taken in England, supposedly signifying that the government means what it says about vocational courses enjoying 'parity of esteem' with traditional GCSEs and A-levels. The information presented on the success of schools and colleges with vocational courses is extremely skimpy, however. Whereas detailed 'point score' averages are given for GCSE and A-level candidates, only a bare figure for 'percentage of candidates achieving qualifications' is given for their vocational counterparts. The tables show the great majority of vocational candidates to be successful. At schools and colleges catering for post-16-year-old students, an average of 81 per cent of candidates achieved their vocational qualifications. A still more impressive 87.6 per cent of 15- and 16-year-olds taking vocational equivalents of GCSEs 'achieved all qualifications or units attempted'. That compares with 43.3 per cent of candidates passing five or more GCSEs at grades A to C. Such figures will fuel concerns voiced in recent official reports about the rigour and value of vocational qualifications. Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University, an authority on the vocational system, said: 'The problem is the existing philosophy of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications (the government agency responsible for vocational courses). Until now it has emphasised 'pass' or 'fail' as the criteria for assessment, not grading.' Prof Smithers believes that new assessment procedures, with greater emphasis on grading and external assessment and less on coursework, are 'essential if vocational courses are to live up to expectations and hold high status'. Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, said that 'much has been done to ensure suitable grading'. The new general national vocational qualifications (GNVQs) are awarded on the basis of three grades (pass, merit and distinction). However, the gradings do not appear in the league tables so the performance of schools and colleges cannot be compared. The tables highlight the extent to which vocational qualifications are the preserve of sixth-form and further-education colleges. According to Mr Hillier all post-16 colleges and 'half of all schools with sixth forms' are offering the new GNVQ courses. The tables show, however, that most of the schools that offer GNVQ courses are entering only a tiny fraction of their students for them, with most sticking to traditional A-levels. By contrast, most sixth-form and further-education colleges are entering more candidates for vocational courses than for A-levels. Swindon College in Wiltshire is a typical case, recording 219 candidates in their final year of study for post-16 vocational qualifications compared with 164 for A-levels. Earlier this month the Office for Standards in Education, the schools watchdog, urged an improvement in the design and assessment of GNVQs. It said that the rate of improvement since the piloting of the exams a year ago was 'far too slow'. Mr Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, highlighted the fact that external assessors did not check that different institutions used the same gradings when setting assessment, while the curriculum had not been defined with sufficient clarity. The government nonetheless remains intent on extending GNVQs further down the age range. GNVQs for 14-year-olds will be piloted in English and Welsh schools next year, with an assessment system which has been radically altered in response to attacks from inspectors. Schools already experienced in vocational education have been asked to tender for piloting courses in three subjects - business and finance, health and social care, and manufacturing - from September next year. Ministers want to pilot more courses in 1996 - including leisure and tourism, art and design, and science - and expand to include schools which have little experience of teaching vocational courses. The courses, to be known as GNVQ Part Ones, are expected to be offered to all secondary schools from September 1998. Each GNVQ will be equal to two GCSEs.</p>

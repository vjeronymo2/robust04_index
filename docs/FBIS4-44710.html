			<p>Downsizing   <F P=102>   94WS0331D Paris AFP SCIENCES in French 14 Apr 94 pp 13, 14 </F> <F P=103> 94WS0331D </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP SCIENCES </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO     [Text] Paris--The NH90 military helicopter program launched  by the Franco-German group Eurocopter "will be maintained" but  "downsized," announced the French minister of industry, foreign  trade, and postal services, Gerard Longuet, before the National  Assembly 13 April.    In reply to a deputy's question, Longuet said that "Defense  Minister Francois Leotard himself will present the extent" of  the scaleback, "which will in no way affect the activities of  the Marignane and Courneuve companies." "The export success and  civil potential of the helicopter--since it has transport  potential--will make it possible to support the project," in  Longuet's opinion. The minister described the program as an  "absolute duty," "both for its military users, the army and  navy, and for Eurocopter company."    Minister Longuet pointed out that the program was costing  France 4.7 billion French francs [Fr]. French orders for 220  helicopters (160 for the army, 60 for the navy) would probably  run up a bill of nearly Fr50 billion. The French market  represents 40 percent of Eurocopter's future workload.    The NH90 helicopter is being developed in partnership with  Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. The development contract  was signed in 1992. The 1995-2000 military appropriations bill,  which was recently submitted to the French head of state, favors  equipment under manufacture at the expense of programs under  study or development (prototype construction stage), such as the  NH90.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> INDIA CUTS DEFENSE OUTLAY  </P> <P> India's government has slashed defense spending and diverted funds to fight  hunger and illiteracy and provide housing for the homeless. The unprecedented  reduction in defense spending was contained in the government's budget for  1989-90, introduced in Parliament by Finance Minister S. B. Chavan. India will  spend $133 million less on defense in the 1989-90 fiscal year compared to the  previous year, Chavan said. He pledged to spend $1.1 billion on aid for hunger,  illiteracy and the homeless, an increase of $333 million from last year. The  added funds for social programs will be raised directly from taxing the  upper-middle classes, including an 8% surcharge on annual incomes of more than  $3,300.  </P></p>

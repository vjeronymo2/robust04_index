			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Leading Article: A manifesto for business The government's long-awaited white paper on competitiveness will seriously disappoint those expecting original insights into the factors underlying the country's industrial performance or radical innovations in policy. Indeed, much of it reads like a self-justifying compilation of measures already in place or planned, and one which fails to counter the anxieties recently expressed by, among others, the Commons trade and industry committee. As such, it is likely to be dismissed by many, including some on the government benches, as a damp squib. However, the document is not without merit. First, it is pleasing that ministers recognise that their separate departmental actions affect a wide range of business activities and have sought to draw up an audit of their impact. Quite how the government intends to achieve the necessary co-ordination across Whitehall over the longer term is less clear. The Treasury, in particular, is often rightly accused of ignoring the impact of its policies on business and wealth creation. Secondly, the document is to be commended for what it does not say. It wisely eschews big new spending on industrial support. It also steers clear of sectoral intervention and picking winners. It is encouraging that the government now appears to accept that these approaches offer no solutions, but more often create problems by retarding essential adjustment. In reality, that acceptance has been imposed by circumstance. Any temptation to embark on a big spending spree is constrained by the budget deficit and the government's commitment to maintaining stable macro-economic policies. Likewise, scope for action is circumscribed by the shift to Brussels of control over trade policy, public procurement rules and, increasingly, competition policy. Without these weapons, the arsenal of classic interventionism which some ministers enjoy promising their political followers is largely denuded. Mild dirigisme The other limiting factor is the wide spread of opinions within the government's own ranks. These range from advocacy of mild dirigisme to heavy reliance on deregulation. Read as a political manifesto, which it is in part, the white paper is an attempt to bridge these two extremes. Inevitably, that has produced a minimalist result, marked more by laundry lists of unexceptionable proposals than by truly innovative thinking. That said, what prescriptions does the white paper have to offer? Most concern small business and education and training. In the former area, the proposal to encourage faster payment of bills, initially by insisting on more disclosure, is welcome. Increased emphasis on advisory services will be good news for consultants, though it is unclear how far it meets small firms' actual needs. But at least, this type of support seems unlikely to do much harm. The white paper correctly recognises the central importance of education and training in raising skill levels. Much remains to be done in delivering on government initiatives such as the reform of the national curriculum and the introduction of new vocational qualifications. One priority rightly identified is the need to tackle the shortcomings of GNVQs, the new vocational qualifications widely criticised for their lack of rigour. Learning credits There are some new proposals on training, notably the extension of the 'modern apprenticeship' scheme to all 18-19 year olds. This welcome move shows that the government has listened to constructive comments on its earlier plans. Much more radical is the idea of learning credits, vouchers that would allow young people to make their own choices in education and training after school. Credits would keep schools, colleges and other providers of education and training on their toes. And they would boost parity of esteem between academic, technical and vocational education by providing the same form of finance for each. The government should press ahead with its promised study of the potential for credits, and mount pilot schemes. However, it is regrettable that more has not been done to strengthen the role of Training and Enterprise Councils in education and training. Mergers between Tecs and chambers of commerce are now permitted, and the developing network of one-stop shops will help to strengthen their position. But to acquire the strength of German chambers, they need clearer strategic purpose and more financial and operational independence from government. The most positive achievement of the white paper is that it sets out clearly the government's thinking on industrial policy and wealth creation. At a time of mounting debate on these issues, business and the public needs to know where it stands. The result falls far short of being a 'blueprint for industrial success', as some ministers suggest. That is an implausible claim for any government to make, above all one which has held office for 15 years. Like a blueprint, however, the effectiveness of the measures set out yesterday will hinge as much on their execution as on their design. The government's priority must be to press ahead firmly with implementation, above all in the field of training and education.</p>

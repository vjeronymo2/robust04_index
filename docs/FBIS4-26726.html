Li Xuebin, chief procurator of the provincial  People's Procuratorate, made a report on the situation of  investigating and handling big and important economic cases in  the whole province. On the basis of summing up experiences,  arrangements were made at the meeting for the anticorruption  struggle in the future.    In his speech, Song Zhaosu said: At present, the  anticorruption struggle in our province is progressing  healthily. However, there is still a gap between what we have  done and the demand of the masses and the CPC Central Committee.  We must increase the number of cases handled, and focus our  main efforts on investigating and handling cases like  corruption, bribery, financial defrauding, smuggling, severe  violations of financial and economic disciplines, and others.  We must continue to direct the spearhead of the attack at  judicial, law enforcement, and economic administration  departments. Investigating and handling cases involving  economic crimes of leading cadres at and above the county level  must be treated as our top priority task to create a good  environment for economic construction in our province.    Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun made an important  speech. He said: In the new historical period, we must consider  the anticorruption struggle from the high plane of the life and  death of the ruling party. We must hold high the two banners of  reform, enriching the people and opposing corruption, advocating  cleanness and honesty. We must be firm and unshakable in taking  economic construction as our center, so that our country will  become strong and powerful and the masses rich as soon as  possible. We must be firm and unshakable in strengthening the  practice of cleanness and honesty and carrying out the  anticorruption struggle.    Li stressed: It is necessary to make an overall plan to  completely fulfill the following three anticorruption tasks. 1)  We must concentrate our efforts on and give prominence to major  cases. We must increase investigation and handling of big and  important cases to boost the confidence of the masses in our  anticorruption struggle. 2) We must do well the work of  dealing with special cases to severely punish cadres those who  violate the regulations to buy private cars, are in arrears with  public funds thus harming our finances, and so on. 3) Cadres  must be clean and honest and exercise self-discipline. In this  connection, CPC Committees at all levels must conscientiously  convene well democratic life meetings for the first half of the  year and formulate and improve rules and regulations to further  standardize leading cadres' behavior.    Li Changchun also urged making more efforts to educate  cadres  and strengthen leadership over anticorruption work, so that our  anticorruption struggle can be carried out in a sustained and  deep manner. He said: Making more efforts to educate cadres is  a fundamental and important measures for forging closer  party-masses and cadres-masses relations and preventing the  occurrence of corrupt phenomenon. Education must be profoundly  conducted among the broad masses of cadres to learn from the  spirit of the people in Linxian County to work hard to do  pioneering work, carry forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu by  serving the people wholeheartedly, and make selfless devotion  [words indistinct]. It is necessary to improve ideological and  work styles of leading bodies at all levels. It is necessary to  implement a responsibility system regarding party style and  clean and honest government administration. Work at each level  must be administered and supervised by its immediate higher  authorities. Under the unified leadership of CPC Committees at  all levels, the anticorruption struggle must be carried out in  an organized and guided way. CPC Committees at all levels must  put the anticorruption struggle in an important place on the  work agenda. They must listen to the recent anticorruption work  report and take new measure for promoting the struggle. The  anticorruption struggle must be conducted closely around the  central task of seizing the favorable opportunity, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and  stabilizing the general situation. As far as specific links are  concerned, the anticorruption struggle must be subjected to  economic construction aimed at benefiting reform, opening up,  and economic development.

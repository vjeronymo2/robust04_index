			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Supermarkets win Costco challenge go-ahead A HIGH COURT judge yesterday granted Britain's three largest supermarket chains the right to an early hearing of their legal attempt to stop Costco, a US-owned warehouse club, opening its first UK outlet in Thurrock, Essex. The ruling, by Mr Justice Brooke, came as another council, Hertsmere in Hertfordshire, approved in principle an application by Costco to open a second outlet at Bushey, Hertfordshire. J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway are jointly opposing the decision last May by Thurrock Council to award Costco planning permission for a warehouse as a wholesale operation and not as a retailer. Costco, which plans to sell goods ranging from baked beans to car tyres at deeply discounted prices, says it is not a retailer because it will sell only to club members. But the supermarkets say Costco should be subject to planning rules similar to those on retailers. The supermarkets' legal challenge had not been expected to be heard for at least 18 months, well after the planned opening of the Thurrock warehouse in late November. Although Mr Justice Brooke set no date for a hearing he said it was 'in the public interest' for the issues raised to be settled quickly. He also denied Costco leave to appeal against his decision and awarded costs against the company. The hearing will be watched by many retailers as a test case with important implications for competition in the industry. The supermarkets, which have invested large sums in superstores, fear Costco and other warehouse clubs would have an unfair advantage if they were not required to operate from scarce and expensive retail sites. Hertsmere council has agreed to authorise the construction of a Costco warehouse on a non-retail site provided the company signs a legal agreement restricting the range of products it sells. The three supermarkets said they would not challenge the planned agreement if they judged it to be sufficiently restrictive. Since Thurrock granted Costco planning permission the department has issued planning guidelines which advise local authorities to treat warehouse clubs in the same way as retail outlets. ASDA supermarket workers have voted overwhelmingly against strike action and have accepted a 2 per cent pay increase. Nearly 69 per cent of the 35,270 staff in the postal ballot responded - an exceptionally high return, according to the GMB general union which organised it.</p>

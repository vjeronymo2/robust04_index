The scientific breakthrough, scored by the Benxi Iron and  Steel Company in northeast China's Liaoning Province, is claimed  to have reduced the contents of phosphorus, sulphur and carbon,  all detrimental to the quality of steel, to far below the  international standards.    Sponge iron is an important material for various high-grade  alloy steel used in military, aerospace, petrochemical and other  key industries.    Currently sponge iron production worldwide is powered by  either natural gas or coal, a method characterized by  complicated techniques and high costs.    According to specialists at the benxi iron and steel  company,  the new method is simpler and costs less.    The specialists also discovered that the iron ore in a local  open mine has a very low content of phosphorus, sulphur and  other harmful elements, and therefore is the best raw material  for the production of good quality sponge iron.</p>

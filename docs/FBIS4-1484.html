			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa; place and </F> date not given -- recorded]    [Text] We wish to put it on record that the ANC has  received extensive reports of violations of the electoral laws,  electoral regulations, and the Code of Conduct in some parts of  the province of KwaZulu-Natal. We are filing with the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] a detailed complaint of a  series of such violation by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and  its supporters. This is particularly rife in parts of Northern  Natal and the Midlands. A list of such incidents will be made  available to you later, but I will refer to it.    Evidence at hand already indicates the following violations  amongst others: The removal of ballot boxes from polling  stations by IFP supporters, the transfer of IEC voting material  to pirate polling stations established by IFP supporters,  threats against the IEC officers as well as the expulsion of ANC  party agents from polling stations, and the lack of secrecy in  polling booths where voters are coerced into voting for the IFP.    When our people went to the polls they knew that the days of  voting would span from 26-28 April. A large number of our  people have turned up at the polls in a very enthusiastic manner  and we believe that, yesterday, many of our people streamed to  the polls and despite all the other problems that were  experienced, were able to cast their votes. The declaration of  the 28th as a public holiday, in our view, has enhanced the  volumes that will also go to the polls today. The measures that  had been taken by the IEC to make sure that voting material is  delivered to the polling station has also enhanced the voting  process. We do not, as a result, at this stage believe that it  is necessary to extend voting beyond the official date.    The IEC is also on record as having said they are willing  and  prepared to extend the hours of voting, meaning that polling  stations do not necessarily have to close at 7PM. I am able to  say that many polling stations across the country yesterday  closed way beyond 7PM, thus allowing many of our people to vote.  The same should happen today, but we do not believe that it is  necessary for the day -- or another day to be added to the days  of voting as we believe that many people are going to vote today  and indeed many people did vote yesterday.</p>

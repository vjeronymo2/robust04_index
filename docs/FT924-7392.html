			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Demand for offices in London increases THE AVAILABILITY of office space in central London has fallen significantly for the first time in five years, Debenham Tewson Research, chartered surveyors, said yesterday. It attributed the change largely to increased demand for new, centrally located offices by the financial sector. Supply and demand for office space are closer to balance than at any time since autumn 1987, when the impact of the construction boom had still to be felt. The amount of office space in central London that can be occupied immediately or within six months fell from 34.3m sq ft to 33.5m sq ft in the third quarter. That was because of a 27 per cent rise in the take-up of space from 2.6m sq ft to 3.3m sq ft, and a 6 per cent fall in the space coming on to the market from 4.5m sq ft to 4.2m sq ft. Availability in central locations fell 4 per cent to 24.3m sq ft while take-up rose nearly 40 per cent. On the fringes of London availability rose marginally, take-up fell by more than a fifth and the space coming on the market almost doubled. Although more than half the take-up was of newly built space, almost four-fifths of the space coming on the market was second-hand.

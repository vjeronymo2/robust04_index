			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD FIRES ITS SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> The school board in the nation's capital fired Supt. Andrew Jenkins, citing his  handling of the troubled school system.  </P> <P> The board voted to place Jenkins on 30 days administrative leave with pay and  terminate his contract on Dec. 30. Vice Supt. William Brown was named acting  superintendent. The superintendent narrowly escaped firing in July, when the  board decided to keep him on until his contract expired at the end of this  school year. The school system has been plagued by one of the highest dropout  rates in the nation, a declining enrollment and a shortage of funds.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Loans Have Nearly Reached a </F> Psychological Limit"]    [Text] Saleh Affif, coordinating minister for economics,  finance, and development supervision has reiterated the need to  seriously review Indonesia's foreign debts which have reached  U.S. $90 billion. He made the latest call at the opening of a  seminar on general mining in Jakarta on 6 April.    A serious review is needed considering that Indonesia's  foreign loans have nearly reached the threshold of a  psychological limit of U.S. $100 billion and which could have an  influence on the donor countries. This means that if the  foreign loans exceed the limit, then the donor nations will  reconsider giving Indonesia more loans. The amount will then be  reduced.    Minister Affif said the national economy did not experience  a  negative impact even though the country's foreign loans "should  have received serious attention." The indicator which was  presented was that the inflation rate was lower than last year,  the foreign exchange reserves have reached U.S. $12 billion and  could support imports for at least five months, the national  banking lending rates have returned to normal, and the  transactions deficit continues to decline.    During the 1993/94 fiscal year, the transactions deficit  stood at only U.S. $3 billion, or around two percent of the  Gross Domestic Product, GDP; while during the 1990/91 fiscal  year, the deficit stood at 3.7 percent. The ratio between the  transactions deficit with the GDP stood at two percent which was  considered a safe deficit level for any nation.    The amount of foreign loans cannot be used as a yardstick to  determine the seriousness of the national economic situation.  All will depend on the country's economic resources.    Indonesia is currently feeling the heavy burden of foreign  loans. Such a burden can be seen, for example, from the numerous  financial allocations it must set aside in every annual budget  to pay interest and repay foreign loans.    The financial allocations set aside for repaying foreign  loans are continuously increasing annually. For example, during  the 1994/95 fiscal year, 42 percent of the routine expenditure  will be allocated for repaying loans. It will be more  beneficial if such allocations are utilized for improving the  welfare of government employees or toward contributing to  allocations for development.    The heavy burden of repaying foreign loans does not  necessarily mean that the burden was caused by the increase in  loans. Another cause was the appreciation of foreign currency,  particularly the yen. The Japanese yen's rapid appreciation  against the U.S. dollar caused Indonesia to suffer a 40 percent  loss in foreign loans, particularly in yen currency. Finance  Minister Mar'ie Muhammad stated that "our debt burden is  increasing even when we are asleep."    First, attention should be directed toward the yen's  continuing appreciation which shows no signs of declining.  Japan's huge trade surplus with its major trading partners and  the deadlock in Japan-U.S. talks will definitely become  potential factors for the yen's appreciation.    More caution is needed in pursuing developments. There is a  need to scrutinize the management of foreign loans from time to  time.    Second, the business circle's commercial loans have  spiralled  in recent years. The loans taken by the private sector within a  brief period accounted for 40 percent of Indonesia's total  foreign loans.    It is very heartening if we view it from a different angle  because the business circle was successful in acquiring  financial resources on its own from international monetary  sources. But on the other hand, the loans they took were only  short-term with high interest rates. This further contributed  to the country's heavy burden of balance of payments for foreign  loans.    In this connection, it is only appropriate that the business  circle positively realizes the situation. The business circle  should practice self-restraint when taking out loans. They  should only apply for limited and affordable loans which can be  repaid, or loans for projects which can bring in foreign  exchange. All this would greatly contribute toward preventing  the national economy from being enmeshed in difficulties.    It is a fact that a drop of water will definitely not cause  a  catastrophe. But if a drop of water is added to a brimful glass  of water, then an overspill is unavoidable. It will be wise and  good if certain planned mega projects are temporarily shelved.    Serious attention is greatly needed on the question of  foreign debts. The danger a country faces is not from its  foreign debts, but more so from its supporting economic  capabilities. This can be observed through the country's  ability to bring in more foreign exchange through its exports.    People know that the debt service ratio [three preceding  words in English], DSR, has exceeded 30 percent. In fact, we  are concerned about the recent export developments.    First, non-oil exports are beginning to face competition  everywhere since its rapid growth over the last decade. Its  rapid climb is currently facing a slight decline.    Thus, we have exposed our export problem. In this  connection, we would like to point out the need to employ other  steps in trying to safeguard our exports and also to secure a  "safe level" due to foreign debts. Whether we like it or not,  this is the hurdle that we must overcome. Our national economy  will suffer if a unilateral step is taken regarding the  utilization of funds derived from long-term international loans.</p>

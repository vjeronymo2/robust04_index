			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> California's economy will again grow faster than the rest of the country in  1989, aggravating the state's transportation and housing problems, Bank of  America said in its annual state economic forecast. California's real gross  state product will grow 3.5% in 1989, said Frederick Cannon, vice president and  senior economist at the bank. Although that is slower than the 4.8% growth  expected in 1988 and the 6.2% growth in 1987, it will be 0.7% faster than the  U.S. real gross national product, Cannon said.  </P></p>

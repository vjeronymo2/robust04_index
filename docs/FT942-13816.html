			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at wool sales this week have held firm and in Australia the market indicator edged to a new high for the season. This was only one cent above the previous high when sales resumed after the Easter recess almost two weeks ago. However, progress on the upward trend has been extremely slow. Trading conditions in wool-using countries are very widely said to be dull, and Europe is suffering from very competitive pricing, some high stocks of semi-processed products, and a hesitant recovery from recession, where this can be identified at all. Currency factors have tended to push down prices in many wool-using countries, and sterling is buying more in dollar terms. The official Wool International market indicator closed the selling week at 574 cents a kg.</p>

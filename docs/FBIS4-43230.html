			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Purple' Coalition Agrees on 13 </F> Billion Guilders Savings"]    [Text] Negotiators for a `purple' coalition government  [comprising the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the Democrats  66, and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD)] have  reached agreement on savings of 13 billion guilders [G]. This  is clear from a list drawn up at the end of last week by the  three politicians who have been appointed by the Crown to assess  the feasibility of the coalition.    National budget cuts are set to produce savings of G6.9  billion. Depending on the interpretation, savings on social  security expenditure are to produce a further G5.8 to G6.1  billion. These are all savings on which the parties have  reached agreement. The parties are still seeking measures  through which the amount available for tax cuts and reducing the  public deficit would exceed this G13 billion mark.    The Central Planning Bureau calculated the proposals over  the  weekend. They include plans to increase jobs and boost  purchasing power. On the basis of these calculations the  negotiators will determine how high the total amount of savings  will be during the next term of government. All those involved  accept that conclusions will be reached this week together with  a final decision on whether or not a `purple' coalition is to be  formed.    Today the negotiators are discussing, among other things,  tax  cuts and how to finance them, together with employment  conditions in the public sector.    VVD leader Bolkestein described the negotiations this  afternoon as "important but not yet crucial." The parties are  still aiming to submit the government pact to the Second Chamber  for debate in mid- July.    PvdA [Labor Party], VVD, and D66 representatives are also  busy considering elements of a government pact outside the  social economic field. A total of eight policy areas have been  allocated that cover the full range of government activities.  These include the environment and planning, and security in  large towns.    At the CDA party council last Saturday [11 June], Brinkman  was critical of the fact that the negotiators are working on the  basis of excessively optimistic economic growth figures. "The  negotiators are apparently mesmerized by the unexpectedly  favorable economic growth," Brinkman says. "This is dangerous  at a time of continuing high unemployment and public debt and  this is why all the election programs cautiously counted on four  years with an average growth of 1.75 percent." The CDA leader  believes that the need for additional policy "is certainly true"  because otherwise in four years time there will be 815,000  unemployed and 850,000 people on disability benefit.</p>

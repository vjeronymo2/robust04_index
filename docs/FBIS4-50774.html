			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 KYODO -- North Korea on Friday [20  May] rejected demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) that it halt removal of spent fuel rods without proper  inspections at an experimental nuclear reactor 90 kilometers  north of Pyongyang.    North Korean Ambassador to China Chu Chang-chun told  reporters that a resolution of the issue would be conditioned on  resumption of bilateral talks with the United States, suspended  after two rounds last July.    "When the third round of talks between the DPRK (North  Korea)  and the U.S. are held and a package solution is realized, then  the agency (IAEA) can take the measurements at any time," he  said.    Earlier in the day, the IAEA confirmed that despite its  warnings, North Korea had started removing spent fuel rods from  its 5-megawatt experimental reactor without IAEA inspectors  present.    The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said it has sent a letter  to  North Korea, warning that further removal of the rods without  proper inspections would be a violation of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and safeguard agreements concluded  between North Korea and the IAEA.    The IAEA demanded the operations be suspended until  arrangements can be made to ensure the rods are properly marked  and separated for sampling.    The three IAEA inspectors now at the Yongbyon nuclear  complex  since Wednesday have not been allowed to take samples or make  tests on the spent rods.    The IAEA has insisted that the rods must be sorted and  examined to see whether plutonium has been diverted for a  nuclear weapons program.    Without the samples, the IAEA has said it will not be able  to  determine whether North Korea has complied with a nuclear  safeguards agreement.    The Vienna-based agency said it is preparing to dispatch  another delegation of experts to North Korea to discuss  safeguards measures.    U.S. officials have said that spent fuel currently being  withdrawn from the reactor could provide enough plutonium to  build four or five atomic bombs.    Refusal to comply with the IAEA's demands would also raise  the possibility the watchdog agency will refer the problem to  the U.N. Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions.    On Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton reacted cautiously  to reports that Pyongyang has begun removing spent fuel rods  without the presence of international inspectors.    "I want to know what the facts are, and when I do, then I  will make a more definite statement," he told reporters.    Clinton called it "an error" for North Korea to thwart IAEA  inspections after it had agreed to comply with them.    A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed regret  and concern Friday that North Korea has already begun removing  the rods in defiance of international demands not to do so.    Seoul also urged Pyongyang to immediately resume talks with  the IAEA to discuss matters of full compliance with their  nuclear safeguards agreement.    "South Korea will consult closely with allies about what  steps it will take, watching the result of talks between North  Korea and the IAEA," the spokesman said.    Meanwhile, Pyongyang's official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY  (KCNA) quoted North Korean President Kim Il-song as saying in a  recent interview, "we feel no need to develop nuclear weapons  and even if we were to manufacture one or two of them, they  would be useless."    North Korea insists its nuclear power program is only for  peaceful purposes, but refusal to comply with inspection demands  has aroused suspicions that it may be trying to build an atomic  bomb.    A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition  of anonymity, told reporters in Washington that the U.S. will  drop its "patient diplomacy" if Pyongyang is found to have  cheated on nuclear inspections.    "We're prepared to consider other options," he said, adding  that the U.S. sees an advantage in exhausting diplomatic means  to persuade the North Koreans to give up their alleged nuclear  development before applying sanctions.    The U.S. has indicated it would pursue economic sanctions  against Pyongyang through the United Nations or together with  Japan and South Korea if the nuclear program is not made more  transparent.    Pyongyang has said it would consider sanctions an act of  war.</p>

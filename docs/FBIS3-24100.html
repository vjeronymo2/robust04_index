			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "The French Are Ready To Re-equip Russia's Nuclear </F> Power Stations: Visit by the President of Groupe Schneider"]    [Text] The French industrial Groupe Schneider  yesterday signed protocols governing cooperation with Gazprom  and with the Rosenergoatom concern of Minatomenergo [Ministry of  Atomic Energy]. Scheduled to occur simultaneously with these  events was the visit to Moscow by Didie Pineau-Valencienne,  president of Groupe Schneider. The signed agreements can be  evaluated as the beginning of large-scale Russo-French  cooperation in the area of nuclear power engineering and the  transporting of petroleum and gas.    [Editorial note] Groupe Schneider is one of the world  leaders in the area of developing and producing electrical-power  engineering units and systems for monitoring production cycles  and distributing electrical power. It includes 180 industrial  enterprises and has representations on 130 countries. Its annual  turnover exceeds 61 billion francs. Cooperation with Russian  entrepreneurs began in the 1880's with the construction of  bridges in St. Petersburg. Schneider also delivered equipment  for KamAZ, GAZ, ZIL, and a number of enterprises in the chemical  industry.    The cooperation protocol signed by the Schneider president  and by Erik Pozdyshev, president of the Rosenergoatom concern,  stipulates the modernization of the control and protection  system at the Kola AES within the framework of the program for  technical assistance to the CIS countries, which is being  implemented by the European Economic Community (TACIS). Other  projects that have been planned are the Kalinin AES  (modernization of the medium- and low-voltage distribution  devices), as well as the Balakovo and Smolensk AES, where work  will be done to improve the physical protection. It is planned  to finance the projects along EEC lines. Commenting on this  agreement, M. Pineau-Valencienne remarked that in France 75  percent of the electrical energy is produced by nuclear  electrical-power stations, and, from the ecological point of  view, nuclear power engineering, provided that a reliable safety  system is functioning, meets the highest requirements.    In accordance with the cooperation protocol between  Schneider  and Gazprom, it is planned to carry out operations to modernize  the electrical equipment at the compressor stations of  practically all the existing Russian petroleum and gas  pipelines. Answering a question asked by a KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent concerning the prospects for a resultant increase  in the exportation of Russian gas to France, the Schneider  president confirmed this possibility as a result of the  reduction of shipments from Algeria.    Touching upon the Groupe Schneider strategy in the Russian  market, M. Pineau-Valencienne commented that its basic positions  would be cooperation in guaranteeing the safety of Russia's  existing nuclear electrical-power stations, systems for  automatic control and monitoring of the operation of AES, and  the modernization of Russian petroleum and gas pipelines with  Schneider electrical equipment. The industrial group's sphere of  interests also includes the exchanging of progressive  technologies, the production of individual types of French  equipment at Russian enterprises, and the training of Russian  personnel.    KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts remark that the visit by the  president of Groupe Schneider may encourage competition among  the leading Western concerns to obtain production orders in the  field of transporting gas and modernizing Russian AES.</p>

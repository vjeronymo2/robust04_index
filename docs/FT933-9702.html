			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Fun to be part of the mob - Julius Caesar at Stratford DAVID Thacker has followed up his revealing modern-dress city-slicker Merchant of Venice at the big Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a modern-dress Julius Caesar at the Other Place. This time, he means the revelation to lie in the way we watch it. So his production occurs in promenade style. The downstairs audience moves around from scene to scene, as the actors keep using different parts of the space. (There are some reserved seats in the balcony.) There is a certain buzz to be had from, say, sitting cross-legged at the foot of Caesar's desk while Calphurnia gulps his Scotch to calm her superstitious fears. To find yourself standing a mere yard from the assassins as they roll up their shirt-sleeves and bathe their arms in Caesar's blood is as nicely horrid as you can suppose. Obviously the big pay-off occurs with 'Friends, Romans, countrymen,' that triumph of demagoguery, when it is fun to be part of the mob that Antony is manipulating from his pulpit - and, later, to encircle him as he reveals Caesar's corpse. This highly political play really seems to be nearer than your doorstep. But the illusion of participating in history sags later. During the final battle, you squat or shuffle or slouch. The smoke, stink and machine-gunfire that are the battle of Philippi are never threatening. Still, Thacker's approach might reap dividends throughout - if only he had chosen the right actors. I guess he is trying to shake up our preconceptions about the four leading roles, but what is he driving at? And why has he chosen an Antony (Barry Lynch) with a much more 'lean and hungry look' than his Cassius (Rob Edwards)? (When Caesar remarks on Cassius's leanness to Antony, the latter is in running shorts in mid-audience, so there is no missing this.) The big error, however, is the Brutus. Can you believe that 'the noblest Roman of them all' conspires Caesar's death with his hands in his pockets? Jeffery Kissoon, for all his vocal and physical prowess, misfires in every way. No stoicism, no inwardness, no integrity. He is shifty in council, smarmy with Caesar; and he misses the sudden mid-scene rushes of tenderness with Portia, Cassius or Volumnius. As when playing Shakespeare elsewhere, he applies a barking marcato to key syllables, mumbles minor ones, and throbs out a rapid tremolo on big words, faking a lyricism that is not in his vein. Everyone else in the cast acts more naturally - though Tricia Kelly and Francesca Ryan are coarse in all the female roles. But both Cassius (Rob Edwards), when conspiring with Casca, and Antony (Barry Lynch), in his soliloquy above the corpse, also lack spontaneity: too much vocal technique, too schematically applied. Lynch is lightweight, a canny charmer, but he carries off the funeral demagoguery with easy assurance, mainly in that smouldering pianissimo that is the favourite weapon in his armoury. Edwards seems, when with Brutus, to attempt the republican nobility that this Brutus omits. He misses, however, Cassius's blend of fanaticism and cynicism. David Sumner's Caesar is a suave old fox, a smooth dictator, credible if not Colossal. Thacker makes his Rome a quasi-fascist police state, which makes it all the more frustrating that the dissident Brutus doesn't ring true. The battle fails to convince. The widow (Tricia Kelly) who wheels a corpse in a pram through the audience while maintaining a silent scream is the crudest thing I have seen in a long while. The play works fluently in the theatre - it always does. When I tell you, however, that the detail that lingers largest in my mind is Caesar taking a puff of Ventolin . . . Sponsored by English Estates. The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, until Sept 25</p>

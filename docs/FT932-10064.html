			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Doubtless Sir, Doubtless if, on the morning when BAT Industries' shares rose above Pounds 10, Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore (Letters, May 7), had got wind of the coming tobacco price war, he would not have sold whatever shares Gartmore may have had in that company, and would subsequently have written an explanatory letter to his clients about the unforeseen collapse in the share price.

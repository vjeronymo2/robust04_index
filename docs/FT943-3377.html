			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Eyecare Products Eyecare Products, the consumer goods maker formerly known as Kitty Little, reported reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 6,000 in the first half of 1994, against Pounds 54,000. The figures do not include any contribution from L'Amy, the French sunglasses and spectacles concern, acquired for FFr75.2m (Pounds 8.9m) last month. L'Amy made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 65,000) in the period, although these figures have not been adjusted for UK accounting standards. The company intends to focus resources on its core eyewear business and have therefore decided to divest its fragrance and beauty bags operations, which made a net loss of Pounds 154,000 (Pounds 77,000 profit) in the period. Group turnover grew from Pounds 2.48m to Pounds 2.79m. Earnings per share were 0.03p (0.53p) and an unchanged interim dividend of 0.5p has been declared.</p>

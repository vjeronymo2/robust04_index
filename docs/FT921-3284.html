			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rothschild expected to advise on sale of MGN NM ROTHSCHILD, the merchant bank, is expected to be appointed next week as adviser on the sale of Mirror Group Newspapers in the first indications of preparations for the disposal of the group. It is believed that the majority shareholding in MGN could be ready for sale by the summer, although no final timetable has been drawn up. Partners at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, who are acting as administrators to the private business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell, are expected to make a final decision on the appointment of advisers within the next few days. They are believed to be favouring Rothschild over a rival bid from Morgan Grenfell. The purchaser of MGN might not be able to take control until towards the end of the year as any sale may need ratification by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The administrators are believed to have received expressions of interest from at least ten potential purchasers. The sale of the principal UK businesses of AGB, the market research company from the administrators of the private empire of Robert Maxwell, to Addison Consultancy was completed yesterday. A rights issue offer document issued last month to raise money to buy the AGB businesses, showed that it was paying Pounds 14.75m. Sales of other AGB companies overseas are expected within the next few weeks.</p>

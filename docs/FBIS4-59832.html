			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq has informed the Arab League that the Saudi and  Kuwaiti rulers are continuing to provide facilities for U.S.,  British, and French aircraft to violate Iraqi airspace, which  seriously threatens Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national  unity.    In a letter he addressed yesterday to the Arab League  secretary general, Iraq's permanent representative to the Arab  League said that the aircraft violated Iraq's airspace 1-9 May  after taking off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. During  this period they carried out 355 hostile air sorties.    The Iraqi permanent representative attached to his letter a  list detailing these violations.</p>

As recently as July, Fritz Gerber, the 65-year-old chairman of both the drugs group Roche and of Zurich Insurance, let it be known he had no intention of retiring. Fast movers, these Swiss. Gerber has now decided he will cede the Zurich chair at the next agm to his chief executive Rolf Huppi. 'Things have their time,' is how he puts it these days. Perhaps he has decided to set an example to the rest of the grey beards cluttering the country's boardrooms? 'I am not a school teacher.' Gerber still claims to be staying put at Roche.

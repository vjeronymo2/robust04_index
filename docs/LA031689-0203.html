			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE DEPT. NOMINEE ASKED TO LIST HIS FORMER KISSINGER FIRM CLIENTS  </P> <P> President Bush's nominee for the No. 2 post at the State Department was asked  Wednesday to give the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a confidential list of  the clients of his former consulting firm, headed by former Secretary of State  Henry A. Kissinger.  </P> <P> The request by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) may delay the committee's vote on the  nominee, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a former undersecretary of state and  ambassador to Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> "I'd rather be safe than sorry . . . and right now, I don't know what the facts  are," Helms argued in asking for the list. The senator promised the list would  be held in confidence, saying: "I don't think anybody on this committee would  leak one word of this."  </P> <P> Eagleburger, a 30-year veteran of government service, told the committee he  would consult with his attorneys on Helms' request, made during the first day  of Eagleburger's confirmation hearing before the committee.  </P> <P> If the Senate does not act this week, the nomination could be delayed for  several weeks, since members begin a two-week Easter recess on Friday.  </P> <P> Eagleburger, who was queried by several members of the panel about his ties  with Kissinger's firm, told the committee he had provided the committee with a  list of the clients he had personally dealt with at the firm and a description  of his work for them in a "generic sense." But he said he was prevented from  disclosing additional information under the firm's confidentiality contract  with its clients.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Indications of changing demands THE NEW indices announced yesterday by the Financial Times, the International Stock Exchange and the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries resulted from an attempt to improve and extend the existing indices covering the UK market. A working party, including representatives from every sector of the investment community, was set up to consider these issues. It rapidly became clear that market participants were happy with the operation of the FT-SE 100 index, as the principal real-time index for UK stocks, and with the FT-A All-Share, the market's main end-of-day performance measurement benchmark. However they wanted to extend the approach taken by these indices in a number of ways: Mid-sized companies - There was a need for a definitive real-time index covering the next tier of companies below the FT-SE 100. The exact size of this group was the subject of much discussion, and some research among investment managers to establish their view on what a 'mid-sized' company meant. The committee settled on a tranche of 250 companies ranking immediately below the FT-SE 100 in size. These companies have market capitalisations in the region of between Pounds 150m and Pounds 1bn, based on share values at mid-year. The largest company in the FT-SE Mid 250 is Standard Chartered, with a capitalisation now of Pounds 1.1bn and the smallest is Newman Tonks, with a capitalisation of Pounds 120m. Real-time industry baskets - The FT-A All-Share provides detailed sector-by-sector breakdowns of performance at the end of each day, published the following morning in the FT on the page that carries the London Stock Market report. Until now, there has been no way to track the performance of industry sectors minute-by-minute or to attribute the relative performance of sectors to a particular news event. It would not have made sense, however, to base real-time industry baskets on the FT-SE 100, as the sector distribution of companies within the index is patchy. What was needed was a group of companies traded with sufficient frequency to make real-time prices meaningful and yet close enough in performance to the All-Share to make the industry baskets good intra-day substitutes for the end-of-day All-Share sectors. The obvious choice was a universe of 350 stocks, the FT-SE 100 plus the new FT-SE Mid 250. Baskets that mirror the sector classification of the All-Share will be calculated minute-by-minute on these companies. In time, derivative contracts (futures and options) may be established on some of the more interesting and active baskets. The FT will publish the hour-by-hour changes in some of the baskets, but the newspaper's principal sectoral breakdown will continue to be the end-of-day All-Share sub-indices. The FT-SE Actuaries 350, the group of stocks on which the industry baskets will be calculated, may also serve another purpose. It may come to be regarded as a 'liquid benchmark', the working definition of the universe of stocks to which most investors direct most of their attention. As the table shows, the FT-SE Actuaries 350 will cover 92 per cent of the total capitalisation of the UK stock market, a significant advance on the 72 per cent covered by the FT-SE 100. A larger FT-A All-Share - At its peak, over the last three decades, the All-Share has contained about 720 shares. Over time, takeovers and bankruptcies have reduced that number. It seemed time to establish whether the current size of 653 shares was the correct one. Despite its name, the All-Share has never attempted to cover all the more than 2,000 UK securities listed by the Stock Exchange. Instead it has focused on the 'investible universe', those shares in which there is a liquid enough market to allow the patient investor to accumulate a position over time, and to sell out gradually when it was time to take profits or cut losses. Investment managers indicated a desire to see a slightly higher proportion of the total market covered. From the end of the year the All-Share will be extended by roughly 200 shares, to cover approximately 98 per cent of the total UK market. At the same time, a new FT-SE Small Cap index will reflect the movement of those All-Share members which lie below the FT-SE Actuaries 350 in terms of market capitalisation. Like the All-Share, this will be an end-of-day index. It will be calculated in two ways, including investment trusts and excluding them. Companies will only be eligible for the All-Share if their stocks trade at least every other day. This 'liquidity screen' is designed to exclude a handful of stocks that are very tightly held, and almost never trade. It will not affect the great bulk of current FT-A All-Share members. A consistent series - One clear message the working group received was a desire to have a consistent series of indices, with a common set of ground rules and procedures, and no overlap. A company should either be in the FT-SE 100, or in the FT-SE Mid 250, or in the FT-SE Small Cap, but not in more than one of them. Thus a small company will start outside the All-Share. As it grows, it will qualify for All-Share membership on the grounds of size and liquidity, and will initially find itself in the Small Cap portion of the index. In time it can hope to rise in market capitalisation sufficiently to enter first the FT-SE Mid 250, and then ultimately the FT-SE 100. At each point, its eligibility will be governed by the same rules, and the same calculations will determine price, yield and so on. Independent management - The arcane and complex rules that govern the way an index runs - necessary to cope with the ever more complex capital structures of late twentieth century companies - can occasionally become contentious. It was important, therefore, to have a unified set of committees to run the new indices, under a strong and independent chairman. The FT, the Stock Exchange and the Actuaries have set up an independent steering committee, overseeing practitioner committees which will carry out the quarter-by-quarter decisions which make the indices tick. The task of seeing that these indices continue to meet the needs of investors - as the All-Share and the FT-SE 100 have done - now falls to them.</p>

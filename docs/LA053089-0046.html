			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A 27-year-old woman who spent a record 130 days isolated in a New Mexico cave  began undergoing a weeklong series of tests in Houston that could yield clues  about the medical effects of long-term space flight. Early indications are that  Stefania Follini, an interior decorator from Ancona, Italy, who volunteered for  the experiment, is faring well despite losing 17 pounds and showing signs of  lethargy and inattentiveness during her latter days in the underground  plexiglass home. Dr. Andrea Galvagno, one of two Italian researchers in Houston  who have monitored her health, said it is still too early to tell what specific  effects the long-term isolation had on her immune system. Follini, whose sense  of time became disoriented during isolation, said at a news conference at HCA  Gulf Pines Hospital that she is still having a hard time adjusting again to a  24-hour day.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: How to do it EU law says nationals in all member countries must be given an equal opportunity to take stakes in EU privatisation flotations. Implementing this law could be difficult, though, and the transactions are complicated by the currency risk. Then, there are practical difficulties. The British government marketed its issues vigorously to the private investor. But continental European governments are said to be less willing to help foreign nationals to profit from the sale of their national assets - an attitude that has prompted grumblings about allocations for UK investors. Other difficulties include the likely need for overseas banking facilities and the complex arrangements for the taxation of dividends held across EU borders both for the payor company and the individual recipient. Then, too, it is difficult to know when the issues will come to the market. There is no central EU information source and individual government authorities can be elusive. Once issues are announced, it can be difficult to uncover information in English about the business and prospects of the corporate assets. Issues are not always accompanied by retail prospectuses in English, although these have been translated for institutional investors. But many issues are of stock in companies already partly-quoted. The largest produce annual reports in English, available on request. Almost the only other source is the pages of the English-language financial media. As one seasoned private investor puts it, buying shares directly under these conditions would be like 'playing darts blindfold.' All but the most tenacious and linguistically-confident private investor should seek professional help. There are two ways into the cross-border new issues market via professionals . . . 1. Buying through a fund Two new investment trusts aimed at small shareholders interested in the privatisation stocks are being offered. These will deal with such difficulties as foreign currency transactions, overseas banking facilities and withholding tax on dividends. Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation investment trust provides the chance (closing on February 2) to buy partly-paid shares, with 50 per cent payable on application and the rest six months later. Annual management charge is 0.75 per cent and minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Mercury Asset Management's European Privatisation trust will be launched on February 3. Like the Kleinwort issue, it will have warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis and will qualify for inclusion in a Pep. Full details of the Mercury offer are not yet available to private investors, but the offer price will be 100p a share and the annual management fee less than 1 per cent. Minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000. 'Since most trusts now start trading at a premium, the 'free' warrants are an additional attraction and are likely to enhance the value of the total investment because they are ultimately tradeable,' says John Szymanowski, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities. The MAM ordinary shares will be traded as a package with their warrants for the first 43 days of listing, so investors can include the warrants inside a Pep. The Kleinwort warrants are tradeable separately from day one. 2. Buying through a broker For those who want to stag their stocks, the trusts are not appropriate. For this, you can choose to use your existing broker or one of the brokers which offer specialist European privatisation services. European Stockbrokers Ltd has launched an execution-only service for UK private investors who want to deal in European shares. The company also is offering private clients a custody service, a choice of nominee or own-name dealings, portfolio valuations, and holding of sterling or foreign currency in an interest-bearing deposit account. Commission charges for execution-only transactions are 0.5 per cent on deals up to Pounds 60,000, with a minimum of Pounds 100 and maximum of Pounds 250, plus 0.25 per cent on the balance of transactions above Pounds 60,000. There are additional charges for local delivery of overseas shares, and a small charge for the custody service. Even more specialised is the Johnson Fry Managed French Privatisation Service to private investors in the UK. Johnson Fry is inviting investments of Pounds 1,000 and will then apply for shares in every French privatisation issue on behalf of each investor. The shares will be sold as soon as possible so that the proceeds can be re-invested in subsequent issues. Charges are Pounds 60 to cover all applications, with a flat fee of Pounds 15 on sales of shares worth less than Pounds 500 and Pounds 22 on larger amounts. No interest will be paid to investors on the money held.</p>

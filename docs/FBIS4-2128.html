			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party </F> committee, at the second enlarged plenary session of the seventh  provincial party committee on 16 December: "Profoundly Implement  the Guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and Rapidly Set Up the Socialist Market  Economic System"]    [Text] Since the beginning of this year, party  organizations at all levels in the province have guided the vast  numbers of cadres and masses to implement conscientiously the  guidelines of the important speeches made by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping during his south China trip and the guidelines of the  14th CPC Congress, to execute firmly the party's basic line, and  to promote positively reform and opening up as well as the work  in various fields around the central task of economic  construction, thus overcoming all sorts of difficulties and  gaining the good situation characterized by in-depth reform,  economic progress, and social stability. The summary of the  1993 work and the priorities of the 1994 work of the provincial  party committee, which will be submitted to the current session  for examination and discussion, and the provincial economic work  conference, which is scheduled to open on 23 December, will set  forth specific arrangements for the various tasks on the  provincial economic and social development in 1994 on the basis  of summarizing the work of 1993. The current plenary session of  the provincial party committee is primarily devoted to studying  the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, discussing and defining the province's  specific opinions on implementing the "decision" of the third  plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  mobilizing all party committees and Communist party members to  lose no time to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up and  the pace of setting up the socialist market economic system.  Hereafter, I want to dwell on three issues in line with the  discussed opinions of the standing committee of the provincial  party committee.  <H5>  1. Profoundly Implement the Guidelines of the Central </H5> "Decision," and Enhance the Sense of Responsibility and the  Sense of Urgency in Deepening Reform and Accelerating Development    Since the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, based on the profound summarization of the great  practice of reform and opening up, guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and in line with the objectives and principles  for the economic structural reform put forward by the 14th CPC  Congress, the CPC Central Committee has adopted the "decision on  several issues concerning the socialist market economic system"  and has set up the outlines for the action of accelerating  reform and opening up during the 1990's for the whole party and  the people throughout the country. If we say that 15 years ago  the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee  realized the shift of the work emphasis of the whole party and  helped push our country to the historical period of reform and  opening up, then, today's third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee has sketched the blueprint and defined the  basic framework for China's socialist market economic system and  has pushed China's reform to a completely new stage of  proceeding in an all-around manner and making breakthroughs in  key aspects.    Successful implementation of the "decision" will certainly  consolidate and perfect the socialist system further and make  socialism with Chinese characteristics even more vigorous and  superior.    In implementing the "decision," we must proceed from the  reality of our province and enhance the sense of urgency in  establishing the socialist market economic system. Through more  than 10 years of reform and opening up, the pattern of common  development of all sectors of the economy, with the state-owned  sector predominant, has been formed; breakthroughs have been  made in changing the operational mechanism of large- and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises and in the property rights  reform of small enterprises; market cultivation and construction  have been accelerated; the commodity prices have been gradually  decided by markets; the rural management system has been  perfected and the collectivized service system and the  trade-industry-agriculture organizations have developed greatly;  and even more border areas have been opened to the outside world  and the pattern of opening to all directions has been formed  gradually. This has not only laid a good foundation for  accelerating the transition from the planned economic system to  the socialist market economic system, but has also promoted the  development of the national economy. This year, the province's  gross national product has increased steadily, grain output has  reached a record high, structure has improved, total supply and  demand have gone up, and efficiency has improved. In addition,  township and town enterprises have developed in a sustained and  rapid manner, and their output value has surpassed agricultural  output value for the first time. The total amount of import and  export has increased and the amount of foreign funds utilized  and the number of foreign-funded enterprises of three types has  doubled and redoubled. Markets have been brisk, purchases and  marketing have been thriving, and the current situation  continues to develop in a good direction.    In the process of development, however, we have also  encountered some conspicuous difficulties and problems. Major  ones are a long period of shortage of investment, with the  investment in fixed assets lower than the national average for  10 successive years; outdated equipment and technology; heavy  burden accumulated in history; and the lack of vitality in  market competition of state-owned large-and medium-sized  enterprises, which support the province's economy; and the lack  of major projects to promote the economy and the relatively  sluggish economic development rate. These problems have  resulted both from the shackles of the traditional systems and  from the lack of sufficient dynamics in doing work. As far as  the systems are concerned, the central revenue and the local  revenue were separated in 1980, and 74.5 percent of the profits  and taxes turned in by the country's industrial enterprises  owned by the people have been allocated to local authorities.  In our province, however, merely 23.5 percent of the profits  and taxes are put under the local authorities, 51 percent lower  than the national average. Heilongjiang's per capita national  income is 28.5 percent higher than the national average, but its  per capita revenue is 24.2 percent lower than the national  average, thus making the province's finances a typical example  of "finance to feed the people." The proportions of the  allocations for fixed assets and circulating funds have declined  by a large margin, and that of the allocations for  administrative funds and various subsidies have notably  increased. Due to the limit imposed by the traditional  investment system on the use of investment, state investment has  been focused on coal, timber, oil, and other basic and heavy  industries, while that of the province has been focused on light  industry and infrastructural facilities, making the ratio of  investment in heavy industry to that in light industry 9 to 1  for a long time. Due to the abnormal ratio of investment, 90  percent of our investment has been used mostly in maintaining  reproduction or in resource producing industries during the  recession period. This has made us merely capable of  maintaining a zero growth rate and preventing a minus growth  rate and made it difficult for us to establish a fairly large  production capacity. Using the remaining 10 percent of the  investment to support the light industry, which accounts for  32.7 percent of our total industry, we are merely capable of  maintaining simple reproduction, making it more difficult to  restructure the industry. The serious barriers between the  industrial enterprises of different regions and different  departments and the separate development of the enterprises  directly under the central authorities and local enterprises  have made it difficult to work out overall plans for and achieve  overall balance in the operation of the industry. The limit  imposed on the dissemination of the products and technology, as  well as the promoting role of key enterprises have led to a  broken industrial chain and the obstacles to the development of  local industry. Due to the price distortion resulting from the  traditional price system  and the double-track price system, which has existed for a long  period, adjustment of the prices of such primary products as  coal, timber, grain, and oil have been sluggish or stagnant.  This has not only caused a large loss of efficiency every year,  but also made the mining and raw material industries, which  account for more than one-third of our total industry, dwindle  every year and made it difficult to develop the follow-up  industries and substituting industries. As far as our work is  concerned, although we have come to understand that structural  contradictions are the deep-seated reasons for the sluggish  economic development, we still lack significant measures for the  transformation of enterprise property rights, the development of  the nonstate sectors of the economy, and the in-depth reform of  local monetary, investment, and planning systems because of a  lack of conditions for macro reform and a lack of courage.  Also, although we have come to understand that the bottleneck  restrictions imposed by fund shortages and the structural  restrictions imposed by underdeveloped processing industry have  seriously affected economic development, we have failed to  achieve notable results in solving problems because of a lack of  unremitting efforts, a pioneering spirit, and a down-to-earth  work style. We might not be the only one to blame for the zero  or minus increase rate in coal, timber, oil, and other mining  industries, but it is our work that has caused the lack of vigor  in local industries and the sluggish economic development.  There might be numerous reasons for the slow technical  transformation and equipment renewal of state-owned large-and  medium-sized enterprises, but it is our lack of project  development and lack of efforts to win projects from higher  authorities that have caused the shortage of important  projects to promote our economy for 10 successive years. The  above-mentioned conditions and problems show that the  fundamental way to resolve the system and structural  contradictions restricting economic development; to accelerate  economic development and promote the province's economy to a new  height lies in speeding up the transition to the socialist  market economy and in pooling the efforts of the people  throughout the province to promote development through reform.  The central authorities have decided to establish the socialist  market economy system. This has provided unprecedented  conditions and a historical moment for us to resolve the  structural contradictions and difficulties in economic  development. As the major trend of the new round of reform is  coming near in the country, those who have made full  preparations will win the conditions for accelerating  development; and those who have seized the opportunity will gain  the initiative. As long as we firmly implement the "decision"  of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee, uplift our spirit, emancipate our minds, seize the  opportunity to advance, and deepen reform in an active and  prudent manner, we will be able to create a new situation in  reform and development.    To study and implement the central "decision," we must  comprehensively and deeply understand the guidelines of the  "decision" and grasp the grand objectives, basic frame, and main  links of the socialist market economic system. According to the  progress of reform and opening up and the provincial reality, we  should pay particular attention to understanding five important  viewpoints: 1) Really understand the viewpoint of linking the  socialist market economic system with the basic socialist  system, further change the confused ideas of setting the market  economy against the socialist system, and define that the key to  speeding up economic development is to bring into full play the  market's fundamental role in distribution of resources and that  setting up the socialist market economic system is consolidating  and developing socialism. Only when we actually stand from the  high plane of the times and the party spirit, further emancipate  the mind, and expand the extent of reform will we be able to  promote the transformation of the economic system. 2) Really  understand the viewpoint that public ownership should play a  dominant role in the national economy on the premise that some  localities and industries are allowed to have the difference in  this aspect, change the mechanical thinking of using the  proportion of quantities to define the position of the public  ownership, and define that there are various ways to realize  public ownership and that the market economy is one in which  various sectors of the economy vie with one another for equal  development. Therefore, we should further firmly proceed from  the provincial actual conditions and proceed from the principle  of giving full scope to the strong points and making up for the  shortcomings to optimize the ownership structure and to  encourage the full development of the nonstate economic sectors.  3) Really understand that setting up the modern enterprise  system is the foundation for the socialist market economic  system; change the old habits that the property rights are not  clear, the responsibility for profits and losses is not clearly  defined, scientific management is ignored, and government  functions are not separated from enterprise management; and  define that enterprises have the decisionmaking rights to manage  the property of legal persons. Only when we set up the modern  enterprise system characterized by well-defined property rights  and duties, separation of government functions from enterprise  management, and scientific management will we be able to  actually liberate and develop the state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises. Only by so doing will we be able to  boldly promote the reform of the enterprise property right  system and comprehensively enliven state-owned enterprises. 4)  To actually understand the socialist market economy, we should  perfect the viewpoint of the macroeconomic regulation and  control system, change the lopsided understanding that the  market economy is a free economy to expel the macroeconomic  regulation and control, and define that strengthening the  central macroeconomic regulation and control rights is conducive  to maintaining the basic balance of the overall economy,  ceaselessly optimizing the economic structure, and promoting a  coordinate economic and social development. Therefore, we  should further consciously implement the central decision on  strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control.  Simultaneously, we should proceed from the actual conditions  and strive to set up a macroeconomic regulation and control  system in coordination with the central macroeconomic regulation  and control system and suitable for the objective requirements  for local economic development. 5)Really understand the  viewpoint that the principle of distribution according to work  must be dominated by efficiency and be carried out by giving  consideration to equality and change the tendencies of unfair  distribution and distribution according to the principle of  equality. Therefore, we should further positively implement the  policy on encouraging some localities and individuals to be rich  before others through honest labor and legal management.    Simultaneously, the individuals are allowed to have their  production factors participate in the distribution of benefits.  Simultaneously, we should further appropriately regulate and  handle the relations of distribution between different stratums  and between the groups of different benefits and gradually seek  common wealth. In short, only when we study the central  "decision" closely in line with the local practice of reform and  development and the work reality of departments and clearly  understand the decision's basic viewpoints and basic  requirements of great practical significance, will we be able to  strengthen the awareness and firmness of implementing the  central "decision."    The next several years is a period of critical importance  and is a stage to tackle difficult problems. Fulfilling the  tasks of this stage is of extreme significance. In line with  the reform priorities defined by the "decision" of the CPC  Central Committee, we have to make plans for all fields, make  breakthroughs for major aspects, promote work in an all-around  manner, make full preparations, be careful in doing the linking  work, and, in particular, resolutely put in place the reform  measures that will be set forth next year. This requires us to  persist in the fundamental criterion of facilitating the  development of vocalist productive forces, facilitating the  strengthening of the comprehensive strength of the state, and  facilitating the improvement of the people's living standards  and require us to emancipate the mind in the course of seeking  truth from facts. In establishing a socialist market economic  system, there are no precedents in the history of socialist  development. Because reform foundations and implementation  conditions vary from place to place, we must proceed from  realities in implementing the "decision" of the CPC Central  Committee. We should further emancipate the mind, continue to  carry forward the spirit advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping of  daring to think, try, and go ahead, and should boldly support  the grass-roots areas and the masses in blazing new trials. We  should boldly absorb all the useful reform experiences gained by  coastal areas and by other provinces and regions in the country,  especially the successful experience in invigorating large- and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises. We should boldly absorb  and use as reference all the management and operation forms of  developed countries that facilitate the development of  productive forces. We should exploit our initiative and  creativity to constantly create work advantages and new  conditions for accelerating development. We should persist in  the principle of promoting development by carrying out reform  and concentrate our energy on beefing up economic construction.  The fundamental purpose of reform is to accelerate economic and  social development and to constantly improve the people's level  of material and cultural livelihood. Development is the  foundation for solving all social problems and for deciding if  the people are for or against reform. We must pay attention to  the organic combination of reform and development and regard the  difficult points we have met in development as the focal points  on which we concentrate to make breakthroughs. In adopting  major reform measures, we should fully consider if the mainstay  of the national economy -- production and management -- can  adapt themselves to the measures. The implementation of  economic development strategy should facilitate in-depth reform.  While meticulously organizing the reform, we should uphold the  central task of economic construction and make all the work  manifest the principle that only development is the essential  criterion. We should give prominence to developing precision  and deep processing and developing new and high-technology  industries to enhance the level of industries and extend the  chains of production. We should also give prominence to  developing high-output, fine-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture, as well as township and town enterprises to improve  the economic efficiency of  the countryside. We should pay equal attention to key projects  and technological transformation projects to improve the general  quality of the national economy. We should strive to ensure the  investment that facilitates the upgrading of industries, expand  the scale of production that has a large market, and develop as  quickly as possible efficient production. We should persist in  the principle of submitting to the overall situation and  conscientiously organize the various reforms that help  strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control of the  state. Only when the market economic system takes shape  throughout the country, can economic structural reform succeed  in localities. Only when a strong and effective macroeconomic  regulation and control system takes shape throughout the  country, can we thoroughly solve the problems of barriers  existing between different departments or regions, market  blockade, and uneven development in different regions. Only  when the central authorities strengthen financial capacity and  the regulation and control capacity can they make industrial  policies truly favor old industrial bases and major grain  production areas. Although the reform of financial, tax,  banking, investment, and planning systems, which will be carried  out next year, will bring about some new circumstances, we  should also submit ourselves to and support the overall  situation and conscientiously do the work arranged by central  authorities. The special situation and practical difficulties  of the province should be reported to the central authorities  voluntarily and repeatedly in order to garner the support of the  state. This is also an important link to do the partial work  well and to support the overall work.    We should persist in integrating the effort to deepen  reform with that to safeguard social stability to ensure the  smooth progress of reform. Only by seizing the favorable  opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world,  and accelerate development, can we consolidate the stable and  united political situation; and only when social stability is  maintained, can we ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening  up, and economic development. Therefore, in the crucial period  for reform and the period for tackling the most difficult  problems, we should make particular efforts to safeguard social  stability. When adopting major reform measures, we should fully  consider the extent the masses approve, attach importance to  their vital interests, and protect their enthusiasm. When  trying to achieve breakthroughs in key areas of reform, we  should pay attention to improving supporting measures, carry out  ideological and political work successfully, and reduce social  fluctuations as much as possible. In particular, following the  deepening of enterprise reform, enterprises that are closed down  and suspended or go bankrupt may increase within a short period  of time. We should implement guaranteeing and preventive  measures in advance and adopt every means to arrange well the  life of the workers who are laid off. We should persist in the  principle of promoting economic structural reform and political  structural reform in a coordinated manner and step up efforts to  improve the socialist legal system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping  pointed out on many occasions that the corresponding reform in  the political structure is an important condition for the  ultimate success in the reform of the economic structure.  Practice of reform and opening up proved that the development  of the market economy has set a still higher demand on improving  socialist democracy and the legal system. We should further  improve the people's congress system and the system of  multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the Communist Party and establish and improve a  democratic and scientific policy-making system. Focusing on  establishing the socialist market economy system, we should  facilitate the reform of the party and government administrative  systems at the same pace, change the functions of party and  government organs, simplify them, and raise their efficiency.  We should step up economic legislation and upgrade the levels  in acting according to law and strictly enforcing laws. We  should achieve progress in grass-roots democratic politics and  respect and protect the mainstay of the market and the  democratic rights of the masses. We should conduct reform and  opening up on the one hand and crack down on crimes and punish  corruption on the other and do a good job in party building and  the building of the spiritual civilization to create a good  social environment for deepening reform and establishing healthy  and progressive social conduct.  <H5>  2. Deepen Economic Structural Reform and Accelerate </H5> Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy System    In Heilongjiang, where large- and medium-sized enterprises  are concentrated, the large proportion of basic industries,  especially the industries related to resource production, the  extensive and long period coverage of mandatory plans, and the  serious barriers between different regions and different  departments have established a special method for economic  operation and a special economic structure. When implementing  the "decision" of the party Central Committee, we should proceed  from this special feature of the province and, focusing on  establishing a modern enterprise system, regard them as the  priorities of reform to transform the property right of  state-owned enterprises, to change government functions, to  cultivate the markets for the essential elements of production,  and to establish unemployment and old-age insurance systems,  facilitate the supporting reform in other fields simultaneously,  and strive for breakthroughs next year. In about five years of  time, we should strive to build a basic framework for the  socialist market economy system, complete the transition from  the planned economy system to the market economy system by the  end of this century, and establish an initial administrative  system and operating mechanism that meet the needs of the  socialist market economy to promote a sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development in the province.    A. We should speed up establishment of the modern enterprise  system focusing on the reform of the property rights of  state-owned enterprises. We should popularize the corporation  system more rapidly and achieve success in the reform of the  property rights of state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises in an active and orderly manner. After  standardizing the existing shareholding enterprises, we should  select a number of large- and medium-sized enterprises provided  with necessary conditions, especially industrial enterprises, to  implement the shareholding system. We should increase the  number of the enterprises implementing the shareholding system  to 150 by next year.    We should define the responsibility for undertaking the  projects for "grafting" transformation according to the  agreements of intention signed during the outside-the-border  business introduction activities sponsored by the provincial  government on two occasions and firmly organize forces to  fulfill the projects. We should strive to expand the scale of  "grafting" transformation. Enterprises are allowed to conduct  "grafting" transformation wholly and partially and to carry out  the policy of one enterprise, several systems. We should strive  to introduce more businessmen and capital from developed  countries. We should pay attention to bringing in not only  capital but also advanced technologies and managerial forms so  as to accelerate the pace of "grafting" transformation. To  speed up the progress of setting up enterprise associations, we  should persist in linking enterprise self-participation with  government guidance and have key enterprises play a key role in  organizing large trans-regional enterprise associations that  have industrial and product advantages and involve various  trades. Next year, we should concentrate efforts on grasping  the organization of the petrochemical industrial, dairy product,  and machine tool enterprise associations. The existing  enterprise associations should balance, as soon as possible,  their internal relations; perfect the organizational structure  and the management system; and actually bring their advantages  into play. We should clearly understand, one by one, the  situation of the small number of enterprises with serious  losses; merge them into the enterprises with advantages; or have  them  resolutely declare bankruptcy. Next year, the province and all  cities and prefectures should make solid strides for  experimenting with the auction of large and medium-sized  enterprises and the work of having the enterprises with serious  difficulties declare bankruptcy. According to actual provincial  conditions, we should coordinate the reform of property rights  with technological transformation, solve the problems of a lack  in motivation by  defining property management rights of legal persons of  enterprises to conduct enterprise technological transformation,  encourage and restrict enterprises to speed up the pace of  technological transformation and the upgrading and updating of  products, coordinate the reform of the property rights system  with the enhancement of the enterprise internal power, solve  extensive management problems by setting up a scientific  management system, and encourage and restrict enterprises to  strengthen management and increase economic results.    We should accelerate the pace of system reform, and the  lease  and sales of enterprise property rights, and comprehensively  reform the property rights of small public enterprises. In the  next one or two years, we should strive to comprehensively  fulfill the tasks for reforming the property rights of  state-owned large enterprises with the shareholding cooperation  system, lease management, and the marketing of property rights  so that they comprise the mainstay. Enterprises with good  economic records are allowed to convert their assets into stocks  and to sell the stock wholly or partially to staff members,  workers, and legal persons so that the enterprises are managed  by legal persons and enterprises' staff members and workers with  stock, or collectively by the staff members and workers with  stocks. As for money-losing enterprises where it is impossible  to halt deficits from forming, their staff members and workers  can obtain the enterprise property rights by taking up the debts  and risks instead of paying money, and then managing the  enterprises through stocks. The enterprises without conditions  for carrying out the shareholding cooperation system are allowed  to carry out the leasing management system. That is, this type  of enterprise can be managed wholly on lease or be divided into  several relatively independent parts for separate leasing. In  the method of managing  the enterprises first on lease and then buying the property  rights, we should reasonably define rent and sell the enterprise  property rights in a step-by-step manner. We should openly sell  off the property rights in society. The enterprises without  hope for halting deficits and with difficulties in paying the  debt in kind and transferring the property rights must  resolutely declare bankruptcy according to laws.    We should speed up the change of the enterprise managerial  mechanism and create conditions for setting up the modern  enterprise system. We should continue to conscientiously  implement "regulation" and the "detailed rules" of the province  and implement to the letter various rights and duties of  enterprises. We should further deepen the enterprise internal  reform and scientifically set up the labor, personnel affairs,  and wage system. We should comprehensively check up on  enterprise property, creditors' rights, and debts; define  property rights; check the amount of property obtained by the  enterprise legal persons; and lay a good foundation for  generally carrying out the company system. We should positively  explore effective ways for strengthening the supervision and  management of public property and protecting and increasing the  value of public property. The province, cities, and prefectures  should respectively select some enterprises to carry out the  modern enterprise system on a trial basis so as to provide  experience for various categories of enterprises in carrying out  the modern enterprise system.    B. We should give priority to the cultivation of markets  with essential production factors and accelerate the building of  a united and open market system with orderly competition. As a  big province rich with natural resources, our province is  located in the central part of the Northeast Asian Economic  Circle with conditions for becoming the center of distribution  for commodities and essential production factors of the  Northeast Asian Region. Therefore, the orientation of  cultivating and developing the market system must be placed in  the commercialization, monetization, and marketing of all  essential factors and concentrate efforts on the cultivation and  development of the markets with essential production factors.  First, we should develop the money market. In the four central  cities of Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, and Jimusi, we should  build the money markets to serve the whole province. We should  also develop the second-grade stock markets in Harbin city,  accelerate the cultivation of foreign exchange regulation  markets and become a center for money lending. Meanwhile, we  should expand the scale of issuing of stock on the market.  Second, we should develop the labor market. Industrial cities  should run special technology and personnel markets to serve the  main bodies of production and operation, in particular, the  township enterprises. The agricultural areas should give  priorities to running markets of labor forces for promoting the  transfer of idle labor forces in the rural areas and the  development of non-agricultural industries. Border cities and  counties should establish labor service export intermediary  organs to serve places outside the territory. All cities and  counties may open employment agencies in a planned manner and  gradually turn them into the whole province's network for the  supply and demand of information on labor forces. Third, we  should develop the technology and information markets. All  cities and prefectures may establish permanent technology  markets or science and technology streets, proceed from reality  and develop science and technology fairs and technology  management organs in the rural areas. It is necessary to  establish a modern information network linking domestic areas  with foreign countries. Fourth, we should develop the real  estate markets. We should turn the renovation and real estate  development of large and medium-sized cities and county seats to  the market and implement open bidding and competition on an  equal basis. We should combine the renting of land with the  paid utilization of land and housing reform and make the real  estate industry become an important pillar industry in the  development of cities. Fifth, we should develop the property  right markets. In places where the environment for inviting  business and investments are fairly good and the conditions for  becoming centers for information and commodity distribution are  favorable, we should step up efforts to establish property  rights markets to serve state-owned enterprises. It is  necessary to further develop all sorts of commodity markets,  give priority to grasping the estabishment and operation of  grain, cereal oil, meat, fruit, vegetable, coal, furniture, and  sugar wholesale markets in the province. Continued efforts  should be made to improve the operation of timber markets in the  northern region, the Daqing petrochemical market and the  provincial markets of machinery and electric products and light  industrial and dairy product and expand their scope of  influence. We should raise funds to build the provincial-level  futures markets and improve the transportation markets. We  should include the building of market system into the overall  plan for national economic and social development. We should  uphold the principle of adopting a unified plan, building the  markets with the efforts of all sectors and allowing them to  enjoy benefits before drawing profits from them, and the  principle that whosoever builds and invests in the markets will  enjoy the benefits and encourage all localities and departments  to run the markets. We should accelerate the establishment of  market law and regulation system, issue stipulations for market  building in our province as quickly as possible and guarantee  that all markets will be managed and operated in line with the  law. In addition, we should cultivate market intermediary  organs in a planned manner, perfect the arbitration and notary  organs and improve the market functions.    We should accelerate pricing reform according to the changes  of relations in the supply and demand of commodities and the  marketing of essential production factors. Regarding the prices  managed by the province, except the products of monopolized  industries and commodities implementing the protective prices,  we should decontrol the prices of all other commodities and let  enterprises set their own prices in line with market supply and  demands. We should gradually reduce and stop the dual-tracking  pricing system for the means of production and implement the  ceiling price in the means of production for agricultural use.  It is necessary to establish the money system for regulating  prices, improve the method of collecting and using the funds and  strengthen the government's capacity to stabilize market  commodity prices. We should step up efforts to formulate laws  and regulations for local prices, improve the market price  management system and standardize the prices of enterprises.    C. We should improve the system for economic regulation and  control, with the focus on changing government functions. The  state will start reform of the financial and tax, monetary,  investment, and planning systems next year. We should achieve  success in the work we need to do and take advantage of this  moment to establish, as soon as possible, an economic regulation  and control system that coordinates the macroeconomic regulation  with the control system of central authorities. This requires  that we speed up change in government functions, turn the  microeconomic administration into macroeconomic administration,  and put the focus of work on making overall plans for the  economy, implementing macroindustrial policy, keeping total  supply and total demand stable, and solving problems that cannot  be solved merely through the market mechanism. We should focus  work on indirect administration, such as regulation and control  of economic levers and improving economic laws and regulations,  mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative  means instead of administrative means alone and guide and  regulate enterprises' economic activities to operate in line  with market regulations and the general targets of the economy.  All departments should examine their powers of screening and  approving before the first quarter of next year, delegate to  lower levels those that should be delegated, and return to  enterprises those that should be returned. We should accelerate  institutional government reform to change from a government  characterized by a mix and overlap of government functions with  business into one characterized by separation of government  functions from business, unity, and efficiency, and establish a  multi-purpose, flexible, and highly efficient administrative  system. The plan for the provincial-level institutional reform  will be issued and implemented next year, and experimental  institutional reform will be conducted in cities and prefectures.    We should actively promote financial and tax reform and  strive to cultivate and expand financial resources. Based on  the tax assignment system and the changes resulting from a  system wherein the central fiscal authority returns and  transfers payments to local authorities, we should deepen the  reform of the local financial and tax systems to enhance our  capacity to create and accumulate financial resources. In line  with the principle of making the grass  roots affluent first before making the province prosper and the  principle of properly enhancing the provincial-level capacity  for regulation and control, we should establish the provincial  tax assignment system to support the accelerated economic and  social development of all localities and to guarantee the funds  to support key construction projects within the province and  poverty-stricken areas. We should pay attention to the  coordination with the important financial and tax policies the  provincial party committee and government issued in the past,  implement the policies on supporting prosperous counties,  poverty-stricken counties, and border cities and counties to  accelerate development, and continue the policies related to  some enterprises' reform experiment until the end of 1995. To  enhance local economic and financial strength, we should  particularly support the technical transformation and new  product development of the large tax and profit payers among the  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to ensure the  steady growth of the local revenue; speed up the development of  the intensive processing industry to increase the income tax  revenue from local enterprises; expedite the development of  transportation, telecommunication, construction, tourism,  catering trade, service trade, and other trades of the tertiary  industry to increase the business tax revenue; expedite the  development of the agriculture with high economic results to  increase the farm, forestry, and special product tax revenue;  expedite the development of individual and private economies to  increase the personal income tax revenue; and accelerate the  development of real estate to increase house property tax, land  use right tax, and real estate business tax revenues. While  cultivating financial resources, we should conscientiously  implement the industrial policy of the state and the province  and avoid ill-considered and overlapping construction. We  should use the lever of local tax rate to promote local economic  development. We should complete establishment of local tax  institutes as soon as possible and conscientiously do a good job  intax collection and management. We should actively support the  state  in the establishment of tax institutes.    We should accelerate the reform of the financial system and  further expand the channels for circulating capital. The  provincial government should work in coordination with various  specialized banks to organize the circulation of capital and to  ensure various specialized banks change into commercial banks.  In line with the method of separating policy-lending loans from  commercial loans, the majority of the enterprises in the  province are designated to use commercial loans. We must  appropriately designate the nature of loans granted to the  forest, coal, and war industries; and study and also adopt  effective measures for changing specialized banks into  commercial banks. Based on the existing city credit  cooperatives, we should firmly attend to setting up the city  cooperative banks to serve the local economy and small-and  medium-sized enterprises. Based on the rural credit  cooperatives and the rural cooperative funds, we should firmly  attend to setting up rural cooperative banks to serve  agriculture and town and township enterprises. We should also  make positive efforts to have the state policy-lending bank and  the central credit industrial bank to establish branch offices  in our province and to have the Communications Bank of China  establish branches in the central cities of the province. It is  necessary to deepen the reform of the investment and planning  systems and to intensify the investment risk-taking restriction  mechanism. In line with the problems that the mainstay of  investment is weakening, the investment in fixed assets is  increasing at a slow speed, and the investment structure is not  reasonable, we must standardize the mainstay of the investment  in line with three major investment spheres -- the competitive  projects, the projects of infrastructural facilities, and the  social welfare projects. We should delegate the right to  examine and approve investment items to the governments at  various levels to further expand city and prefectural  governments' rights. We should use the registration system for  the record to replace the administrative examination and  approval system in competitive projects. Beginning in 1994 we  should carry out the system that representatives of legal  persons should assume responsibility for the investment in the  fixed asset projects of the industrial enterprises and carry  out, on a trial basis, the system that representatives of legal  persons should assume responsibility for the investment in  infrastructural facility projects. The representatives of legal  persons, as soon as they are designated, have decisionmaking  power to charge the entire process of collecting funds, inviting  and determining bidders, engaging in construction and  management, managing production after operation, and returning  loans; and also assume the responsibility for taking the risk.  The representatives of legal persons should be relatively  stable and  must not be changed easily. To speed up the development of the  basic industries and the intensive and precision processing  industries, we should firmly attend to studying ways for  building investment group companies in the province. We should  further change the functions for planned management; strengthen  the coordination with the economic lever departments; calculate  and monitor the macroeconomic operation; coordinate the  investment orientation and the investment structure according to  the industrial policies; particularly strengthen the functions  for development and scientific management of projects; set up a  project tank including the ongoing projects and reserve  projects; accelerate development of a group of key projects with  technologically high-quality starting points, great influential  functions, good economic results, and short construction  periods; and make positive efforts to strive for  more projects.    D. We should set up and perfect the social guaranteeing  system with the focus on unemployment insurance and the  insurance for providing for the aged. Next year we should make  breakthroughs in perfecting the unemployment insurance system  and the system for insurance for providing for the aged to  promote the reform of the enterprise property right system and  the reasonable flow of production factors. We should expand the  scale of unemployment insurance work and gradually set up the  insurance and service system for the staff and members of  state-owned, collective, and private enterprises, as well as the  Chinese staff members and workers of the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises. We should expand the implementation  of the unemployment insurance system from some staff members  and workers of state-owned enterprises to all staff members and  workers of state-owned enterprises. We should carry out the  system of setting up unemployment insurance funds among the  enterprises of various ownerships, strengthen the management of  the funds, and ensure that special funds should be used for  special purposes. The specialized training bases and the  production self-salvation bases should bring their functions  into play, enhance the unemployed staff members and workers'  employment ability and the awareness of participating in social  insurance, and expand the channels for arranging jobs for  jobless staff members and workers.    We should gradually establish a system wherein the basic  old-age pension insurance, enterprises' supplementary old-age  insurance, and the old-age insurance derived from workers'  individual accounts are combined and should develop old-age  insurance for the workers of the enterprises of various  ownerships and urban self-employed workers. In rural areas,  support of the aged should be shouldered chiefly by their  families and supplemented by community assistance, and the  old-age insurance derived from accumulation of individual  accounts should be gradually popularized so as to expand the  coverage of insurance. We should establish city and prefectural  basic old-age pension insurance reserve funds and gradually  unify the management of retirement funds. We should rationalize  the social security management system and, in coordination with  institutional reform, establish a unified provincial social  security management organization. Distribution of social  property is the most sensitive issue of the economics of  society. We should establish a reasonable system for the  distribution of personal income, gradually standardize the  mechanism for the formation of income, and reduce the  opportunity for a small number of persons to take advantage of  their special positions or privilege to win excessive profits.  We should improve the collection and management of personal  income tax, establish and improve the system to issue receipts  during transactions, the bank account system, and the personal  taxable income declaration system, and prevent too large a  difference in final personal income. We should lift the limit  of the total payroll of enterprises in line with the principle  of giving priority to efficiency while considering fairness and  guide the distribution of income to tilt favorably to managers,  people adept at business, backbone technicians, and skilled  producers. We should sell, lease, and build houses  simultaneously to accelerate urban housing reform, with the  focus on selling public houses. Except for the houses that  governments think are not suitable to be sold, all urban public  houses may be sold to urban staff members and workers. We  should continue to promote the house rent reform and gradually  raise house rent according to the changes in market housing  prices. We should attach importance to the development and  construction of the houses suitable for economic development and  provide necessary support in such areas as distribution of land  for construction, dismantling of houses, relocation of people,  taxes, and credit to the enterprises responsible for the  development and construction of such houses.    E. We should further improve the rural operation system  focusing on the cooperative shareholding system. The  household-based output-related contract responsibility system  and the dual-management system combining unified operation with  independent management are the basic economic systems for rural  areas. The rural work conference held by the provincial party  committee has decided to extend the household-based  output-related contract system another 30 years without change  and the term for agricultural developmental production contract  another 50 years without change. The optimal- scale operation  of land should be developed on the premise that nonagricultural  trades are developed correspondingly and rural labor forces are  transferred reasonably and by establishing a land circulation  mechanism compatible with the requirements of the market  economy. We should allow peasants to transfer with  compensation, mortgage, buy shares with, or lease out their land  use right before their contracts expire. Institutionalizing of  the cooperative shareholding system is another important reform  of the rural operation system. We should apply this system  extensively to the establishment of new township enterprises and  to the transformation of the existing rural collective  enterprises. Business entities engaged in the coordinated  development of farm and animal products, the distribution of  farm and sideline products, and rural socialized service should  adopt the cooperative shareholding system step by step. This  system may also be tried in developing the superior industries  of certain localities, in establishing the entities engaged in  the integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture,  and in accelerating the construction of small cities and towns.  Business entities that have already adopted the system should  standardize and systematize it so that their shares can be  established in a reasonable manner, their organizations are  sound, their management systems are perfect, and their  distribution of interests is proper. Integrated management of  trade, industry, and agriculture will help in guiding and  organizing peasants to enter the market, in developing  specialized production and optimal-scale operation, and in  upgrading the industrialization of the rural economy. We should  develop more rapidly the organizations engaged in the integrated  management of trade, industry, and agriculture and exert great  efforts to establish the production and management systems that  closely coordinate farming and breeding with the processing  industry, production and supply with marketing, domestic trade  with foreign trade, and agricultural and industrial production  with commerce.    We should break with the regional barriers, combine the raw  materials production zones with the processing bases and  commodity distributing areas in accordance with the principle of  the economic zones and efficiency and give priority to  developing foreign trade-industry-agriculture integrated  organizations with the serial development of grain, animal  by-products and flax. We should also give priority to  cultivating and expanding leading enterprises, accelerate the  pace of developing other new products, markets and technological  transformation, and enhance their influential capacity.  Continued efforts should be made to accelerate the building of  the socialized service system, strengthen the service  consciousness and functions of agricultural-related departments,  support rural production and management experts to take the lead  in running all sorts of special associations, develop community  service organizations, strengthen the building of county and  township agricultural stations (centers), and gradually realize  socialized service in the whole course of production, operation,  circulation, and consumption in the rural areas. We should  accelerate the system of cultivating and building farm product  markets, do a good job in coordinating and preparing for the  reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system, establish  the grain risk-taking fund system, improve the grain reserve  system, give priority to building special wholesale markets with  the advantages of regional products, actively develop country  trade fairs in counties and townships, and effectively link the  rural economy with domestic and international markets. It is  necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control in the rural areas, make rational plans and adjust the  distribution of rural productive forces and promote coordinated  development in various industries and regions, as well as the  economic and social sectors.    F. We should give priority to deepening reform of the  foreign  trade system in an effort to promote a strategic escalation of  opening up. Since our province has the advantages of opening up  the border areas, accelerating the establishment of foreign  economic trade operational mechanisms that meet the needs of the  socialist market economy will be the strategic priority of our  province's reform and development. Next year the country will  establish a market-based manageable floating exchange rate  system, abolish the mandatory plan in foreign trade enterprises,  implement the foreign exchange remittance system and the system  of converting Renminbi for regular projects with favorable  conditions, place the export tax refund under the unified  allocation of the central departments, further decontrol the  management of export commodities in an orderly manner, expand  the foreign business power of industrial and foreign trade  enterprises with favorable conditions, develop transcountry  companies that integrate industry with agriculture, science,  foreign trade, and so forth. Generally speaking, these  measurers are helpful to our province to expand the degree of  opening up. We must implement them well in accordance with the  central plans. In view of the fairly great changes in the  foreign economic and trade environment, governments at all  levels, and all economic and foreign trade departments and all  sorts of foreign trade enterprises should conscientiously study  the market trend outside the territory and the demands of  domestic and foreign markets, strengthen market forecast and  development, know how to manage things according to  international practices, and strive to make foreign economic and  trade work conform to the objective law of the market economy.  We should induce foreign trade enterprises to develop in line  with the orientation of becoming integrated industry-foreign  trade ones and expand the foreign economic and trade bodies that  serve as mainstays. Foreign economic and trade enterprises  should gradually expand their business from simple commercial  activities to such production spheres as developing various  industries, projects and natural resources; production  enterprises should cooperate with and jointly do business with  foreign trade enterprises, expand the foreign trade sphere and  the export quotas and make use of the advantages of products to  directly participate in competition in the international market;  enterprises of the same category that lack competitive power  should organize associations that combine production with  processing and marketing or enterprise groups with superior  enterprises in the lead and production chains as the link in  line with the principle of mutual benefits and enhance their  capacity to participate in the international market competition.  We should exert efforts to adjust the foreign economic and trade  forms and enhance the competitive ability of border and local  trade enterprises on the international markets. In face of the  changes in the external environment of border and local trade  and the stagnation in barter trade, on the basis of stabilizing  the development of economic and trade cooperation with Russia,  we should accelerate the implementation of various market  strategies. While stabilizing barter trade, we should gradually  expand ordinary spot exchange trade to reduce the business  risks. We should change the dislocation between foreign  economic relations and foreign trade, turn pure trade into  multidirectional economic and technological cooperation, and  establish long-term and stable foreign economic and trade  cooperation relations. We should make great efforts to adjust  the export product mix and accelerate the export-oriented  economic development. We should continuously develop marketable  new products to meet the changes in the world market, speed up  development of export-oriented agriculture and export processing  industry, and expand the exports of the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises to promote the steady growth of  large-scale exports. We should adopt resolute measures to block  the channels for the exports of counterfeit and inferior  commodities and promote barter trade. We should seize the  opportunity presented by the expansion of the foreign trade  autonomy of enterprises to strive to grant more large- and  medium-sized enterprises import and export rights so that more  enterprises can enter the world market. We should establish a  unified and smooth work mechanism for foreign economic relations  and trade and unify the management of ordinary spot exchange  trade, barter trade, foreign capital utilization, and  development zone construction so that foreign economic relations  and trade can be coordinated and promoted simultaneously.    G. We should speed up the close integration of science,  technology, and education with the economy, with the focus on  commercializing and industrializing scientific and technological  achievements. We should be steadfast in implementing the  guiding thought of relying on science and technology in  developing economic construction and gearing scientific and  technological work to economic construction, facilitate the  development of science, technology, and education, and deepen  the reform of the educational system and the scientific and  technological system. We should comprehensively implement the  strategy of "developing the province with science, technology,  and education" and establish a scientific and technological  system and an educational system that conforms to the  development of the socialist market economy and the laws  governing the development of science, technology, and education.  While intensifying basic research and regular education, we  should step up construction of the Harbin and Daqing High- and  New-Tech Development Zones focusing on the development of high  and new technology and relevant industries. The Harbin  Development Zone should emphasize integration of machinery and  electronic industries, biological medicine, and new materials,  and the Daqing Development Zone should emphasize the petroleum  industry, the chemical industry, and the integration of optical  instrument, machinery, and electronic industries. They should  step up the work to bring in projects from outside and to start  up the projects developed by themselves. In particular, it  should bring in and develop the projects that reflect the  characteristics of the development zones and create high  additional value for products and strive to build in two to  three years a number of pillar enterprises whose output value  exceeds 100 million yuan and profits and taxes exceed 10 million  yuan. We should integrate science, technology, and education  with the economy, with the focus on transforming scientific and  technological achievements. Scientific research institutes and  schools of higher learning provided with favorable conditions  should strengthen joint management and cooperation with  industrial and trade enterprises and, by converting their  scientific research achievements and personnel into shares,  cooperate with the enterprises to establish enterprise groups  engaged in development, production, and marketing of new  products. With government support and through shareholding  cooperation, we should prepare for establishing in Harbin an  intermediate experiment base for scientific research  achievements. We should be determined to train a contingent of  science and technology brokers to facilitate the entrance of  scientific and technological achievements into the market. By  next year we should complete transforming developmental  scientific research institutes into business entities. The  Harbin Engineering Institute New Technology Park should  emphasize its functions of experimentation of scientific  research achievements and development of high- and new-  technology industries, and more of its funds should be used in  developing high- and new-technology industries. We should  support institutes of higher learning to develop their  advantages in personnel and technology and to adopt different  methods to develop high- and new-technology industries. We  should thoroughly implement the 36-point policy on developing  the role of intellectuals and encourage scientific research  personnel to establish by themselves or in cooperation with  others scientific and technological development enterprises and  information service enterprises or to lease and contract for the  management of small state-owned enterprises, neighborhood  enterprises, and urban collective enterprises. We should  promote the development of new products, with the focus on  adjusting product mix. In line with the requirement for  developing ten major projects in the province, we should  organize scientific research units and processing enterprises to  develop the new products that are based on a high technological  starting point, create high additional value, and have good  market prospects and strive to enable our several leading  industries to create brand name products that dominate the  domestic market and open up the world market.  <H5>  3. Strengthen and Improve Party Leadership, and Provide a </H5> Reliable Guarantee for the Establishment of the Socialist Market  Economic System    The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  has initiated the new period of China's socialist modernization  drive. To effect the historical change from old to new systems,  and to establish the socialist market economic system, we must  further strengthen and improve party leadership, strengthen the  party's cohesive forces and fighting capacity, and persist in  the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough  with both hands in order to provide a strong and effective  social and political guarantee for deepening the reform.    A. We should profoundly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics to lay a  solid ideological foundation for implementing the "decision."  Party organizations at all levels in the province should give  top priority to organizing party members and cadres to study the  theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics.  We should combine the study of Volume Three of the Selected  Work of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the "decision" of the  CPC Central Committee, emphatically grasp the quintessence of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and  appropriately handle the relations between reform and  development, between speed and efficiency, between plans and  markets, between the present and the future, and between the  part and the whole. We should grasp the main line that "only  development is the essential criterion," clearly understand that  liberating and developing productive forces is the essential  demand of socialism, and always persist in the central task of  economic construction without any deviation. We should guard  against the right but primarily prevent the "left." We should  extricate ourselves from the fixed traditional modes of thinking  and get rid of the disease of fearing capitalism to maintain the  continuity and stability of the policies concerning reform and  opening up. To study well Volume Three of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, we must strengthen the study among the central  groups of party committees at all levels. The standing  committee of the provincial party committee plans to schedule a  certain period of time to study Volume Three of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping around the major issues concerning the  province's reform and development in order to seek unity of  thought and mobilize party members and cadres throughout the  province to profoundly study the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. We should run theory discussion  classes for leading cadres of party and government  organizations, run study classes for leading cadres of  enterprises, and run training classes for reserve cadres. We  should combine the study of Volume Three of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the basic knowledge on market  economy. We should continue to break with the old ideas and old  concepts taken shape under traditional systems and should set up  the new ideas and new concepts that suit the socialist market  economy so that we can push forward the cause of reform and  opening up with one heart and one mind.    B. We should strengthen leading bodies at all levels and the  grass-roots organizations and should build up the ranks of  cadres that meet the demands of the socialist market economy.  Deepening reform and accelerating development have set an even  higher demand on the leading and work level of party  organizations at all levels. To meet this demand, we must  persist in the party's centralism and actually strengthen  leading bodies at all levels in line with the principles of  making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger,  better-educated, and professionally more competent. We should  use and promote cadres based on their political achievements.  Through the reform of party and government organizations, we  should strive to train, choose, and promote a number of cadres  who have both ability and political integrity and who have been  outstanding in official performances, and should provide  sufficient and competent cadres for leading bodies of all levels  of party and government organizations. We should regard the  building of the ranks of modern entrepreneurs and the  improvement of the quality of the ranks of grass-roots cadres as  work priorities of strategic significance. We should bring in  the competitive and incentive mechanisms to break with the  restrictions from ownership systems and administrative grades.  We should not stick to one pattern in choosing and promoting  outstanding talents in order to truly promote the talents, who  are familiar with market economy and are good at scientific  management, to leading posts of enterprises and promote the  cadres, who have the spirit of blazing new trials and working  practically and who are able to lead the masses to achieve  prosperity commonly, to leading posts of grass-roots  organizations. We should realistically strengthen the  construction of the ideology and work style of the leading  bodies at various levels, and concentrate energy on solving the  problems in which the leading cadres stand high above the masses  and remain indifferent toward the masses' weals and woes and the  grass roots' difficulties. All leading cadres should go deep to  the grass roots and the masses to help directly solve their  practical problems. We should solve the problems of trying to  skirt round difficulties, shifting responsibility onto others,  and not assuming responsibility; set up a definite system of  responsibility for fulfillment of the targets; and ensure that  all levels take on their own duties. The problems of shifting  responsibility onto others, putting blames onto others, and  never undergoing self-criticism should be solved.  Simultaneously, we should foster the awareness of personal  responsibility and creatively do our duties well. Doing away  with the tendency of blaming everyone and everything but oneself  and being negative and pessimistic, we should boost morale and  be inspired with enthusiasm. The cadres who do not stress party  spirit and principles and refuse to do solid work must neither  be put in important positions nor be promoted. Cadres who  create bad consequences due to the negligence of duties or the  failure to implement the decisions of higher levels should be  readjusted from their leading posts resolutely. Those who  damage unity must be punished strictly according to party  discipline and administrative discipline. We should be  determined to build grass-roots organizations into fighting  forces and unite with and guide the masses to realize the  fighting goal of the party. The party committees at various  levels should try to clearly understand, one after another, the  weak and lax situation of the grass-roots organizations; and  adopt measures to consolidate them in stages into groups. Party  organizations of enterprises, rural areas, organs, and  institutions should strengthen self-construction and bring their  functions into play in line with the requirements for setting up  the modern enterprise system, increasing the income of the  peasants, serving the grass roots and the masses, and  implementing the strategy of relying on science and education to  rejuvenate the province. Simultaneously, we should improve the  work forms of the grass-roots party organizations, further  investigate and study the new situation and new problems, and  positively explore new ways to set up party organizations and  conduct activities in various sectors of economic organizations  under market economic conditions.    C. We should realistically strengthen the construction of  the socialist spiritual civilization and strive to create the  social practice of opening to the outside world in a civilized  manner and making progress healthily. To set up the socialist  market economic system, we should persist in the principle of  paying equal attention to spiritual and material civilizations,  ensure the accurate orientation of reform and opening up by  strengthening the construction of the spiritual civilization,  and simultaneously ensure the provision of powerful ideological  theory, a democratic legal system, science and culture, and  social practice. The theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the basic line of the party, patriotism,  collectivism, socialism, the people's creativity in reform,  opening up, and modernization, and the fine traditional ethics  of the Chinese nation should be regarded as the focal points of  propaganda work and ideological and political work, and  vigorously carry forward the main melody of socialism. Papers,  magazines, and books should use key pages to prominently and  vigorously expand the reaches of propaganda on the main melody.  The radio and television stations should also use prime viewing  time to do so. Enterprises, neighborhood committees, and  campuses should develop cultural activities. It is also  necessary to conduct mass cultural activities and strengthen the  construction of civilized villages and units. We should  persistently take the main melody as the keynote and ensure that  the cultural activities are not only varied and colorful but  also healthy and progressive. We should notice that along with  the ceaseless deepening of reform and opening up, the people's  thinking and the social practice are changing positively in line  with the requirements for social progress. However, some  negative, backward, and corrosive things that undermine the  nature of socialism continue to spread unchecked. In  particular, money worshipping, out-and-out egoism, corrosive  lifestyles run rampant and have become extremely prominent  problems. If these phenomena are spread unchecked, not only will  it damage the prestige of the party and the government but it  will ruin the future of reform, opening up, and modernization as  well. All communist party members with the sense of  responsibility for the cause of the party and the people must  not turn a blind eye to these phenomena. On the contrary, they  must be the first to eliminate these phenomena at their posts  and departments, and realistically strengthen the construction  of the spiritual civilization. We should strengthen the  education on having an accurate outlook on life and an accurate  outlook on value and strive to form a practice of respecting  advances and stressing contributions. We should adopt various  effective educational forms and conduct education on patriotism,  collectivism and socialism among the masses of cadres,  especially young people. The media and propaganda departments  should adhere to a correct media guidance, give prominence to  publicizing advanced and typical cases of diligent and honest  administration and selfless dedication and gradually make  selfless devotion become the guidance of value and the highest  moral standard of the whole society. We should exert efforts to  promote the spirit of devotion to work and strive to form a  practice of paying full attention to one's post and working  painstakingly. Party and government organs and all social  departments should strengthen education on professional ethics  in line with the characteristics of their own work, induce the  people to work hard, compete with one another on an equal basis,  give civilized service and observe law and discipline. Through  conducting all sorts of activities on fostering the enterprise  spirit, we should induce the people to enhance the sense of  responsibility, dedicate themselves to their own business and  work in a down-to- earth manner. We should actively induce the  people to spend their money in a sound manner and strive to form  a habit of practicing economy. On the basis of conducting  investigations and studies, we should adopt policies, laws and  regulations as well as economic and administrative measures to  effectively check the spread of abnormal social consumption and  the trend of lavish spending. Leading cadres at all levels  should take the lead in promoting the spirit of building the  country and running the households industriously and thriftily.  We should resolutely check the repulsive social phenomena and  strive to purify the social environment. Continued efforts  should be made to deal blows to feudal superstitions, gambling,  drugs trading and taking, prostitution and visit to prostitutes  and other repulsive social phenomena, organize efforts to ban  all sorts of pornographic services and gambling activities in  recreation and service places and strictly handle the managers  in line with law.    D. We should continue to deeply conduct anticorruption  struggle and use the actual results in fighting corruption and  promoting honesty to guarantee the smooth progress of reform,  opening up and economic construction. Fighting corruption and  strengthening the building of clean politics is the necessary  conditions for building the socialist market economic system.  Since the issuance of the central authorities' important  anticorruption plans, party and government organs at all levels  across the province have adopted a resolute attitude, taken  action actively, and witnessed a very good trend in the  anticorruption struggle. Places where this work has been fairly  good have achieved fairly remarkable results in carrying out the  three central tasks and enhanced the confidence of masses of  cadres in fighting corruption. We should continue to expand  the degree of work, consolidate the expected results of the  previous stage, and guarantee the realization of the three  anticorruption tasks on schedule. Leading cadres at all levels  must implement the relevant stipulations on keeping oneself  self-disciplined and honest in places where needed, pay further  attention to holding democratic life activities of leading  bodies with emphasis on honesty, self- discipline and  self-investigation and self-correction, compare their work one  by one with the relevant central and provincial stipulations,  examine their own problems in a fact-seeking manner, report  their cases and criticize them within a certain scope and place  them under mass supervision. We should conscientiously handle  cases on law and discipline violations, strictly handle all  verified corruption cases and never tolerate them. Discipline  inspection, supervision and judicial organs at and above the  county level should select typical cases that affect a large  area and cause strong complaints from the masses for public  trial. Regarding the central proposal on checking the recent  unhealthy trends in various trades and the problems which all  localities and departments have determined to solve on a  priority basis, we should grasp them through to the end until  good results are achieved. In fighting corruption, we must  rely on education and the legal system, proceed from deepening  reform and the building of systems and fundamentally guard  against and check the corrupt phenomena. We should solve the  unhealthy trends in cadre personnel affairs, real estate  development and contract of projects by adopting the methods of  holding public examinations, employing workers in the public and  inviting tenders; solve the problems of using public funds to  build houses above set standards and selling public houses at a  higher price by deepening reform of the housing system and  collecting unhealthy trends in housing distribution; prevent the  problems of abusing one's powers to seek personal gain in the  course of distribution of funds by deepening reform of the  financial, tax and banking systems; and solve the problem of  spending public funds lavishly and wastefully by setting  standards for cadres' wages and for reception that conform to  reality. In addition, we should also strengthen inner party  supervision, legal supervision, media supervision and mass  supervision, study and explore effective ways to exercise  supervisory power under the market economic conditions, and  gradually institutionalize and legalize the anticorruption  struggle. While successfully grasping the anticorruption  struggle, we should rectify the ideology and work style among  party and government organs at all levels with opposing  bureaucracy, liberalization and formalism as the main content.    E. We should exert conscientious efforts to maintain social  stability to provide a good social environment for deepening  reform. In the current economic activities, both difficulties  and destabilizing factors are rather numerous. In addition,  many major reform measures will be put into practice next year.  This makes it a very important task to maintain social  stability. Party committees and governments at all levels  should regard it as a major task to show concern for the life of  the masses and maintain social stability, concentrate efforts on  tackling in a timely manner the social problems that affect  stability, and strive to nip the hidden destabilizing factors in  the bud to maintain and develop the stable and united political  situation. To achieve this, we should, first, pay attention to  people's ideological fluctuations, if any, emerging in the  process of reform and ease people's feelings and resolve  contradictions in a timely manner. Leading cadres at all levels  should go deep into the grass-roots level and the masses to  intensify the investigations and analysis of public opinion and  people's mind-set, learn about their thinking, do a timely and  good job in education and persuasion, guide the people to  correctly understand reform and to enhance their mental  preparations for it, and conscientiously lead, protect, and  develop well the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Second,  we should exert particular efforts to solve the problems in the  life of the staff members and workers of loss-making  enterprises. Party and government leading organs at all levels  should adopt a highly responsible attitude toward the people  and, dividing work among themselves, conduct study of the ways  to guarantee the basic life of the staff members and workers of  the enterprises under their charge which have stopped or  postponed wage payment. They should also study the ways to  reassign the laid-off staff members and workers of the closed or  suspended enterprises. Labor departments should strengthen  coordination for the unemployment insurance work and put the  focus of social insurance business on the enterprises which have  lost money for a long time. Trade unions, the Communist Youth  League [CYL], and women's federations are the channels and  bridges for the party to establish ties with the masses. They  should fully develop their role, further represent and safeguard  the interests of workers, report workers' desires and demands to  party committees and governments in a timely manner, and help  party committees and governments in the ideological work for  workers to safeguard social stability. Meanwhile, they should  conscientiously institute the system of responsibility for  helping and supporting poverty-stricken localities, implement  the aid-the-poor measures in every village and household, and  encourage rural party and CYL members to support the poor all  the year round. As the year is drawing to an end, all  localities should make good arrangements for the life of  poverty- stricken households to make sure that they have a happy  New Year and Spring Festival. Third, we should further reduce  the burdens on enterprises and peasants. The "enterprise law"  and the "regulations" should be conscientiously enforced, and  exaction of fees and wanton requisition of donations from  enterprises and their workers should be checked. By  transforming enterprises' property right system and operating  mechanism and improving the social security system, the burdens  on enterprises should be gradually shifted to the society.  Effective measures should be adopted to continuously implement  the regulations of the central authorities as well as the  provincial party committee and government on reducing the  burdens on peasants to prevent reemergence of the burdens. We  should intensify publicity of policies to familiarize the masses  with the laws and regulations on lightening the burdens on  peasants so that they will resist the irrational burdens  according to law. Fourth, we should keep price rises under  control. There will be plenty of factors for price hikes next  year, and if we fail in regulation and control, prices will  still rise by a large margin. Therefore, we should attach great  importance to prices, strengthen supervision and control to  prevent monopolization of the market, random jacking-up of  prices, and pursue of huge profits in a timely manner, and exert  utmost efforts to bring next year's price rises under control.  Fifth, we should do a good job in comprehensive improvement of  public security. We should strictly crack down on gangs of  hooligans and thieves, bus and train marauding and waylaying,  and serious criminal elements. We should strengthen management  of the public security in public places to safeguard normal  social order. We should achieve success in mediating in civil  disputes to prevent contradictions from becoming intense. We  should earnestly handle people's complaints exposed in their  visits and letters and strive to solve problems at grass-roots  levels and in the places where they arise so as to reduce  bypassing of immediate leadership to present complaints to  higher levels. We should apply the leadership responsibility  system to public security and make public security a decisive  factor in appraising the work of a locality so as to create a  stable social environment for reform and construction.</p>

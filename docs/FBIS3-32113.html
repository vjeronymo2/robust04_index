			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Secret Document: Shining Path Uses </F> Peace Agreement to Stall for Time," which was "approved" by the  Shining Path Central Committee -- first 10 paragraphs are  introductory editorial explanation]    [Text] For the sole purpose of reporting the events  occurring in the country, LA REPUBLICA publishes the following  Shining Path document which reveals the intentions of [Shining  Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso's followers with respect to  the peace treaty that they are negotiating with government  officials at the Callao Naval Base prison.    The Maoists believe that just because they are talking with  government representatives does not mean they have to lay down  their arms, and that the cease fire is only temporary until  conditions are ripe for restarting hostilities.    Specialists believe the following document may have been  written by Abimael Guzman himself. It was approved by Central  Committee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote  Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez, and  Angelica Sala, who are all imprisoned.    The contents of the document, the quotes from books, and the  reference to recent facts -- like the referendum and Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Japan, reveal that the author -- or authors  -- have been allowed to watch television, to read newspapers and  magazines and, as in the case of Guzman, allowed to consult a  library.    The manuscript serves to compel the majority of prisoners  endorse the "fight for a peace agreement" slogan. The document  reveals that the bases of a popular war have not been  specifically abandoned. On the contrary, referring to the  murders and attacks that stained the country with blood over the  past 13 years, Guzman boasts having directed "the largest  revolutionary social movement in Peruvian history."    He defends his current decision to "fight for a peace  agreement" on the grounds that the first stage of the "world  revolution" has ended. This may be a strategy to gain time,  through "diplomatic language," and to temporarily suspend  terrorist actions until the "new stage" of the world revolution  begins.    The document is also a call to his followers "to stick very  close" to the masses in the style of the political work carried  out by the Shining Path in Ayacucho during the 1960's and  1970's, which served as the basis for the start of the armed  struggle in May 1980.    The document gives the predictions of Abimael Guzman about  the probable split of his organization as well as the call "to  set the basis" for the Shining Path Second Congress (the first  congress was held in 1988).    LA REPUBLICA discloses this important and unusual Shining  Path document, making clear that it does not share its content,  so that the country may learn the proposals by Shining Path  leaders during the negotiations for the Peace Agreement.  <H5>  Key Ideas </H5>   1. The MLM-PG [Marx, Lenin, Mao - Thoughts of Gonzalo] is  undefeated and imperishable (it was never defeated), because it  is the ideology of the last class of history.    2. We are Communists, Maoists, soldiers of the proletariat,  our essence is Maoism, wherever we fight and with the arms that  we have.    We should carefully bear in mind what Mao has taught: "The  next 50-100 years... new things, new problems, which must  consequently be resolved."    It is necessary to continue to play our role, there is fear  of making a decision.    Those who have always fought us still do so. Why?    3. The MLM-PG is our special weapon... Bear in mind what was  agreed upon at the Third Plenary Session (III S.P.). We are  confronting new problems, which should be resolved by using the  Thoughts of Gonzalo (PG).    4. Adopt the new decision and the new definition, and fight  for them.    These four key ideas should be at the foundation of our  conception of things.  <H6>  TEXTS AND DOCUMENTS </H6>   Our conception, our ideology has a base: Marxism. It should  be used in our concrete circumstances.     -  Quotes of Mao.    -  Chapter V ("War and Peace"). This should be  studied and applied.    -  "...This ML [Marxist-Leninist] Principle of  the Revolution: Has Universal Validity."    The principle is not being questioned. The point is how to  apply it in concrete circumstances. (Bear in mind the experience  of the 1960's and 1970's).    The party, the organized masses, and the public have created  the conditions for the Beginning of the Armed Struggle (ILA).     -  Quote No. 1 from Chapter V: "War is the highest level of  struggle to resolve the contradictions between the classes..."    "War begins and develops in specific circumstances. If  circumstances change, the method of struggle should be changed.  [no closing quotation marks as published]     -  Quote No. 3 [order as published] from Chapter V: "The  classification of fair and unfair wars, what to do when there is  an unfair war... The way to oppose an unfair war is to prevent  it from breaking out, and -- if it breaks out -- wage a fair war  to counter the unfair war, whenever possible." The "whenever  possible" is also valid for us when we face an unfair war (even  if it is a response to our action). This should not be read  just from an abstract point of view, its application should also  be understood).    -  Quote No. 2 of Chapter V: Relation between War  and Politics: "Until the obstacle is totally removed, war will  continue..." (text of 34 [not further specified]; contradictions  are analyzed in 37). See Chun Chin's conversations in 1946,  Volume IV; it implies continuing with the democratic revolution.    Did Mao Zedong deny The Principle? No, he applied it in a  creative way in the wake of the war against Japan. Public  opinion was in favor of peace. Mao taught that public opinion  had to be taken into account. Thus, he decided to hold talks.  Important concessions were made. Where did the problem lie?  Following the signing of the agreement between Mao -- who did  so on behalf of the PCCh [Chinese Communist Party] -- and the  KMT [Kuomintang, the People's National Party] led by Chiang  Kai-Shek, the latter violated the agreement and launched a  counteroffensive. But he did not violate any principle. In  general one should not read without trying to see the practical  application of what one is reading. It is therefore possible to  say that politics is a bloodless war whereas war is bloody  politics.  <H5>  The People's Law: "Fight, fail, ... cause social unrest." </H5>   This great Class Struggle Law takes precedence over the Laws  of Imperialism and reaction, and the People. [sentence as  published]    Class struggle is the great and ongoing class war waged  against politicians that has two types:    1. Bloodless -- "politics is a bloodless war."    2. Bloody -- "war is bloody politics."    These are different aspects of the great political war,  which  is the class struggle. Class struggle is now the development of  a contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution, the  essence of which is to fight and cause social unrest. These two  laws constitute the great Class Struggle Law, which is a  contradiction, the terms of which are -- on one hand -- to cause  social unrest, which sows the seeds of ruin and -- on the other  hand -- to fight, which in turn leads to victory. Failures are  sure to be met in both cases -- while old ideas lead to ruin,  new ones lead to victory. This is a great inexorable law. One  should not be afraid of failure, the important thing is to fight  -- hence the importance of the great Marxist truth --  "Revolution is Worthwhile." It is of utmost importance to study  this and then put it into practice.    Quotes -- page 237 [as published]    Quotes -- page 225 [as published] It is of paramount  importance not to be subjective, unilateral, and superficial.    Subjective = not taking circumstances into account; only  consider the overall picture.  <H6>  Chapter VIII. Left-wing Movement: Communism's Infantile  Disease </H6>   "Communists are Communists because throughout the  intermediate stages and throughout all the commitments -- not  the ones taken by them but by the progress of the historical  development process -- they clearly see and unerringly strive to  achieve their final objective, namely, the abolition of classes  and the establishment of a society in which private ownership of  land and the means of production no longer exist."  <H5>  Six Slogans </H5>   1. Let Us Struggle for a Peace Agreement! (Leading  political guideline)    2. Become the Standard-Bearers for Our Cause!    3. Take on and Combat for the New Great Decision and the  Great Definition!    4. Close Ranks behind the PG and the Central Leadership!    5. Become the Standard-Bearers for the New Great Decision  and Definition!    6. Glory to M-L-M [Marxism-Leninism-Maoism]!    What is a Communist?    Do we understand the historical process, are we objective or  subjective people? Are we in control of what is happening or  does reality have us in its grip? Communists see clearly  (though there may be disorder, confusion).    "... The 33 Blanco followers [not further identified] are  Communists because they think they can skip intermediate stages  ... and that the seizure of power will happen in the next few  days -- they are absolutely certain about this. Once power is  seized, Communism will be imposed the following day. If this  cannot be effected at once, then they are not Communists."    What childish naivete it is to use one's impatience as a  theoretically convincing argument!    Naturally, very young and inexperienced revolutionaries, as  well as little bourgeois revolutionaries --even those of a very  respectable age and with vast experience -- believe it is  extremely dangerous, incomprehensible, and erroneous to "reach  agreements."    Many sophists, petty politicians ... think along the same  lines, what do they do every day? -- commitments to capitulation.    "And yet, proletarians who have gone through the school of  numerous strikes ... are able to assimilate the deep truth."    "PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH" = Corresponds to contradiction; it is  a  winding road.    "HISTORICAL TRUTH" = Development process of revolutions,  like  class struggle.    "POLITICAL TRUTH" = The day-to-day struggle to come to  power,  it expresses this need.    "PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH" = How it is understood from a class  standpoint; To see the difference between commitments derived  from the present state of affairs ... commitments that do not  lessen in the least the revolutionary negation or the  willingness to continue with the struggle as a result of the  commitment that the workers have taken. To differentiate the  latter from subjective commitments that serve a particular  interest, commitments of traitors who seek to safeguard their  own interests ...    Strike breakers also make commitments! Their cowardice,  their desire to adulate.... for crumbs... seeking the praise of  the capitalists.    Not all commitments are simple, there are international and  national commitments. We must assess the two situations!  Lenin's words are more directly applied to our case: "No  Commitment" is absurd.    What is a mature Class Party that deserves to be called  such,  and which has leaders who deserve to be called such? .... It  consists of winning over, through prolonged efforts, all  representatives of a given class who are capable of thinking.  Lenin: In any class there are and always will be ...  representatives of that class that do not think, that are  incapable of thinking for themselves, otherwise Imperialism  would not be the oppressor of classes that it is. The leaders  are the ones who have more knowledge, more experience, and the  necessary political sagacity to achieve a prompt and fair  solution to complex political problems (To have the necessary  self-sacrifice to do so; not just to know things, but also to  make decisions).     -  Volume 4 - 151 PM [Thoughts of Mao] page 430-443    -  The  interview granted to EL DIARIO by the P.G.

We must fight for  a future wave of the World Proletariat Revolution (R.P.M.). A  grandiose and unforgettable stage of the R.P.M. is over.    There is an International Political Withdrawal (Strategic  and  Global), this stage has left us with three great banners:  Marx-Lenin-Mao, which show that the MLM is unwithering,  unconquerable.    Engels in 1891 in his "Introduction to the Civil War in  France", taught us that there would be an R.P.M. withdrawal and  that it was impossible to conquer power. It was necessary to  resolve the issues through new forms of struggles and  organization, mainly military issues. He makes an assessment of  50 years of R.P.M.; there was a general political withdrawal.  This is what Marx refers to when he established the First  International (Workers International Association). The  Communist Party Manifesto and the Workers International  Association are different.    In 1891, imperialism was being established, a new division  of  the world was underway. For 30 years, power could not be  conquered, and the issues concerning the forms of struggle and  organization could not be resolved. Things are different now.  In 1917, Lenin resolved this, and in 1949 Mao resolved the  problem of the road to the Revolution in semi-feudal,  semi-colonial, and bureaucratic capitalist countries. In the  Great Cultural Proletariat Revolution (1966-76) he resolved the  problem of the continuation of the socialist revolution under  the dictatorship of the proletariat.     -  Mao: Chapters on charts in the first quotation proposes  the training of people to continue.    -  In that way we previously  maintained that the World Revolution Offensive Strategy  [Ofensiva Estrategica de la Revolucion Mundial] (OERM) started  in the 1980's. Today we have developed and we believe that the  period 1976-80 is a very short time. The OERM starts with the  Great Cultural Proletariat Revolution because it occurs at the  height of the R.P.M. and the National Liberation Movement  [Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional] (MLN), under the leadership  of the proletariat. In so doing, Mao seeks to develop and  expand the R.P.M.    -  See Mao, Quotes chapter on Imperialism, page.  83: There are two kinds of wind, the East wind prevails. In  1957, page 80: "Imperialism Will Not Live Long."    Make the effort to understand the great stages, and remember  Mao: "The next 50 to 100 years...," that is from the year 2010  to the year 2060; therefore, a new wave is developing. It must  be understood within the framework of the development of the  contradiction between Restoration and Counter Restoration. We  must consider the historical background, the Development of the  Class Struggle Law. It took the Bourgeoisie Revolution 300  years to take hold. In the 16th Century the Revolution took  hold in Holland. It was later crushed by Spain in the 17th  Century. In England the victory of the Bourgeoisie Revolution  was achieved in two stages: The Revolution led by Oliver  Cromwell in 1640 (he failed); and in 1688 the "The Glorious  Revolution" was victorious: Just 48 years separate the first  revolution from the second. In the 18th Century, there was the  U.S. Independence in 1776; in France the revolution succeeded in  1789. England became the First Power of the World after the  defeat of the "Invincible Armada" (Naval Battle); It took almost  90 years for the bourgeoisie to impose and consolidate itself in  England.    If it took the bourgeoisie 300 years to conslidate itself as  a class power, the proletariate cannot be expected to do the  same in the 66 years (two-thirds of century) that it has  exercised its dictatorship over the state through the Socialist  Revolution.    The difference with the RGR [General Withdrawal of the  Revolution] of 1891 should be noted (Engels made the balance).    The current RGR stems from the process of restoration,  because an unfavorable public opinion has developed about this  stage of the revolution (140 years). Three years have already  passed since RGR. From the point of view of Maoism -- which is a  decisive, key factor in designing the strategy of the RPM [World  Proletariat Revolution] in the New Great Wave -- we understand  why this period is the transition between the crowning point of  one stage of the RPM and the future Great Wave of the RPM. This  is the foundation of the general political withdrawal, among  other things.    Lenin: "Karl Marx taught us to analyze tactical problems."  To dare to think, to dare to act, to dare to decide. Going  against the stream is a Marxist principle. Does everything we  have been analyzing oppose what we have maintained, that "The  Revolution is the Main Trend!?" One should see the difference.    1.- TREND. It is unquestionable and inexorable that, from a  historical viewpoint, the revolution is the main trend. It  would be sufficient to invoke the process of development of new  things, and the contradiction. Bear in mind the example: "The  Pampas River is born and, after a long and winding course, it  reaches the sea. It should be understood that history does not  go back, that development is a spiral, uneven process. Time is  measured in decades, not in years, and historical steps are not  so brief."    2.- THE REVOLUTION AS A POLITICAL TREND (Study very  carefully). At least five to six years are needed for the  international stage and the situation to become clear. What  will be the concrete results of U.S. hegemony? What will be the  concrete results of Russia's disintegration? What will be the  strengthening and the role of other powers, Japan and Germany?  In the revolution, what will be the specifics of the RGR? What  does the International Revolutionary Movement (MRI) think of  these matters? Mao taught us that there are many Communist  parties where Communist only appear in their letterhead. What  is their situation now? See the situation of periods and the  organizations of the proletariat. How are the unions? These  are situations of which we have to make an in-depth analysis.  What is the situation of class organizations, of peasant  organizations? What does national and world opinion say? The  direction of Communist parties is a key factor; the classes, the  Anti-imperialist Movement.    SUMMARIZING, make an in-depth analysis of the development of  the struggle of classes, its rules, trends, and prospects. The  old mole about which Marx taught us has not disappeared, it is  alive.    If there were no political trend, there would be no  historical trend. The political trend is now underground, and  one should realize this.    The debris of disintegration and of restorations (USSR and  China) has fallen upon our shoulders and we must bear it; yet  the political trend lies inside Communist parties, among  Communists, within the class, in the anti-imperialist war.  Socialism existed and we saw it. The main right is to conquer  power. Rebellion is justified! Consequently, it has not  disappeared, it is an underlying political trend. Marx analyzed  this process. He raised the issue of "The Deep Waters," saying  that "the old mole again works the land." This is how the trend  occurs from a political point of view, like underground water.  The political factor is decisive: the direction of Communist  parties. One should again study this, it is very important for  us to reaffirm our position in the revolution, as the main  historical trend, which operates politically, routinely. At a  world level, there is a new distribution of the cake and new  contradictions are being created.  <H3>  Imperialism is Slowly But Inexorably Agonizing -- Third  Plenary Session (III SP) </H3>   What are the current specific signs? It continues, but it is  inexorably agonizing. (Bear in mind the III SP on the collapse  of imperialism); yet there is also temporary recuperation. What  Lenin taught us in "The Imperialist Stage ...," "Socialism...  and Imperialism," "Revisionism... and Imperialism" is true and  fully valid.    How can we regard imperialism today? We see it in the light  of the MLM to resolve new problems.    What are the material grounds for this situation? The  economic situation that gave rise to it was the petroleum, coal,  and iron and steel industry. Today there are new sources of  jobs, some of them very sophisticated, like informatics,  electronic communications -- which are great development  processes -- genetics, monopolies are attentive to genetic  modifications (plant and animal manipulation), and even with new  species. This is a new item for exploitation and oppression.  Always see both sides of the contradiction. All oppressions  generate an antioppression class movement.    If one considers war, the development of strategic weapons  causes more militarization of industry, larger investments in  electronic war, costly weaponry and maintenance, which soon  becomes obsolete. Their economic recession problems and their  restrictions have made them foster the development of  conventional weapons. Privatization of state-owned productive  units is another world phenomenon. How much have the states  obtained from productive units? All this is being transferred  to monopolies, strengthening their power. All these matters  determine the basis for this temporary recuperation.    If we analyze the government from the political viewpoint  we will see there is a tendency to reduce its social functions.  Who will carry out these functions? In imperialist countries,  monopolies -- for example -- organize areas of social security  (the AFP [Pension Fund Managing Companies]), health, and  education. Something similar occurs in the area of security --  not just armed security, but also regarding measures to prevent  or to develop industrial espionage. All that makes us wonder  about the reactionary state process represented by the grand  bourgeoisie's dictatorship (in our case, the grand bourgeoisie  and the large landowners who obey imperialism). Nowadays, the  Armed Forces are becoming stronger and have more political  decisionmaking capacity.    Look at the role played by monopolies. In the past, they  divided the world, currently they perform government functions.    Regarding the international situation, the superpowers  remain the same. Russia continues to be a superpower in view of  its military power and its strategic atomic power. It has  problems related to its international influence, it is riddled  with domestic problems, and it is facing difficulties in  international security. In Japan, Yeltsin suggested that the  Japanese Government did not claim sovereignty over the four  islands in dispute. Russia still has influence. We realize  that international politics are undergoing a readjustment  process and we are watching how the United States will structure  its hegemony. Japan has become the second power, is paying  increasing attention to its military weakness, and seems ready  to increase and develop its own military policy. Germany is  ruining France (its famous ally) to improve its currency.    Ideologically, they are not structuring a new ideology, they  are proving that it is obsolete. They are playing increasingly  with "the failure of socialism." In spite of all this, they  support an economic recovery, after having no ideology, and  support liberalism. These are old banners, updated to manipulate  public opinion.    We must be very attentive and worry about the slow agony of  imperialism, despite its temporary recovery. We must  temporarily retreat because if we do not analyze imperialism, we  cannot fight it. Lenin taught us that imperialism limits the  development of productive forces. This is the general law. It  will be decisive and prevail in the end. We can see abundant  riches, while on the other hand we see 15 million children die  every year before their first birthdays. We cannot overcome  these realities because they are contradictory.  <H5>  How do Empires Sink? (III SP) </H5>   We realize that these processes occur over long, not short,  periods of time. During the slavery age, Roman Imperialism was  the most developed and took more than five centuries to end.  During feudalism, Spanish Imperialism was the most outstanding  and took more than two centuries to fall. In capitalist times,  it took more than a century for England to fall. Yankee  imperialism consolidated as a superpower after the Second World  War. This process has lasted more than five decades. We  predict that it will be a long process, but it will evidently  last less than the others, although we know it will take a long  time.  <H5>  Revisionism and Revolution </H5>   We have fought two sorts of revisionism: the old one that  opposed the conquest of power just after World War II and the  one we are fighting now, the essence of which is restoration.  Thus, we have always fought revisionism.    CONCLUSION: We fight for the large wave of International  Revolution that will come. Our Guide is Maoism!    2. [as published] The bureaucratic path sets its foundations  and becomes feasible.    We begin by analyzing how they are setting their bases and  developing a coherent strategy in the face of the People's War.  In the economy it is clear that they set bases, not just by  drafting laws, but also by implementing them.    Since 1988, we have had five years of recession. The GDP  increased by 6 percent in 1993, after five years of a growing  recession. Inflation decreased. Seen from a strategic  viewpoint, the GDP decreased by 26 percent between 1982 and  1993, while the population increased by 30 percent. If it  increased by 30 percent, it would still have to increase another  20 percent even if we disregard the increase in population. We  must do our best to consider the steps they take and the  increases as objective deeds.    As to "Politics and the Government," after electing their  constituents and drafting the Constitution, they won the  referendum and opened the path toward reelection. This is a way  of setting the bases for reorganization the government.    Regarding "Peacemaking" and their antisubversive war, they  began it through civic action efforts, continued it by  controlling the people, than they created peasant patrols,  conducted psychological operations, and used intelligence  actions to make arrests.    This period of bureaucratic capitalism has a goal: To  concentrate power. This process needs: A long-term plan and a  long-lasting administration to promote it, lead it, and  implement it. As a result, there will be a reappearance of  bureaucratic capitalism.    With the fall of our leadership and our central board,  imperialism sees no need to interfere.    During his speech on 24 September [no year specified],  President Gonzalo [Abimael Guzman] shunted the Program, the FPL  [People's Liberation Front], the EPL [People's Liberation Army],  the New State and its relative stability as far as the people's  war was concerned, the transfer of the center and all that it  entailed. He then established the basis of the masterly plan for  a general political withdrawal.    The process of a counter-revolutionary war leads to victory.    The renewed thrust of bureaucratic capitalism entails a  greater imperialistic control -- "Reinsertion."    Border problems with Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil  put our nation in jeopardy.    What is the situation of bureaucratic capitalism nowadays?    There are no powerful people's liberation movements, the  proletariat and the people's struggle have weakened. Hence, it  is neither powerful nor strong. Bureaucratic capitalism is thus  fueled with renewed vigor, its plan is put into practice, and  social and political rights are further curtailed. This will  make the deep class struggle awaken the old revolutionary ideals.    Knowing how to place and handle the laws of every process  puts things in their proper perspective and course.    The strong point, the most developed one in the democratic  path is the People's War.    3. The People's War cannot be developed; it can only be  maintained. There are six indispensable conditions for the  People's War to be victorious:    1. Leadership by the proletariat.    2. Masses' bases.    3. Strategic centralization.    4. A new type of Army.    5. Prolonged People's War.    6. Favorable international conditions.    Condition No. 6 does not exist, it is not the main one, but  it is necessary. The most important is No. 1. The leadership  should maintain a fair and correct political line, and wage a  people's war following a course and direction established by the  Class.    We have problems in No. 1 and No. 3. New problems, the  course is not analyzed (by the foreign leadership). No. 4 must  be assembled and developed; it is not just the name "EPL." No.  2 is not handled or managed as it should, given the new state of  affairs. Who represents the people in the election? Nobody ...  Thus, everything leads to a prolonged People's War; The problem  lies in leadership by the proletariat.  <H5>  What have we achieved? </H5>   First, we have worked for a long time to bring about an  armed  struggle and to further the People's War, a Peasants'  Revolutionary war, supported by its own bases, means, and  masses, without being submitted to classes. The People's War  has lasted 13 years.    We have hit our three targets, semi-feudalism is less  widespread, and the system is crumbling. We combated  bureaucratic capitalism, proved that the latter fosters  semi-feudalism; it controls the Peruvian state so that it can  oppose the revolution.    We have fought imperialism head-on. The spread of our  People's War has been a security problem for the United States  since 1989.    The People's War has generated a New Type of Army.    We established a new type of state directed by the Class,  which has never happened before. This had far-reaching  implications.    In sum, the People's War gave us five successes:    1. The People's War is the greatest revolutionary social  movement in Peruvian history in terms of program, development,  and length.    2. It served to defend Maoism as a third, new, superior  stage, and particularly to develop the strategic plan at a world  level.    3. It raised the party's prestige to the highest level in  its  history, with the highest world's repercussion.    4. We accumulated the greatest revolutionary experience in  Peru, Latin America. It is one of the richest in the world  today.    5. We made a great contribution to the world proletarian  revolution. It is recognized by the International Revolutionary  Movement (MRI) as a vanguard theater for the World Proletarian  Revolution. Today the revolution ends a great period. It is  the hinge between two waves. It is an example of how to operate  on our own efforts. It has shown that a People's War is  invincible.    4. The leadership problem cannot be resolved in time.    5. New great decision, new great definition; struggle for a  peace agreement and establish the bases for the second congress.  <H5>  Concrete Tasks </H5>   To raise the MLM-PG even more; to struggle for a peace  agreement and its implimentation; to define the importance of  the people's war, the greatest Social Revolutionary Movement in  Peru's history; to develop deeper bonds with the broad masses;  to develop the international proletarian movement more. Mao  said: "If a revolutionary party..." which is the single axis and  the great fortress. We must defend and strengthen it against  everything because the political and ideological structure is  decisive in a protracted People's War.  <H5>  End of the propaganda. </H5>   6. With masses and a party, anything can be accomplished.  Let us handle the general military withdrawal, a consequence of  the general political withdrawal. It is complex, difficult, but  necessary.

Define today's main target within the current context.    4. The issue is to handle sagaciously the objective  convergence field. R'oo Rx'. [sentence as published]    5. It is a peace agreement between the PCP [Peruvian  Communist Party] and the Armed Forces through the government.  Our political positions have been confirmed, we told them how  to resolve PCP-Armed Forces contradictions and this is what is  happening.     -  To develop struggles between two lines, seeking unity,  strive for the disbandment to be as little as possible; the  party is politically strong but we must be aware that only a few  may remain, only the best; the best defense is to attack. Let  the militants become a revealing mirror of the infamous attacks  perpetrated by the enemy, not even the Armed Forces act like  that.    -  The other side also has a very clear objective: that we  will never raise our heads again; that there will never be  another People's War. No one can deny that it is using this  issue to win today's referendum and the future reelection  because the Peruvian State's long-term plan must be restructured  and promoted.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- The negotiations  between Dniester and Moldovan sides are temporarily suspended;  the Chisinau officials made a break "to calm the passions" after  different political forces criticized the signing of the  Snegur-Smirnov declaration, stated yesterday Valeri Litskai,  state secretary of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, on  Asket TV in Tiraspol. In his opinion, other reasons for this  suspension would include the fact that Chisinau is preoccupied  with the settlement of the Gagauz problem and that the results  of the presidential elections in the Ukraine are awaited.  Litskai declared that Moldova speculates on Dniester's  financial difficulties. Dniester cannot obtain from Russia the  coupons printed there, thus causing an acute crisis of cash.  According to him, Russia declared that it would send the  coupons to Tiraspol when an agreement between Chisinau and  Dniester leaders is signed. Litskai pointed out that the  Tiraspol leadership insisted for three weeks that Snegur meet  Smirnov, but it received no answer. He said that nevertheless,  the prospects of settling the conflict are favorable and gave as  example the signing of an agreement between Russia and  Tatarstan. According to him, the contribution of Russian and  CSCE mission mediators to the settlement of the conflict has  been substantial and constructive. Nevertheless, Moldova will be  a potential enemy for Dniester, as it fortifies its armed forces  and refuses to demilitarize, stated Litskai.</p>

The cease-fire, which began  midnight Sunday [30 December], is to be backed by the disarming  of the rival forces and the effective return of people to their  permanent areas of residence.    In a two-day meeting which started Friday, parliamentarians  agreed to set up a peacekeeping force as recommended by the  Inter- Regional Committee for Peace, created for the purpose.  The committee has ordered road blocks removed off the streets  and also that rail traffic be resumed between Brazzaville and  Loutete, some 40 kilometres to the south. It has asked  government to make the public media available to political  parties. It ordered the closure of private jails and the  release of all individuals illegally detained. It also said  schools, universities and all administration offices in the Pool  region and in the southern districts of Brazzaville (Bacongo,  Makelekele and Mfilou) must open immediately.</p>

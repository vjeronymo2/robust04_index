			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANKERS ARE CHEAPEST WAY TO SHIP OFFSHORE OIL -- STUDY  </P> <P> As oil from a ruptured tanker laps at the beaches of Orange County, a final  study released Friday supports Chevron Corp.'s argument that it would be  cheaper to ship crude oil by tanker from its Point Arguello offshore project  than by pipeline or other means.  </P> <P> The study, completed by consultants Arthur D. Little Inc. for Santa Barbara  County, concludes that it would cost $2.55 to $2.65 a barrel for tankers to  carry oil to Los Angeles from the $2-billion project.  </P> <P> Three drilling platforms were built off the Santa Barbara County coast and  other aspects of the project were completed two years ago. But no oil has been  produced, and regulators continue to wrangle over the transportation issue.  </P> <P> Options other than using tankers -- including shipping the oil by various  combinations of pipelines and rail routes -- could cost between $2.85 and $6.25  per barrel according to the $400,000 study, which was commissioned by the  county and paid for by Chevron.  </P> <P> Tanker opponents -- including environmental groups and pipeline operators --  argued that the study underestimated the costs of using tankers and  overestimated the costs of pipeline shipment.  </P> <P> Even if tankering is cheaper, Chevron "should bear some of the expense for  being environmentally safer," said Carole Ann Cole, spokeswoman for Get Oil  Out, a local group opposed to the use of tankers.  </P> <P> Chevron was pleased with the findings. But spokesman G. Michael Marcy did not  expect any quick decision on the company's request for a tanker permit --  particularly in the wake of the Orange County spill.  </P> <P> The study was conducted as part of the county's process of reviewing a permit  request by Chevron to tanker oil from the project, which is owned by a  consortium of 18 oil companies. An earlier permit was revoked by the state  Coastal Commission after protests from community groups.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China  (BOC), the country's state foreign trade and exchange bank, has  agreed to provide a huge sum in export seller's credit to  finance the launching of foreign satellites.    BOC officials said the 900 million yuan loan (about 100  million U.S. dollars) is the biggest single export seller's  credit the bank has ever provided since it started such business  in 1980.    The second biggest sum of export seller's credit was made to  China Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation in  December 1993, at a total amount of 690 million yuan.    The deal was sealed here today between the Bank of China and  the Great Wall Industry Corporation, which specializes in  research and production of carrier rockets.    China announced last month that it will launch some 30  foreign satellites of different types from 1994 to around the  year 2000.    The Great Wall Industry Corporation will send three foreign  satellites into space in 1994, according to an official with the  corporation.    The corporation is also negotiating with the newly  established Import and Export Bank of China for more financial  support for its satellite launching business.    As a main export credit provider, the Bank of China has so  far provided 13 billion yuan export seller's credits to support  the production and export of complete sets of equipment, cargo  ships, aircraft, and automobiles to international satellite  launching.    It has also provided export buyer's credits totaling 160  million U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Commission rejects cartel plan The European Commission has firmly rejected proposals by the German government to hand responsibility for decisions on European cartel cases to an independent body of experts. The proposal was put forward by Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, as part of the programme for Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union. But the Commission, whose fourth directorate general is responsible for competition cases, argues that an independent body would lack the political sensitivity required to get the right balance between member states. The Germans would like to see a European cartel office modelled on its own Bundeskartellamt. Brussels fears that this could give too much power back to the member states. Last year some 1,250 cases involving restrictive agreements and abuses of dominant positions came before the Commission.</p>

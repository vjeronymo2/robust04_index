			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GURNEY'S 'COCKTAIL HOUR' IS SOBER SLICE OF LIFE  </P> <P> A.R. Gurney may be the closest thing America has to Britain's Alan Ayckbourn.  One doesn't laugh quite as loud or as hard at Gurney's plays, draped as they  are over a rigid New England frame, but both men have a sense of life's  geometry that they love to translate into theater.  </P> <P> Take Gurney's "The Cocktail Hour," which opened Wednesday at the James A.  Doolittle Theatre. This is a mirror play about a son's visit home to get  permission from his father to put on a play that he has written about that  father and the rest of the family. Simple.  </P> <P> Except that you soon realize that the play you're watching cuts close to the  play in question. And we soon know precisely why the son's request unleashes  such strong reaction in the parents. It is art imitating art imitating life.  </P> <P> Pure geometry. Gurney's earlier "The Dining Room" is a play about a room and  the generations of people passing through it, acting out their pent up little  dramas. More geometry. Gurney's "Love Letters," which opened Tuesday at the  Canon Theatre, presented parallel lives connected by words crossing the literal  and philosophical miles dividing the writers. Again, geometry.  </P> <P> Gurney's territory here as ever, is WASP land -- the affluent White Anglo-Saxon  Protestant fiefdom of repressed emotions, stiff upper lips and churning  stomachs in which he grew up. Central to "The Cocktail Hour" is the cocktail  hour -- the sacred real one (which "took the place of evening prayers") and the  play of the same title that son John has written (encore geometry). Gurney has  gone to the altar this time: the daily ritual of an aging, rigidly conservative  upper-middle class, in this case at odds with a progeny wanting to break free.  </P> <P> Elder son John (Bruce Davison), a publishing executive who is visiting for the  weekend to secure permission to put on his infamous play, tangles lightly with  his parents -- Bradley (Keene Curtis) and Ann (Nancy Marchand). It is done  drink in hand, in a welter of genteel conversation behind a veneer of good  manners, and interrupted only by the casual visit of John's younger sister,  Nina (Holland Taylor), who lives in this same Upstate New York town.  </P> <P> But things quickly get as heated in the living room as they do in the kitchen,  where the new maid is burning dinner. This inordinately extends the cocktail  hour, loosing tempers to speak more truth from behind diminished defenses.  </P> <P> It's soon clear that John has never felt valued by a father who's always liked  his younger brother best; that Bradley takes a dim view of John's efforts in  general, but his playwriting ones in particular; that Ann wishes John would  write books instead of plays ("books are quieter"), and that the terminally  bored Nina, who yearns to go to Cleveland to work with seeing-eye dogs, is  furious at having only a minor role in John's play when she has such a major  one in her parents' lives.  </P> <P> By the second act, disruption is complete. Confrontations abound, facades  crumble, confessions bubble up and all that WASP hypocrisy is cathartically  unmasked.  </P> <P> "The Cocktail Hour" at the Doolittle is the very one that originated in June,  1988, at the San Diego Old Globe, traveling from there to a lengthy and  respectable run at New York's Promenade before returning to Southern  California. It takes place in Steven Rubin's same stylish New England interior,  dotted with elegant 18th and 19th century pieces, and benefits from Globe  artistic director Jack O'Brien's finely tuned direction.  </P> <P> We're in luck that the cast too is the same, having merely refined what had  been splendidly synchronized performances from the start: Davison as a mass of  controlled frustrations prime for Act II's provocations and explosions; Curtis  as a model of smug and mildly distracted self-satisfaction; Marchand as the  sly, unruffled Ann, who's a lot savvier than she lets on -- and Taylor's  scattered, mildly desperate Nina who finds Big Brother a savior in the end.  </P> <P> The dialogue sparkles, the zingers fly and Gurney finds ways to cleverly take  on a variety of tantalizing subjects -- the antediluvian state of theater, the  anachronistic absurdity of writing plays (which he compares to carving a corner  of a Gothic cathedral in a computer society) and, of course, the mysterious  critics ("Who are these people anyway?").  </P> <P> Ultimately, this is top drawer drawing-room comedy and social commentary that  never quite makes the leap to Major Play. But this writer, who had reviewed the  original at the Old Globe almost 2 years ago, found a lot more to relish this  time around -- perhaps because the performances have become so expert. It is  witty, literate entertainment for lovers of the well-made, linear play.  </P> <P>  At 1615 N. Vine St., Hollywood, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; matinees  Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Until July 1. $26-$36; (213) 410-1062  or (714) 634-1300).  </P> <P> </P></p>

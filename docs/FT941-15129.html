			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Aluminium The upward drift of aluminium prices points to optimism that output cuts can be agreed when producing countries meet this week in Brussels. Given the large overhang of stocks, though, it will take more than token measures to restore the market to balance. Reducing world output by perhaps 1.5m tonnes a year would be enough to erode stocks and allow base metals bulls to push aluminium higher. Anything less would be a disappointment. Failure to reach any sort of agreement would rightly drag the price back towards the lows plumbed in the final quarter of last year. Sharing production cuts between Russian producers and those in the west is the most difficult task. The gap between US demands for a 1m tonne capacity reduction from Russia, and the Russian offer of 300,000 tonnes, will not be bridged easily. It is difficult to believe that threats of anti-dumping litigation from US producers will encourage a settlement. More imaginative solutions - such as using western aid to upgrade Russian smelters, which would reduce output for a spell - might help. But Russia will be unwilling to shoulder the burden of real cutbacks alone, not least because aluminium exports are a useful source of hard currency. Alcan's decision last week to cut 156,000 tonnes annual output may set the tone for a wider agreement if other western companies are willing to follow the lead. Experience in basic industries suggests that, even if overall targets are agreed, a lengthy period of haggling among European and North American companies will follow.</p>

But he added that land was being returned quicker at the  moment. He said in 1991-1992, the documents returning the  property were handed to 12.6 thousand former landowners and only  in 1993 -- 25.2 thousand.    Slezevicius said the reform would be speeded up when local  authorities hire enough officials working with the land issues.</p>

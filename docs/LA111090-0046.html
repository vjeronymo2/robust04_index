			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL FANS TIRED OF BEING SUCKERED  </P> <P> I see the Angels have once again raised ticket and parking prices for season  ticket-holders, their best customers. Given the continuing mediocrity of the  team, don't you think the Angels should be giving refunds to last year's season  ticket-holders? Or does Gene Autry agree with P.T. Barnum?  </P> <P> TOM CHAMBERS, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

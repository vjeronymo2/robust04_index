			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII SHIPS CS LONG BEACH OUT, 84-79;  </P> <P> NIT: RAINBOW WARRIORS END 49ERS' SEASON AT 23-9. HAWAII WILL PLAY AT NEW MEXICO  THURSDAY NIGHT.  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach's best basketball season in 16 years came to an end here  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The 49ers lost to the University of Hawaii, 84-79, in the second round of the  National Invitation Tournament before a sellout crowd of 7,617 in Blaisdell  Arena.  </P> <P> Long Beach finished the season 23-9.  </P> <P> Hawaii (25-9), which will advance to play at New Mexico Thursday night, got  three-point plays from Chris Gaines and Vincent Smalls in the last 2:12.  </P> <P> Those gave the Rainbows a 77-72 lead.  </P> <P> Tyrone Mitchell's two free throws then cut it to 77-74 with 1:09 to play.  </P> <P> But Terry Houston of Hawaii made one of two free throws to make it 78-74.  </P> <P> Frankie Edwards then went to the line for the 49ers with 42 seconds left and  made two shots to pul the 49ers within 78-76.  </P> <P> After a Long Beach timeout, the 49ers fouled Houston with 38 seconds left and  then called another timeout.  </P> <P> Houston made both ends of a one-and-one.  </P> <P> Long Beach guard Lucious Harris, who had scored only one point in the second  half after scoring 15 in the first half, then shot an air ball.  </P> <P> After a scramble, the 49ers got the ball back and Harris was fouled. He made  the first shot, missed the second and the 49ers lost the rebound out of bounds.  </P> <P> Gaines clinched the victory with two free throws with 13 seconds left.  </P> <P> The 49ers did not appear intimidated by the screaming Rainbow fans who waved  the two-foot-long green leaves of the ti plant for good luck.  </P> <P> After a power move inside by Mitchell, the 49ers had a 13-7 lead with 14:50  left in the first half.  </P> <P> The 49er press bothered Hawaii and forced four early turnovers. With about 12  minutes left in the half, Bobby Sears made a steal in the backcourt that led to  a reverse dunk by Troy Joseph that gave the 49ers a 17-13 lead.  </P> <P> Mike Masucci came off the bench to score three baskets for the 49ers, his third  giving Long Beach a 26-20 lead.  </P> <P> But Hawaii's Troy Bowe, the smallest player on the court at 5 feet 10, scored  after grabbing a rebound and then, 20 seconds later, he made a driving layup to  cut the lead to 26-24 with 8:28 left in the half.  </P> <P> Mitchell was unstoppable inside, but his inability to make free throws -- he  missed the rim on one attempt -- got the crowd and the Rainbows back in the  game.  </P> <P> After two missed free throws by Mitchell, Hawaii went on a 6-0 run to take a  30-28 lead as the 49ers had trouble keeping them off the offensive boards.  </P> <P> Mitchell came back with a drive to tie the score at 30-30, then Harris, who had  scored 90 points in his last four games, began to take over.  </P> <P> He made two free throws, a layup and a bank shot, then lobbed a perfect pass to  Frankie Edwards, who dunked.  </P> <P> That surge, followed by a rebound basket by Masucci, put the 49ers ahead,  42-36.  </P> <P> A bank shot from three-point range at the buzzer by Darrell Faulkner gave the  49ers a 48-43 lead at the half.  </P> <P> Long Beach went into the locker room knowing it was 18-0 this season in games  in which the 49ers led at the half.  </P></p>

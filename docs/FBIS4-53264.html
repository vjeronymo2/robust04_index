			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by NODONG SINMUN reporter Chong Yong-chol] </F>   [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught:  We should properly build bases to produce substitute fuels,  such as methane gas or metanthracite, throughout counties and  other rural communities and, also, should strive to increase  substitute fuel production so that tractors, automobiles, and  agricultural machines can properly use it.    Some time ago, we visited a methane gas plant at a village  located in Taesan-ri, Chongju County. The methane gas plant is  operated by one person.    The plant has a round shape with a ferment room on the  second  floor and machine room, compressor room, and supply room on the  first floor. First, we visited the ferment room.    A functionary of the cooperative farm said: "How nice it is  to build, with our own might, such an outstanding tank to  produce methane gas!"    After hearing from him, we went to the supply room through  the compressor room. Many pipelines have been laid in the  supply room to transport gases to automobiles and other  agricultural machines.    Comrade Kim Hyo-song, secretary of the ri party, said that  "We are widely using methane gas to operate machine facilities."  According to his remarks, the cooperative farm has properly  built the base to produce methane gas and, above all, formulated  plans to use it for use by agricultural machines. Therefore,  automobiles, rice transplanting machines, weeders, and  small-sized harvest machines are being operated using the gases.    The methane gas production base built by the cooperative  farm's own might has greatly improved the rural people's  standard of living. Also, the cooperative farm uses methane gas  to operate generators.    The gas pipelines between the supply room and the rural  dwellings are connected like a spider's web.    We visited a family at No. 10 workshop village, where a  housewife was preparing a lunch by using a gas stove. We use  methane gas byproduct as a good quality fertilizer.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL;  </P> <P> CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> SECTION'S DEFENDING CHAMPIONS HAVE A COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL NIGHT  </P> <P> Although La Jolla has appeared in the San Diego Section 2-A or Division II  final volleyball finals for the past eight years, the pendulum has swung more  in favor of USDHS lately.  </P> <P> La Jolla won four consecutive titles from 1982-85 but has now lost to the Dons  in the past four championship matches, including a 15-11, 8-15, 15-5, 15-11  decision Saturday at San Pasqual High School.  </P> <P> All three defending champions -- USDHS, Poway in Division I and Francis Parker  in Division III -- won in the tripleheader of section title matches.  </P> <P> "La Jolla's much improved by this match," USDHS Coach Rob Gorney said. "But we  were really up for them. I thought our attack and our defense were strong."  </P> <P> Both schools are representatives of the Western League. Second-seeded La  Jolla's only two losses in the league were to top-seeded USDHS, both in four  games.  </P> <P> But it was a wonder La Jolla (18-2) even got this far, what with a graduation  toll of nine starters and with three starting sophomores. La Jolla defeated  previously unbeaten Escondido in three games in the semifinals.  </P> <P> "It's a bit of a consolation," said La Jolla Coach Vicki Eveleth, "but any time  you get this far and lose, it's tough."  </P> <P> Junior Michelle Rico had 23 kills and senior Amy Siedlinger had 13 kills and  seven blocked shots to lead USDHS (19-2).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Division I  </P> <P> Top-seeded Poway (19-0), ranked fourth in the state, defeated second-seeded  Palomar League rival Torrey Pines, 16-14, 15-7, 15-8, for its fifth section  title in eight years.  </P> <P> The meeting between Poway and Torrey Pines, ranked ninth in the state, was the  third this season. The Titans won the first two in four games.  </P> <P> "This time it was just three," Poway Coach Lisa Reis said. "The only way they  could have lost is if they had laid down and died."  </P> <P> They did no such thing. In a somewhat shaky first game, where the lead changed  six times, Poway pulled out the two-point victory, then got down to business in  the second game. The closest the Falcons came was 9-7.  </P> <P> "Their level just rose," Torrey Pines Coach Jim Harrah said. "We didn't let  down. We just let it get away from us in the second game."  </P> <P> The Titans were down, 8-3, in the third game, but Poway's front line kept  pounding shots deep into Torrey Pines back court, and the Titans won the next  12 points and the match.  </P> <P> Senior Christy Fortney said this games marks the end of a season and a  beginning of a new one for Poway, which will begin play in the Southern  California Regionals Tuesday. (Seedings and sites will be announced today.)  </P> <P> "This was our biggest game," she said, "but this is when our season starts."  </P> <P> Even a first round victory would be a milestone. No Division I or II team from  San Diego has ever gotten past the first round in the state tournament.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Division I  </P> <P> 1-A Championship  </P> <P> Three-time defending state and four-time defending section 1-A/Division III  Francis Parker defeated Christian, 15-2, 15-11, 15-13. Mary Burt had 12 kills,  and Juli Cheskaty added eight.  </P> <P> First-year Coach Doug Huffman said there was pressure in inheriting a program  with such success, but having four returning players with state playoff  experience helped.  </P></p>

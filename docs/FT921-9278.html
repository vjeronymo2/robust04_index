			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / 35 Vietnamese boat-people deported from Hong Kong A Vietnamese father carrying his child waves farewell to Hong Kong yesterday before boarding an aircraft flying them and 34 other boat-people back to their homeland. Yesterday's deportation, reports Reuter, was the third since Vietnam agreed last October to take back a number of people who were deemed by the British colony to have fled poverty rather than political persecution. Vietnam yesterday welcomed the return and expressed sorrow at the deaths of 23 boat-people burnt alive in a Hong Kong camp riot last week. It urged that those considered responsible be put on trial.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Raytheon plant closures in UK spark protests Raytheon of the US is to close the UK corporate jet business it bought from British Aerospace and transfer the work to Kansas with the loss of 850 British jobs over the next three years. The decision provoked a storm of protest in Britain immediately after its announcement yesterday by the industrial group, which acquired the BAe business for Pounds 250m (Dollars 387m) last year. Representatives of the opposition Labour party and trade unions called on Mr Michael Heseltine, the British trade and industry secretary, to intervene to stop Raytheon closing its two UK facilities near Chester in northwest England and Hertfordshire in the south of the country. Raytheon currently leases both plants from BAe. The US company, which also announced it was suspending production of the Hawker 1000 business jet and slowing production of the smaller Hawker 800 jet, said the move reflected difficulties in the recession-hit corporate jet market. 'The timing of this decision is principally driven by the current weak market conditions and substantiated by the results of a recently completed study by Raytheon after it acquired Corporate Jets from British Aerospace,' the US company said. As part of the overall rationalisation of its corporate aircraft activities, Raytheon is also cutting 630 jobs in the US. The company is merging its Beech Aircraft subsidiary with the former BAe corporate jet activities into the Raytheon Aircraft Company based in Wichita, Kansas. Apart from poor market conditions, Raytheon said its recently completed study of its aircraft businesses concluded that merging Hawker and Beech aircraft production would achieve significant cost savings. Raytheon said final assembly of Hawker jets would start being moved to Wichita next year. 1997. Engineering activities will also be moved to Wichita. It added it was immediately cutting 170 out of 550 jobs in Cheshire, where Hawker business jets are assembled, and 143 out of 300 jobs at its Hertfordshire design, engineering and marketing facility. The remaining jobs at both plants will go by 1997, although several UK employees will be offered jobs in the US. Since the sale to Raytheon, former BAe employees had been worried about the ultimate intentions of the US company and the strong possibility it would eventually transfer production to the US. But yesterday's announcement still came as a big shock to staff. Mr Tony Lloyd, the Labour party's employment spokesman, said it was 'outrageous that an American company can move in, buy an order book and then close down forever the plants with the consequences for skilled employment'.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Resilient food prices raise RPI THE SMALL rise in the headline rate of inflation last month from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent was mainly because food prices fell by less than normal for the time of year. Last year the drop in food prices in July was exceptionally sharp whereas this year the fall was 0.1 per cent. Most fresh vegetables and home-killed lamb were cheaper but there were price rises for milk, cereals, some biscuits and cakes. The 2.8 per cent fall in seasonal food prices compared with June was the smallest for any July since 1983. In spite of the relative resilience of food prices, a breakdown of the retail prices index shows there are still strong deflationary pressures in the economy and the July rate remained close to June's 30-year low of 1.2 per cent. One of the main factors behind the low June figure was the early start to summer sales. This appears to have continued into July in many sectors, with shopkeepers fearing a large drop in demand if they raise prices. For household goods, prices fell by 1.2 per cent compared with June, reflecting widespread sale offers on furniture and electrical appliances. There were increases, however, for pet foods. Prices for clothing and footwear fell 3.5 per cent compared with June. Clothes were only 0.4 per cent dearer than in the same month a year ago. The combined June and July falls for household goods were the sharpest for the time of year since 1956, and for clothing and footwear since 1914. The only other component of the RPI in which prices fell on the month was leisure goods. The Central Statistical Office said the 0.9 per cent month-on-month fall reflected reductions in the prices of hi-fi equipment and videos, as well as toys and newspapers. Prices of household services rose by 1.1 per cent compared with June, partly because of an end to special reductions for local 'cheap-rate' telephone calls. There were also increases in some insurance premiums and trade union subscriptions. Housing costs rose a slim 0.1 per cent, reflecting a continuing rise in the average outstanding mortgage debt. There was no change in mortgage interest rates compared with a small fall in July last year. Inflation may rise again this month. The CSO said prices of seasonal food usually rise in August, although prices for fresh fruit and vegetables have fluctuated widely in recent months. Further increases in pub beer prices are also expected. As sales end, a recovery in prices of audio-visual equipment is also likely.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Russia's enrollment in the  Partnership for Peace program is an important step indicating  the country's determination to participate in the European  cooperation process as an equal partner, says Lithuanian Deputy  Foreign Minister Albinas Januska.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed NATO's  cooperation plan in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher in Brussels Wednesday [22 June].    In an interview with BNS, Januska also emphasized the  significance of other accords between Russia and NATO, which  will create "clear and stable relations, enhance stability and  security in Europe."    The Lithuanian official said a separate political agreement  between Russia and the alliance proves that Partnership for  Peace cannot resolve all problems hindering stability in Europe,  but is only a part of a possibly much wider strategy.    "It is evident in this context that certain consultations  between NATO and Russia, carried out beyond the partnership  framework, concerning nuclear arms, their control, problems of  mutual disarmament, restrictions on deployment of troops and hot  lines for cases of potential conflicts, are understandable in  creating an atmosphere of trust in Europe," the deputy minister  said.    In Januska's words, Lithuania may also be interested to  develop a program for wider cooperation with NATO. Considering  Lithuania's determination to become a fully-fledged member of  the alliance, and how Lithuania's individual needs to cooperate  with NATO will be evaluated, possibilities of a wider accord  between Lithuania and NATO could be discussed, at the same time  expanding practical cooperation within the partnership program,  Januska said.    Hopefully, the deputy minister said, a role in building  European security will be given not only to big, important and  well-armed countries, but also to nations, which found  themselves in an uncertain security situation not through their  own fault.</p>

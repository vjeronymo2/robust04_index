This conclusion was drawn  today at its first session by the information judicial chamber,  which examined an appeal of the guild of parliamentary  journalists.    Valentin Sergeyev, head of the government press service,  gave  explanations on the incident. He said it had taken place when  he had not been there, and the cause of the incident was some  technical complications, connected with the moving of the  Cabinet of Ministers to the "White House".    Commenting on the resolution of the judicial chamber, its  Deputy Chairman Igor Yeremin said that "one should not dramatize  the situation and present an individual fact as a trend." At  the same time, the chamber's resolution suggested that the legal  status, rights and duties of press services of state bodies, as  well as matters related to the accreditation of journalists,  should be clearly reflected in the legislation.</p>

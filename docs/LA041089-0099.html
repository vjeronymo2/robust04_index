			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY PERFORMS  </P> <P> Blame the earthquake for a sparse turnout at the Newport Harbor Art Museum on  Saturday night. Those few without fear of aftershocks were rewarded with string  playing of a high order from members of the Southwest Chamber Music Society.  </P> <P> The ambitious and adventurous program provided tremors of a musical sort in  Wuorinen's String Quartet No. 3 (1987). This knotty yet cohesive work may well  daunt those accustomed to a modern diet of saccharine minimalism. It may have  daunted the players a bit too, from the look of it: Erstwhile horn player Jeff  von der Schmidt essayed the role of conductor.  </P> <P> But from the sound of it, violinists Jacqueline Brand and Kimiyo Takeya,  violist Jan Karlin and cellist Richard Treat played with far more confidence  with Schmidt directing.  </P> <P> Having received its Los Angeles premiere Friday night in a Pasadena performance  by the same forces, the single-movement work makes demands on the listener  nearly as great as on the players. Based on a Gregorian chant, the  non-programatic work moves quickly from a fireball opening to a passage where  the notes of the chant are compressed into a cluster.  </P> <P> The gradual emergence of the chant proper is the key event around which the  other parts of the piece turn. The thickets of notes, in what is overall a slow  movement that rarely pauses, can tire even the dedicated listener. But clearly  the players had both the technical resources and the commitment to do the work  justice.  </P> <P> Loosed from modern terrors, the quartet took flight in an exuberant reading of  Ravel's Quartet in F.  </P> <P> Brand's sweet sound literally set the tone for an opening movement of surging  climaxes and suave interplay. The scherzo brought brief lapses of intonation  and ensemble but emerged with its spirit intact.  </P> <P> Minus Brand, the remaining trio opened the proceedings with a stimulating  reading of Peter Warlock's arrangement of Three Fantasias by Henry Purcell.  </P></p>

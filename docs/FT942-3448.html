			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Irish political 'mould breakers' face the prospect of break-up: FT correspondents report on fallout from last weekend's European election The party which set out nine years ago 'to break the mould' of Irish politics, the Progressive Democrats (PDs), looks to be on the verge of breaking apart itself as a result of internal feuding following its humiliation in the European elections, and the first poll defeat ever for the party's founder and former leader, Mr Des O'Malley. Mr Mary Harney, the present leader, called the defeat as a 'catastrophe'. She has been criticised by some colleagues for her handling of the campaign, although senior party figures were yesterday ruling out a leadership challenge. Mr O'Malley had been chosen by the party to defend its only seat in Strasbourg. That had been won in 1989 by Mr Pat Cox, the party's deputy leader, who had achieved the distinction of gaining more votes than any other candidate in Ireland in that election. The 55-year-old Mr O'Malley resigned the leadership of the party eight months ago 'to make way for new blood' and said at the time he had made 'an absolute decision' not to run in the European elections. Ms Harney was subsequently elected party leader, defeating a challenge from Mr Cox. Then, earlier this year, she asked Mr O'Malley to reconsider his decision and to take over Mr Cox's seat. This he duly did, precipitating Mr Cox's resignation from the party last month and his decision to run as an independent candidate. The two were neck-and-neck as the successive vote transfers were counted, and the final result, which gave the seat to Mr Cox, was only announced late on Monday. Nationally, the party only polled 6.5 per cent. Ms Harney yesterday indicated that those party members who had supported Mr Cox's campaign should now resign. This could widen the spilt in the party. The PDs were formed in 1985 by Mr O'Malley and Ms Harney, after they were expelled from Fianna Fail by its then leader, Mr Charles Haughey, for opposing his hardline policy on Northern Ireland, the contraceptive issue and internal party democracy. It was Mr O'Malley's threat to pull out of the 1989-92 Fianna Fail-PD coalition over a series of scandals that brought about Mr Haughey's downfall in January 1992. His subsequent public fight with Mr Albert Reynolds, who replaced Mr Haughey as prime minister, over evidence they both gave to a public inquiry into the country's huge beef industry, then brought about the collapse of the coalition and precipitated the November 1992 general election. The report of that inquiry is expected to be published shortly. Ms Harney has been a formidable performer in parliament, frequently overshadowing Mr John Bruton, leader of the main opposition Fine Gael party. But the PDs' ambition to overtake Fine Gael as the main conservative voice in Ireland has now been seriously damaged by their Euro-election debacle.</p>

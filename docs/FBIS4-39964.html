			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Yanayev report: "Criticism Could Be Heard Even at </F> the Founding Congress"]    [Text] The founding congress of the party being organized  by Yegor Gaydar, scheduled for 12 June, is attracting  considerable attention. First, because this organization is  associated with the president. Second, the congress can be seen  as an attempt to create in a country with a multitude of  minority parties the first real party of liberal-conservative  orientation. Furthermore, the party organizers are making no  secret that their main task is to ensure a second presidential  term for Boris Yeltsin or a first term for Yegor Gaydar.    Yegor Gaydar is creating his party not under the best  possible conditions, primarily because Gaydar's new party is  based on the Russia's Choice election bloc whose showing in the  December elections, according to official results, proved to be  far from what was desired. Naturally, one also cannot ignore  the general political apathy of the population, whose majority  since the CPSU days has developed a steady allergy to any  parties.    Furthermore, having invited Democratic Russia supporters to  the new party ranks, Yegor Gaydar incurred criticism from  right-wing elements for splitting the democratic movements. It  is not ruled out that they will voice their complaints at the  founding congress. Besides, even among those who agree to join  the new organization there are differences in views on the  principles of party organizational development. The former head  of government is being urged to create a party not "to fit  himself," also not to insist on rigid discipline, and to  enshrine collective leadership. Yet chances are that there will  be more Gaydar supporters at the congress -- such authoritative  figures as Sergey Filatov, Andrey Kozyrev, and Anatoliy Chubays  are expected to attend -- and therefore the new party will be  established, and Gaydar himself will be elected its leader.  Incidentally, according to information received from the  Russia's Choice leadership, Yegor Gaydar has so far not been  able to obtain assurances that Boris Yeltsin will be present at  the founding congress.    In spite of all the problems, the new organization's  potential capabilities look fairly serious. Rigid discipline,  Gaydar's regular meetings with Yeltsin -- giving the party some  additional weight -- free access for its functionaries to the  corridors of power, and considerable financial resources -- all  this gives reason to suppose that Russia's Choice (unless, that  is, its name is changed) will become one of the major political  parties in the country.  <H5>  From the Russia's Choice Draft Program: </H5>   --It is necessary to defeat inflation. The state budget  deficit must be covered by floating state securities.    --A most important task is to reduce the tax burden,  stimulating business activity.    --Encouragement of domestic and foreign investments should  be  accompanied by the provision of preferential conditions for  small and medium-sized businesses. --A major prerequisite for  economic growth is privatization. We are for protection of  private property obtained legitimately from legal sources, and  we are against private property living off state property like a  parasite.    --The party's agrarian policy envisions completion of reform  in the countryside and formation of an effective property  structure.</p>

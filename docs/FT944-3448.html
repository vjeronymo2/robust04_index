			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Albrighton Albrighton, the USM-quoted quarrying company, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 324,000 to Pounds 105,000 on turnover more than doubled from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 4.21m for the six months to end-September. The increase in turnover - largely the result of acquisitions made in the second half last year - had been below budget, directors said. This, coupled with other factors, had led to an unfavourable product mix and higher costs over the period, they added. After a Pounds 10,000 profit from an associate undertaking, against a of Pounds 29,000, and increased interest payable of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 73,000), earnings came out at 0.1p (0.6p) per share. The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.1p.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / US forces must run own show, say congressmen THE mounting US death toll in Somalia has redoubled demands in Washington that the US assert control over operations involving its troops. Members of Congress rammed home the message to President Bill Clinton in a meeting at the White House yesterday morning that their limited tolerance for a continued US presence in Somalia would be greatly reduced if they could not be assured that US forces would remain under US command. 'My point was to ensure that this was an American plan and was going to be controlled by Americans,' said Senator Bob Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, after the meeting. US forces have in practice almost always remained under the ultimate command of a US officer. From General Dwight Eisenhower in the second world war, by way of Gen Douglas MacArthur and Gen Matthew Ridgway in Korea, to Gen Norman Schwarzkopf in the Gulf, the US has provided the commander-in-chief for multinational operations. It continues by trad-ition to appoint the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (Saceur) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. It becomes more difficult to insist on US command of a particular operation, however, while seeking to minimise the size of the US commitment. Already this summer, members of Congress with big military bases in their districts returned from recess with questions about the command structure under which US troops were operating in Somalia. Last Sunday's bloodshed has reinforced US doubts about the wisdom of ceding control of their troops. Specific complaints about muddled chains of command, language problems and incompatible tactics have merged with long-held US suspicions, dating back to U Thant's term as United Nations secretary general in the 1960s, about whose side the UN is on. US concerns have been further coloured by occasionally xenophobic views on the reliability of troops from other nations taking part in the UN force. Some US newspapers questioned the willingness of Malaysian and Pakistani troops to come to the rescue of US soldiers trapped in Sunday's bloody fighting in Mogadishu. The command issue has already arisen in Bosnia, where the US has sought to insist on Nato's leadership - and so, de facto, a US commander in chief - while France has argued that the Saceur command structure is inappropriate for peacekeeping operations and asserted UN supremacy.</p>

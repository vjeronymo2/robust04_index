			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 8 (TANJUG) -- Opposition parties in  the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia -- the Democratic Party and the  Democratic Party of Serbia -- on Wednesday welcomed the signing  of the agreement on a one-month ceasefire in the former Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but underscored that this should  be just the first step towards a lasting truce.    Assessing that even a brief truce was better than a  continuation of the conflicts and that the Bosnian Serb  delegation has once again shown, by accepting the agreement,  that it wants the war to end, the Democratic Party pointed out  that the best solution would be the acceptance of the Bosnian  Serb delegation's proposal on a permanent ceasefire. By  insisting on a one-month ceasefire, the Moslem side has shown  that it is not interested in a serious negotiating process,  because it is clear to everyone that a peace accord cannot be  reached in such a short time, the Democratic Party said in its  statement which was sent to TANJUG.    According to the ceasefire agreement which was signed on  wednesday by special United Nations envoy for former Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi and Vice-Presidents Ejup Ganic of the  Moslem-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Nikola  Koljevic of the Bosnian Serb Republic, the warring sides have  pledged to refrain from all military activities for one month as  of 12:00 hrs local time on June 10.    Akashi had proposed a four-month ceasefire agreement, the  Bosnian Serb delegation had been for a lasting ceasefire, but  the Moslem- Croat side had insisted that the maximum period be  four weeks.    In a statement sent to TANJUG, tha Democratic Party of  Serbia  assessed that the signing of the Geneva agreement was still far  from lasting peace, but that it should nevertheless be applauded  as the fwrst step towards an end to the human suffering. From  the diplomatic aspect, it is good that the Bosnian Serb  delegation, despite the evident concessions to the Moslems who  have always so far undermined the peace process, has once again  shown flexibility and signed the document which can lead to a  lasting ceasefire and a demarcation process, the Democratic  Party of Serbia said. The Democratic Party of Serbia has  understanding for the Serb side's dissatisfaction in Geneva, but  diplomatic patience is necessary at this time which will be  certain to bring lasting peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  statement said.    The Democratic Party, underscoring that the Bosnian Serb  delegation has shown once again by accepting even such a short  ceasefire that it is taking the peace talks seriously and that  it wants the war to end. The Democratic Party pointed out that  it is therefore all the more surprising that Yugoslav President  Zoran Lilic should have said that the Bosnian Serb leaders were  not constructive, thus weakening their negotiating position at  the time when the agreement was being signed. The Democratic  Party of Serbia also criticized Lilic for this in a statement  released earlier today. Lilic on Tuesday said that Yugoslav  citizens cannot be hostages of any one leader or part of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or the Bosnian Serb Republic, or  the republic of Serb Krajina in former Croatia.</p>

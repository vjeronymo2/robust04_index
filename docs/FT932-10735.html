			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Dressing for the seabed - Worth Watching The technology to send divers to the seabed clad only in a metal suit is the stuff of science fiction programmes. But a patented rotary joint means such suits are a flexible - and less expensive - alternative to robotic vehicles for repairing oil rig damage at depths of over 300 metres. Developed by International Hard Suits, of Vancouver, the Newtsuit has some 20 fluid-filled rotary joints, which the company estimates gives the diver 90 per cent of his or her normal dexterity. A thruster pack allows divers to change direction. UK marine contractor Rockwater is supplying Newtsuit-clad divers as a service to the offshore oil industry. International Hard Suits: Canada, 604 986 5600. Rockwater: UK, 0224 722877.</p>

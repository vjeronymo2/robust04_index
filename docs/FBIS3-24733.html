Mr Mlambo was speaking in Transkei, where he was trying to  defuse dissatisfaction of some PAC leaders and members over the  announcement of the suspension of the organisation's armed  struggle. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio  news quoted Mr Mlambo as saying the PAC's policy until now had  been that the bullet would not be abandoned before the ballot  was secured. Three PAC members, including Publicity and  Information Secretary Waters Toboti, remain suspended after  voicing disagreement over the suspension of the armed struggle.</p>

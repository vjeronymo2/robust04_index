			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Investigative Police Director Nelson Mery has  stated that the arrest in Osorno of Rosa Ester Vargas [aka  Negra] -- one of the most wanted terrorists -- has revealed the  crisis affecting the Mapu-Lautaro Group because she is an  ``operative'' who was acting in a leadership post of this  terrorist organization.    The police said that Lautaro Group leader Guillermo Ossandon  is ``trapped and alone'' because he has lost most of his leaders  and contacts. [passage omitted]    Nelson Mery asserted that following the arrest of Rosa Ester  Vargas it can be asserted that, from the organizational  viewpoint, the Lautaro group is experiencing a crisis.    Mery added: ``Proof of this is that Negra Ester has been  occupying political or leadership posts within the movement  although she is merely trained to carry out operations.''  [passage omitted]    Police sources in Santiago disclosed that Lautaro leader  Guillermo Ossandon (aka Diego Carvajal) has spent these past few  months in Osorno, ``depressed and shaken after seeing his  accomplices arrested, one by one.''    It was stated that ``Ossandon is trapped and alone. He has  experienced critical moments these past few days following the  arrest of his main aides.'' Ossandon had allegedly withdrawn to  undergo psychological treatment.    Moreover, police spokesman Luis Cariz said there is no proof  about the rumors within the Lautaro group that Guillermo  Ossandon wants to become a politician. [passage omitted]</p>

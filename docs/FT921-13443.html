			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Industry shake-up opens airways over new Europe - Modernisation and western alliances are transforming airlines east of the Elbe THE emergence of Air France as leader of a consortium to buy a 40 per cent stake in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), the Czechoslovak national airline, has heated up the competition to restructure the air transport industry from the Elbe River to the Pacific Ocean. With an eye on the potential for rapid business and tourist traffic growth in central Europe, western airlines and aircraft makers are seeking new partners and new customers. Significantly, the CSA announcement coincided with confirmation from Polskie Linie Lotnicze (LOT), the Polish state airline, that it had disposed of the bulk of its Soviet-built aircraft fleet to Air Ukraine, one of a number of new national airlines emerging from the parallel dissolution of Aeroflot and the Soviet Union. Mr Bronislaw Klimaszewski, LOT president, has consistently made clear his belief that the Polish company, the largest of the central European airlines, would have to dispose of its fleet of Soviet-built aircraft before being able to attract a foreign partner. Warsaw, with its soon-to-be-completed air terminal, is competing with Prague and Budapest to become the leading hub airport for east and central Europe. One, or a series, of new hub airports in the centre of the continent will be needed to relieve pressure on overcrowded west European air space. Which location emerges as the most important hub will depend largely on the choice of foreign partner and the sort of traffic volumes it can generate. LOT's success in selling its seven long-range Ilyushin-62s and 10 virtually obsolete Antonov-24 short-haul turbo-jets to the fledgling Ukrainian airline has gone a long way toward improving LOT's chances of finding a western partner. It is left with 14 medium-range Tupolev-154s and a handful of smaller Tu-134s still to sell. The emergence of new national airlines in the former Soviet Union provides a unique chance to off-load thirsty, obsolescent and sometimes dangerous Soviet-built aircraft. The only alternative market is China, which also flies large numbers of Soviet aircraft and is used to the problem of obtaining, and often re-working, ill-fitting spare parts for engines and airframes. LOT has held preliminary talks with a number of western airlines, including Air France, Lufthansa and El Al, and has also partially re-equipped with leased western aircraft. It flies two Boeing 767s on its transatlantic route with another to be delivered soon. After cancelling a deal to acquire aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, LOT recently signed a Dollars 300m deal for nine Boeing 737s to renew its fleet for European routes. It is also taking delivery of eight Franco-Italian ATR-72 turboprops to complete its fleet of all-western aircraft. LOT's search for a western partner is mirrored by Malev, the Hungarian national airline which already operates out of a smart new airport in Budapest. Malev, which reported a Dollars 15m profit last year, already leases three Boeing 737-200s and one BA-146. It also recently re-painted and re-furbished to western standards the interiors of its current fleet of 12 Tu-154s and six Tu-134s. Malev's search for a foreign partner is being orchestrated by Credit Suisse First Boston. But it is in the former Soviet Union itself that some of the biggest changes are happening, both in the airline and the aircraft industries. Aeroflot, which has a fleet of over 3,000 fixed-wing passenger and transport aircraft, flies more than 132m passengers annually. But growing shortages of aviation fuel and a rapidly-ageing fleet are now causing havoc. Although perceived as a highly-centralised operation, Aeroflot has actually long operated as a series of linked operating companies. It is now splitting into a plethora of independent national airlines, and faces the prospect of competition on internal routes for the first time. Last year, British Airways took a 31 per cent stake in a joint venture with the international division of Aeroflot to create Air Russia. It will lease extended-range Boeing 767 aircraft and build a new international terminal at Moscow's Domodedovo airport. Hitherto a domestic terminal of legendary overcrowding and inefficiency, Domodedovo will become a new hub for inter-continental traffic between Europe and North America and destinations in south-east and east Asia. Typically, aircraft would leave London, Paris, Frankfurt and other European cities for the relatively short flight to Domodedovo. The flights would all arrive within minutes. Passengers would then board ongoing flights to Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo or Bangkok. Later in the day, passengers arriving on the long-haul leg from Asian capitals would transfer to the same European destinations. British Airways is investing a modest Pounds 20m in the scheme. All the aircraft will be leased, but maintained by BA. Most of the airline's income will be in hard currency, its main attraction for the Russian shareholder. Shortage of foreign currency, and the looming foreign debt crisis, places a big question mark over Aeroflot's ability to buy more western aircraft or allow domestic aircraft producers to re-equip with more fuel-efficient engines they so desperately need. The slowdown in the Soviet economy, where production fell by an estimated 15 to 20 per cent last year, has been reflected in further delays in the production of the planned new generation of Soviet passenger aircraft. The main aircraft needed by Aeroflot is the Tupolev 204, to replace the ageing medium-range Tu-154s, and the Ilyushin 96, meant to be the replacement for the Ilyushin-62, which came into service in the early 1960s. Abolition of the former central ministry, which dealt with aircraft procurement, has lead to transformation of the major design bureaux - Tupolev, Ilyushin, Mikoyan (Mig), Antonov and Yak - into production companies. Hitherto, the design bureaux competed to produce plans for military or civilian aircraft. But actual production was contracted out to the several hundred aircraft component and assembly plants which frequently assembled different models at the same plant. In theory, there is enormous potential for joint ventures between western engine and airframe manufacturers and their Soviet counterparts, whose often brilliant design teams have been handicapped up until now by Cocom restrictions on the transfer of western technology. But without western financing on a heroic scale, many of the agreements and joint ventures discussed in recent years seem destined to tread water until broader agreement is reached.</p>

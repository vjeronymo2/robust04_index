A total of 11  people engaged in large-volume drug trafficking -- (Ma Yan), (Ma  Zhigang), (Huang Zhong), (Genghis Moli), (Feng Zhenghe), (Su  Musha), (Rebiya Maimaiti), (Shadaiti Adili), (Wang Zhengbang),  (Tohai Lino), and (Yang Xujie) -- were in the first instance  sentenced to death and stripped of political rights for the rest  of their lives. The other 12 drug traffickers received either  life imprisonment or term imprisonments ranging from three to 15  years. [video opens with long shots of an assembly hall with a  capacity audience, and police escorting handcuffed criminals  into the hall; some of those sentenced are shown in closeups]    With its solemn and just punishment of these drug  traffickers, the people's court has punctured the arrogance of  drug criminals, fully shown the people's government's consistent  stance of strictly prohibiting drugs, and determination to  thoroughly wipe out all illicit drugs.</p>

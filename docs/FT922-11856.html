			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Brokers call off boycott SHARE prices jumped in Bombay yesterday as trading resumed after a three-day boycott by brokers to protest against the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) registration fees. The BSE index climbed 304.30 to 4,467.32. Last weekend, the SEBI, the new market watchdog, was forced to halve the fees, originally set at Rs500,000 for leading exchanges and Rs100,000 for small exchanges. Some observers said the strike illustrated the stockbroking community's resistance to the government's capital market reforms. The SEBI has the difficult task of purging vested interests, which include six-week settlement periods, a lack of regulation of intermediaries, unbridled speculation and insider trading.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Partners look at future of Globex project The three partners in the Globex electronic futures trading system met in New York yesterday for a day-long summit to discuss the future of the troubled project. Globex volume, while topping 600,000 in November, is still below targeted levels. Management issues have kept new exchanges, like Liffe, from joining the system, and infighting between managing partners has limited growth. Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, and Ms Rosalyn Wilton, project manager for Reuters, were expected to discuss a new governance plan for Globex and Reuter's growing dissatisfaction with the CBoT's promotion of competing after-hours trading mechanisms.</p>

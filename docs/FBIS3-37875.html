			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kazimieras Klimasauskas, Lithuanian industry </F> and trade minister, by Gediminas Koncius in Vilnius; date not  given: "Quality Goods: Will We Have Them in Lithuania?"]    [Excerpts] [Koncius] Mister Minister, the TIESA editorial  board has proposed the following regular rubric to its readers:  "May the Words `Made in Lithuania!' Sound Proudly." We intend  to write ourselves, and we are also inviting the readers,  specialists, producers, and dealers to share their views on the  production and sale of Lithuanian consumer goods.    In the opinion of the editorial board, the problems in this  sphere are numerous. Why did some enterprises fail to  restructure their production to meet market demands? Why do  many Lithuanian quality goods not have demand on the domestic  market? Why are imported goods so much in demand on our market,  the majority of which are neither better nor cheaper than ours?  We will try to stir producers' responsibility and customers'  respect for trademarks with the inscription "Made in Lithuania."    [Klimasauskas] This is a good idea. I have been thinking for  a long time that we must be a nation of nihilists. We are  unable to rejoice at our successes, a few of which we have  achieved. As true provincials, we loathe everything that is  homemade. We boast only of the past, as aged people.... Many  politicians do not even want to see the sun over their heads, to  say nothing of the obvious economic stabilization. Nor do  consumers value homemade goods on the commodity market due to  the same nihilistic attitude. Without optimism and  self-respect, however, we will not achieve anything or be  interesting to others.    We really have something to boast about. Many light industry  enterprises work stably and sell their production without  difficulty. Those who have worn Lithuanian knitted clothes,  eaten products from the dairy plant in Birzai, sat on furniture  with upholstery manufactured in "Audejas" [weaver], worn suits  made by "Lelija" [lily], drunk coffee from "Jesia's" china cups,  will not find fault with them. "Snaige" [snowflake]  refrigerators and freezers are in demand both on the domestic  and foreign markets. The output of refrigerators, portable  television sets, and bicycles climbed by 166, 110, and 107  percent, respectively, over the last year. Our estimations are  based not on the financial results that can be manipulated but  on output units. Thus, they can be trusted.    The situation in the food processing industry is more  difficult. The production of many food stuffs is declining, and  they are replaced by an increasing number of imported goods.  Lithuania is losing both the foreign market it has had and its  own market. We used to boast about "feeding Russia," but we  have become food importers.    The first reason is the improper beginning of the agrarian  reform which was a terrible blow to food producers. The second  reason is the outdated food processing industry. [passage  omitted]    Producers have already realized that they must work not for  "his majesty the plan" but for consumers. They must only find  ways for pleasing the latter.    [Koncius] The production of quality goods requires  investments. Where could we get money for up-to-date  technologies and more productive equipment?    [Klimasauskas] Lithuania has chosen such a model of  privatization which has actually produced no investments.  Investment coupons for which the new owners acquired capital  goods is not money. One cannot buy new equipment for them,  while only traders can get bank loans with a 100-percent annual  interest rate because turnover is faster in trade. Practically  no one is investing in industry because this brings no profit  today. Even a layman can notice this: New and lovely stores  open every day, but no one has heard about the construction of  new industrial enterprises. The exception is joint ventures  with foreign partners who bring their own capital earned at a  normal interest rate.    Incidentally, our people also have capital. I do not believe  those businessmen who claim that there are several billion  dollars in Lithuania. I believe, however, that the internal  unused reserves may reach $500 million in various foreign  currencies.    However, until we have a well-arranged banking system,  admit foreign banks, and peg the litas to some stable foreign  currency, we will have neither normal credits nor investments in  industry. The longer this will last, the worse and more  expensive our goods will be.    [Koncius] In your opinion, what should the exchange rate be  when tying the litas to the U.S. dollar?    [Klimasauskas] I think that neither the sheep would be hurt  nor the wolf would feel hungry if the dollar cost no less than  four litai. Such an exchange rate would satisfy exporters and  do no damage to customers in Lithuania. I believe that  international financial organizations would also approve this  exchange rate.    [Koncius] The production of quality goods requires not only  money but also ideas. Does Lithuania have a sufficient amount  of new ideas? [passage omitted]    [Klimasauskas] I have already mentioned ingenious producers.  Unfortunately, we also have many such manufacturers who failed  to offer anything to the market.    Let us take the Vilnius enterprise "Sigma," for example. I  suppose that bright heads would have really found possibilities  for producing personal computers there. Sadly, the slot  machines made at this enterprise are in low demand. [passage  omitted]    I understand perfectly well that bright heads are needed not  only in production but also in the government, because a market  economy is not chaotic, and it must be managed reasonably. The  government has done and will do its best in supporting producers  of consumer goods. However, it will promote only those who will  prove that they have their own brains.    [Koncius] The problems in trade are no less numerous.    [Klimasauskas] First of all, the Seimas must speed up the  adoption of the draft laws on trade and the protection of  consumers' rights. Until we have them, the bazaar trade will  flourish, and there will be no real competition. The absence of  these laws also impairs the effective work of trade inspection  institutions.    Only the law will allow us to combat piratical importers  from  other countries who come to us with expired goods and dishonest  competition, and without proper service and guarantees.    [Koncius] Could you personally already pronounce the words  "Made in Lithuania" with pride?    [Klimasauskas] First of all, I would like journalists to  learn to pronounce these words, because the prestige of our  goods largely depends on the press, radio, and television.

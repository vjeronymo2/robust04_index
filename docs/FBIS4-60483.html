			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister returned to New Delhi this  morning on the completion of his week-long visit to the United  States. Mr. Narasimha Rao was received at the airport by the  home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan; the civil aviation and tourism  minister, Mr. Ghlam Nabi Azad; and the Harayana chief minister,  Mr. Bhajan Lal, besides others.    As reported the prime minister's arrival in New Delhi was  slightly delayed as Air India's special aircraft carrying him  and his delegation developed a minor technical snag while  landing at Paris for a scheduled halt. A standby aircraft  already stationed at Charles de Gaulle Airport was used for the  onward journey home.    India-American business leaders have proposed creating two  new institutions on Wall Street in New York to chalk out  programs for the modernization of Indian industry. Sponsored by  the Greater Houston Partnership, the plan was presented to the  finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who accompanied the prime  minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on his just concluded U.S. visit.  A press release issued by the group says the plan envisages  creating mutual funds, venture capital funds and other debt and  equity instruments to raise capital for India in the next  decade. The release estimated a contribution of at least $100  billion by the U.S. private industries for Indian markets in the  next five years. It also said the Indian Americans have the  capacity to fund $5 billion per year for the modernization of  the country's industry.    The leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Atal  behari Vajpayee, has lauded the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha  Rao, for not succumbing to U.S. pressure on the issues of  Kashmir and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Talking to  newsmen in Lucknow, Mr. Vajpayee expressed satisfaction on the  firm stand taken on these points.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas falls on broker meetings A series of broker-hosted meetings between Ms Clare Spottiswood, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, and many of the Scottish institutions saw British Gas shares the most heavily traded of the FT-SE 100 constituents. Gas shares, one of the FT-SE 100's worst performers last week after the group issued a profits warning at its annual meeting, fell 4 1/2 , or 1.5 per cent, to 281 1/2 p yesterday compared with a 0.8 per cent decline in the Footsie. Turnover in Gas reached 13m shares. Dealers said the stock had attracted hefty selling by US institutions late last week but that much of that had been countered by keen support from UK-based income funds. There was also increasing nervousness among dealers ahead of the politically sensitive joint Department of Industry/Ofgas report on the structure of Gas, expected next Monday. A second report, prepared by Ofgas, dealing specifically with stock market sensitive areas such as rate of return and pricing formulae, is expected at the end of this month.</p>

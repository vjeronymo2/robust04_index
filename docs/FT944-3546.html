			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Company to raise funds for Labour A group of Labour party supporters in the City has set up a limited company to raise at least Pounds 100,000 for political advertising at the next general election. The company, Common Campaign, has no formal connection with Labour but the founders are all members of the party's finance and industry group, set up to tap City expertise. Mr Roger Warren Evans, managing director and a former Bovis and Sainsbury's executive, said the company hoped to raise funds from business people keen to see a change of government but unwilling to contribute directly to Labour. He said: 'There is growing personal support for Labour in business and professional circles, but it is difficult for the party to access those supporters through normal political channels. 'At election time the government has always been able to rely on a subservient Tory press, pull in large advertising funds from corporate executives with keen personal interests in a Tory victory, and gain special access to media deals. We are seeking to redress that balance. We are committed to a Labour victory and we are giving the wider business and professional community the chance to do something practical.' In an attempt to reassure supporters that the company is independent, its articles of association limit its objectives to purchasing advertising independently of Labour, and specify that it must be wound up three months after the next election. Common Campaign will observe Labour's guidelines for donations, which bar anonymous gifts, but offer confidentiality to donors of less than Pounds 5,000. Like the party, the company says it will concentrate on seeking personal donations but will consider corporate donations 'on their merits'.</p>

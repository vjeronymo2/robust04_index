			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KJOI'S FORMAT CHANGE  </P> <P> I'm sure I'm not alone in protesting KJOI-FM's format change to soft vocals and  light jazz ("KJOI to Drop Easy-Listening Format Sunday," Claudia Puig, Oct.  18).  </P> <P> What the station's research apparently didn't disclose was that a major reason  the "easy listening" format was so successful was that it provided the  (typically car-bound) listener an audio environment that fostered a sense of  ease, even reverie; sounds that were not necessarily intrusive.  </P> <P> I hope executives of the profitable station will soon be reminded of a lesson  learned by the Coca-Cola Co., which also tampered with a successful product on  the basis of misguided market research.  </P> <P> DEAN BROWN, Placentia  </P></p>

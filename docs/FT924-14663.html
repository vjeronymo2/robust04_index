			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria 3: Voters turned more thoughtful - Ian Rodger reviews a political scene very different since the presidential election THE UNEXPECTED triumph of Mr Thomas Klestil in last spring's presidential election campaign may turn out to be a watershed in Austrian politics. It was certainly an illustration of thoughtful voting - something for which Austrians had not hitherto been noted. It may mark the beginning of a recovery of the fortunes of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP). And it has already made life more complicated for the democratic socialist chancellor, Mr Franz Vranitzky. Because the former president, Mr Kurt Waldheim, was unable to fill many of his roles, Mr Vranitzky has effectively been both president and chancellor for the past five years. Now, suddenly, there is a real president expressing opinions, making speeches, visiting refugee camps and hobnobbing with foreign dignitaries. And it is not the president that Mr Vranitzky wanted. The chancellor had backed Mr Rudolf Streicher, a fellow socialist and former transport minister, in the election. In the first few weeks after Mr Klestil, a conservative, moved into the sumptuous Hofburg palace, the chancellor was looking distinctly out of sorts, prompting the media to speculate on what one magazine called Vranitzky-dammerung (the twilight of Vranitzky). According to Conservatives, it is not only the presence of Mr Klestil that depresses the chancellor, but also the whole political outlook. Mr Vranitzky has had a fairly easy ride since his party's strong showing in the 1980 election, facing few really tough decisions and knowing in any event that his opponents were in disarray. Opinion polls have consistently shown him to be the most popular politician in the country, and he has presided over the nation's affairs rather like an avuncular chairman. Now he faces a tough two years until the next general elections, filled with no-win legislation such as cutting taxes on the rich and reducing state pension benefits and raising the retirement age for all. Meanwhile, the hitherto divided and moribund OVP has a new sense of purpose following Mr Klestil's victory. The party has followed up by electing the attractive Mr Bernhard Gorg to lead it back to respectability in the city of Vienna. In last November's city election, the OVP was knocked into third place by the fast rising Austrian Freedom Party (FPO), led by Mr Jorg Haider. Mr Gorg is widely seen as a potential successor to Mr Erhard Busek, the latest in a succession of rather colourless OVP national leaders. The most sanguine Conservatives talk of forming an alliance with the FPO to displace the national coalition government. The OVP has become increasingly uncomfortable as the the junior partner to Mr Vranitzky's Democratic Socialist Party (SPO) since 1986. 'Austria has missed the great conservative trend of the 1980s,' one veteran OVP member says wistfully. At the moment, an OVP-FPO coalition is not an option, as the SPO has 80 seats, the OVP 60, the FPO 33 and the greens 10 in the federal parliament, but it could be possible after the next election. Many - perhaps most - conservatives would not contemplate an alliance with the FPO as long as Mr Haider, a controversial populist, was at its head. But they seize hope from the fact that Mr Haider has had to contend with growing dissatisfaction in his party over his purges of internal opponents and his oscillation on various policy issues. On the other hand, an FPO without Mr Haider in charge might lose so much popular support as to be of little use as a coalition partner. It was noticeable that Mr Vranitzky returned from his summer holidays last month looking refreshed and more confident than for some time. Some observers say he may not be that upset after all that Mr Streicher was beaten in the presidential election. Mr Streicher, who has since left politics to become chairman of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, was the most likely challenger within the SPO to the chancellor.</p>

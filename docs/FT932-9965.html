			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan sheds 1.9% on Fiat, Generali weakness BOURSES made a restrained start to the week with the outcome of the Danish referendum on Maastricht continuing to weigh on some investors, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN was hit by weak Fiat and Generali stocks and technical selling ahead of tomorrow's expiry of monthly options contracts and Friday's end of the monthly trading account. The Comit index shed 10.46 or 1.9 per cent to 532.62. Some investors were also disappointed not to have seen a  1/2 point cut in the discount rate from its current 11 per cent in response to the continuing strength of the lira and Friday's confidence vote victory for Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. However, Mr Nicholas Potter of Credito Italiano International in London believed that the new government would need to make progress on its additional fiscal package before the Bank of Italy would move. Fiat continued to be hit by last week's poor April car sales data and fears of a dividend cut. The shares fell L271 to fix at L6,330 before easing to L6,320 after hours. Generali dipped L1,000 to settle at L37,950 and then slipped to L37,925 after-hours as analysts sought clarification of the complex Alleanza rights issue, announced late on Friday, before concluding that it would not be unfavouable for shareholders. Alleanza fell L672 to L17,035. FRANKFURT closed marginally lower amid thin volume after early selling tested the 1,600 level. The DAX index closed down 2.89 to 1,609.03 after hitting a low 1,600.73, in turnover of DM5.3bn. Most stocks fell in line with the index. Commerzbank, however, plunged DM15 or 5.1 per cent, to DM277 on worries over Hafnia Holding, the Danish insurer which filed for bankruptcy yesterday. Commerzbank is one of Hafnia's leading creditors. Investors were slow to react to an announcement by Hoechst and Schering that talks were underway to merge the companies' agriculture chemicals sectors. While traders said the move would help the companies save costs, Hoechst fell DM2 to DM234, while Schering declined DM1 to DM768.50. ZURICH put in a firm performance with the strong dollar and hopes for lower interest rates behind a 16.5 rise in the SMI index to 2,179.1. Trading centred on UBS bearers, SFr6 higher at SFr933, and Roche certificates, SFr70 ahead at SFr4,520. CS Holding added SFr50 to SFr2,530 after Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, said that it had left the rating of Credit Suisse unchanged. PARIS was moribund ahead of the government's budget statement which came just after the close. The CAC-40 index slipped 1.36 to 1,877.21. Among the movers UAP, off FFr6 at FFr525, and Paribas, down FFr7.50 at FFr405.50, were affected by news that Hafnia was filing for bankruptcy. AMSTERDAM saw KLM move ahead Fl 1.10 to Fl 28.20 as the airline announced closer co-operation with Garuda of Indonesia and made an upbeat statement on plans with three other European airlines to defend market share. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.9 to 108.8. STOCKHOLM lost a little momentum in late trading after early gains on news of an agreement between employers and unions in the industrial sector on a new two-year contract for employees. The Affarsvarlden index closed down 0.30 at 1,068.40 in turnover of SKr1.2bn, with some profit-taking in evidence following recent strong gains. Since the beginning of the year the index has risen some 15 per cent. COPENHAGEN was hit by a latest opinion poll over the Maastricht treaty indicating a narrowing of the gap between supporters and opponents. The KFX index lost 0.48 to 87.37. The index had been strong recently on hopes of a positive vote on the May 18 referendum, but the latest Gallup poll taken Sunday showed 46 per cent approved the treaty while 34 per cent opposed the issue. Den Danske Bank was hit by Hafnia Holding, the Dutch insurer, filing for bankruptcy. The bank, a leading creditor to Hafnia along with Commerzbank of Germany, fell DKr8 to DKr319. ISTANBUL surged 6.5 per cent, the 75-share index rising 1.11 to 7,864.52.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 10                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1138.83     1139.30     1139.82     1142.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1197.43     1196.72     1198.08     1200.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1142.45     1142.43     1141.49     1142.74 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1200.70     1200.40     1202.20     1203.54  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         May 7     May 6     May 5     May 4    Apr 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1142.41   1152.03   1153.13   1148.16   1144.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1200.34   1205.10   1206.61   1207.82   1206.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1142.87; 200 - 1203.54 Low/day: 100 - 1138.48  200 - 1196.07.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paramount sees loss of up to Dollars 40m Paramount Communications, the entertainment group at the centre of a Dollars 10bn takeover battle, yesterday announced that it expected a third-quarter net loss of between Dollars 35m and Dollars 40m. The loss is due partly to a revaluation of programme inventories and partly the box office performance of Addams Family Values, a comedy horror film. The news reinforced the belief of some Wall Street analysts that Viacom and QVC Network, rival bidders for Paramount, are paying a very high price for a business with a falling financial performance. The forecast loss for the quarter to January 31 works through at 29 cents to 33 cents a share, and compares with analysts' expectations of earnings of 5 cents to 15 cents a share. In the same period of last year, Paramount lost Dollars 66.8m, or 56 cents a share, but that included a one-time charge of Dollars 66.9m for a change in accounting principles. The company said USA Network, an advertiser-supported cable channel which it owns jointly with MCA, expected to record a Dollars 78m pre-tax charge to adjust the carrying value of certain broadcast rights to net realisable value. This stems mainly from the poor ratings of the comedy series Major Dad in its debut on the network, and will leave Paramount with an Dollars 18m after-tax loss in the third quarter. Paramount also forecast a loss in its motion picture division, due to an unexpected write-down on Addams Family Values, which was released in the US last November and has taken some Dollars 46m at the domestic box office. The company said it expected its television programming operations to produce lower operating income because it was increasing production for the broadcasting networks, which involves the studio in higher up-front costs. Its publishing operations would report larger seasonal losses - although in line with its full-year business plan - primarily because of higher product development and selling expenses to meet anticipated sales growth. On the positive side, the company said it expected sharply higher results from its home video operations and increased operating income from broadcast television stations and Madison Square Garden, the New York concert and sports venue. Two of the company's biggest box office successes in 1993 - Indecent Proposal and The Firm - have been issued in video in the US in recent months.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Eight die as fighting flares up in Bosnia-Hercegovina AT least eight people were killed yesterday in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the worst day of violence since Moslems and Croats in the central republic earlier this month voted to break away from Yugoslavia. Six federal army soldiers and two Croat militiamen were killed in fighting near Neum, on Bosnia's patch of Adriatic coastline. Local officials reached by telephone yesterday accused the Serb-controlled federal army of 'using multiple rocket launchers, mortars and artillery to launch over 1,000 projectiles on outlying Croat villages.' A member of the town's crisis team said over 2,000 army troops have massed near Neum, 90 per cent Croat, which lies just north of a self-proclaimed Serb autonomous region. Clashes have escalated in Bosnia since Moslems and Croats, two of the republic's three main ethnic groups, voted in favour of independence. Serbs, who make up about one-third of the republic's 4.4m population have raised roadblocks in protest against Bosnian independence. At the same time several people were reported wounded in gunfights yesterday between Serbs and Moslems in Gorazde, 30 miles southeast of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, which has been designated the headquarters for the United Nations peacekeeping forces. Mr Hadzo Ifendic, the mayor of Gorazde, said the clashes began when Serbs demanded a greater share of petrol which has been rationed in Gorazde. Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said Serbs seized a television transmitter after the Moslems took control of the local police station and a factory. It said shops were closed and the streets remained deserted after the rival ethnic groups exchanged gunfire and raised several road blocks in and around Gorazde. But a western observer yesterday attributed the renewed clashes to 'last minute pushing and shoving' before the 14,000 UN peacekeepers are deployed to neighbouring Croatia. Many diplomats believe the presence of peacekeepers in Croatia will calm the volatile ethnic groups in Bosnia, where peacekeepers will not be despatched. Some 500 members of a UN advance team are already in the three UN protected areas in Croatia. The UN says a stable ceasefire is a requirement for the deployment of peacekeepers. But UN officials reached by telephone in their headquarters in Sarajevo yesterday declined to comment on the most recent violations of the 11-week-old UN-brokered ceasefire. Mr Fred Eckhard, the UN spokesman, said: 'Our eyes and ears are not yet established well enough for us to establish who's doing what to whom.' Croatian and Serbian media yesterday also accused each other of violating the ceasefire in fighting around Vinkovci, eastern Croatia.</p>

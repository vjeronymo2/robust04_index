			<p>BFN     [Text] Information Minister Muhammad Salman said today that  the departure of the colonialists from the homeland was the  result of rebellions in various parts of the country and our  people's heroic struggle for a quarter century until they  regained their freedom and independence.    In an educational seminar held for its students, by the  Higher Institute for Political Science, Salman spoke on the firm  principles of the Syrian policy under President Hafiz al-Asad's  historic leadership in terms of domestic construction and  political and economic multiplicity, and in terms of the Arab  solidarity and strengthening the Arab people against the  cultural invasion to which they are being exposed.    Salman spoke about the peace process and its repercussions  and on obstacles that are preventing its progress. He said:  Syria supported the peace initiative because it emphasized the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.  Syria's insistence on a comprehensive solution stems from its  firm pan-Arab principles. This was manifested at the Geneva  summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill  Clinton where Al-Asad represented the Arabs' stand and desires  and the U.S. Administration announced its intention to realize  comprehensive peace on all tracks of the conflict.    The minister refuted the motives of the tendentious  campaigns  of Israel, the Zionist Lobby, and the media that are sympathetic  to them. He said the aim of these campaigns is to change the  firm and pan-Arab position of Syria, whose Arab and  international role has grown under President al-Asad's  leadership. This has been voiced by the Arab media which are  daily reiterating that Syria is the symbol of the pan-Arab  struggle and the honest helmsman of the Arab ship sailing toward  the future.    At the end of the meeting, Salman answered questions by  students participating in the seminar.    Answering a question, Salman said: I hope Rabin's  announcement on withdrawal from the Golan will be free of land  mines which we have always encountered in every session of talks  in which the principle of withdrawal from all the occupied  territories in exchange for peace was discussed.</p>

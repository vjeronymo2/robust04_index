			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dominion Mining strongly back in profit DOMINION Mining, one of a crop of emerging Australian gold producers, has overcome lower gold prices to make a strong return to the black in the year to June. The directors yesterday reported that the company had turned net losses of ADollars 26.7m (USDollars 19.54m) into ADollars 18.1m profits on a 6.6 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 265.8m from ADollars 249.2m. The previous year was affected by an ADollars 81.3m abnormal loss. The annual dividend has been reduced to 4 cents a share from 4.5 cents. The directors warned that an accent on cost reduction would lead to a small fall in gold production in the current year. Gold output rose to 436,605oz from 388,021oz but the average price received fell to ADollars 598 per oz from ADollars 626. The directors said the cost of production was running at ADollars 376 per oz. 'A strong forward sales position has been maintained, with over 900,000oz forward sold at an average deliverable price of ADollars 580 per oz,' they said. 'The group net operating cash flow for the financial period was ADollars 81.8m. Total equivalent cash increased to ADollars 46.8m and the group re-mained totally debt free. 'The strong cash flow and debt free status enables the company to examine acquisition opportunities. 'The company will continue to review expansion options from its own resource port-folio, search for sound ac-quisitions and above all maintain the aggressive and innovative exploration programme.' The tax provision was ADollars 11.4m compared with a ADollars 17.1m credit, and depreciation took ADollars 45.5m against ADollars 42.4m.</p>

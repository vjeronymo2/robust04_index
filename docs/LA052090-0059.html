			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PREVIEW FAN  </P> <P> Concerning Dirk and Erik Sanders' May 6 letter on movie previews: They are not  alone.  </P> <P> While viewing "Crocodile Dundee II" a couple of years ago, I realized I was  totally bored. Why? All the best scenes and lines had already been shown in  previews I had seen before the movie's opening.  </P> <P> Now I stand in the theater lobby and wait for the previews to end before I  enter.  </P> <P> MARI A.

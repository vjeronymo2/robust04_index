			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE-ALMOST;  </P> <P> EVEN THE SURPRISES FAIL TO ENLIVEN TV'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> It's the Emmyzzzzzzz. . . .  </P> <P> There were jolts -- "Lonesome Dove" losing to "War and Remembrance" and getting  nearly shut out in the non-technical categories, and James Woods topping both  Robert Duvall and John Gielgud for best special or miniseries actor.  </P> <P> What a sad irony, however, that on the 50th birthday of American television,  the program whose sole purpose is to honor television should be such a  monotone. And what an irony also that Fox Broadcasting, a network that  rightfully prides itself on being different and innovative -- from "The Tracey  Ullman Show" to "America's Most Wanted" to "Married . . . With Children" --  should produce an Emmycast that was so ordinary.  </P> <P> At just under three hours, it was on time, but not on target.  </P> <P> Directed by Walter Miller and produced by John C. Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee  ("Not Necessarily the News"), Sunday night's program was not only largely flat  and tedious, it was disjointed and critically in need of a single host, someone  -- but not Milton Berle, all right? -- to tell some jokes and provide cohesion.  There have been hosts for past Emmycasts -- although not last year -- and a  return to the old ways is in order.  </P> <P> The way comedy/variety show winner Ullman characterized the behind-the-scenes  chaos on her own show on Fox applied to the Emmycast: "It's not funny . . . it  could be funny . . . it's getting better." But not much.  </P> <P> Even a singing Snow White would have been welcome.  </P> <P> Some of the old clips zinged. But otherwise the evening was so . . .  perfunctory, more or less consisting of awards being announced and accepted  without much zest or style (Annie Potts of "Designing Women" being an  exception). Even a tribute to Governors Award winner Lucille Ball -- which  should been the evening's emotional centerpiece -- lacked passion.  </P> <P> If anyone saved the night, ironically, it was the no-shows, the seven winners  who weren't present to accept their awards. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  </P> <P> By not showing up, they allowed Fox to hilariously simulate their acceptance  speeches. The "acceptance" by HBO's "Tanner '88" directing winner Robert Altman  -- a spoof of the controversial ABC News simulation of suspected spy Felix  Bloch allegedly handing over government material to a Soviet agent -- was  especially brilliant. If only the entire Emmycast would have been simulated.  </P> <P> Surely the evening's biggest surprise was the Emmy that went to ABC's 29-hour  "War and Remembrance," a towering achievement whose extravagant cost --  compared with relatively moderate ratings -- has been cited as putting a chill  on long-form miniseries. "War and Remembrance" was expected to lose to the  more-popular CBS miniseries "Lonesome Dove."  </P> <P> "It's a major shock," exclaimed "War and Remembrance"  director/producer/co-writer Dan Curtis.  </P> <P> Undoubtedly, many had the same reaction to that fine actor Woods winning for  his performance in the overrated "Bill W." on ABC. It was good work, but not in  a class with expected winner Duvall as the aging plainsman in "Lonesome Dove"  or with Gielgud's heroic performance as Aaron Jastrow in "War and Remembrance."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Emmycast itself was not in much of any class. Next year, leave a  wake-up call.  </P></p>

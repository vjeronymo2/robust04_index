			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Topdanmark sees slide into red Topdanmark, the Danish insurance and finance services group, expects to slip back into the red this year with a loss approaching DKr200m (Dollars 31.93m). It returned to profit in 1993 following two years of losses. The latest loss has been caused by provisions totalling DKr253 made by a new management team brought in last spring. The provisions cover losses at Aktivbank, the group's German banking subsidiary, and property losses in the US, said Mr Kaj G. Schou, chief executive. The group has also suffered this year from falling bond and share prices. Mr Schou said the group would make a profit in the second half - of between DKr75m and DKr125m - but there would be loss of almost DKr200m for the full year. Topdanmark made a profit of DKr53m in 1993. Its losses in 1992 were DKr107m. Topdanmark is part of Eureko, the European insurance alliance including Friends Provident of the UK, AVCB of the Netherlands, Wasa of Sweden and Ocidental of Portugal. Eureko holds a 32 per cent stake in Topdanmark. The group's poor performance for several years dates back to the acquisition of Aktivbanken, a Danish regional bank, in 1989. The main Danish assets of Aktivbanken were sold to Sydbanken in May. The acquisition cost Topdanmark DKr1.4bn, and the bank then went on to lose DKr581m in the next four years. This has left the group with a funding problem. It has some DKr1.5bn in loans which have to be renewed in 1995 and 1996.</p>

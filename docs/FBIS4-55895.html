			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "Economy on State Reservation"] </F>   [Text] If enterprises under majority state ownership had  clear strategic goals and if management were responsible for  their operations, the type of problems that have emerged  surrounding the government's decision on banning sponsorship  would be impossible.    At one of its recent meetings, the government of the  Republic  of Croatia discussed, among other things, a ban on state-owned  enterprises being sponsors, because according to government  officials some budget beneficiaries have compensated for the  lack of money following consolidation of the state budget  through sponsorships. As these sponsorship funds originate from  state enterprises, many of which are money-losing ventures, the  government decided to ban sponsorship by enterprises where it is  the majority owner. The competent ministries must reexamine all  sponsorship agreements in order to gain insight into the  dimensions of this "form of siphoning off funds," as the  government described it.    The somewhat unusual and unexpected decision by the  government comes at an inauspicious time, because the situation  has become exacerbated with the strike by education workers.  Those involved in cultural affairs felt that they are hardest  hit by this government move, and they reacted to it immediately,  while athletes, who perhaps will actually be hardest hit by the  sponsorship ban, were simply caught off guard. This government  decision has intensified certain old economic problems that are  detrimental to the market development of the Croatian economy,  for which the government still has no solution, although its  officials contend that they do. To be sure, these are public  enterprises and state-owned enterprises. Although through the  decision the government has once again affirmed that it is ready  to fully and decisively implement a stabilization program, even  adopting such ad hoc decisions if it senses that its goals are  threatened, tensions have mounted to a red-hot state while the  weaknesses in managing state enterprises have not been resolved.  If they had been, the government would not be in the position of  accountant for public enterprises; instead, the management would  be responsible for its operations.  <H5>  No Strategy </H5>   The government's moves show that there is no development  strategy for these enterprises, whose position in the economy is  almost of crucial importance, nor are there projections of their  future position. Moreover, it appears that the tacit social  consensus that the government enjoyed is slowly being drawn into  question. Even now it is becoming clear what this consensus has  meant to it in the implementation of the stabilization policy,  even though statements by union leaders have long provided an  indication of their disappointment with the government's  belittlement of its social partners. The government contributed  to a great extent to the eruption of the strike by education  workers and to the protest by cultural workers through its  arrogant and intolerant behavior, only to resolve all issues  through negotiations, which should have been attempted even  before the strike.    In sponsorship, the government sensed the possibility of  budget breaches. Valentic recently explained to businessmen and  the public that he must insist on the budget adopted by the  Assembly, without breaches in a single item on the outlay side,  and that position is being followed blindly. However, such a  decision--seemingly resolute and perhaps even appropriate--is  more of an indication of all the problems of government  relations with public enterprises and the lack of strategic  guidance for the Croatian economy, in which the state defines  its interests and priorities, than it is a reflection of resolve  in the pursuit of economic policy.    Four years ago, when it was decided to found 11 public  enterprises under state authority based on a special societal  interest, a major inclination by the new state to control all  significant economic subjects was discernible, but at the time  it was not realistic to expect that an economic strategy would  be known precisely. Over four years' time, however, only Astra  has departed from that select group, and nothing significant has  happened in the government's policy toward those enterprises. In  addition, the state has become the majority owner of a large  part of the Croatian economy that has undertaken transformation  even though it was expected that with the privatization of the  rest of the economy the public enterprises too would gradually  begin privatizing.  <H5>  Administrative Committees </H5>   The public enterprises are very important: One-third of the  capital of the Croatian economy and 13 percent of all employees  were concentrated in these 10 enterprises when they became  public, and they accounted for 11 percent of all revenues.  Although all governments have emphasized their importance, and  some--such as the Sarinic government--have declared the  resolution of their status to be a top priority, key problems  have remained in relations with these enterprises, which is  unacceptable precisely because of the proclaimed greater  interest, but also because of their position on the market. The  majority of them are monopolies, but for some this is not a  natural position.    The state was supposed to manage the enterprises through  administrative committees. The way in which functions in the  administrative committees were understood in our country is  largely well-known, as is the fact that they did not work on  strategy and on defining economic policy at the enterprises, nor  was their relationship to the state specified. It is interesting  to observe how the administrative committees operate based on  the example of the Fund for Privatization [HFP]. At the  beginning of privatization, the fund's administrative committee  had seven members because transformation was not regarded as  essential, except declaratively. When privatization got into  full swing, the number of members rose to 11, but now that  everyone has realized that privatization is an essential process  there are 13 members of the administrative committee, while the  employers' association has demanded that one of its members be  admitted to the fund's administrative committee. Judging from  the new acquisitions (Ivic Pasalic), it is clear that these  expansions of committee membership are politically motivated,  and it can hardly be expected that it will formulate a strategy  for development of the Croatian economy.    Right now it can be said that the state has not pursued a  consistent policy toward the public enterprises. There is no  obligation to realize profits and to transfer them to the state  budget; some enterprises are exempt from payments of taxes on  profits, while some are not; some cover losses from the budget,  while some do not, even when the loss is the result of an  administrative restriction, etc. To be sure, there cannot be a  uniform model in dealing with them, because their roles and  positions in the economy differ, but there must be a strategy  with defined goals. The overall goal of economic policy must be  stability and growth, which will be achieved by increasing  business efficiency, and it has long been clear that private  enterprises conduct business much more efficiently.  <H5>  Return of "Write-Offs" </H5>   Of major importance to the economy of any state is how big  companies conduct business, especially if they are state-owned.  Over the past three years (from 1991 to 1993), the state has  helped out Croatian Railroads [HZ] with subsidies amounting to  approximately 950 million German marks [DM], but in those three  years HZ has operated with additional losses of around DM220  million, which means that more than DM1.1 billion has been spent  on the railroads. The projected subsidy for this year is around  DM290 million, but the situation is not improving. On the  contrary: There have already been strikes and political affairs  (Kralj, Seks) at HZ, and the HZ Independent Union recently sent  a scathing letter to Prime Minister Valentic concerning  detrimental contracts (allegedly, HZ has been harmed to the tune  of around DM10 million from only three contracts with private  enterprises). Strong opposition to the involvement of Josip  Bozicevic, former minister of trade and communication, in the  management of HZ was also expressed.    The letter from the union includes the following: "We regard  the return of those who have been `written off' to the top  management of HZ, led by Mr. Bozicevic (65 years old), as an  attempt to cover up and conceal plunder and pillage at HZ, and  as the return of a nebulous and hopeless state at Croatian  Railroads." Although the government has introduced a new bill on  railroads that proposes solving the railroad problem in three  stages, and although railroads are subsidized everywhere in  Europe except in Sweden, it appears that the proposed personnel  solutions will be problematic: Experts have also expressed their  reservations toward this solution, and it appears that the  railroad issue will remain very painful for every Croatian  government for some time to come.    Of the 10 public enterprises, only NARODNE NOVINE and the  HPT  [Croatian Post and Telephone] are operating in the black, while  Croatian Forests is close to it; besides the railroads,  Jadrolinija--which the government is helping with subsidies--and  the Croatian Electric Power Industry are operating in the red.  The others are borderline, operating at the "break-even point,"  whereby INA [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise] is  eliciting an outcry because of its continued special status,  while there are those who have said that INA has its own  mini-state budget, although the other public enterprises are not  far from that either. All these enterprises have experienced  various affairs, and there have also been strikes in them. In  this atmosphere and given the unclear state strategy and the  imprecise and undefined goals, it has not even been possible for  public enterprises to operate any better. The government of  Nikica Valentic has also formed an Office for Economics and  Restructuring of Public Enterprises, which is responsible for  monitoring the economic efficiency of public enterprises and for  their restructuring.  <H5>  Incest With Banks </H5>   Minister Zlatko Matesa has also touched on the especially  sensitive subject of relations between public enterprises, but  also other major, problematic enterprises (e.g.,  agricultural-food combines, shipbuilding, iron and steel works),  and banks. It has been proposed that the "incestuous" relations,  in which these enterprises are the banks' biggest debtors, but  at the same time their co-owners and members of their  administrative committees, be resolved through a sort of swap of  stock among the state, the banks, and the enterprises, but for  now this is only an idea.    The Office for Reconstruction first dealt with INA, perhaps  because the head of the office, Milan Ujevic, also works at INA,  for which it was proposed that it be a joint-stock company under  state ownership, and afterwards models for the railroads were  also proposed. What should be most important is the onset of  serious restructuring of these enterprises and their at least  partial privatization, which is possible in the majority of  public enterprises.    Croatian Post and Telephone, the value of which HFP  president  Penic has estimated at DM6 billion, is a very promising  enterprise that operates well, although the price of connections  and pulses has dropped while investments have been made in  establishing 600,000 new connections. However, that is still a  far cry from European standards, especially in the price of  connections, but partial privatization of HPT could provide  significant resources and thus further improve operations. The  same is true of NARODNE NOVINE. Moreover, although the majority  have rejected such variants, even HRT [Croatian Radio and  Television] could be partially privatized if the political will  to do so existed.  <H5>  Smothered Initiative </H5>   However, it is clear that the state will not decide in favor  of more substantial moves to privatize this sphere, and even if  it did, such moves would be very gradual. Because of this, it is  very important to specify and define the relationship between  the state and the public enterprises and the manner in which  these enterprises will be led. Setting out strategic goals for  these enterprises and appointing a management that will execute  them with clear authorities and responsibilities would make the  government's job appreciably easier; then it would not be an  administrator and accountant for public enterprises, but rather  a genuine owner who knows what it wants.    In that case, there would also be no problems with  sponsorship, because an enterprise would have a marketing budget  which, as everywhere, must serve the objective of the best  possible business results, for which the management of the  enterprise would be responsible to the government. Centralized  administration of the kind exhibited by our enterprises,  according to studies, leads to poorer business results, which  has long since been recognized in the rest of the world.  Although the government must keep certain things under control  during the implementation phase of the stabilization program,  centralization in guiding the economy will certainly be  counterproductive, because a big, bureaucratic state apparatus  is created that smothers business initiative, and the government  increasingly concerns itself with everyday business affairs to  the detriment of strategic decisions and especially to the  detriment of the creation of legislation and business  regulations that will permit economic growth and development.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The working visit of General George Joulwan,  commander- in-chief of NATO forces in Europe, to Russia began on  Monday.    Officials in the Russian Defense Ministry's press and  information service told Interfax that Joulwan would meet with  National Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov, First Deputy  Minister Oleg Soskovets, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  chief of the General Staff, and MPs on June 27.    Joulwan's meeting with Army General Pavel Grachev, the  Russian Defense Minister, and a joint news conference with him  are scheduled for Tuesday.    Other plans for his stay in Russia include a meeting with  ambassadors of NATO member nations in Moscow and a visit to the  27th Separate Motorized Brigade stationed in Teplyy Stan, a  southern neighborhood of Moscow.    Observers believe that the Joulwan visit reflects closer  ties  between Russia and NATO. Russian diplomats told Interfax that  the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had signed a  protocol on working out a Russia-NATO cooperation program  simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace framework program.  The two sides are said in the protocol to have agreed to  continue broad Russian-NATO cooperation both inside and outside  the Partnership for Peace program.    Russia and NATO also agreed to continue a dialog on both  political and security problems in Europe, political  consultations and cooperation on security.    Russian diplomats pointed out that the very fact of signing  the protocol implied the existence of special relations between  the North Atlantic Alliance and Russia.</p>

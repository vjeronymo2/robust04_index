			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Senate sponsors of legislation to raise the minimum wage ignored President  Bush's veto threat and pressed ahead with a plan to boost the hourly base wage  to $4.55 -- 30 cents more than Bush has said he would agree to. The bill's  sponsor, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), won vital Southern Democratic  support by agreeing to cut the final target of his bill from $4.65 an hour to  $4.55 and add a provision allowing workers to be paid a sub-minimum wage for  their first two months in the job market. Those changes are likely to be  offered by Southern Democratic senators today. The agreement appears to give  Kennedy more than enough votes to win passage of his plan, although a final  vote likely will not come until next week.  </P></p>

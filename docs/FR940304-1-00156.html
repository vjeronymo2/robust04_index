			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average affected consumer of $73.09 for the representative class of gas non-self-cleaning ovens; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $42.07; standard levels 3 and 4, by $26.37; while standard level 5 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in an increase of $59.83. For the representative class of electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-self-cleaning ovens, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs for the average consumer of $27.29; standard level 2 would reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average life-cycle costs by $38.05; standard levels 3 and 4, by $53.25; while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 5 would result in an increase of $61.41. The life-cycle cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions indicate that no standard level, other than max tech, would cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any economic burden on the average consumer. See Technical Support Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tables 4.12 and 4.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely face in financing the purchase of ovens. Similarly, DOE did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that national average energy prices were appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that for all classes of conventional ovens, standard level 1 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a net present value of $1.20 billion to consumers. The corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net present values for levels 2&hyph;5 are $0.52 billion, $1.09 billion, $1.12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billion, and negative $2.38 billion, respectively. See Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document, Table 3.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conventional cooking tops.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels are less than the baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. However, it should be noted that for another class, electric smooth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element cooking tops, there are life-cycle cost increases for units meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 4 and 5. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for the representative classes. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 to 4.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels.

Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average affected consumer of $8.96 for the representative class of gas cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tops; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $66.08 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels 3, 4 and 5, by $18.05. For the representative class of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric-coil cooking tops, standard level 1 would cause no change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life-cycle costs for the average consumer since it is the same as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $5.69 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels 3, 4, and 5 by $1.64. These life-cycle cost reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate that no standard level would cause any economic burden on the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.9 and 4.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

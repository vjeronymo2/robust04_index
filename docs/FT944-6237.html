			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Choices widened in Tessas and Peps - Savings Savers and investors with Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) and personal equity plans were given wider investment choice yesterday with moves broadly welcomed by building societies and the Pep industry. Tessas: Savers will be allowed on maturity of their Tessa to invest Pounds 9,000 in a new tax-exempt account. These bank and building society accounts, introduced in 1991, allow Pounds 9,000 to be invested over five years. As long as the capital remains untouched, interest is tax-free on maturity. In effect, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has raised the first-year investment limit from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 9,000. The move puts the first-year investment limit for Tessas on an equal footing with Peps, their tax-free equity rival. Pep investors are allowed an annual investment of Pounds 6,000 in a general plan and Pounds 3,000 in a single company plan. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, which had lobbied for equal treatment of Peps and Tessa, welcomed the measure as 'very good news'. Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager at Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said he saw the concession as a holding measure, particularly given the proposal to extend the investment remit of Peps. However, Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, the second-largest society, described it as 'half-hearted' because the ability to reinvest will not apply to the quite large sums which could have been amassed in interest. Investors who put in less than Pounds 9,000 in the first year can continue to save over the next four years within the usual annual limit of Pounds 1,800 for year-two onwards and subject to the Pounds 9,000 overall limit. Peps: Corporate bonds and convertibles of UK non-financial companies, as well as preference shares in UK and European Union companies, will become eligible investments in a Pep from April 6 1995. This is the first time that fixed-rate investments qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance. Peps which were designed to encourage investment in equities, are free of income and capital gains tax. Mr Nick Nichols, secretary-general of Pepma, the Pep Managers Association, said he was 'ecstatic' at the news. Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds said he was 'delighted'. He said it would mean that investors no longer had to take the great leap from deposits to equities, but could invest in fixed-rate instruments instead. Gilts were not included, perhaps because Mr Clarke wanted to emphasise that this was a measure designed to help the corporate sector develop new methods of finance. To qualify under the new rules, corporate bonds will need to have a minimum term of five years to maturity and be issued at a fixed rate of interest. Regulations will also allow open-ended investment companies, the new-style unit trusts due to come into existence next year, to qualify as Pep investments on the same terms as authorised unit trusts. Save As You Earn: The tax-free government save-as-you-earn savings scheme operated by building societies and Abbey National bank has been abolished. This scheme for small savers, introduced in 1969, had a maximum monthly contribution of Pounds 20 and paid tax-free interest of 8.3 per cent at the end of five-years. Existing SAYE savings schemes will be able to run their full course without being affected. The government said that it had decided to abolish the scheme to simplify tax incentive savings schemes. National Savings: National Savings will stop offering its Yearly Plan regular savings scheme on February 1 1995. Customers with existing Yearly Plan agreements will be able to complete the monthly payments to obtain their next Yearly Plan certificate. The commission on purchases and sales of gilts on the National Savings Stock Register will be increased on February 1 1995. The scale will be 0.6 per cent on the first Pounds 5,000 and 0.35 per cent on any amount over Pounds 5,000, with a minimum of Pounds 5 for purchases. (No minimum for sales).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] NOTICIAS learned from police sources yesterday that  alleged Lebanese or Palestinian terrorists entered the country  through Ciudad del Este during the week to attack the Israeli  Embassy. Recent events in the Middle East and the possible  signing of a peace treaty in the conflict area has allegedly  hurt the interests of terrorists who are trying to boycott it  through attacks against Jewish people and assets in South  America and around the world. The police are handling the issue  with absolute secrecy.    The Israeli intelligence service told the National Police  about the entry of the alleged terrorists into the country. They  came through Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.    In Brazil, these individuals allegedly obtained the support  of some of their people to get false passports and other  documents, including the famous special permits called "Border  Controls," which are handled by the border mafia.    The National Police ordered the Intelligence Department, the  Investigative Department, Interpol, and the 4th Zone Police  Command to carry out an in-depth investigation to locate the  foreigners. Police Superintendent General Lopez Pintos, director  of the Technical Support department, said foreigners are  regularly and routinely controlled. He minimized the importance  of the issue.    Police Superintendent General Santiago Flores Torres, chief  of the 4th Zone, said his first concern when he assumed the  command of Canindeyu, Alto Parana, and Itapua Departments, was  to order a census of foreigners residing in the border zone,  which is very vulnerable to the entry of undesirable people.    "The Immigration Department and this command are strictly  controlling the situation. We will provide documents to residing  foreigners and place illegal residents at the disposal of the  court. We usually make those controls. We have been intensifying  them in the past few days," Flores Torres said without  confirming or denying the report on the presence of terrorists  in the country.    According to a reliable police source, the Israeli Embassy  is  aware of the possibility and has asked for police reinforcements  for the guard outside the embassy and the residences of their  diplomats.    The embassy has also allegedly said that the terrorists are  possibly members of Arab groups who are trying to prevent the  signing of a peace agreement in the Middle East. They are  allegedly moved by their interest in the arms trade.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Tories set for clash on Euro bill TORY Euro-sceptics hit back yesterday at increasingly strong government criticism of their efforts to derail the Maastricht ratification process, insisting they were 'hell-bent' on killing the treaty. Mr Jim Cran, MP for Beverley, said Tory rebels were 'determined' to defeat the Maastricht bill and remained 'very hopeful' of succeeding. But he predicted the issue would not go away even supposing the bill was passed: 'We will still be in the Commons harrying anybody who pursues this course.' His remarks came as the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group said the government's attempts to force ratification through without a referendum were having a 'devastating' effect on party morale. In a strongly worded editorial in its Forward periodical, the group said Maastricht was dividing the party inside and outside parliament and 'draining it of its life blood'. The article added: 'The more the treaty that John Major initialled is examined, the less it lives up to its hype.' It was on the basis of a 'cosy coalition' between the leaders of the three main parties and not any commitment by the British people that Maastricht was being 'steamrollered' through the Commons. The bill is due back on the floor of the Commons on Thursday.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS NOT LIKELY: STUDY  </P> <P> A predicted teacher shortage probably will not materialize because many  veterans who left the profession are returning, a study said today.  </P> <P> The National Center for Education Information said that 38% of current public  school teachers have had at least one break from teaching.  </P> <P> Nearly half of the new teachers hired since 1985 have had at least one break,  and 18% of these have had two or more breaks.  </P> <P> "Teaching appears to be a revolving door," the study said.  </P> <P> "There is absolutely no question" that statistics projecting teacher shortages  are not accurate, said Emily Feistritzer, director of the center, an  independent, nonpartisan research group. She said little attention has been  paid to the "returning teacher phenomenon."  </P> <P> "All this business of teachers being miserable and leaving is not being borne  out in data anywhere," she said.  </P> <P> The study analyzed the results of a 58-question survey of 3,201 current  elementary and secondary school teachers -- 2,380 public school teachers, 469  teachers who had participated in alternative teacher certification programs in  Texas and New Jersey and 352 private school teachers.  </P></p>

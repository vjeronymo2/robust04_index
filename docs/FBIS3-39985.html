			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Ulrich </F> Wickert at the CDU Congress in Hamburg on 22 February --  recorded]    [Text] [Wickert] Chancellor, the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] has now adopted an economic program. Was this necessary?    [Kohl] Of course, an ad hoc program, a crash program is  essential in the current situation. The program on principles,  that the Congress in Hamburg will also adopt, defines our  principles, which are the principles of the social market  economy, which is what we stand in for. However, at the moment  we are facing quite unique problems. We are not only faced with  an economic crisis but with a deep structural slump. We now  have to pay for the mistakes that were made in our society in  two or three decades, which is why we must press for rapid  changes. Let me give you one example: Our main problem --  unemployment -- could be tackled much more quickly. At the  moment there are somewhat more than 4 million people without  work in Germany, which is too many, far too many. Hence, we  have to stimulate the economy to protect jobs and create new  jobs. Still, we have an example in our immediate vicinity --  the Netherlands, and they can be compared with us. In the  Netherlands, 34 percent of all jobs are part-time jobs, while in  Germany it is no more than 14 percent. There are 2.5 million  Germans who would like to work part-time and who do have  employment. So something could be changed quickly. We have  created the legal conditions. The state -- this also applies to  us, the federal, laender, and local governments -- the  companies, and trade unions must now try to create new jobs for  those who are interested in part-time work.    [Wickert] In your address you almost sounded like a leader  of the opposition. You spoke of decades of controversy, of  over-regulations, that is too say too much bureaucracy. Yet,  you have been in power for 12 years. So could you not have  changed a thing or two?    [Kohl] The problems as far as over-regulation are concerned  are not only problems of the past 10 years.    [Wickert] Still, you could have changed something.    [Kohl] But we did. First of all, I would like to say that I  was not putting the blame on anybody. We have discussed railway  reform since 1959, and now it has been put into practice. This  is certainly an achievement of Helmut Kohl. We have talked  about postal reform for decades. Both reforms are important  conditions for securing Germany's future, which have now finally  been implemented. In the years in which I was able to work  without potential outside influence, so to speak, the years  1983-1989 -- we reduced state debts to almost 45 percent,  created 3 million new jobs....    [Wickert, interrupting] Still, Germany's debts have never  been higher than they are now.    [Kohl] This is a classic journalistic claim, which is  correct even though it is not the truth.    [Wickert] So what is it?    [Kohl] Just listen, I am going to explain it. First of all,  one must look at the situation before we had German unity.  Before it, we did, of course, reduce state debts. And without  the policy we pursued between 1983 and 1989, we would not even  have been able to make the current necessary investments in the  new laender. Everything we are now investing in Saxony, Saxony  Anhalt, and everywhere else is, of course, an investment in the  future. Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania,  and Thuringia will be blossoming landscapes tomorrow or the day  after tomorrow, which will most likely be of advantage for all  of Germany.    [Wickert] Do you not regret the statement of the blossoming  landscapes?    [Kohl] Not at all, because it is true. Excuse me, but why  should I be sorry about that statement. Even today you can see  in large parts of the new laender that things are truly  developing in a positive way. What is true is that developments  have taken place more slowly. I was wrong on this point, and I  have admitted it. It is the number of years -- it does not  matter whether I say four of five years. Still, Mr. Wickert, it  is also part of the truth that when I was making that statement,  I started from the assumption that, as the former GDR [German  Democratic Republic] did, we would export goods to the Soviet  Union worth 20-25 billion German marks [DM]. However, the  Soviet Union has disappeared, has ceased to exist. And now we  only export DM5 billion worth in goods, and with Hermes export  guarantees, at that.    So I am maintaining this statement; one only has to add a  few  more years. But what difference does it make, whether it is  four of five, or eight or 10 years? We have achieved Germany  unity, freedom for all Germans -- and this is the real  achievement. And nobody would like to turn back the clock, not  even my severest critics would deny that we pursued the right  course.    [Wickert] You have just mentioned the Soviet Union. You  were on the telephone with Boris Yeltsin yesterday, and, I  suppose, the main issue in your talks was Bosnia. The success  of the ultimatum is obvious. Yet, now Germany also has to  contribute its energy. Are you ready to exert your influence,  particularly on the Croats?    [Kohl] What we have achieved so far has something to do with  our influence, and, above all, with mine. I am happy that, for  the first time -- I am not saying that it will be a success --  there is a real opportunity for achieving a peaceful solution.  This would not have been possible without the contribution of  the Russians. Now the Russians are there, and the Americans have  committed themselves more than ever, and so have the French and  British. Within the framework of our possibilities, among others  within the European Community, we must also bring our influence  to bear. And we must do it together with others.    I hope that, beyond Sarajevo, it will be possible to reach a  plan for all of Bosnia, that means that other....    [Wickert, interrupting] But that means to exert pressure.    [Kohl] Yes, and I am in favor of keeping up the pressure.  Still, now I am starting from a vision that I hope will become  reality, namely that, over the next few weeks and months, we  will achieve a carefully worked out overall plan, with the  parties to the conflict -- the Croats, Muslims, and Serbs -- and  that the major powers will then guarantee, so to speak, what  Boris Yeltsin and others have now suggested. For the first  time, I can now see a real chance, which is why the pressure has  to be maintained. Since we have a special relationship of  confidence, it is our main duty to talk to the Muslims and  Croats. After all, it is these two groups, in particular, that  want the Germans to participate in the negotiations and help  protect their interests.    [Wickert] It will probably take longer to solve the Bosnia  problem than to conduct the election campaign: The election  will be held in October. Some have already complained about the  mudslinging. Are you ready to participate in that mudslinging?    [Kohl] I am not engaged in such mudslinging. You know, I  would say that those who are actually engaged in mudslinging are  those who complain most about it. I am not engaged in  mudslinging. I am in favor of discussing concepts and ideas, and  who is able to show the better path into the future. Still, if  I talk about the future, I also have to talk about the present,  and I cannot disconnect the present from the past. We are  currently facing the challenge of filling concrete positions.  And he who agrees to being a candidate for the office of  federal president must accept questions regarding what he did in  a crucial era of German history, namely the past few years, what  he did regarding the relationship with our fellow citizens in  what used to be the GDR. I am opposed to mudslinging. I am  also against digging up Stasi files from early morning to night.  The results are quite often detestable and disgusting, and I do  not get any satisfaction from it.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: European purchases for Boots BOOTS, the retail and pharmaceutical group, is paying Pounds 14.5m for two over-the-counter healthcare companies in Europe. Boots said the acquisitions would give Boots Heathcare International, the OTC medicines and consumer products business set up last year, critical mass in France and Italy. The French business being bought is La Societe Francaise du Triclocarban, the main products of which are Nobacter, a shaving foam, and Solubacter, an antiseptic wash. It has sales of Pounds 5.1m. Boots will move production to its own manufacturing facility in France and will sell the products through its existing sales force. In Italy, Boots is buying Marco Viti, with annual sales of Pounds 4.4m and products which fit with Boots' existing portfolio. The purchase includes a manufacturing base near Milan and a sales team. Boots' strategy is to develop its brands across Europe, based on four product areas: analgesics, such as its Nurofen brand already sold in France and Italy; eyecare, such as its Optrex brand; skincare, including brands like E45; and cough and cold treatments such as Strepsils, which is the leading OTC sore throat remedy in France.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / People: Heading up the barber's creation They are changing the top guard at Phillips Petroleum, the Oklahoma-based oil company which used to be a favourite target of corporate predators in the mid-1980s. Wayne Allen, 57, takes over in May as chairman and chief executive, and Jim Mulva, 47, steps into Allen's place as president and chief operating officer, writes William Hall. Arkansas-born Allen will be the ninth chairman of a company set up in 1917 by Frank Phillips, a former barber, who decided he could make more money from drilling for oil than from Phillips Mountain Sage, his baldness cure. Allen, like current chairman C J Silas, is an engineer who has risen through the production side of a company which produces over half its output of 200,000 plus barrels a day overseas. However, Allen is considerably older than Silas was when he took over nine years ago, which means he will probably hand over to Mulva before the end of the decade. Mulva has been Phillips' chief financial officer since 1990 and has been heavily involved in reducing the mountain of debt that Phillips incurred when it was fighting off the unwelcome takeover approaches from T Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn in the mid-1980s. Phillips has cut its debt from over Dollars 9bn to Dollars 3.5bn and Mulva says the company is now supporting a similar-sized asset base of Dollars 12bn with around half the employees. Phillips shares now stand at a substantial premium to net asset value but Wall Street still needs convincing that Phillips can continue to play in the big oil league. Analysts believe that Mulva is as good a choice as any to get this message across.</p>

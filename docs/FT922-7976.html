			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Accor expects profits up 10% to FFr1.05bn ACCOR, the acquisitive French hotel group, yesterday forecast that its net profits would rise 10 per cent this year. Mr Gerard Pelisson, group co-chairman, told yesterday's annual meeting that he expects net profits of around FFr1.05bn (Dollars 193m) this year, up from the FFr948.6m reported in 1991. Last year's profit was 5.6 per cent down on 1990, the first fall in the group's history, due to the Gulf war and a general fall in business travel and tourism. However, Mr Pelisson warned that trading conditions this year and next would not be as good as in the four years to 1989, when net profits rose on average by nearly 35 per cent annually. He expected a stronger recovery in 1994 and 1995. Accor was planning to sell up to FFr2bn of assets over the next few years, to reduce debts built up to fund last autumn's FFr2.2bn takeover of Wagons Lits, the Franco-Belgian group.</p>

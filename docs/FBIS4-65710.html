			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "b.b.": "Hope for Karabakh"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Since the cease-fire agreed upon by the  warring parties in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on 11 May has  been holding, CSCE is now making increasing efforts to  consolidate this truce. If the three conflicting parties  (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh) sign a relevant  agreement in Vienna, CSCE will send 34 observers to Karabakh  within three days (10 of whom would be mine clearing experts),  the CSCE's Karabakh rapporteur, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, told  correspondents on Thursday [19 May].    Within another two weeks, this CSCE team would be increased  to 66. Twelve CSCE states are prepared to provide military  personnel for the Karabakh mission. Eliasson stressed that this  mission will be a first step toward a peace process.    He said that the Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents,  Ter-Petrosyan and Aliyev, have pointed out to him that this is  an "historic chance" to end this "war that has been forgotten by  the world" (Eliasson). So far, cease-fires in the Karabakh  conflict have always been broken shortly after they were signed.  International supervisors would contribute a "new quality" to  securing the cease-fire, Eliasson said.</p>

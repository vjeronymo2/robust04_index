			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Entente not cordiale this Noel (1) Sir, Mr Michael Thompson Noel suggests to French people that 'they must ditch their dead language'. The contents of his feature ('English yes, French non', December 18/19), which can be quoted as a model of jingoism, is so witty that his portrait shows him to be laughing at his own jokes. Mr Thompson Noel (should I say Mr Thompson Christmas?) is outraged by French drivers being unable to understand his gracious insults. A 'large yellow Citroen' (ask Mr Stuart Marshall, your excellent motoring correspondent, if he has ever seen a lot of this type and colour) nearly touched his Rover, 'a noble and lineal descendant of the Spitfire aircraft'. Maybe he was keeping to the left side of the road as a proud Englishman should do everywhere. Anyway, it is a pity that the Parisian driver could not appreciate it. He would certainly have replied in the language of Shakespeare and Mickey Mouse that he would have believed that Rover was now merely a subsidiary of Honda. Mr Thompson Christmas is absolutely correct as regards speaking foreign dialects. Some stupid natives are entrenched in the belief that English is not the only key to a civilised world. Why didn't Fellini realise that 'Such a Good Life' instead of 'La Dolce Vita' would have earned many dollars more? Why do Frenchmen prefer their own way of cooking instead of a 'leg of lamb in mint sauce'? And why doesn't the Parthenon stand in Marble Arch? So 'cultural identity' is farcical and 'Nobody on the planet . . . likes the French'. As a Frenchman (nobody is perfect), I apologise for our arrogance and rudeness and I am very grateful to your writer to have taught me some English. I was looking for the translation of what is said in the Bible about 'la paille et la poutre'. My Collins dictionary tells me 'It's the pot calling the kettle black . . .'

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Warning that the competitive status of the United States is at stake, a group  of educators urged U.S. colleges to coax more business and science majors and  less-affluent students to take part in study-abroad programs. The Council on  International Educational Exchange said colleges should encourage students to  attend schools in Latin America, Asia and Africa, and not just England or other  Western countries. Fewer than 5% of U.S. college students, or about 50,000,  study abroad each year, while about 350,000 foreign students attend U.S.  schools, the council said. The report said that only 3% of U.S. high school  graduates and 5% of college graduates have proficiency in a second language,  that 33 states do not require foreign language study in high school and that 34  states do not require world history in high school.  </P></p>

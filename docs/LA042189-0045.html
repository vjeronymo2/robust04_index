			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY'S CIZEK GETS HIS WAY IN 8-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> Mitch Cizek truly believes that he has developed a knack for the knuckleball.  Given his druthers, the senior right-hander at Kennedy High would like to throw  it 30 times a game, especially on days when his curve won't and his fastball  isn't.  </P> <P> "It's definitely my best pitch," Cizek said. "I'd like to throw it more often."  </P> <P> His coach, Manny Alvarado, doesn't necessarily concur. It seems that every time  Alvarado agrees to let Cizek try one, it fast becomes a case of knuck and duck.  </P> <P> "He likes it, but I don't," said Alvarado, who calls the pitches from the  dugout. "There are too many times when his knuckler doesn't knuck."  </P> <P> And though his knuckleball sometimes had all the movement of a tectonic plate  Thursday, Cizek found the strike zone often enough with his other offerings to  lead Kennedy to an 8-2 win over Taft in a Northwest Valley Conference game at  Kennedy.  </P> <P> Cizek (6-2), who won his sixth consecutive game, pitched a five-hitter and  allowed one earned run. He struck out five, walked seven and threw 119 pitches.  He may have been just wild enough to keep the Taft batters off balance.  </P> <P> Of the eight baserunners Taft stranded -- Taft also hit into two double plays  -- the three left high and dry in the sixth were the most crucial. With Kennedy  holding a 5-1 lead, Taft's Glen Nahmias led off the sixth with a home run to  left. With one out, Doug Kougher singled, and with two out, Cizek walked Rich  Cosentino and Rich Shapiro to load the bases.  </P> <P> With the Kennedy bullpen in action, Alvarado made a trip to the mound but  decided to let Cizek remain in the game. Cizek struck out Brett Reisner with a  curve on a 1-and-2 pitch.  </P> <P> "I think he knows better than to take me out," Cizek said, grinning. "He knows  by now that I can finish what I start."  </P> <P> On this point the two agree: Cizek has six complete games in nine starts and  Alvarado concedes that Cizek is a better bet to clean up his messes that any  reliever.  </P> <P> "Mitch is a very, very strong kid," Alvarado said. "I was looking more to see  if he'd lost his composure than if he'd lost his stuff."  </P> <P> In essence, Taft (10-9, 6-4 in league play) was finished after one inning.  Kennedy used a walk and consecutive singles to left from Gino Tagliaferri,  Travis Bourne, Pat DeBoer and Danny Gugler to build a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> After Cizek wriggled off the hook in the sixth, the Golden Cougars (14-5, 8-2)  added three runs in the bottom of the inning, including a two-run home run by  Tagliaferri -- his sixth of the season and 16th in his three-year career.  </P></p>

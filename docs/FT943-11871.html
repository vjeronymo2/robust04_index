			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / MoD to order survey vessel The Ministry of Defence plans to invite tenders for an ocean survey vessel next month and to place the order by the end of the year, Mr Roger Freeman, the defence procurement minister, said yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. The news is a small boost to attempts by Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the only prospective bidder for shipbuilder Swan Hunter, to generate a two-year Pounds 50m workload for the Tyneside yard. The government had previously said it hoped to order the ocean survey vessel, likely to be worth about Pounds 45m, in January next year. Mr Freeman said that if a proposal from CMN to provide performance and financial guarantees for the refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Olwen were acceptable to the ministry, there could be a little flexibility in its August 1 deadline for the yard to achieve the 'firm financial footing' needed before it could take on Olwen.</p>

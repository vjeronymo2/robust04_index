			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory stamp duty rebellion subdued A PROSPECTIVE rebellion over the re-introduction of stamp duty on house purchases fizzled out in the Commons last night as Tory backbenchers stopped short of supporting a Labour amendment to extend the current moratorium until March 1993. Not a single Conservative MP voted for the amendment which was defeated by 30 votes (281-311), although one - Mr John Wilkinson (C Ruislip-Northwood) - indicated he would abstain. This was in spite of considerable Conservative support for a parliamentary early day motion tabled last month calling for 'a further extension' of the relief - which applies to the purchase of houses costing up to Pounds 250,000 - after it runs out in six weeks' time. For the government, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the Opposition amendment would more than double the Pounds 400m cost of the moratorium to date. It was more important to pursue policies designed to reduce interest rates and 'get a real grip on public expenditure.' The government should not try to 'rekindle' confidence by 'fiscal and other measures that have the effect of inflating house prices further.' Sir Malcolm Thornton, the Tory MP for Crosby who tabled last month's early day motion, said that while keeping the moratorium would help the building and construction sector, he recognised the Treasury had 'enormous difficulty' in balancing competing claims. Signing an early day motion was a means of expressing an opinion and not 'a gesture of rebellion,' he added. Mr Wilkinson applauded Labour for introducing the amendment and argued that stamp duty was 'a direct tax on flexibility and mobility in the employment market.' The real need was for immediate measures to bring interest rates down by some 2 1/2 per-centage points, he said. For Labour, Mr John Marek, a front bench Treasury spokesman, called on the government to support the amendment to show the original moratorium was not just 'a gimmick for the election.'</p>

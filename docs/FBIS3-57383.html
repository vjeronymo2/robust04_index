What gave rise to this document, and what  has it changed in the life of our soldiers? Vladislav  Shunevich, chief of staff and first deputy commander of  Turkmenistan's border troops, speaks:    "Turkmenia's state border has always been complex. It is  2,472.1 km long. It extends over mountains and desert sands,  along rivers, and across the Caspian. In the old union it was  `covered' by the Central Asia Border District. As of 11 August  1992 the guarding of the border passed entirely into the hands  of Turkmenistan. I will not say that these changes caused a  disaster. But the `green caps' encountered serious problems.  Owing to the rupture of ties with Russia, it became difficult to  maintain in `combat readiness' the various obstacles in the path  of possible violators.    "In previous years it was mainly Slav officers and soldiers  who were sent to the USSR's southern border. It was thought  that they stood up better to the heat here and, moreover, any  contact with Iranians and Afghans was ruled out on ethnic  grounds. After Ukraine and Belarus demanded the return of their  servicemen before 31 [date as published] November, and the  Russian Supreme Soviet of its troops before 31 December 1993, a  mass exodus began. Incidentally, the last six compulsory-service  Russian soldiers left the border literally one month ago. Here  I will emphasize that there was not a single case of desertion!  As a rule, officers were transferred back home only after they  had trained a replacement. Nevertheless, we have run into an  acute shortage of professionals.    "A partial solution has been found. A school for junior  officers `forges' lieutenants and ensigns in the space of three  months. Students drafted from higher educational institutions  have closed up the breaches among specialists in communications  and in motor vehicle and aviation hardware. University  graduates have become deputy commanders for work with personnel,  henceforth made up entirely of residents of Turkmenia.    "Today one-half of the officers are already Turkmens. But we  risked losing the Russian servicemen who had stayed -- the  backbone of the commander corps. The first talks began under  Russian Security Minister Barannikov. They soon reached  impasse. The deadlock was overcome when Andrey Nikolayev came  to head the Russian Federation's border troops. Much was  resolved by his talks with President Saparmurad Niyazov of  Turkmenistan -- knots of problems were `unraveled.'    "A joint command has been set up, headed by the commander of  Turkmenistan's border troops. He has two deputies. I, the  chief of staff, am one, and the other is the chief of the  Russian Border Troops Operations Group, to whom all the Russian  servicemen are subordinate. The Russian Federation has taken on  their funding, while Turkmenistan will pay for the supply of  hardware, ammunition, and arms. The most important thing is  that the Russian officer can continue to serve calmly. He  retains all rights and privileges indefinitely. You know, some  officers who had tendered requests for a transfer have now  withdrawn them.    "What is service like for the Russian officer in Turkmenia?  There are no problems with housing or children's schooling.  All school graduates whose fathers are serving in the Border  Troops Directorate entered institutes or universities last year.  Wages are paid at the officer's request either in manats or in  rubles. There is no question of discrimination along ethnic  lines. All the border detachment chiefs of staff are Russian  officers. Yes, language problems do arise. But the Turkmens  speak Russian, and all orders are given in it. Office work is  also done in Russian.    "The signed agreement is also advantageous to Russia.  Afghanistan remains a zone of heightened tension. The Turkmen  leadership maintains close, good relations with the leaders of  the northwestern provinces -- Turan Ismail Khan and Rashid  Dostam -- but this does not remove all problems. Mass poverty  is pushing Afghans into robbery and theft and the seizure of  pastures and lands. The drugs business has assumed dangerous  proportions in Afghanistan and is literally breaching the  border. It is possible to speak purely hypothetically about a  border service on the Afghan side, but many servicemen there,  moreover, are light-fingered and live by smuggling.    "The Iranian border is a little quieter. A pass regime has  been introduced there. But all kinds of things happen. A  subunit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lopushko  recently tracked down some smugglers who were using three horses  to carry a 150 kg consignment of drugs from Afghanistan across  Turkmenia into Iran. The servicemen pursued them across  snow-covered mountains for more than 30 km, caught up with them,  and disarmed them after a fight.    "If Russia quits the Turkmen border, a muddy wave of crime  and terrorism and a wave of drugs will swamp the Commonwealth  countries. There have been proposals to move the border further  north, but that is unrealistic. It would cost a colossal amount  of money to equip."</p>

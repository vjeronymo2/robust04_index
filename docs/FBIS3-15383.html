"And the  adoption of a new Constitution will strengthen society's  movement towards a socially-orientated democratic system," he  said.    The speaker of the Belarusian parliament emphasized that the  deputies' determination to resolve the country's political  problems in a constitutional way is in the interests of the  people, who are tired of the constant meetings charged up by  leaders of individual parties.    "The path of government reorganization marked by the Supreme  Soviet is the most constructive: Presidential elections are to  be announced, representing the popular choice of the state's  head, and then parliamentary elections. All this will not lead  to a power vacuum," Hryb noted. "At the same time, the  opposition is proposing a diametrically opposed movement towards  social reconciliation: The disbanding of the Supreme Soviet,  early elections for new deputies, the adoption by the latter of  a new constitution, and only then the election of the president.  That drawn-out and very expensive project will inevitably lead  to a social explosion under conditions of an disbalanced  economy. That it exactly what we are trying to avoid," the  Supreme Soviet chairman announced.</p>

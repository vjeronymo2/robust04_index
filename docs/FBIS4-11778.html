			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Kurdish Officials Deny </F> Appointment of Barzani as Governor of Iraqi Kurdistan"]    [Excerpt] London -- An Iraqi Kurdish official has denied  yesterday's reports that the Iraqi Government intended to  appoint Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party  [KDP], as governor general of Iraqi Kurdistan. He said that  this claim was "unfounded and aimed to undermine the KDP and its  leader."    The Qatari News Agency [QNA], citing the Jordanian paper  AL-BILAD, said yesterday that the Baghdad government would  appoint Barzani as "governor general of the Kurdish autonomy  region in the north of the country." The paper cited what it  called "informed Arab sources" as saying that the Kurdish leader  would "return to Baghdad within 10 days at the latest to settle  in his country permanently."    Muhsin Dazha'i, Barzani's personal representative and member  of the Executive Council of the opposition's Iraqi National  Congress [INC], told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that "the  report was fabricated at the instigation of the Iraqi Government  and some tendentious people." He added that "its aim is to  undermine the party and its leader and create confusion,  suspicion, and friction among the Kurdish people, the Kurdish  parties, and the Iraqi opposition forces in general."    An official of the KDP's European Bureau in London has also  denied the report, describing it as "sheer lies."    Hani al-Fukayki, deputy chairman of the INC Executive  Council, accused the Iraqi intelligence services of trying to  "confuse the Iraqi opposition, the Arab states, and the United  Nations by spreading rumors and lies such as that report." He  added that "Saddam's local and regional intelligence services  have made up that false report in order to harm Barzani who,  along with other brothers, is leading the struggle in the  homeland against Baghdad's dictatorship and despotism and for  the creation of a united, federal, democratic Iraqi state."

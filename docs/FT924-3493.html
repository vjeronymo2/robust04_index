			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Stock market watchdog shows its teeth JAPAN'S Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the new stock market watchdog, yesterday launched its first raid to crack down on illegal stock transactions. At dawn, commission officials started a search of the office of Teishin Fudo, a small property company, the home of its president, Mr Makoto Araya, and Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, a financing affiliate of the Sumitomo group. Teishin is alleged to have pushed up the stock price of Nihon Unisys, the 32 per cent-owned Japanese affiliate of the US computer group, by using some 30 different accounts at 20 brokerage houses during 1990 and 1991. The commission, modelled on the US Securities and Exchange Commission, was set up last July after a spate of stock market scandals shocked investors, fueling the fall on the Tokyo stock market. As television cameras rolled, commission officials raided Sumitomo Fudosan Finance. 'We're the Securities Exchange Surveillance Commission]' shouted an official storming into the central Tokyo office as the media recorded the ceremonial raid. The finance company extended an estimated Y55bn (Pounds 291m) to Teishin, and took Nihon Unisys shares as collateral. Sumitomo Fudosan Finance said it now regretted the 'stupid' loan, but said it had not known of Teishin's alleged share cornering. The commission is also investigating Mr Araya and Sumitomo Fudosan Finance for allegedly violating the rule where holders of more than a 5 per cent stake in a company are required to report this to the Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei average fell 88.57 points to 17,207.12 yesterday in dull trading.</p>

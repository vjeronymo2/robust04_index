			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Observer: Moving the gaul post Thirty years ago a grumpy General de Gaulle, miffed about his Common Market partners' behaviour, temporarily withdrew his ambassador from Brussels. Now one of his supposed kinfolk, Pierre de Boissieu, is to fill the French chair there, as ambassador to the new European Union. We must say 'supposed' because de Boissieu's precise relationship to the late general is unclear. Who's Who in France shows that de Gaulle's daughter married a de Boissieu, but does not make plain that it was one of Pierre's clan. Little matter; everyone in the French foreign ministry regards this 48-year-old star diplomat as the embodiment of Gallic, not to say Gaullist, hauteur. As director of economic affairs at the Quai d'Orsay, he negotiated the Maastricht Treaty for France. Those who were on the receiving end of his whiplash wit may groan at his return to Brussels.</p>

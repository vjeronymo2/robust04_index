Such sugar shall not be subject to a second assessment when it is marketed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) First processors shall send remittances and CCC&hyph;80 forms as specified by CCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1435.204 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Civil penalties and interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A first processor shall be liable for a civil penalty of up to 100 percent of the relevant national average price-support loan rate times the quantity of raw cane sugar or beet sugar involved in the violation if the processor:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Fails to remit, on a timely basis, the entire amount of any marketing assessment in accordance with this subpart;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Fails to submit form CCC&hyph;80 fully and accurately completed; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Fails to maintain and permit inspection of records as required by &sect;1435.205 of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Also, a processor who knowingly markets sugar in excess of the allocated allotment of the processor under section 359d of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 shall pay an assessment in an amount that is double the applicable assessment required under &sect;1435.202 of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In addition to any civil penalty assessed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, interest on unpaid assessments or deficiencies in assessments paid shall be due and payable at the rate specified in part 1403 of this chapter, beginning on the first day of the month after the marketing assessment was due in accordance with &sect;1435.203 of this subpart. Such interest shall continue to accrue until such amount is paid. However, if full payment of an assessment is received within 30 calendar days of the date on which the assessment was due, no interest shall apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The Controller, CCC, shall assess civil penalties and interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Affected first processors may appeal civil penalties by filing a notice of appeal within 15 calendar days of receipt of certified written notification by the Controller, CCC, of such assessment of civil penalties.

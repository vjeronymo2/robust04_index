			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Quarry side pushes Alex Russell past Pounds 3m mark BUOYANT demand for quarry products lifted pre-tax profits at Alexander Russell to Pounds 3.06m for the year 1990, from the Pounds 2.11m of the previous nine months. The latest profits included an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.05m from land sales. Below the line there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.14m for the running down of US and UK coal operations and premature closure of a UK coal site. Turnover for the year was Pounds 38.76m (Pounds 32.67m), with a record Pounds 18m from quarrying sales, up 15 per cent, but a 10 per cent decline in concrete products. From fully diluted earnings per share of 7.76p (4.38p) the final dividend is 1.15p for a total of 2.15p (1.61p for nine months). Mr Russell Nicolson, chairman, forecast increased profits as the costly retrenchment of coal operations neared completion and the group expanded its more profitable quarrying and roof-tile manufacturing activities.</p>

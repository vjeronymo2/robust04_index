			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM CANCELS GALA FOR OPENING OF CHINA EXHIBIT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural history has canceled a gala party  originally scheduled for Friday night's opening of a new exhibit of fossils  from China, billed as the most comprehensive such display ever shown outside of  Asia.  </P> <P> But the exhibit, "From the Land of Dragons," will open Saturday for its  full-scheduled run through Oct. 15, the museum said.  </P> <P> Craig Black, the museum's director, said the party was canceled "in light of  the events in China and the loss of life there." Black said the fossil exhibit  is part of an ongoing museum exchange with China.  </P> <P> The museum said the future of the exchange program has been cast in doubt by  the current crisis in China. Black said he ordered the party canceled because  he was "saddened and shocked by the action of the Chinese government taken  against its students and peaceful demonstrators in Beijing and elsewhere."  </P> <P> The exhibit will include fossils of dinosaurs and flying reptiles. It includes  42 specimens, of both carnivorous and plant-eating species.  </P> <P> The exhibit was accompanied by four Chinese scholars from the Beijing Institute  of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. The four are installing the  displays in the Exposition Park museum. The Natural History Museum said the  four would remain in Los Angeles until June 18, as scheduled.  </P></p>

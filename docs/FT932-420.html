			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / People: Capel invests in trusts traders James Capel has chosen another area to begin making markets - investment trusts. It has recruited two traders, who have both recently left SG Warburg, a leading broker in the sector, from September. A well known figure in the market for many years, Bill Cornish (pictured far right), 46, built up the investment trust team at jobbers Akroyd and Smithers, which was bought by Warburgs in 1985. He let Warburg this March. David Cockbill (above left) is a former colleague of Cornish. He had joined Akroyd in 1979, and made markets in the sector between 1984 and 1992. Unlike Warburg, which claims to make markets in all the 500 plus bits of paper (including warrants and so on) associated with the sector, Capel will 'certainly not cover the whole world of investment trusts' according to Bob Benton, managing director of James Capel. Benton says he has not decided how much capital to allocate to the operation.</p>

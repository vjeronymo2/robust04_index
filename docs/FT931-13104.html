			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shearson loss behind sharp fall at American Express LOSSES at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage subsidiary, helped cause a sharp slump in fourth-quarter 1992 net income at American Express, the travel and financial services group. American Express suffered a 65.4 per cent drop in net profits in the last quarter of 1992, to Dollars 82m. For the whole of 1992, American Express earnings before accounting charges were 44.7 per cent lower at Dollars 436m. Shearson's fourth-quarter loss, a result of legal provisions and property writedowns, was Dollars 166m. This compared to a Dollars 130m net profit in the same quarter of 1991. For the whole of 1992, Shearson lost Dollars 116m, compared to a 1991 net profit of Dollars 207m. Revenues at American Express were unchanged in the fourth quarter at Dollars 6.7bn and 4 per cent higher at Dollars 26.96bn for the whole year. The group's core travel related services (TRS) division saw its 1992 net profit slump to Dollars 243m from Dollars 396m in 1991. The results included a third-quarter Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge. Fourth-quarter TRS net income recovered to Dollars 181m from Dollars 81m a year earlier. American Express Bank saw its 1992 net profit fall to Dollars 26m from Dollars 60m in 1991. The IDS Financial Services division reported 1992 net income of Dollars 297m, up by 20 per cent year-on-year. First Data Corporation, a financial services processing business in which American Express reduced its shareholding last year from 100 to 54 per cent, had 20 per cent better net earnings of Dollars 141m in 1992. Mr James Robinson, who gave up his job as chief executive to Mr Harvey Golub yesterday while remaining as chairman of the group, said Shearson Lehman had strengthened its balance sheet during 1992. He said the emphasis would be on improving profitability at Shearson in 1993 as he takes over as chairman and chief executive of the American Express subsidiary. Mr Robinson said significant items in 1992 included a fourth-quarter legal provision and property write-down of Dollars 166m at Shearson; Dollars 300m of added reserves at The Balcor Company, a property subsidiary; Dollars 150m of charges related to Shearson's holding in Computervision, a company which had received a bridge loan from the investment bank; and a Dollars 425m gain on First Data Corporation, which had shares floated last year in a public offer.</p>

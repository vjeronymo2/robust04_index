She was  quoted as saying the decision should be seen as part of the  overall effort Israel is making to meet Palestinian security  concerns. She also said the United States is considering  whether to put Kakh and Kahana Hay on its list of terrorist  sponsors. Christine Shelly told reporters yesterday that Kakh  and Kahana Hay, on the basis of their words and actions, have  advocated and engaged in terrorism. Shelly added that U.S. law  had provisions for curtailing fund-raising for such groups in  the United States.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 15 March,  in  a similar report, adds that "Israel's Ambassador in Washington  Itamar Rabinovich told our correspondent Arye Golan that senior  State Department officials had reacted very positively to the  steps taken by the Israeli Government in the wake of the Hebron  massacre."]</p>

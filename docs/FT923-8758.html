			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Solymosi recalls days of Nureyev WHAT A lot of Capulets and Montagues there are in London. At the Barbican, the RSC is doing Shakespeare's play, English National Ballet returns Ashton's ballet to the Royal Festival Hall next week, and tonight the Royal Ballet brings its Covent Garden season to a close with the last of a dozen performances of MacMillan's version. In the latter, there have been six pairs of star crossed lovers, with two Juliets and one Romeo making their debuts on Thursday. For Altynai Asylmuratova, this was her second version of Juliet within seven weeks, for she was also dancing the Lavrovsky version with her native Kirov on that company's recent American tour; I saw her dance it in New York. In both, she is a stellar, picturesque heroine, unusually sweet and over-inclined to present the role as a string of shining photo-opportunities. Lavrovsky's and MacMillan's steps and interpretations are different but, to her, the differences are not significant. No doubt she will relax further into the detailed verismo of MacMillan's version and perhaps she will come to grasp the fact that his Juliet should sweep the whole ballet along on the wave of her will. Her Romeo, Zoltan Solymosi, gained more from the ballet, and this role is the high water mark of his period with the Royal. The liveliness of MacMillan's story telling and the dark brightness of Asylmuratova stirred him to a new ardour and intensity. At first, with Rosaline, this was Romeo as smoothie, an unusually practised young elegant - but, with Juliet and the many marketplace scenes, he became more exuberant and artless. These were both very guest-star performances, sometimes reminiscent of the famous Fonteyn-Nureyev account of this ballet. Bonnie Moore's first Juliet on Thursday afternoon was a far less striking affair. She is slight, but her view of Juliet amounted to little more than a certain open-mouthed petulance. Also, like too many young Royal women, her dancing is not truly coordinated. She was fortunate in the exemplary partnering and dancing of her Romeo, Bruce Sansom. No one today shows this role's difficult steps with such lucidity. His acting, too, is vivid. Of the two conductors, Barry Wordsworth has provided competent and vivacious routine, but Philip Ellis, the first-rate young maestro from the Birmingham Royal Ballet, is something more. He shapes every incident with distinction. One hopes to hear him lead a full-length Tchaikovsky at Covent Garden before long.</p>

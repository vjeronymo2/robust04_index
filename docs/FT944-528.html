			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Nadir pays tax debts of Pounds 250,000 Turkish Cypriot tax authorities said yesterday that Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive tycoon, had paid about Pounds 250,000 in tax debts from disputed Cyprus-based assets of his collapsed Polly Peck empire. The payments were made late on Monday, only hours before the authorities had threatened to confiscate the Jasmine Court Hotel in Kyrenia and the Palm Beach Hotel in Famagusta. Mr Nadir - who is believed to have debts to the state of about Pounds 7m - said he still controlled the hotels, which have remained beyond the reach of Polly Peck administrators because of court cases concerning their transfer of ownership in the island's Turkish sector. Administrators for the Polly Peck subsidiary Voyager Mediterranean last week paid the Turkish Cypriot authorities a year's land rent of Pounds 62,000 for the Jasmine Court Hotel.</p>

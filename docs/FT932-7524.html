			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: Illuminating thought CATCHING THE LIGHT by Arthur Zajonc Bantam Press, Pounds 16.99, 388 pages WHAT IS light? Arthur Zajonc and a colleague, both physicists, recently constructed a science exhibit to show why this question is so compelling. They made a box into which strong light is beamed. Viewers peer into the box through a window. What they see is - nothing. Outside the box is a handle connected to a wand projecting into the box. When the handle is pulled, the wand moves up into the beam, flashing brilliantly on the surface facing the light source. Only with something to illuminate does light become visible. Many historians treat science as a tale of progress from superstition to enlightenment. Zajonc takes a different tack. His interest lies in the variety of human efforts to make sense of the world. In this book he concentrates on one of the most extraordinary and beautiful of things, and one of the most difficult to understand: light, and its allied phenomena of sight and colour. Zajonc takes us from the Egyptian god Ra, whose eye was the sun and whose tears gave rise to mankind, to the latest speculation on the ambiguous nature of the photon in quantum physics. It is a fascinating journey. Zajonc succeeds in showing that scientific enquiry is seamlessly part of the human search for more than mere facts. Recently science has come under renewed attack for clipping angels' wings, as Keats put it, and unweaving the rainbow; but Zajonc shows how mistaken this perception of science is. Light is central to our imagination of the world. Creation was conceived as the moment when god ordered light into chaos, and great religions like Zorastrianism and Manichaeism carried the theme forward by describing existence as the struggle between light and darkness. The metaphor of the 'light of the world' is central to Christianity also, and it is unsurprising that from antiquity onwards intelligence has been analogised as the light of the mind. The word 'theory' derives from the Greek word 'to behold', and blind seers, like Homer and Tiresias, gaze further than sighted men because their inner light shines brighter. Early philosophers described seeing as a projection of light from the eye. Light itself was, quite literally, the eye-beam of god, as witness the identification of Ra and the sun. Plato thought of sight as the mingling of daylight with beams emanating from the eye, kindled there by a fire within; inner and outer light coalesce, making a bridge for motions caused by external objects to pass into the mind. Until the beginnings of modern science in the Renaissance, the mysteries of light remained a rich source of metaphor for speculation about gods and minds. But with the work of Italian artists on perspective, furthered by the optical researches of Galileo and Descartes, light began to reveal itself as a repository of mysteries much stranger and deeper than the pre-scientific imagination had ever dreamed. Newton split white light into its spectrum of colours by beaming it through a prism. He conceived of light as particles of different sizes, each responsible for producing a different colour in visual experience. In the following century Leonhard Euler rejected Newton's view, replacing it with a wave theory of light, on analogy with sound. Augustin Fresnel developed the theory, and experimental work supported it. The stage was set for 19th century science's great distraction, the quest for the luminiferous ether. Just as sound needs a medium through which to propagate - it does so by compression and rarefaction of air - so a medium was thought necessary for light. The ether filled this bill. Much effort was devoted to the search for it. But the brilliant work of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell on electromagnetism sowed the seeds for abandonment of ethereal speculations, and prepared the ground for the giant steps soon taken by Einstein and the quantum theorists. In quantum mechanics light is described as both wave and particle, a deep ambiguity which has led to a revision of the fundamentals of physics. Photons have no mass, and display the weird property of nonlocality, meaning that ordinary concepts of causality do not apply. To accommodate light in the physics of the universe, entirely new ways of thinking are required. By exploring the unfolding of views about light from mythology, religion and current science, Zajonc helps us to a position where, in the concluding discussions, quantum theory strikes us as no more odd, though no less mysterious, than any of its predecessors. Although Zajonc goes close to the edge of speculation sometimes (can Rudolf Steiner really be as serious a contributor to the debate as Albert Einstein?) one learns a lot from this rich book, which is highly entertaining and - yes - illuminating.</p>

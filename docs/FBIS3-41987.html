			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su: ``Turning the Joint Declaration of </F> the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Into an  International Treaty'']    [Text] The Foreign Ministry feels nervous about minimizing  the stir regarding the report that the United States is calling  on the ROK to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization  of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty. It seems  the Foreign Ministry is concerned about a breakup of the  cooperative system with the United States, which may take place  during the final stage of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations.  <H5>  The Government's Position </H5>   The government opposes the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint  Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into  an international treaty. That is, the government contends that  because the joint declaration of denuclearization signed in 1992  is not a treaty between countries but an agreement signed within  the nation, the government does not need to turn it into an  international treaty.    The government believes the issue of North Korea constantly  keeping nuclear reprocessing facilities, even after adopting the  joint declaration of denuclearization, should be resolved  through North-South dialogue. In other words, the government  believes that the government should persuade North Korea to  destroy the nuclear reprocessing facilities through the Joint  Nuclear Control Committee and, then, abide by the joint  declaration of denuclearization.    A government official explained that ``the U.S. proposal to  turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula into an international treaty is a result of  considering North Korea's demand for a guarantee that a nuclear  preemptive strike on the DPRK will not take place.'' That is,  there is a possibility that because North Korea indeed regards  as serious a nuclear threat from the United States and others,  it may stick to nuclear development. Thus, in order to ease  North Korea's threat, it is necessary for the nuclear-possessing  countries to promise not to conduct a nuclear attack on North  Korea.    Government officials have analyzed that the United States is  intending to supplement the weak points of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by turning the joint declaration  of denuclearization into an international treaty. The current  NPT regulations stipulate that NPT member countries can have  nuclear reprocessing facilities and inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are only required of  the plutonium produced from the nuclear reprocessing process.  Accordingly, if the joint declaration of denuclearization is  turned into an international treaty, North and South Korea  cannot have nuclear reprocessing facilities so suspicions of  nuclear development on the Korean peninsula will be fully  abolished. There was a (Tulatert) protocol signed by South  American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, in 1967 in  which the nuclear-possessing countries acknowledged the contents  that had been agreed upon by the relevant countries.    At that time, when the South American countries resolved not  to develop and possess nuclear weapons, they called on the  nuclear- possessing countries, including the United States, to  acknowledge the guarantee of refraining from a nuclear attack on  them. Thus, the nuclear-possessing countries turned the  agreement into an international treaty through a protocol.    It can be said that the United States has tried to apply  this  precedent to the Korean peninsula. [passage omitted]</p>

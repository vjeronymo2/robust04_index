Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court,  gave an account of the trial and judgment of Sun Xianlu's air  hijack case at a news briefing today.    Sun Xianlu, 25, was a worker of the Tianjin No. 2 Steel  Smelting Plant. In July 1993, he started an idea of hijacking  an airliner to Taiwan and began to prepare for the criminal act.  On 28 November 1993, he boarded a Shanghai-bound plane of the  China International Airlines in Tianjin. Soon after the plane  took off, he threatened to set off explosives and coerced the  crew to fly toward Taiwan. After the crew members took some  resolute measures, Sun Xianlu was arrested at the Nanjing  airport.    After hearing the case, the Nanjing City Intermediate  People's Court of Jiangsu Province confirmed that Sun Xianlu  carefully plotted the hijacking and hijacked the plane by  threatening to set off explosives, and his act was an air hijack  crime. On 13 January 1994, the Nanjing City Intermediate  People's Court, in accordance with the relevant law, sentenced  Sun Xianlu to life imprisonment and deprived him of political  rights for life on the charge of air hijacking. After the  sentence was pronounced, Sun Xianlu did not appeal, nor did the  procuratorial organ lodged any protest within the time  prescribed by law. The verdict became legally effective on 25  January.    Liu Jiachen pointed out: A criminal who hijacks an airplane  with violence, coercion, or other methods is extremely dangerous  to the society, seriously disrupts normal air travel order,  causes great economic losses to the state, seriously jeopardizes  the safety of passengers' lives and property, and yields very  bad social effects. All countries and regions regard such an act  as a serious crime and impose severe punishment for it.  Relevant international conventions have been recognized by more  and more countries and regions. This means that air hijackers,  particularly those criminals who hijack civil airplanes, will be  punished by law no matter where they escape to.    According to relevant reports, Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai,  criminals who hijacked an airliner to Taiwan on 6 April 1993,  have been sentenced to 10-year imprisonment by Taiwan region's  judicial organ and they will not be allowed to stay in Taiwan  after serving the term. At the same time, a common  understanding of the cross- strait hijackers repatriation issue  was reached between our country's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation in later part of December 1993. The two sides came to  a consensus that hijacking by violence, coercion, or other  methods is a serious crime and hijackers should be severely  punished, and that in principle, all hijackers will be sent back  to where they came from.    Liu Jiachen emphasized: Hijackers of aircraft have always  been a target to which severe blows will be dealt according to  China's Criminal Law. In particular, according to the "Decision  on Punishing Hijackers of Aircraft" adopted by the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress on 28 December 1992,  hijackers must be severely punished, or sentenced to death if  they cause severe injury or death to other people or heavy  damages to aircraft, or their crime is extraordinarily serious.  Liu Jiachen said that the people's judicial organ will  certainly impose harsh punishment on any desperadoes and  hijackers who dare to defy the law and make a reckless move.</p>

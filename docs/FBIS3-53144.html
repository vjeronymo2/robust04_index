Israeli sources said after the second meeting, which  concluded at 1800 [1600 GMT] today, the drafting committee had  started to formulate a draft agenda in light of two papers  submitted by the Palestinians and the Israelis. The draft  agenda outlines the views of each party and the apparent  differences in views over the area of Jericho, the crossing  points, and the settlements in Gaza.    The Israeli source, who declined to be named, pointed out  that the draft agenda includes all the points of difference,  which will be left to a later stage. The source noted that the  current round of Taba talks is expected to conclude on Wednesday  or Thursday at the latest and that a new round of talks will be  held on Monday in Taba.

From the Palestinian side, the drafting committee comprises  'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, former commander of the Palestine  Liberation Army; and Dr. Camille Mansur, holder of a doctorate  in law from the Sorbonne University. The Israeli side of the  committee includes General David Agmon, adviser to the chief of  staff on the intifadah; Yoel Singer, Foreign Ministry legal  adviser; and military prosecutor (Alan Shif).</p>

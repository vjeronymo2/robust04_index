			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429): "CPC Calls For Recovery of Power From Local  Authorities in Eight-Point Instruction"]    [Text] From 13 to 22 May, Zhu Rongji, member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee and vice premier of the State Council, called an  economic work conference for the seven provinces of Hubei,  Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan in Wuhan and  Zhengzhou. At the conference, he repeatedly stressed that the  key to stabilizing the situation as a whole is to place the  focal point of economic work on improving agricultural  production and state-owned enterprises. This shows that the  senior CPC leadership already has a new consensus on the  questions of stabilizing the political situation and economic  reform. Moreover, it also reflects that two serious problems  still exist in mainland China's economic restructuring today,  namely the problems of agriculture and state-owned enterprises.  Beijing's economists maintain that if these two big problems  are not resolved properly, it will be impossible for China to  succeed in reform.  <H5>  CPC Worries That Problems in Industry and Agriculture Will </H5> Throw Situation as a Whole Into Confusion    According to informed sources in Beijing, the seven-province  conference called by Zhu Rongji was not just an economic work  conference, but also a "briefing" for members of the standing  committees of the provinces' party committees and governments.  The "briefing" proceeded in keeping with a decision on work  recently adopted by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee. The decision on work instructed leading cadres at  all levels to "go down to the grass roots, learn about the  reality, give briefings, find out about their problems, and  attempt to get work done [zou xia qu, zhang shi qing, da zhao  hu, bai wen ti, cu luo shi 6382 0007 0637 2222 1395 1906 2092  2156 0729 2369 0795 7344 0191 5507 1395]." This 15-character  instruction evolved from a demand set not long ago by General  Secretary Jiang Zemin on leading cadres. Jiang Zemin had said:  "Go down to the grass roots, conduct investigations, hold  informal meetings, find out about problems, and attempt to get  work done." Later, Zhu Rongji suggested changing the words  "conduct investigations" to "learn about the reality." Deng  Xiaoping saw this wording at an internal CPC briefing and felt  it was okay. He also suggested changing the words "hold  informal meetings" to "give briefings."    Informed sources said that, at the conference, Zhu Rongji  specifically emphasized the significance of attaching great  importance to agriculture and state-owned enterprises. He said:  "The central authorities have always contemplated the question  of how to further improve agriculture. What the central  authorities worry about is that if great problems occur in the  next crucial decade, they will be agricultural problems.  Moreover, the problem of state-owned enterprise reform must not  be approached improperly. It is necessary to safeguard the  immediate interests of more than 120 million staff and workers,  otherwise, workers will take to the streets, peasants will enter  the cities, and the situation as a whole will be thrown into  confusion. It will be self-induced confusion."    Beijing's economists pointed out that regarding the problem  of agriculture, Deng Xiaoping had already given warnings as  early as early 1991 and early 1993. He said: "China's  agricultural foundation is still rather weak. If problems ever  occur in China's economy in the 1990's, they will probably be  problems in agriculture." Unfortunately, his words have been  fulfilled. Although the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC  Central Committee in November 1991 adopted a special decision  regarding the issue of agriculture in November 1991, the  decision has not been thoroughly implemented, with the result  that the peasants' situation is worsening daily, the gap between  the cities and the countryside is widening, and peasants'  dissatisfaction is growing daily. As for state-owned  enterprises, which consistently derive funds from bank loans,  shoulder a heavy historical burden, and find it difficult to  transform their management mechanism, "those that should be  closed down have not been closed down and those that should  survive do not operate well." Their profits are decreasing,  losses are increasing drastically, and economic returns are  sliding, and the problem of unemployment is worsening daily. In  view of this, it is not unlikely that self-induced confusion  could occur.    The sources said: In addition to being obliged to review  policy, the major reason for the increasingly serious problems  in agriculture and state-owned enterprises is that the local  authorities do not feel obliged to listen to the central  authorities. At the briefing, Zhu Rongji said: "At present,  resistance to the principles, policies, and measures of the  central authorities is not weak, which makes it very difficult  to implement them. Some party and government chiefs do not feel  obliged to listen to the central authorities. They doubt  whether the central authorities' decisions are right or whether  or not they suit the conditions in their own localities. This  phenomenon has caused a chain reaction among the leading groups  in some localities. If we do not correct this immediately, it  will not only weaken the central authorities' authority but will  also affect our work as a whole."    A Beijing political  figure pointed out that the main leaders of the local  authorities have not been obliged to listen to the central  authorities for a long time. In a speech to the Third Plenary  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in  February, Jiang Zemin gave this warning, saying: "Some  high-ranking cadres do not maintain unity with the central  authorities in terms of the political line. We are clear about  this. They should not think we do not know about it." But a  warning is a warning. The phenomenon where they do not feel  obliged to the central authorities has not changed but is  tending to spread. Therefore, it was Zhu Rongji's turn to  criticize this time. This may have been a declaration about the  possible dismissal or transfer of local leading cadres who do  not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. During a  working tour of Heilongjiang in mid-April, Zhu Rongji dismissed  Sun Weiben as secretary of the Heilongjiang party committee.    This political figure said: Now, due to their local  interests and their own face, some local party and government  chiefs often disregard central policies and shield cadres who do  not feel obliged to listen to the central authorities. If the  central authorities do not dare to deal with the shielders,  regionalism will inevitably expand. But dismissing and  transferring cadres is not the ideal cure, and this has put the  CPC authorities in a dilemma.  <H5>  Central Authorities Demand Localities Maintain Unity in </H5> Eight Areas    The informed sources added: In order to strive to maintain  unity between leading comrades in local parties and governments  and the central authorities, the central authorities, while  dismissing some cadres as a warning, had Zhu Rongji put forward  eight criteria (namely the eight-point demands set by the  central authorities on the local authorities) for provincial  party and government leaders to determine whether they were  maintaining unity with the central authorities.    First, they must attach great importance to agriculture  as the most important task which has an influence on the  situation as a whole and must conscientiously implement various  central agricultural policies;    Second, they must not arbitrarily set aside farmland  for the purpose of setting up development areas or special  economic zones.    Third, they must effectively control inflation and  promote social stability.    Fourth, they must limit the scale of infrastructural  development and must not arbitrarily pool funds.    Fifth, they are forbidden to use funds or credit to  speculate in real estate, futures and so forth.    Sixth, they must not issue shares or debentures, or set  up financial exchange markets.    Seventh, they must not arbitrarily sell the assets of  state-owned enterprises, still less must they sell them at low  prices to benefit enterprise cadres, staff, and workers. Those  who have done so must return the same amount;    Eighth, property rights transactions in state-owned  enterprises set up by prefectural-level cities or above must be  examined and approved by the State Council and carried out  according to the relevant regulations. Transactions that have  not been filed for approval must be stopped immediately and be  refiled for approval. Authorities at and below prefectural-level  cities must not organize this kind of transaction.    A Beijing economist holds that the central authorities'  eight-point demand on local authorities are in fact another kind  of administrative means of control or administrative  interference. Whether this kind of interference is good or bad  for economic development is as yet unknown. However, the  economist pointed out that one of the objectives of reform is  not to revive the excessive centralization of power of the past  in another form but to establish new economic relationships  between the center and localities and between the government and  enterprises on the basis of a market economy. Viewing the  matter from this angle, neither an excessive centralization of  power nor an excessive regionalization of power meets the needs  of a market economy. As for the question of how to  appropriately distribute central authority and local authority,  it depends on whether the distribution is beneficial to the  development of the productive forces and the development of the  economy. However, if administrative means are used excessively,  "economic rectification" will be repeated, and this must be  guarded against.</p>

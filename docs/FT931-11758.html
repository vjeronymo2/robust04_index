			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / ICI invests Dollars 200m in US titanium plant joint venture IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' titanium dioxide subsidiary, Tioxide Group, is paying Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) for a 50 per cent stake in a North American joint venture. The deal, one of ICI's largest single investments in recent years, is with Kronos, a subsidiary of NL Industries of Houston, Texas. The deal gives the British company a half-share of a 100,000 tonne-a-year chloride titanium pigment plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The plant was officially opened last October. Simultaneously, ICI announced it was postponing the construction of a CDollars 175m (Pounds 94.3m) plant at Becancour, Quebec, with an annual capacity of 60,000 tonnes. By postponing the plant, ICI avoids adding to overcapacity in the North American titanium dioxide market which is presently suffering from low prices, reduced operating rates and poor profitability. ICI also announced it was shutting down part of its site at Tracy in Quebec, with the loss of 60 jobs. The partial closure will result in the complete elimination of waste acid pollution from the site, according to the group. Although ICI had a government licence to discharge waste, it had recently run foul of local municipal authorities which were calling for the plant's closure. The deal offers ICI immediate access to Kronos' proprietary chloride technology for manufacturing titanium dioxide, an area in which the British group has little experience. Chloride-based products are used in paints for the top-coats of vehicles and high durability coatings. The alternative technology using sulphate is used for products in inks, fibres and ceramics. The joint venture, due to be completed during the second quarter of the year, needs to be cleared by the Federal Trade Commission. ICI presently imports titanium dioxide equivalent to less than 10 per cent of the US market. NL Industries has been suffering from the poor state of the titanium dioxide market. It reported a net loss of Dollars 18.8m on sales of Dollars 694m during the first nine months of last year. The titanium dioxide division's operating income for the first nine months fell 37 per cent compared with the same period in 1991. ICI said the deal had no implications for UK-based titanium dioxide plants. Lex, Page 16</p>

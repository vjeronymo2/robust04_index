			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEWS OF TODAY'S AFI FILM FEST  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Venus Trap'  </P> <P> West Germany, 1988, 107 minutes  </P> <P> 6:50 p.m.  </P> <P>  The latest film by West German sex-and-society phantasmagorist Robert Van  Ackeren ("A Woman in Flames") is weird indeed: like a fancy porno film in which  all the sex has been removed, jumping from one tease to the next. We wander in  and out of the fantasies of an ever-ready young doctor smirking and  consummating his prodigious lusts all around the city. Its theme is the rebirth  of romance in the teeth of desperation, or sex-as-calculated-rebellion, but Van  Ackeren may have over-calculated, this time. How much teasing we can take?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [13 April] in Bonn, UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali basically came out in favor of  greater German participation in the international organization.  On Wednesday, the secretary general also discussed German  representation in the United Nations and, above all, the  transfer of UN offices to Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  During his talks in Bonn it was clearly stated that Germany  wants more transfers of UN offices.    At a joint press conference with FRG foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel, Butrus-Ghali limited his support for Germany's  application for a new seat on the Security Council by pointing  to the UN Charter, which says that he is not responsible for  that. He indicated a longer waiting period by referring to the  necessary discussions among the 184 UN members. In contrast, he  declared his readiness to again suggest a German for the  high-ranking post of UN undersecretary general, after UN legal  adviser "Undersecretary General" Carl Fleischhauer was appointed  a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in  1993.    Kinkel stressed the FRG's claim to greater participation by  pointing to its status as the third-largest payer of  contributions. He thanked Butrus-Ghali for the promise to try to  evacuate the surrounded 11 German employees of Deutsche Welle in  the Rwandan capital of Kigali as soon as possible by means of UN  helicopters.    As during his previous two visits to Bonn, Butrus-Ghali  stressed that he understands Germany's constitutional problems,  which have so far prevented the participation of armed German  blue helmets in peacemaking missions. He will welcome any  German contribution, Butrus-Ghali said.    Regarding the situation in Bosnia and, above all, around  Gorazde, the UN secretary general expressed optimism that  solutions like the one in Sarajevo will get the upper hand in  continued negotiations. Butrus-Ghali did not refer to the  Serbian threats, which have also been directed against UN  personnel. He hopes for appropriate participation by Russia.    Kinkel once again defended the quick decision for NATO air  raids against Serbian positions, which did not permit informing  Moscow immediately. In addition, Russia did, after all, also  sign the UN resolution. After his visit to Bonn, Butrus-Ghali  was expected to go to the Spanish capital of Madrid.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Gulf's Security is the Responsibility of </F> its Sons"]    [Text] There is no doubt that military exercises enable  armies to gain large-scale field skills and high combat  experience, which would not have been gained without hard  training, direct close contact, and continuous examination of  the latest military technologies and science. This is what was  done by some armies in the Gulf, including the Kuwaiti Army,  following the end of the liberation war. They held land, naval,  and air maneuvers with the Western alliance states--the United  States, Britain, and France--as well as naval maneuvers with  Russia, which is also among the advanced states militarily and  is a signatory to the military cooperation agreement with  Kuwait. There is no doubt that the aim of these maneuvers goes  beyond training and military doctrines to political and economic  interests. It is not wrong to embark on such cooperation,  particularly when the parties involved recognize mutual  interests based on equality and respect for national  sovereignty. However, despite their importance, these maneuvers  are not an alternative to the Arab defense order, of which the  Gulf is an integral part, and will not prevent efforts to build  a regional security order that is badly needed in the region.  Otherwise, the maneuvers will become a shackle and a monopoly  that will lead to subservience.    Hence, the Islamic Republic of Iran's call several days ago  for holding joint maneuvers with Gulf states is important and  will reinforce military cooperation and deepen the sense of  joint responsibility toward the region's security, on which the  Gulf states' political literature always focuses and proposes as  one of the Gulf desires and as a priority for the region's  states to reinforce their defense structure. It is, however,  noticed that this call has not been favorably received, even  though it may provide an opportunity for us in Kuwait to  introduce a new strategic dimension in the security cooperation  and military coordination--a dimension that is justified in  light of the unity of the security interests, the deep  historical, and religious ties, and the economic and trade links  in the past and at present. Iran's firm position on the Iraqi  regime's invasion of the State of Kuwait, as well as the blood  we shared in confronting that tyrannical regime, makes it  necessary for us to establish all forms of cooperation and  coordination between Kuwait and Iran in particular and between  the Gulf states and Iran in general. This will breathe life  into Gulf-Iranian relations and will remove some obstacles  hampering strategic understanding to protect the Gulf from all  dangers and ambitions and rise to the level of the big  challenges threatening the Gulf region.</p>

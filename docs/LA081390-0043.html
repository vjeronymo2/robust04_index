			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY MAKES A NERVE-RACKING ESCAPE FROM IRAQ  </P> <P> With tension and confusion escalating in Baghdad, where 500 American citizens  remain stranded, Dr. Ghazi Shaba made his decision: His family would try to  escape Iraq by making a marathon bus ride across the desert to the Jordan  border.  </P> <P> Fifteen hours later, having endured nerve-racking searches and questioning by  Iraqi soldiers, the San Diego County family crossed the border safely, among  the first Americans to be allowed out of Iraq or Kuwait during the current  Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Shaba, his wife, Edna, and sons, Namir, 12, and Steven, 11, entered Jordan on  Wednesday. They took a flight from the capital of Amman on Saturday to  Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and then Los Angeles. They arrived at their Jamul home  early Sunday.  </P> <P> "We took a risk getting on that bus, but I knew we had to take the chance. I  made the decision even though we didn't know what would happen on the road from  minute to minute," said Shaba, a physician with Kaiser Permanente in San Diego.  </P> <P> "It was frightening, very confusing. We were praying constantly to get across  the border," he said.  </P> <P> Shaba's successful odyssey is tinged with sadness: His parents, who live in  Baghdad, are ill. After a joyous reunion in mid-July, their first meeting in 18  years, Shaba knows he probably will not see them again.  </P> <P> "We went to visit my parents and to vacation, but then everything turned very  confusing," he said. "It was very emotional, leaving my parents again after 18  years. We were very upset."  </P> <P> U.S. officials continue efforts to get more Americans out of Iraq and  neighboring Kuwait, which was invaded and annexed by Iraq on Aug. 2. Some  Americans, mostly relatives of diplomats and members of the U.S. Embassy,  arrived in Jordan over the weekend after battling the same frustration the  Shaba family faced in getting permission to leave Iraq.  </P> <P> Other vehicles carrying Americans and other foreign citizens from Baghdad have  been turned back by Iraqi authorities at the Jordan-Iraq border. More than 500  American citizens remain in Baghdad and another 3,000 in Kuwait. The U.S.  government does not yet consider the remaining Americans to be hostages.  </P> <P> After months of planning to visit relatives in Iraq -- both Shaba and his wife  were born there and moved to the United States two decades ago -- the Shabas  arrived in Baghdad on July 16. The Iraqi government announced Aug. 2 that a  coup had occurred in Kuwait and that Iraqi troops had been invited to cross its  border, Shaba said. A news blackout was imposed in Baghdad.  </P> <P> "We couldn't get any news from the outside, any Western news," Shaba said. "We  didn't learn until a few days later what was happening."  </P> <P> When he began to understand the extent of the crisis, Shaba said, he called the  U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and was warned to leave immediately.  </P> <P> Use of roads and airports was limited. Foreigners were faced with confusing and  rapidly changing restrictions on who could leave the country, Shaba said.  Iraqis and Kuwaitis -- now considered under Iraqi jurisdiction since the  annexation -- were not allowed to leave the country.  </P> <P> "Arab nationals were turned back. Some (foreigners) could leave if you had been  in the country for less than one month, but two days later that changed, and  you had to have an exit visa," Shaba said. "It was very confusing."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, after days of contacting the Iraq government and U.S. Embassy,  Shaba heard a rumor that Italian and Japanese tourists had been allowed to  cross the Jordanian border. That night, he got his family on a bus for a  600-mile bus ride through the desert to that border crossing.  </P> <P> During the 15-hour drive along the desolate road, Iraqi soldiers stopped them  at least two dozen times, boarding the bus with guns to inspect passports and  baggage and question the passengers, Shaba said. There was no food and little  water.  </P> <P> "It was not a relaxing escape. It was like a James Bond movie, very  frightening. We didn't know what would happen in the next mile," he said.  </P> <P> At the border, there were more inspections and interrogations, and at one point  it seemed that Shaba's wife and children would be allowed to pass without him.  But Shaba said he and his wife were able to converse in Arabic with the  soldiers, smoothing the way for their crossing.  </P> <P> "We used our common sense in talking with them. I kept persuading them. The  soldiers were hostile to some Americans, but we were treated very well," he  said.  </P> <P> Now that the emotional ordeal of the escape is over, his family remains  concerned about their relatives in Baghdad, Shaba said. All Iraqi men ages 16  to 55 are being drafted, and residents are worried as the military crisis  worsens, he said.  </P> <P> "People are carrying on with their lives, but they don't know what is going to  happen," he said.  </P></p>

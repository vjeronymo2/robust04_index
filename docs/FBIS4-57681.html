			<p>Ties   <F P=102>   PA2405002594 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2252 GMT 23 May  94 </F>  <F P=103> PA2405002594 </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City NOTIMEX </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Castillejos] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, 23 May (NOTIMEX) -- Central America  will reiterate to the United States the need to define  commercial ties between the United States and Central America in  relation to NAFTA, regional official sources reported today.    The regional proposal will be presented to U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore on Tuesday, when he will meet with the  Central American presidents in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, diplomatic  sources added.    Sources told NOTIMEX that the area presidents will propose  an  interdependence relationship "between a program for peace and an  agenda for development" to Gore.    According to a preliminary document yet to be discussed by  the presidents before presenting it to Gore, a renewed  international solidarity, "that goes beyond traditional  assistance," will be demanded.    The sources said the Central American presidents will  propose  that the United States negotiate a "parity" or a "full rights"  incorporation into NAFTA, whose members are the United States,  Mexico, and Canada.    The draft document says the presidents will ask the United  States to expand access of Central American products to the U.S.  market, particularly within the context of the Caribbean Basin  Initiative [ICC]. ICC is a U.S. Government program that  provides tariff exemptions for Caribbean basin countries.    In addition, Rodolfo Doughterty, coordinator of the Central  American Parliament's Export and Investment Commission, said  that the Central American governments will demand recognition of  their countries' productive capabilities. "Central America's  incorporation into international markets is the highest priority  in the presidents' agenda," he said. Central America is on its  way to becoming a "model" region for the solution of conflicts.  It is a region interested in consolidating peace and democracy  through overall development, a diplomatic source commented.    In the 1980's, Central America suffered armed conflicts that  resulted in the deaths of thousands and the displacement of  hundreds of thousands of people. The region seems to have  attained political stability in this decade, however.    In 1993, the 14th Regional Presidential Summit stated:  "Decades of suffering and sacrifice have left the Central  American people with deep scars but also with the necessary  political maturity to admit that we need each other and that we  cannot develop by excluding others."    Nevertheless, the document "Commercial Relations Between  Central America and the United States," issued by the UN Program  for Development [PNUD], admits that the world market does not  operate in the region according to the perfect competition rules.    The Central American governments expect NAFTA to yield to  them benefits similar to those obtained by Mexico, official  sources said. The benefits that Washington grants Central  America through ICC are less than those obtained by Mexico  because, while Mexico does not have to pay tariffs for the  export of its products to the U.S. market, the Central American  countries still do, the sources pointed out.    Central America's trade with the United States is worth  nearly $5.6 billion, with Mexico it is $556 million, and with  Canada it is nearly $195 million, according to official sources.    Rodolfo Prez, president of Guatemala's General Association  of  Farmers [AGA], said there is interest in learning what will be  the U.S. position regarding Central America. "We desire an  opportunity with the United States. We do not want NAFTA to  leave us out," he said.    According to the Central American countries, NAFTA could  divert the trade or the investments of its most important  member, the United States, toward Mexico, particularly regarding  the export of agricultural products, textiles, and clothing,  according to experts.    A document issued by the Central American Integration  Secretariat, to which NOTIMEX had access, proposes to expand the  area covered by ICC and the General Preferences System [SGP] so  that more products of the region can receive special treatment.  SGP is a system whereby the industrialized countries give a  non-reciprocating preferential treatment to developing  countries' products. Trade between Central America and the  United States deals mostly with agricultural products.    This aspiration for preferential treatment was voiced  recently by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who  said: "With the end of the Cold War, we have a chance to become  incorporated into the region, strengthen the democratic process,  combat poverty, ensure respect for human rights, and advance  toward modernization."</p>

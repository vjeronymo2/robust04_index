			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Emap wins Maclean Hunter - Purchase takes media group into Germany for the first time Emap, the media and exhibitions group, yesterday won the battle for Maclean Hunter European Publishing with a Pounds 60m deal. It is believed it beat off United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, Bertelsmann, the German media group, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to acquire the group from Rogers Communications of Toronto. The deal, which is subject to Rogers' purchase earlier this year of Maclean Hunter getting Canadian regulatory approval, greatly expands Emap's presence in continental Europe which has been largely confined to France until now. MHEP publishes 22 directories, provides seven electronic information services and publishes 34 business magazines in six countries apart from the UK. In the UK the publications include UK Press Gazette, the business publication of the newspaper industry, and BRAD (British Rate and Data). More importantly the acquisition takes Emap into the German market in a significant way for the first time through the Media Daten directory and Germany's second largest portfolio of construction business magazines, directories and information services. The deal marks what may be the end, for the time being at least, of a very active period for Emap on the takeover trail. During the first half of the current financial year Emap spent Pounds 197m on acquisitions, including Pounds 106m for 28 magazines from Editions Mondiales, the French publisher, and a further 10 consumer titles from the Hersant group of France. It also included Pounds 50m on Trans World Communications, the commercial radio group. Mr Robin Miller, group chief executive, promised yesterday that the company would continue to take advantage of any opportunities which arose. He added: 'Our main efforts will now be concentrated on achieving the anticipated returns from the recent additions to our business.' Last month Mr David Arculus, managing director, made it clear he regarded the Maclean titles as a 'bolt-on' to the existing business titles. The latest deal is part of Emap's determination to expand in continental Europe. 'Within the space of six months we have firmly established ourselves first in France and now in Germany with smaller operations in a number of other European countries,' Mr Miller said. Last month Emap reported pre-tax profits up 34 per cent at Pounds 22.2m for the six months to the beginning of October on turnover up 38 per cent at Pounds 234.2m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yig'al Karmon] </F>   [Text] Three weeks after signing of the agreement, there  still is no autonomy council, and the local administration is  nearly paralyzed. The police, who are not local, do not know the  terrain and the people. The Gaza Strip is under total closure  following the terrorist attacks and even Jericho has been placed  under a "study closure." But how will they study the agreement  while their commanders mislead them and announce that Israelis  are not allowed to travel with arms? 'Arafat adds his own two  cents and sends out instructions that create legal and  functional chaos on the ground while blatantly violating the  agreement, of course.    In this situation, no wonder that people are already  speaking  of reconquering the Gaza Strip--would that it were not  necessary. Rabin calls all this "a good start." Why? He let the  cat out of the bag during his visit to Gaza, revealing the real  goal and the true test of the process: not an agreement, not  peace, not even a cessation in terror--but getting IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] soldiers out of Gaza. There were also  ideological motives such as those of MERETZ (to put an end at  any cost to occupation rule of another people) and realist  motives such as those of Rabin (the IDF has failed and we cannot  go on this way forever; he found no solutions that would not  require involvement of much of the army in policing the  territories and denied the political branch any options until it  was forced to leave, come what may).    Accordingly, 'Arafat can declare jihad as much as he likes,  announce his intention to break the agreement as Muhammad did in  his time and even violate it immediately in practice (as he is  doing). We got ours. The IDF has left the alleys of Gaza.    Because this is the true test and the basic goal of the  entire process not only so far as the government is concerned  but for a large part of the public as well, the question arises,  was the agreement with the PLO the correct and best way to  achieve this? Might there have been a better way to reach the  goal, such as unilateral withdrawal and handing over authority  to the residents (even without an agreement with them)?  Comparison of the two options shows that neither assures an  orderly peace and stability and that terror is very likely to  continue either way. If and when it becomes necessary as a  result to carry out the IDF's contingency plans because there is  no other way to guard the Green Line area except by holding the  Gaza Strip as a security zone (as in southern Lebanon), it will  become apparent that we have chosen the worse of the options.  Indeed, we shall then face not only the inhabitants of Gaza but  also thousands of armed men--PLO soldiers, released prisoners  and deportees who were brought back--who would not be there if  we had chosen the option of unilateral withdrawal. We shall also  face a population armed with the weapons, the morale, and a  fighting nation's readiness for sacrifice created by the  agreement with the PLO. And, of course, we shall face the PLO  itself, which we have rescued by our own hands from internal and  elemental collapse and reinforced with support in the most vital  arena of all: the free world led by the United States. Of  course, if we had chosen unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, we  would not be mixed up with Jericho, nor would we ourselves be  undermining Israel's security doctrine and our consensus  regarding the Jordan Valley which, like the Golan Heights, is  almost barren of Arab inhabitants.    Even for its goals and means, Israel's government has chosen  the worse of the two options.</p>

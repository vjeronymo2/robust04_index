			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS DAY COLDEST EVER IN PARTS OF U.S.  </P> <P> Forecasters said Monday may have been the coldest Christmas ever in Florida as  freezing temperatures destroyed an estimated 40% of citrus and vegetable crops  and power outages delayed holiday dinners and other activities.  </P> <P> In Texas, temperatures headed into the 50s and 60s after a mass of arctic air  had smashed low-temperature records and destroyed about 60% of the citrus crop  there. Fruit growers fear that trees also may be damaged or lost, state  agriculture officials said.  </P> <P> At Harlingen, Tex., citrus grower Joe Kutzenberger said no fruit that was not  harvested before Friday and Saturday's cold can be salvaged.  </P> <P> It was the second straight day that Florida's $3.5-billion citrus industry was  ravaged by cold. Wind was light Christmas Eve, meaning groves that escaped  unharmed the previous night suffered freeze damage. Stiffer wind prevents frost  from settling on the fruit.  </P> <P> "Apparently there is a lot of iced fruit," said Dick Whalley, a spokesman for  Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's big grower cooperative.  </P> <P> More snow fell on the Deep South, and Florida utilities asked people to turn  off holiday decorations to save electricity for heat.  </P> <P> Florida Power &amp; Light imposed rolling blackouts of up to 30 minutes in  length and braced for a possible increase in demand with the opening of many  businesses today. "The records only go back to '42, and this was the coldest  Christmas since 1942," said meteorologist Noel Risnychok of the National  Weather Service.  </P> <P> On the resort island of St. Simons along the south Georgia coast, residents  reveled in the rare snow, cross-country skiing on beaches and body surfing on  Boogie boards in snow-covered parking lots.  </P> <P> Many homes in Charleston, S.C., were without water Monday because of a water  main break.  </P> <P> The temperature fell to a record low of zero at the Wilmington, N.C., airport,  where a record 15 inches of snow fell Sunday. The previous record low at  Wilmington of 5 above had stood since February, 1899.  </P> <P> Two of North Carolina's three main natural gas companies asked consumers to  turn down their heat Monday to ease demand on tight supplies.  </P> <P> Other record daily lows Monday, all in Florida, were 29 at Ft. Lauderdale, 46  at Key West and a record-tying 33 at Miami Beach, the National Weather Service  reported.  </P> <P> The East and Midwest received a welcome gift from Mother Nature early Monday as  a stubborn cold spell loosened its deadly grip.  </P> <P> Although much of the Midwest enjoyed a white Christmas, temperatures in some  areas climbed into the 40s and 50s, well above the record chills of last week.  </P> <P> In New England, a massive arctic high-pressure system responsible for record  low temperatures slowly weakened, but temperatures remained bitterly cold.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment of George Washington's  famous Revolutionary War crossing of the Delaware River to capture British  troops at Trenton, N.J. "We couldn't get our four boats into the river because  it was a sheet of ice," said James Gallagher, who has played the role of  Washington since 1985.  </P></p>

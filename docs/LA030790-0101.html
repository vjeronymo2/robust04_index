			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Diaper Deals for Dandees Enterprises: The 3-year-old Los Angeles firm announced  commitments from 750 Southern California markets, including Hughes, Boys and  Ralphs, to carry its new line of diapers. The deals came despite mounting  criticism from environmentalists and such companies as Procter &amp; Gamble,  who contend that so-called degradable diapers don't truly degrade in landfills.  The diapers, like other degradable plastics on the market, are 94%  petroleum-based plastic and 6% starch and enzymes.  </P></p>

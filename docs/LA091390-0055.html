			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MICHIGAN PASSES PARENTAL CONSENT ABORTION BILL  </P> <P> A measure to require girls to obtain parental consent for an abortion sailed  through the Michigan Legislature on Wednesday, but abortion-rights activists  pledged a quick counterattack.  </P> <P> The measure requires unmarried girls 17 and younger to have permission from a  parent or a judge to get an abortion.  </P> <P> It will become law 90 days after the last legislative session in December,  taking effect about April 1.  </P> <P> The Legislature approved an identical bill earlier this year, but Gov. James J.  Blanchard vetoed it. Right To Life of Michigan then gathered about 330,000  signatures to put it back before the Legislature, which took less than five  hours to approve the measure.  </P> <P> Because it began with a petition drive, Blanchard cannot veto the latest  version.  </P> <P> Barbara Listing, president of Right To Life of Michigan, said it would  encourage sexually active teen-agers to use birth control. Girls who do become  pregnant will be able to get help, guidance and support from their families in  deciding what to do, she added.  </P> <P> State Rep. Maxine Berman denounced the bill as "a mean-spirited shame. A lot of  teen-agers are going to find themselves in horrible positions because of this."  </P> <P> Katherine Spillar, national coordinator for the Fund for a Feminist Majority,  said laying the groundwork for a repeal effort will start immediately.  </P> <P> "We will be organizing the outrage and the anger. We know it's an uphill battle  here," she said.  </P></p>

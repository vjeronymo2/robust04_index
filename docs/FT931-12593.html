			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris falls on worries over banking sector CORPORATE news dominated the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS weakened after Standard and Poor's, the US credit ratings agency, said that it was placing six French banks, including subsidiaries of Suez, down FFr10.90 at FFr260.50, and Paribas, FFr2.70 lower at FFr 375.00 on creditwatch. The CAC-40 index closed down 15.20 at 1,777.35 in turnover of some FFr2.3bn. Alcatel Alsthom lost FFr15 or 2.4 per cent to FFr625 after Paribas Capital Markets lowered its rating from hold to underweight. FRANKFURT blamed cooling hopes of interest rate cuts, yet again, and selling of equities from the DTB derivatives market as the DAX index fell 13.84 to 1,562.30, featuring falls of over 1 per cent in Deutsche Bank, Daimler and Siemens. However, market turnover stayed low, falling from DM5.4bn to DM4.6bn. Deutsche Bank fell DM7 to DM633.50 on an unchanged DM15 dividend and a report that the engineer, KHD, was considering a rights issue. Deutsche has a 40 per cent indirect holding in KHD, which rose DM2.80 to DM101.80 on the hope of share price support from the banks. AMSTERDAM saw Hoogovens gaining Fl 1.50 to Fl 26.90 on news after Tuesday's close that it was to lift steel prices by up to 15 per cent from April. James Capel, in a comment on the European steel sector yesterday, forecast that, in common with previous years, the 'strategic ploy' of announcing an April price rise was to boost sales. After April, the brokers note, the increases only held for a brief period. The CBS Tendency index was flat at 97.7. BRUSSELS was little changed although steel shares performed strongly after Hoogovens' announcement. The Bel-20 index added 0.15 to 1,178.45 in volume of BFr1.04bn. Cockerill, due to make a statement on prices later this week, closed BFr6 higher at BFr95 with a high 141,000 shares traded. Luxembourg steel maker Arbed followed in its wake, rising BFr80 to BFr1,995. Solvay, down BFr25 at BFr12,750, turned back from a firm start after announcing that 1992 net profit before extraordinary items would fall 14 per cent, at the high end of analysts' expectations. MILAN saw continuing weakness in Montedison while the Comit index rose 7.29 to 480.38. Montedison was fixed L26 lower at L1,155 before falling to L1,124 after hours as a Socialist MP called for an investigation into its former joint venture with ENI. Speculation that Gemina could be planning a disposal - its stakes in Ambrovento and Burgo have both been mentioned - ignited the insurance and banking sector. Gemina firmed L41 to L1,255, Ambrovento advanced L120 to L4,100 but Burgo slipped L130 to L5,470. ZURICH ended near the day's lows as profit-taking eroded prices. The SMI index fell 20.2 to 2,064.1. Nestle shed SFr15 to SFr1,050 in response to last year's 7.9 per cent rise in group sales, announced after the market closed on Tuesday. Roche certificates declined SFr60 to SFr4,030 amid reports that investors were turning instead to Sandoz, SFr50 higher at SFr3,170. STOCKHOLM reversed early gains after Stora announced a preliminary 1992 loss of SKr1.4bn after a 1991 profit of SKr1.1bn. Its B shares closed down SKr4 at SKr259. The Affarsvarlden index fell 3.2 to 893.0 in turnover of SKr565m after Tuesday's SKr745m. VIENNA saw short-covering lift the ATX index 17.91 or 2.4 per cent to 761.62 with Austrian Airlines putting on Sch120 to Sch1,650. ATHENS saw profit-taking after strong gains earlier in the week and the general index closed 15.89 lower at 732.16.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 27                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1078.40     1077.07     1077.24    1076.73 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1155.56     1153.01     1150.35    1151.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1075.30     1073.84     1073.99    1072.28 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1150.60     1150.76     1148.75    1147.45  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 26    Jan 25    Jan 22    Jan 21    Jan 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1084.24   1077.68   1091.64   1091.44   1091.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1156.52   1146.87   1156.91   1154.96   1153.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1078.64; 200 - 1155.99 Low/day: 100 - 1072.18 200 - 1147.25.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Stalemate in South Africa THE AFRICAN National Congress has made its point. It should now return to the negotiating table. The trial of strength on the streets has ended in stalemate. Millions of Africans stayed away from work on Monday and Tuesday, either out of political conviction or as a result of intimidation. On Wednesday exuberant supporters of the ANC were addressed by Mr Nelson Mandela in the amphitheatre near government headquarters. President FW de Klerk evidently instructed his senior police officers to co-operate with the demonstration leaders, but this does not mean that further 'rolling mass action' would necessarily pass without setting off a violent explosion. In any event, continued negotiation by street theatre would be self-defeating. It would further weaken the republic's economy and deter foreign investors. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that Mr Mandela will lead his party back into talks. That is the logical next step. The ANC has expressed its understandable anger at the killing of its people at Boipatong, allegedly by supporters of the Inkatha Freedom party. Recent reports have lent credence to charges that the lower ranks of the South African police have connived at, or taken part in, murders of ANC supporters. The number of deaths in police custody has been shown to be suspiciously high. The assertion that Mr de Klerk is either unable or unwilling to control his security forces has become increasingly difficult for him to refute. This puts his government back under the world spotlight. He is aware of this. South Africa has accepted 10 United Nations observers within its borders. The team is small, but its potential contribution as a facilitator of an eventual settlement is disproportionately large. Mr Cyrus Vance was instrumental in bringing about a pre-demonstration meeting between the South African government and the ANC, thus contributing to the apparently peaceful nature of this week's events and setting the scene for an early resumption of talks. Mr Vance is now expected to propose the establishment of a long-term UN presence in the republic, to monitor the progress of the national peace accord. This should be welcomed, but its potential should not be exaggerated. Outsiders such as the UN and the British individuals sent to assist into inquiries into police behaviour can help diminish the mistrust between the ANC and the government, but they cannot solve the fundamental problem that faces the two sides. This is that Mr Mandela's party demands majority rule while Mr de Klerk's insists on 'power-sharing' as a means of protecting minorities. A deal can be struck only when the ANC recognises that it cannot have total control over South Africa handed to it on a plate and the National party accepts that in the end constitutional safeguards for minorities cannot permanently and universally thwart the will of an elected majority. If South Africa is lucky, the perilous weeks now behind it will have served to concentrate the minds of those who must reach agreement - or face a future that a former prime minister once described as too ghastly to contemplate.</p>

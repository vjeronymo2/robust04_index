In explaining why such efforts were necessary, Peng Yu,  vice-director of the National Family Planning Committee, said by  the end of last year China's population was more than 1.18  billion. The number of women at reproductive age was more than  324 million or 27 percent of the population.    But China's arable land was only 7 percent of the world's  total, it had to support 22 percent of the world's people, Peng  said.    China's population had to live within the country, she went  on. Unlike the situation which had prevailed in Europe during  its industrial revolution, China could not ease its population  pressure by diverting large populations to other continents.    Rapid population growth had led to sharp reductions of  arable  land and over-exploitation of resources and aggravated  environmental pollution, she continued. As its basic national  policy since the late 1970s China adopted family planning to  control population quantity and improve its quality in terms of  health and education. The aim was to accelerate socio-economic  development.    Peng summarized the main points of China's current family  planning policy: to promote late marriage and later, fewer  births; to advocate the practice of "one couple, one child," to  persuade rural couples who wished for second children to have  proper spacing; and to let the governments of autonomous regions  or provinces inhabited by national minorities decide their  family planning needs according to local conditions.</p>

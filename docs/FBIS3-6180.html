The three generators  are now safely producing more than 92 million kilowatt-hours of  electricity for the national line after being installed and  completing a test run from 12 January to 2 March. Thanks to  these generators, daily electricity resources for the southern  provinces have increased by about 15-20 percent. The total cost  of the 63-km, 220-kilovolt Ba Ria-Long Binh line and the three  generators was more than 441 billion dong.</p>

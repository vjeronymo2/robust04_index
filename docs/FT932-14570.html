			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / How To Spend It: The sweet smells of success - Lucia van der Post sniffs fragrances fit for the most discerning noses SOMETHING STRANGE has been happening to perfume. Where once public relations blurb used to wax lyrical about green notes and oriental essences, today the language has changed. The deconstructionists, having finished with clothes are moving in on perfume. Listen to Japanese designer Issey Miyake, talking about his own perfume, L'Eau D'Issey, launched last year: 'For me the most beautiful perfume for a woman is water. Water is like a surge of energy: it has upward positive movement; spiritually it's more of a fountain than a trickle.' Well . . . er . . . perhaps. But wouldn't it just be easier to bottle some spring water and leave it at that? Listen next to French designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier, darling of the French Haute Boheme, whose first bottled elixir goes on sale in Harrods this week: 'It's one part dusty loose powder, like my grandmother wore - I think it was old Coty; one part that smell you get when you are sitting in the front row of the theatre - for me I think of going to the Chatelet when I was 12 - and the curtain goes up, and the hot lights are on the costumes, wigs and sets, and you breathe it all in; and, just to be modern, one part nail polish remover.' All very frank, very modern and very barrier-breaking but I cannot help wondering whatever happened to jasmine and ambergris, to musk and tuberose, to seductive nights and scented mornings, to romance and mystery ? But, hark, what have we here? Jean-Paul Gaultier is on about eternity - you will, I am sure, remember eternity, that staple of PR perfume utterances. 'Why hasn't he thought about it (ie creating a perfume) before?' asks the blurb, 'For the sake of eternity,' comes the Delphic answer. Ah, but of course. Instead of water, Bulgari has drawn on the 'ancient Oriental tea culture and the more profound sense of the rituals connected with it' for inspiration for its new perfume, Eau Parfumee, Cologne au The Vert. For a text it has taken some lines from Lin Yutang, a contemporary Chinese writer: 'There is something in the essence of tea which guides one towards a world of serene contemplation of life'. So there is and Eau Parfumee looks as cool and green and serene as any Oriental tea ever did. Kenzo has a more traditional source of inspiration - summer - for his latest perfume which is just about to be launched. Kenzo, it seems, loves summer. He sees it as a 'symbol of happiness, of openness to the world, of freedom without end . . . ' an 'invitation to the pleasures of living in rare communion with nature, celebrating the union of body, mind and sun.' So Parfum D'Ete is 'A song to summer, his muse, his inspiration.' It 'dances like a sunbeam, softly caressing the skin with a warm and fragrant wind. Inside us, sun-filled, exhilarating pictures of summer come alive, transporting us away from today towards gold, eternal fields.' Goodness, I cannot wait. Clearly, what we are seeing is a new mood in the traditional world of perfume and this extends beyond the conception and the smell to the design of the bottles. Where once the talents of Baccarat and Lalique and great designers of the day combined to produce bottles of lavish seductiveness, today's bottles perfectly express the new mood in the world of perfume. Issey Miyake's bottle, as befits the most intellectual of fashion designers, is strong, sculptural, simple and clean. It exudes an air of purity and strength. A slender, tapering, conical-shaped bottle (described as 'timeless  -pure and flowing, just like water') of clear glass which allows the perfume to be seen is finished by a 'silver' conical top. Jean-Paul Gaultier's is a joky, funky, pink torso of a woman. It may look absolutely 1990s but as new-age thoughts go this harks back to the 1930s and 1940s when many scent bottles, including a famous one by Schiaparelli, came woman-shaped. But, as Jean-Paul Gaultier puts it: 'As it is a fragrance for a woman it was obvious that the bottle ought to be woman shaped.' The torso/bottle comes packaged in a slicked-up version of a tin-can which has a ring-pull opener. Gaultier admits that there is a certain perverseness at work here: 'Nobody before thought of a can as a classy packaging.' He simply took a pair of scissors and cut up a tin can which he gave to a jeweller to smooth down. The result, as Jean-Paul Gaultier must be satisfactorily aware, is indubitably different. The Bulgari bottle is - like the tea ceremony - all serenity. Clean - lined, frosted glass reveals the cool pale green perfume and the classily simple silver top is etched with the Bulgari name. Classic, timeless, elegant. As for Kenzo, summer has clearly set him (and co-designer Serge Mansau) off. We have a bottle of frosted glass shaped like a leaf with fine indentations of leaf-veins, which comes in an aquamarine blue box imprinted faintly with a sheaf of grasses bound with raffia. Traditionalists can take heart, for all the new-age language, the talk of breaking barriers and the hint of iconoclasm behind the designs all four of these perfumes smell quite nice. L'Eau d'Issey, for instance, is light, refined, and will never embarrass you by shouting too loudly. Gaultier is bright pink but is richer, more sensuous and could happily be worn to the grandest soiree. Bulgari smells of citrus and if you go on sniffing 'the green tea essence,' so runs the blurb, 'is slowly released to give one a truly refreshing feeling.' As for Kenzo's oeuvre, it is hard to define: light but more floral than the others, it, too, has the inestimable merit of being nice and quiet and well-behaved. Not the sort that, like some of its transatlantic cousins, would knock out all other contenders in an olfactory contest.

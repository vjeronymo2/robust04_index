			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Five years ago,  officials of Liaoning Province asked the central government to  supply this key industrial province with two million tons of  grain.    Last year saw the officials go to Beijing to ask for help  once more.    But this time they did not request for grain supply, but for  helping sell its two million tons of surplus grain.    "This was a historical change," a provincial official said,  "Liaoning Province, used to depend on other provinces for  living, is self-sufficient in grain and pork."    According to the figures provided by the Provincial  Statistical Bureau, the province turned out 17 million tons of  grain last year, averaging 400 kilograms per capita and  exceeding the national average.    Its output of livestock products amounted to 2.32 million  tons, averaging 34 kilograms of meat, 18 kilograms of eggs and  four kilograms of milk per capita, also higher than the national  average.    By the end of last year, the province sold 2.5 million tons  of rice and maize and 300,000 live pigs to other parts of the  country.    In addition, it exported 300,000 tons of rice to Japan last  year.    Local officials attributed their achievements to the  government's sustained efforts in promoting agricultural  development.    Liaoning is China's only province, of which the urban  population accounts for more than 70 percent of the province's  total.    To feed its residents, the provincial government had to buy  at least three million tons of grain and 70,000 tons of pork  from development.    A senior Chinese official has called on other provinces and  regions with grain shortage to follow the example of Liaoning in  northeast China.</p>

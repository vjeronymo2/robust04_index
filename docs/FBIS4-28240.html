			<p>BFN     [Text] Tonga's offer to join a Pacific Islands  peacekeeping force on the Papua New Guinea island of  Bougainville will be followed up this week by a visit to the  island by Tonga's minister for foreign affairs and defense,  Crown Prince Tupouto'a. Sean Dorney reports that the crown  prince will be the first minister of a foreign country to visit  mainland Bougainville since the secessionist war began.    [Begin Dorney recording] Papua New Guinea's foreign  minister, Sir Julius Chan, raised the possibility of Tonga  providing the soldiers for the proposed peacekeeping force with  Crown Prince Tupouto'a's father, the king, when in Tonga  recently. The crown prince, who is a soldier himself, arrives  in Port Moresby tomorrow for a five-day visit to Papua New  Guinea.    Sir Julius says Price Tupouto'a will travel to Buka Island  on  Wednesday [8 June] and then go on to visit (Wakamayan Glowmahoe)  on the Bougainville mainland. Fiji has also offered troops for  the peacekeeping force, but Australia may be asked to fund.</p>

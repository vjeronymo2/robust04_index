			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow is not inclined to dramatize the situation  stemming from the American Senate's decision to recommend that  the Clinton Administration should unilaterally lift the  international embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslims  imposed in 1991. "This decision is unlikely to be carried out,"  a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX on Friday.    According to him, "prior to becoming a law, the Senate's  decision must be supported by the House of Representatives."  "And this is very problematic. But even if this happens, the  U.S. President might use his right to veto," the diplomat said.    American legislators, he noted, had already decided to lift  the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian Muslims previously.  "As at that time, this may be a political declaration, rather  than instructions for action. Under American legislation the  international law has priority over national, and therefore the  U.N. embargo on arms supplies to the Muslims will remain in  force till the U.N. Security Council makes its own decision," he  said.    Nevertheless, the diplomat conceded that the U.S. Senate's  decision is not the "best gift" for the conference of the heads  of Russian, American, British, French, Belgian, German and Greek  diplomacies on a settlement in Bosnia which opens in Geneva on  Friday. "The U.S. secretary of state will have to reckon with  the senators' decision in one way or another. The only question  is to what extent," he added.    According to INTERFAX's interviewee, "the political  declaration of the U.S. Senate might give rise to some response  in Russia's State Duma." "As regards emotions our legislators  are not second to the American. They can be expected to decide  to lift the sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia in the near  future. If this happens, the State Duma decision will have the  same fate as that of the U.S. Senate," the diplomat concluded.</p>

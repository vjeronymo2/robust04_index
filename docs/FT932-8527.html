			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Sterling rises on hopes of calmer ERM SEVERAL European currencies, including sterling and the Italian lira, rose strongly against the D-Mark in the build-up to yesterday's Yes vote in Denmark, writes James Blitz. Investors sold D-Marks after taking the view that a clear result in favour of the Maastricht treaty would ease tensions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. In recent weeks investors, fearing a No vote, had been seeking a safe haven against currency turmoil and a renewed threat to economic and monetary union by buying D-Marks and Swiss francs. German government bond prices also fell yesterday, to the benefit of Italian and French bonds. Sterling gained a pfennig to close at DM2.4875 after the final Danish opinion polls showed a clear majority for the treaty. The Italian lira was also a strong performer, closing at L909.2 against the D-Mark from a previous close of L914.9. The dollar gained significantly from the D-Mark's weakness, rising more than a pfennig in Europe to finish at DM1.6272, a 7-week high. It closed in London at DM1.624 and at DM1.62465 in New York. The dollar was also supported by speculation about tighter monetary policy in the US. Currencies, Page 43</p>

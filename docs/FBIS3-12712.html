			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah in London and unattributed </F> AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT report from Sanaa: "People of al-Dali' Besiege  Northern Brigade in Yemen"]    [Text] Yemeni military sources have confirmed that forces  of the (northern) 2d Armored Brigade stationed at al-Kabsi camp  in al-Rahah area near Radfan (about 160 km north of Aden)  yesterday came out of their barracks and spread out in nearby  villages and valleys with the aim of besieging the southern town  of al-Dali'.    At the same time the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade in the  southern governorate of Abyan yesterday also continued to deploy  heavily in the town of Zinjibar after storming and seizing the  security command headquarters in the governorate.    That northern military move came less than one hour after  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who is also the secretary  general of the General People's Congress [GPC], and his Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who is the secretary general of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], signed an authorization giving the  Joint Military Committee full powers to put an end to the  military clashes between northern and southern forces.    Political sources have stressed that the crisis of trust  which has now spread from the political to the military sector  might hamper the implementation of any agreement. According to  military sources in Aden, the people of al-Dali yesterday came  out to confront the forces of the (northern) 2d Armored Brigade  to prevent them from moving their armor and to force them to  return to the positions they held before.    Military reports also said yesterday that the al-'Amaliqah  Brigade was still refusing to obey any orders to return to its  barracks on the outskirts of the southern town of Zinjibar.    The sources said that the 5th Light Infantry Brigade loyal  to  former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was totally destroyed and  that the real number of victims of the heavy bombardment of that  brigade by the 1st Armored Division commanded by Colonel 'Ali  Muhsin al-Ahmar was still unknown.    The sources added: "The crime was not just what happened to  the soldiers loyal to former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad near  Sanaa, but also the fact that those who did it are denying that  there was such a barracks in that area. That is what they said  to the military team which visited Harf Sufyan north of 'Umran."</p>

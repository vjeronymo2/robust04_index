			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Apr (AFP) -- President Carlos  Roberto Reina said Thursday that the Honduran Armed Forces  support his decision to eliminate compulsory military service,  as announced on Wednesday night on a national radio and  television network. The president told the press that after he  announced his intention to submit to the National Congress a  bill to remove forced recruitment from the Constitution, General  Luis Alonso Discua, commander in chief of the Honduran Armed  Forces, telephoned him to congratulate him.    He described as "part of the democratic give and take" the  statements made Thursday by other top military leaders,  reiterating their disagreement with the measure, which relieves  young men between 18 and 30 years old from compulsory military  service.    Reina's bill proposes instead the creation of "a voluntary,  educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military  service."    In addition, the deputies of the opposition National Party  of  Honduras said today they will have to review the bill with the  military before it reaches the plenum of the legislative  chamber. Constitutional amendments must be approved by  two-thirds of the 128 deputies and must be ratified by the  legislature the following year to enter into force.    Meanwhile, Gladys Lanza, one of 10 people who went on a  hunger strike 10 days ago to pressure the government to repeal  compulsory military service, told reporters she will not stop  her fast until there is a final decision on the matter.    President Reina acknowledged today in remarks to the press  that compulsory military service "has been terribly unjust,"  because it has only been imposed on the poor, and military  chiefs themselves have admitted that young men in the batallions  have been mistreated.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Allied Group fined over adverts ALLIED MAPLES Group, the furniture retailer, was yesterday found guilty of putting its prices up by 25 per cent ahead of a sale which advertised '25 per cent off everything'. Magistrates in Reading, Berkshire, heard how local Allied branches sold goods at the normal price, and even more, while the chain promised 'massive reductions' in advertising in national newspapers and on TV. The group, based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, was found guilty on five counts of placing misleading advertisements between last December and March this year. The company was fined a total of Pounds 3,250 under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 and was ordered to pay Pounds 2,232.95 costs.</p>

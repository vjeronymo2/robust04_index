			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: That sinking feeling in market flotations Down Under - Kevin Brown reports on the jitters now forcing the abandonment of some equity and rights issues in Australia AUSTRALIA'S financial community is becoming increasingly jittery about the prospects for forthcoming equity issues in the wake of a falling stock market and a series of controversial flotations and rights offers. The uncertainty was brought to a head last week by the abandonment of a ADollars 2bn (Dollars 1.4bn) flotation of the Woolworths retailing chain, owned by Industrial Equity (IEL), a subsidiary of the collapsed Adsteam group. The board of IEL reluctantly abandoned the flotation after being told by the lead underwriters that there was no prospect of raising more than about ADollars 1.7bn in the current state of the market. IEL is not alone in having failed to bring an offering to the market in recent weeks. Brokers say Wilson Neill of New Zealand also dropped plans to float its Tasmanian brewery operations after being advised the issue would flop. Even Foster's Brewing Group, the world's fourth-largest brewer, has problems with its ADollars 1bn rights issue. The ADollars 1.10-a-share issue appeared to be deeply discounted when it was announced three weeks ago, but looks much less attractive now that Foster's shares have slipped to ADollars 1.16. The main reason for the uncertainty is the continuing weakness of the Australian share market, with the All Ordinaries Index at 1,455.4 last night, down 13.6 per cent from its peak of 1,684.5 in May. The weakness reflects Australia's slower-than-expected recovery from recession, combined with uncertainty about the timing and outcome of a forthcoming federal election, and a reduction in demand from overseas buyers. But confidence has been further undermined by disappointment over several recent equity issues, notably the ADollars 1.2bn flotation of the Government Insurance Office (GIO) of New South Wales. The GIO flotation, which was heavily promoted by the state government, closed ADollars 1bn oversubscribed following unprecedented demand from small investors, who took up 75 per cent of the shares. After opening at a small premium, GIO shares have traded at a discount to the ADollars 2.40 issue price, in spite of the release of improved trading results. Many investors were also burnt by the weak aftermarket for the ADollars 475m flotation of Australian Consolidated Press, the magazine arm of Mr Kerry Packer's privately-owned media group. But the greatest contributor to the uncertainty was the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue by Westpac Banking Corporation, which was 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving about 17 per cent of issued shares in the hands of the underwriters and sub-underwriters. The turmoil caused by the Westpac debacle has sufficiently worried the Australian Stock Exchange to prompt a check into the financial health of brokers who participated in the sub-underwriting. It has also raised questions about the willingness of corporate investors to participate in future equity raisings. For example, Pioneer International, the building products group, says it acquired 12m Westpac shares at the issue price of ADollars 3, valued in its books at ADollars 36m, but worth only ADollars 33.2m at last night's closing price of ADollars 2.77. Pioneer has not ruled out participating in future underwritings, but says the size of its exposure to Westpac was a 'one-off'. So far, Pioneer is the only corporate casualty of the Westpac issue to come clean about its exposure, but brokers say there is no doubt that many others were tempted. 'The Westpac net spread well beyond the traditional underwriters into the more adventurous industrial companies, and it is likely that many of those will not want to participate in equity raisings again,' says Mr David Arch, a director of the investment banking division of Schroders Australia. 'I think a number of flotations will be put on ice. Smaller flotations will probably still go ahead because people will not be so worried about those, but the ones where there is a large volume of stock coming on to the market are going to be very hard to underwrite,' he says. Mr Ralph Willis, the federal finance minister, appeared to concur with this view yesterday when he suggested that the the flotation of Qantas, the government-owned airline, might be delayed beyond the earlier target of March 1993. There must also be a question mark over other mooted flotations, including Ansett, a domestic airline owned by TNT and News Corporation; David Jones, another Adsteam retailing subsidiary; the Rural and Industries Bank, owned by the Western Australia state government; the Channel Seven television network, formerly owned by Mr Christopher Skase's Qintex group; and various businesses owned by the governments of New South Wales and Victoria. In addition, cash-hungry companies, such as the transport group TNT, long rumoured to be considering a ADollars 500m rights issue, may have to find other means of raising capital, such as equity issues in overseas markets. However, not all observers are convinced that there is a rational basis for the uncertainty in Australia. Mr Bruce Rolph, head of research at Barings, says the widespread uneasiness is largely a reflection of the weakness of the stock market, which he forecasts will recover by up to 25 per cent in the next 12 months. Mr Rolph argues that Westpac, Foster's and Adsteam should all be treated as special cases: Westpac because of its poor public image; Foster's and Adsteam because of their well-known former association with the failed entrepreneurs Mr John Elliott and Mr John Spalvins. But even the bullish Mr Rolph thinks the next large issue will need special treatment. 'It will have to be deeply discounted because the market is quite sceptical at the moment and the institutions are going to have to be very confident that they will not be left holding undervalued stock,' he says.</p>

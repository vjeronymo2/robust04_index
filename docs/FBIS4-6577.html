			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Colonel Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great September First Revolution of  the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, denounced  the nuclear threat of the United States to the DPRK at the  second lawyers conference of Libya held in Tarabulus over April  14-16.    In his speech he charged that the United States was using  the  United Nations as a tool for suppressing the people and abusing  it for the attainment of its aims. "The confrontation today is a  confrontation with imperialism," he said.    Saying he did not pin any hope on the UN Charter which had  already been violated and destroyed, he went on:    "Has North Korea occupied Kuwait? Or has it reached the  nuclear arms on the earth? Is this the reason why they abuse  and threaten North Korea and attempt to strike it? Aren't they  going too far?    "We must fight a bloody fight against imperialism. We will  fight to the last man to defend our rights."</p>

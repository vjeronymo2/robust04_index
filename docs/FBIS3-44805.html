The two sides had a cordial and friendly talk on topics of  common interest.    During the meeting, Zou expressed his thanks to Lundberg for  his role in promoting China's cooperation with other Inmarsat  member countries.    He expressed the belief that the setting up of Inmarsat's  representative office in Beijing would further enhance this  cooperation.    Lundberg voiced his appreciation for China's support for  Inmarsat.    He said Inmarsat is directing more and more attention to the  Asia and Pacific region, which boasts rapidly growing economies.    China is the ideal place for Inmarsat to establish its first  representative office outside its London headquarters, he said.    According to sources here, Inmarsat, set up in 1979, is a  commercial organization between governments. With 71 member  countries, its aim is to provide better communications services  to ships and aircraft via its maritime satellites.</p>

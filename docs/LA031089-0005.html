			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANG LIZHI  </P> <P> As a Chinese student studying here, I am greatly disturbed by the incident of  Prof. Fang Lizhi, the prominent Chinese dissident astrophysicist, being blocked  by the Chinese police from attending President George Bush's banquet on his  invitation (Part I, Feb. 27; editorial, "The Missing Guest," Feb. 28).  </P> <P> The obviously politically motivated obstruction not only violates Prof. Fang's  basic human rights, it may also alarm and alienate many Chinese students here.  Largely identified with Fang's honest and outspoken ideas, hundreds and  thousands of them have signed letters to support him. Now his humiliation  clearly sends a chilling signal to those of us who plan to return that  political freedom and tolerance are still very limited there. If these students  choose to speak their minds as Fang is doing back in China, it is very likely  that they will face the same threat of jeopardizing their career and even  personal freedom.  </P> <P> ZUOYUE WANG  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' share transactions BRITISH Bio-Technology came to the market in June last year as a highly-rated pharmaceutical research and development company. The company is making losses and those are forecast to rise during this year and next as research costs increase. Dr Keith McCullagh, chief executive, sold 100,000 at 435p leaving himself with 800,000 shares. At the same time Dr John Gordon exercised an option over 100,000 shares and sold 50,000 of them at 435p. That takes his holding to 51,000. Reports of strong trading in December boosted shares in the motor sectors and Pendragon, the up-market car dealer, is no exception - the shares have outperformed by over 30 per cent during the last month. The four key executives, including the chairman and chief executive, have sold a total of 370,000 shares at 242p. Nigel Rudd, the chairman, sold 25,000 shares at 222p towards the end of December. George Robb's purchases of shares at Aberdeen Petroleum are worthy of note. He purchased 500,000 shares at prices between 6p and 7p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                 Sector     Shares      Value        directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Albert Fisher            FdRe     125,000        71            1 BCE Holdings              H&amp;L   2,798,466       140            1 British Bio Techngy      Hlth     100,000       435            1 Courtaulds               Chem      30,000       181            1* Evans of Leeds           Prop      26,000        35            1 Henderson Admin          OthF       5,000        44            1 Laird Group              Motr     169,832       502            1* Pacific Assets           InTr      50,000        94            1 Pendragon                Motr     370,932       898            4 Radio Clyde               Med      22,500        62            1 Rathbone Brothers        OthF      53,700       137            3 Rolfe &amp; Nolan            BuSe       8,000        19            1 Sidlaw                    O&amp;G      78,000       253            2* Smith &amp; Nephew           Hlth      15,000        24            1 Sun Alliance             InsC       4,515        16            1 Whitbread                Brew      38,300       188            2*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aberdeen Petroleum        O&amp;G     500,000        34            1 Amersham Intl            Hlth       6,000        38            2 Grand Central            FdMa      25,000        11            1 Group Devlp Capital      InTr      80,000        23            2 Hall Engineering         EngG      10,000        12            1 Hewetson                 BdMa     250,000        64            1 Pacific Assets Tst       InTr      20,000        58            1 Shaw (Arthur)            BdMa     195,000        60            1 Tay Homes                 C&amp;C      40,000        64            1 Yule Catto               Chem      21,098        50            1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

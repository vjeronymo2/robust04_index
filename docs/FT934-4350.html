			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK boost for IMF loans to poor Britain said yesterday it would contribute Pounds 50m to the next phase of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) through which the International Monetary Fund provides concessionary lending to the poorest developing countries. The money, which will come from the Overseas Development Administration budget, will go towards a subsidy account which enables the countries that borrow from the facility to pay interest of only 0.5 per cent to the IMF. The British contribution is expected to give a boost to negotiations in Washington on a successor facility to replace the original ESAF. The Pounds 50m will provide an estimated 3 to 4 per cent of the cash needed for interest subsidies in the new account. Taking the old and the new facilities together, Britain will provide about one ninth of the funds to subsidise interest payments. In September, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, cast doubt on Britain's ability to provide funds for the new ESAF because of tight budget constraints. However, the ODA was able to provide the cash by using aid funds earmarked for spending through the EC in 1991-92 but unused.</p>

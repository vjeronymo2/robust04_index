Examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following examples apply the proposed rule.

On January 15, Institution B agrees to acquire a branch office of Institution A that held $5 million worth of deposits reported in Institution A's December 31 report of condition. Institution A continues to be an insured institution. Institution A's February 28 assessment invoice that will be collected on March 30 will be based on the reported $100 million worth of deposits, in accordance with normal processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institution A remains responsible for the assessment liability on January 1 based on the December 31 report of condition. The February invoice represents the second installment payment of the January through June semiannual assessment period. The FDIC expects that Institutions A and B may well have dealt with any question of allocating the cost of the assessment premium. But Institution A must still make the payment to the FDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2_Partial transfer of deposits; transferor remains in business.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Institution A reported $100 million worth of deposits in its report of condition as of September 30. On October 1, Institution B agrees to acquire a branch office of Institution A that held $10 million worth of deposits reported in Institution A's September 30 report of condition. Institution A continues to be an insured institution. Institution A's November 30 assessment invoice that will be collected on December 30 will be based on the $100 million worth of deposits, in accordance with normal processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institution A remains responsible for the assessment liability established on October 1 based on the September 30 report of condition. The November invoice represents the first installment payment for the next semiannual assessment period (January through June). The FDIC expects that Institutions A and B may well have dealt with any question of allocating the assessment premium. But Institution A must still make the assessment payment to the FDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3_Transfer of deposits; transferor ceases to exist.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Institution A reported $100 million worth of deposits in its report of condition as of September 30. Its assessment base (deposits less deductions) is $90 million. On October 15, Institution A transfers all its deposits to Institution B and goes out of business. Institution A has only $98 million in deposits at the time of the transfer. The FDIC will increase Institution B's September 30 assessment base to reflect its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  share of Institution A's assessment base. That is, Institution B's assessment base will be increased by $88 million, determined as follows: $98 million deposits acquired divided by $100 million deposits reported by Institution A on its September 30 report of condition multiplied by $90 million assessment base (98/100 &times; $90 million), or $88 million. Institution B would receive credit for any assessment payments attributable to the transferred deposits that have already been made by Institution A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institution B's payment represents the first installment for the January through June assessment period. The FDIC considers that the deposits transferred in bulk to Institution B continue to pose a risk to the insurance fund. Accordingly, it is appropriate to adjust Institution B's assessment base to reflect that risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4_Multiple transfers of deposits; transferor ceases to exist.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Institution A reported $100 million worth of deposits in its report of condition as of September 30; its assessment base is $90 million. On October 15 it transfers $33 million of its deposits in bulk to Institution B. Institution A then shrinks in size from $67 million to $50 million, and on November 30 transfers all its remaining deposits to Institution C. The FDIC will increase the September assessment bases of Institutions B and C by $30 million and $45 million, respectively. The supporting calculation shows: Institution B_$33 million in deposits acquired by Institution B divided by $100 million deposits reported by Institution A on the September report of condition multiplied by $90 million assessment base of Institution A determined from the report of condition based on September 30 report of condition; Institution C_$50 million in deposits acquired from Institution A divided by $100 million deposits reported by Institution A's September report of condition multiplied by the $90 million assessment base of Institution A determined from its report of condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC believes that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  methodology presented properly reflects the continued risk to the insurance fund presented by the deposits transferred in bulk from Institution A to Institutions B and C. The insurance fund will bear the cost of deposits that are not transferred in bulk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

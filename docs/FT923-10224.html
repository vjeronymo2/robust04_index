			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / President rebukes minister who quit PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy yesterday severely rebuked Mr Vincenzo Scotti, the Christian Democrat politician who resigned as foreign minister on Wednesday. He indicated that he viewed the widely criticised resignation as unjustified at a time of severe economic crisis and rising organised crime, which have severely damaged the country's image abroad. The prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, last night tried to calm fears that the resignation could trigger instability in his month-old government. He told parliament that he himself would temporarily act as foreign minister and would not be rushed into any decisions on a replacement for Mr Scotti, whose departure he presented as an internal party matter. The resignation was badly received on the financial markets, with both the lira and the Milan stock market under pressure. Dealers said the move implied further tensions in government and party. Shares on the Milan bourse fell to their lowest level this year, while the lira declined against the D-Mark after a period of relative calm earlier this week. The lira slipped to 756.25 against the D-Mark, after being fixed at 755.91 on Wednesday. Italian government bond futures prices in London dropped more than a full point from Wednesday's 92.71 closing. Mr Scotti resigned over a new Christian Democrat policy which says that members who are ministers should renounce their parliamentary seats. The doctrine has encountered some hostility in the party, and Mr Scotti evidently valued his Naples constituency more than his ministerial post. The resignation highlights the extent of internal differences among Christian Democrats, who have been without a leader since Mr Arnaldo Forlani stepped down soon after the April 5 general election. President Scalfaro, a Christian Democrat before becoming head of state, accused Mr Scotti of irresponsibility. 'If instead of serving the interests of the people, factional interests are allowed to take priority over the interests of the state, then this is a crime against the state.' France and Italy appealed yesterday for an urgent meeting of EC interior and justice ministers to stop the spread of organised crime, Reuter reports from Rome. It is feared the Mafia will try to exploit the ending of border controls inside the Community on January 1. Action to stop money laundering and a German proposal for a common EC police force are likely to be high on the agenda.</p>

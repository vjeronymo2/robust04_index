			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Centre of Bogota rocked by bombs TWO 50kg car bombs exploded in the centre of Bogota yesterday morning leaving at least four people dead and dozens injured. Both bombs went off in narrow, busy streets among shops and offices, causing panic in the Colombian capital. Police sources told Reuter they believed the bombing had been ordered by the fugitive Medelln cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar. The blasts damaged buildings and shattered glass for several blocks around, and the streets were strewn with the wreckage of some 20 cars. Windows were blown out of the Intercontinental-Tequendama, one of city's main hotels. A Reuter reporter at the scene of the hotel blast said: 'People were trying to leap from the upper floors of buildings after the blast to escape the fires. It was total chaos.' The government has accused Mr Escobar of leading a campaign of terror against the state. Over the past two and a half weeks car bombs have exploded in Medelln, Bogota and the oil city of Barrancabermeja, killing 37 people. However, the two Medelln bombs were aimed at Mr Escobar's relatives and properties, and were apparently detonated by a new anti-Escobar group called the 'Pepes' - people persecuted by Pablo Escobar. The authorities have increased the reward offered for information about Mr Escobar to Dollars 7m. At the same time, the Pepes have killed several of Mr Escobar's collaborators and employees in Medelln. After Mr Escobar's escape from jail last July, he was expected to re-surrender quickly, but this now seems unlikely. However, some interpret the new wave of bombs as a last-ditch attempt to force the government to bow to new conditions. The government has said any negotiations would be impossible and Mr Escobar's only option is unconditional surrender.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Diet Pepsi cleared by FDA ALLEGATIONS of nationwide tampering with Diet Pepsi cans are unfounded, the US Food and Drug Administration said yesterday following an investigation. 'We've been unable to confirm even one case of tampering among the dozens of reports we have received,' Dr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, said in Washington. His remarks followed days of confusion, during which dozens of people said they had found objects - mainly hypodermic needles and syringes - in cans of Diet Pepsi. The claims first surfaced in the Seattle-Tacoma area of Washington state, but quickly spread to New Orleans, and then to other regions. The FDA said its investigation into the numerous consumer complaints indicated that the suspect cans had come from disparate Diet Pepsi bottling plants, with production dates months apart. 'It is simply not logical to conclude that a nationwide tampering has occurred,' said Dr Kessler. He added that 'a number of people' who had made complaints were now withdrawing them. PepsiCo shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher, at Dollars 37 7/8 yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Kwang-chun] </F>   [Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, May 7 (CNA) -- President Li  Teng-hui of the Republic of China [ROC] said here over the  weekend that the ROC would actively participate in international  affairs as a sovereign nation.    Li, who is now on a official visit to Costa Rica where he  participated in the inauguration of President Jose Maria  Figueres Sunday [8 May], made the remarks during a news  conference held following a breakfast meeting with Figueres.    The ROC is a sovereign nation and the world should recognize  that China is divided and ruled by separate governments, Li said.    Under the existing situation, the ROC has two courses of  action, Li said, including the promotion of substantial  relations with other nations and improving cross-Taiwan Strait  relations.    "Developing mutual understanding between the two sides of  the  Taiwan Strait is important," he emphasized. But it is necessary  for the ROC to enter the international community as a sovereign  nation, he added.</p>

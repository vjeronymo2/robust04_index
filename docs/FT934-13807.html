			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / People: Hanson sends Cotton to chair Renison Hanson is taking a 'hands on' approach to Renison Goldfields Consolidated, the quoted Australian mining group in which the Anglo-American conglomerate has a 40 per cent stake and which has a far from sparkling recent financial record. Hanson has persuaded one of its senior directors, Anthony Cotton, to become deputy chairman at Renison for a year before taking over from chairman Max Roberts; he will stay to help with the changeover. Hanson acquired the Renison stake when it paid Pounds 3.9bn for Consolidated Gold Fields in 1989, a purchase that proved far from the bonanza Lord Hanson must have hoped for. Campbell Anderson, until recently Renison's chief executive, used to say that there were three types of company in Hanson's portfolio - the A companies were core businesses and not for sale; buyers were actively being sought for C companies; leaving the B companies which were for sale if someone should come along with the right offer. Poor old Renison, he suggested, was on the B list. Hanson was keen to give the impression yesterday that Renison had now moved to the A list and has 'persuaded one of our senior people to take this appointment'. According to an official, Hanson is anxious to increase its presence in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and Renison might provide some opportunities for that. Renison, analysts suggest, is an ideal candidate for 'Hansonisation'. It has been badly hit by the collapse in most commodity prices and recorded net losses for the past two financial years. But there have also been strategic mistakes which have added to the pain. Hanson's chance to move in emerged because Campbell Anderson, seen as the likely successor to the present chairman, decided instead to move to North Broker Hill Peko, another Australian resources group, as chief executive. Cotton has been Hanson's deputy chief operating officer UK, responsible for the group's main building products interests. He has been chairman of ARC, Beazer, London Brick, Butterley Brick and, until its recent sale, Ever Ready UK. He has been a director of Renison since 1991 and will continue as a Hanson director. His move to Sydney has led to two consequential appointments at Hanson. Ross Chiese becomes assistant chief operating officer UK. He has been an associate director of the group since 1990. Andrew Dougal becomes deputy finance director and an associate director.</p>

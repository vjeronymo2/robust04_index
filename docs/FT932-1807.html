			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: FGP to acquire commercial printer in Pounds 1.5m deal THE FINANCIAL &amp; General Print Group is to take over Brown Knight &amp; Truscott, one of the UK's oldest commercial printers, founded in 1825. Both companies specialise in corporate and financial publishing with clients ranging from ICI and Guinness to The Body Shop and the Milk Marketing Board. FGP, based in Edmonton, London, was founded only eight years ago. Mr Michael Brown, whose family has been involved with Brown Knight since 1855, will become chairman of the new company trading under the Brown Knight &amp; Truscott name. The combined turnover of group will be Pounds 10m. Brown Knight incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 914,000 on sales of Pounds 7.1m in the year to end-March 1992. The acquisition, believed to be worth about Pounds 1.5m, will create a company with an estimated 10 per cent share of its specialist market.</p>

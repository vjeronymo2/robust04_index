			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chrysler gives its image a new shine - Martin Dickson detects an upbeat mood at the No 3 US carmaker THE NEW car models bear the code-name LH, and cruel wits have been calling them Chrysler's Last Hope. But when the mid-sized sedans are formally launched this week they will mark a big improvement in the fortunes of America's third-biggest automobile group and an upbeat finale for Mr Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's retiring chairman. For the LH range, which will be sold under the names Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision, has won rave reviews from the US motoring press for its sleek, original design and extremely roomy interiors. 'The Second Coming of Chrysler,' trumpeted Automobile Magazine. It is not yet certain that motorists will be equally enthusiastic, but the early signs are promising - as well they need to be. The LH is financially-stretched Chrysler's most important launch in years and will give a much-needed lift to its tired car line-up. It will be 1993 before the range has an appreciable impact on the profit and loss account, but the positive psychological effect has been much more immediate - both within the company and on Wall Street, where Chrysler's shares have doubled in value over the past year. And the LH models form only one plank in a multi-year roll out of new Chrysler vehicles. This started last spring with a top-of-the range Jeep, which is selling well, and will end in 1995 with a revamped mini-van. Chrysler pioneered mini-vans in the 1980s and still holds almost 50 per cent cent of the US market, despite formidable competition. The upbeat mood is a sharp contrast to two years ago, when Mr Iacocca, the man who masterminded the company's escape from near bankruptcy at the start of the 1980s, was under fire for diversifying into non-automotive businesses (since sold off) and failing to develop quickly a new model range to replace Chrysler's aged K car series. The result was that Chrysler entered the recession with a geriatric range of cars, losing market share, and without the big, profitable European operations which bolstered larger rivals Ford and General Motors. Jeremiahs said it might have to merge with a larger rival, though year-long talks with Fiat of Italy came to nothing. However, adversity bred ingenuity. Chrysler saw the recession coming before its rivals, built up a Dollars 4bn reserve of cash through asset disposals, cut Dollars 3bn off running costs and spent heavily on the development of vital new models like the LH. Its assembly plant productivity is much improved: it now takes Chrysler 3.76 workers to assemble a vehicle, much better than GM's 4.55 but still behind Ford, with 3.01, according to a report from consultancy Harbour &amp; Associates It has also radically changed the way it develops cars, adopting a much more Japanese approach: It has forged much closer links with parts suppliers and has set up in-house teams which bring together people from different disciplines, such as design and engineering, to cut costs and quicken lead times. Some analysts argue the result is a model for the US industry. However, development spending and recession have severely strained Chrysler's balance sheet and it remains in delicate financial health, though here, too, the recent signs have all been positive. Last month, Moody's, the credit information agency, raised the company's debt rating for the first time in six years (though the borrowings still have 'junk' status), after Chrysler completed a vital but tricky Dollars 6.8bn loan roll-over for its vehicle financing arm. The company is also expected to report solid third-quarter profits today, in contrast to losses at GM and Ford. Mr Robert Eaton, who will take over as chairman in January from Mr Iacocca, recently told the Financial Times that Chrysler's recently-completed business plan foresees capital spending of Dollars 17.3bn over the next five years 'and we are in a very good position to carry that out, even if the (US economic) recovery is far more anaemic than any we have ever had'. He says that over the next few years the company should be able to boost its share of the US car and light truck market from 13 per cent to 15 per cent. He rejects the suggestion that Chrysler may eventually need to merge with another auto manufacturer: 'I believe a company of around 2m units (roughly Chrysler's vehicle output) can be a viable stand-alone company.' Mr Eaton, 52, was named last spring to succeed Mr Iacocca. The choice was a surprise since Chrysler, after an intense internal power struggle, went outside the group to pluck him from the European presidency of General Motors, a company he had been with since 1963. A down-to-earth engineer, he has a reputation as a manufacturing and quality expert, with an eye for detail and an ability to foster team-building. Mr Iacocca, arguably the best-known industrialist in America, will be a hard act to follow - though he will stay on part-time for at least a year as head of the board's important executive committee. The delicacy of the transition was underlined in August when Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the Californian who is Chrysler's largest single investor, demanded a meeting with company executives to express concern about the reduced role of Mr Iacocca, with whom he is friendly. Mr Kerkorian seemed to be mollified after meeting Mr Eaton for the first time. 'In hindsight, I probably should have met him earlier,' says the new chairman. However, the incident has prompted speculation that Mr Iacocca might try to continue exerting authority, though both he and a relaxed Mr Eaton dismiss the idea. For years Mr Iacocca has been Chrysler's most effective salesman, appearing in countless television advertisements to plug his company's products. His final campaign has just got under way, and has him lavishing praise on the LH range, with claims its design will transform the way Americans look at cars. The market place will ultimately decide that, but at least Mr Iacocca is going out with a bang, and not the whimper which once seemed possible.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Two Swedish banks made steady headway The pattern of lower loan losses and weaker underlying results which has characterised the Swedish banking sector this year was highlighted yesterday when Nordbanken and Swedbank unveiled their nine-month figures. Nordbanken, the biggest casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis, disclosed a SKr3.54bn (Dollars 481.6m) operating profit for the period, after being lifted by last December's acquisition of Gota Bank. Pro-forma figures, excluding Gota, show profits rising to SKr2.77bn from SKr2.48bn. Swedbank achieved a SKr2.61bn profit, following an unexpectedly strong third quarter which prompted it to raise its full-year forecast and promise a dividend. Its result at the nine-month stage in 1993 was a SKr2.65bn deficit. Both banks saw a sharp reduction in loan losses due to the recovery in the Swedish economy and lower interest rates. Excluding Gota, Nordbanken's loan losses fell to SKr1.35bn from SKr3.41bn. Swedbank's loan losses tumbled 62 per cent to SKr3.35bn from SKr8.86bn. It also benefited from a SKr1.58bn capital gain on the sale of shares in Robur, a fund management unit. Before loan losses, pro-forma figures from Nordbanken showed a SKr4.12bn profit, down from SKr5.89bn, while Swedbank's result, including the capital gain, was SKr5.96bn, against SKr6.21bn. Weaker loan demand and tighter margins lowered both banks' net interest income. They also had lower capital gains on bond sales than in 1993. Nordbanken, bailed out by the state in 1992 and due to be privatised next year, forecast full-year profits of SKr4.6bn, saying final-quarter operating profits should be at least as much as the SKr1.09bn achieved in the third quarter.</p>

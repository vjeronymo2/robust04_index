			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. V. Litinetskiy, V. V. Volkov, Yu. A Seregin, </F> Central Aerological Observatory; UDC 551.509.617:551.507.35]    [Abstract] This article describes the capabilities of the  Tsiklon-1 and Tsiklon-2-S measurement and computing complexes  for aircraft used for meteorological research and cloud seeding.  The equipment is installed on An-26 and YaK-40 aircraft. The  types of equipment included in both systems are described and  specifications are listed. In general, the equipment may be  divided into navigation instruments, measurement devices, and  recording and imaging devices. The AgI dispensers used for cloud  seeding are described. The Tsiklon-1 system features a Doppler  velocity measurement device, an inertial navigation system, and  Orbita-20 and Orbita-701 on-board computers. The Tsiklon-2-S  system features a gyrocompass system. The systems take  meterological readings to determine the feasibility of cloud  seeding. Results of seeding may also be tracked. The systems  include an aircraft position monitoring device. This makes it  possible to coordinate actions in multi-aircraft cloud seeding  operations. The Tsiklon-2-S system is more sophisticated in that  it uses an IBM AT PC and a satellite navigational system  (TRANSPAK). Information is stored on diskette. Schematics of  both systems are provided. Figures 2; tables 3; references 12:  11 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

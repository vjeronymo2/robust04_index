			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> '89 ENCORES;  </P> <P> ON THIS LAST DAY OF THE YEAR, AND OF THE 1980S, THE VIEW STAFF PAYS A RETURN  VISIT TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE NEWS IN 1989.;  </P> <P> A SPIRITUAL CAUSE  </P> <P> Last July, Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet, spent three  weeks in Los Angeles, conducting an initiation ritual to advanced Buddhist  meditation, generally delighting audiences with his warmth and humor, and  speaking about the cause of his people.  </P> <P> (Tibet was invaded and occupied by China in 1950 and since has been partially  absorbed by that country, with another part occupied and declared an autonomous  region by China. As the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama  has been living in exile in India since 1959.)  </P> <P> In December, despite the strong protests of the Chinese government, the Dalai  Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. He traveled with a small  entourage of his supporters and staff to Norway, where he was honored for his  nonviolent crusade for human rights, freedom and peace -- for Tibet and for the  planet.  </P> <P> Michelle Bohana, human rights director for the International Campaign for  Tibet, was here with the Dalai Lama's delegation last July -- the subject of a  July 20 story in View -- and was one of the few who attended the ceremonies in  Oslo.  </P> <P> It is too early to judge the effects of his receiving the prize, Bohana said  from her office in Washington.  </P> <P> "It elevates His Holiness, quite rightfully, to the status of a world  statesperson, and that has to have an effect on Beijing or they wouldn't have  responded with so much vehemence. The immediate effect in Lhasa (capital of  Tibet) is an increase in repressive tactics. There have been more arrests. But  in the long term, it's going to be positive. I personally think it's the best  thing to have happened to Tibet in 40 years."  </P> <P> Just as the Dalai Lama visibly charmed and moved so many people in Los Angeles,  so did he affect the Norwegians and the gathering assembled there for the award  ceremonies, she said:  </P> <P> "The Norwegians treated His Holiness with a respect that bordered on  reverence."  </P> <P> It was, in short, a great celebration.  </P> <P> "You know, in Buddhism there is a teaching about rejoicing," Bohana said. "When  something wonderful happens, you're allowed the opportunity to rejoice. We  don't have cause to celebrate very often," she said of people who have been  involved in the Tibetan cause. "After 40 years we were able to rejoice, and we  came away inspired and renewed." KATHLEEN HENDRIX  </P></p>

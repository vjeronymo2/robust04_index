			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Troops quit earthquake site Soldiers left the earthquake-devastated villages of India yesterday after spending 12 days digging up bodies, building shelters and running community kitchens, AP reports from New Delhi. More than 10,000 troops from southern and western India went to the districts of Osmanabad and Latur in Maharashtra on October 1, the day after the earthquake flattened 83 villages. Mr Sharad Pawar, the state's chief minister, said 9,748 people had died in the earthquake. Estimates of up to 30,000 casualties had been 'highly exaggerated,' he said. The troops fought off looters, prevented epidemics in the relief camps and erected corrugated tin sheet shelters for the thousands of homeless people. The state government, meanwhile, has begun levelling 28 sites chosen to relocate the devastated villages, and begun operating relief centres, kitchens and clinics.</p>

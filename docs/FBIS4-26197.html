			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli by Xie Geng </F> (6200 1649), Li Zhengping (2621 3630 1627), and Qian Fengyuan  (6929 7364 0337); place and date not given: "Financial and  Taxation Reform Is Progressing Smoothly, Implementation of the  Budget Is Basically Normal--Interview With Minister of Finance  Liu Zhongli"]    [Text] The financial and taxation system reforms, which  were implemented this year, are now having a major and  deep-going effect on our country's economic life. The operation  of the new systems has, over nearly five months, produced new  situations and new problems in economic life and has attracted  the wide attention of people in all spheres of society,  especially those in economic circles and enterprise circles.  Thus, our reporters visited Liu Zhongli, minister of finance  and concurrently head of the State Administration of Taxation,  and asked him to give his views on several questions which are  of great concern to people.    [JINGJI RIBAO] Financial and taxation reform and financial  and taxation work are the most important aspects of economic  life this year. All sides have shown great concern about the  operation of the new financial and tax systems and the current  financial situation. Could you please give us some idea of the  situation in these areas?    [Liu] The current financial situation is, speaking overall,  quite good. First, the implementation of the financial system  and tax system reforms is going quite smoothly, and there are no  major problems. This year, reforms of all major aspects of the  financial and tax systems are being carried out concurrently.  This provides the advantage of coordination, but certainly also  exacerbates the risks of reform. In order to guarantee the  normal operation of the new financial and tax systems and  realize our anticipated goals, from the beginning of the year,  we have greatly concerned ourselves with the implementation and  operation of reform. Seen from the current situation, the  levying of all taxes is now handled completely in accordance  with the new tax system, and there has been a marked decrease in  losses through tax leakage. The reaction of foreign businesses  and the majority of domestically funded enterprises to changes  in tax burdens have been stable, and no instances have occurred  of wild price rises resulting from the tax system reforms  affecting financial income. The revenue-sharing financial  situation is now being implemented level by level in accordance  with the requirements of the central authorities and no major  distortions have occurred. The fiscal revenue situation is  basically normal in central and local financial administrations.  The work of setting up branch taxation organs is now being  firmly grasped and carried out. As to the new situations and  new problems which have appeared in the implementation of the  new systems, on the basis of much investigative research, we  have carried out overall analysis and, in a timely way,  formulated appropriate response measures for dealing with these  situations and problems. From the beginning of the year until  now, we have sent out over 100 documents and telegrams resolving  problems which have appeared in the operation of the new  systems. Second, in a situation where quite a number of reform  measures have been implemented, the budget implementation  situation is basically normal. From January to April, national  fiscal revenue totaled 125.246 billion yuan, an increase of  22.607 billion yuan or 22 percent compared with the same period  last year. Of this, growth in added-value tax, operational tax,  and other major tax types was over 30 percent. National fiscal  expenditure over the same period was 116.751 billion yuan, an  increase of 22.357 billion yuan, or 23.7 percent over the same  period last year. Expenditure in major areas such as  transformation and tapping potential, education, science and  technology, health, public security, and procuratorial and law  work increased by over 30 percent. Comparing revenue and  expenditure over the January to April period, we see that  revenue exceeded expenditure by 8.495 billion yuan, a higher  figure than in the same period last year. Of course, in budget  implementation, there have existed and will continue to appear  factors which reduce revenue and increase expenditure. These  have already received a high degree of our attention. At the  same time, there has been steady growth in the national economy,  and from January to April, the industrial output value of  enterprises at or above township level grew by 18.4 percent.  Also, in April, industrial output value and realized profits of  state-owned enterprises saw a turn for the better compared with  the first quarter.    [JINGJI RIBAO] Some people believe that since the beginning  of this year, the price increase index has been quite high and  that this is closely linked with the reform of the taxation  system. What are your views on this?    [Liu] In accordance with the taxation reform plans, this  year, the reforms will not increase the overall tax burden on  enterprises. Thus, in theory, there should not be a direct  effect on the overall level of prices. However, seen from the  actual situation, the structural readjustment of the tax system  will result in the level of tax burden of some enterprises  increasing, while for some others it will fall. Enterprises for  whom the tax burden has been reduced will not necessarily reduce  their prices, while it is very likely that some of the  enterprises which will see an increased tax burden will, as a  result of cost pushes, raise their prices. However, speaking  overall, the influence of the tax system reforms on price  indexes will be limited. Seen from the situation this year, the  main factors leading to price rises will remain the excessive  scale of capital construction, inflation in consumption funds,  and enterprise cost-push factors. In resolving the inflation  problem, we must make efforts into several areas.    [JINGJI RIBAO] It is claimed that since the beginning of  this year, many state-owned enterprises have experienced  operational difficulties. Do you think this is linked with the  tax system reforms?    [Liu] Seen overall, the operational situation of  state-owned enterprises is normal, and their development trend  is good. As for the problems which exist in some enterprises,  some of the problems are quite complex and require specific  analysis. Seen from the fiscal angle, after a large number of  enterprises implemented the "General Rules Governing Enterprise  Finances" and the "Enterprise Accounting Standards," interest  and repayment of long-term loans which had originally been  expended from profits, were entered as costs, and there were  also increases in depreciation rates. This reduced their book  profits or potential losses were converted into explicit losses.  However, funds which the enterprises were able to expend not  only were not reduced, but actually increased. Thus, in the  light of the implementation of the "Rules" and "Standards" noted  above, this situation is normal and falls within our  expectations. Of course, the tax system reforms are having some  effect on the burdens of enterprises. This influence is mainly  of three types: 1) Tax burdens in a small number of industries  have increased. In this respect, we have already adopted  appropriate measures to deal with the effects. 2) In accordance  with the requirements of industrial policy, when planning our  programs we have appropriately raised the tax burden levels of a  small number of industries and products and abolished some  inappropriate tax exemption policies for some enterprises. This  should be noted as being correct and the changes in the economic  situation resultant from this are normal. 3) Where, over an  entire industry, the general tax burden is not high but some  individual enterprises complain about the raising of the tax  burden; this suggests a problem of enterprise operations. Such  problems can only be resolved by enterprises improving  management themselves. We cannot carry out, on the policy  level, any individual readjustment of such enterprises.  Otherwise, the tax system reforms will be entirely distorted  and will be unable to achieve the anticipated goals. It also  needs to be explained that the majority of problems which  various sides have reflected to us about the tax system reforms  and enterprise burdens have been rational and have already been  basically resolved.    [JINGJI RIBAO] According to my understanding, at present,  some local financial administrations and especially county-level  financial administrations are suffering a tightness of funds and  some are even in a situation where they cannot issue wages.  What is your assessment of this?    [Liu] The implementation of the revenue-sharing system this  year is being carried out gradually and, as of yet, this has not  affected the immediate financial strength of localities. Thus,  the reforms should not have affected the financial resources and  payment capability of the localities. In particular, the  central financial administration's timely readjustment of the  funds transfer ratio played an important role in improving the  financial expenditure situations of the localities. As for some  localities which are experiencing tightness in their finances  and are even unable to issue wages, the reasons differ with each  locality. Each region has its own situation. However, as far  as the whole country is concerned, a common problem is that the  degree of wage readjustment for staff and workers in  administrative and institutional units exceeded the standards  set down by the state. This is a problem worthy of attention.  In order to safeguard stability, it is hoped that financial  administrations at all levels will seriously organize well their  various revenue channels and, in making expenditure  arrangements, will give precedence to guaranteeing the issue of  wages.    [JINGJI RIBAO] According to the budget approved by the  National People's Congress at the beginning of the year, this  year, the Ministry of Finance is going to issue over 100 billion  yuan of treasury bonds. This is a major element in our  country's economic life this year. At the same time, it has  also attracted wide attention from circles in society. Please  advise us of the most recent situation in the issue of state  bonds.    [Liu] This year, because of the attention given by leaders  at all levels, the adoption of appropriate measures, and the  cooperation from banks and other relevant bodies, the issue of  state treasury bonds has gone very well. Up to 21 May, 60.295  billion yuan of state treasury bonds had been issued. Of these,  the sale of two-year maturity state treasury bonds has already  reached 82.7 percent of the figure set as the target for the  year, while the sale of three-year maturity treasury bonds has  completed 63.28 percent of the planned annual figure.  Throughout the country, half of provinces and cities have  completed or exceeded their tasks in terms of selling two-year  maturity state treasury bonds. At present, the situation in  terms of the issuance of state treasury bonds is still looking  good. We are still putting efforts into the work and are  striving to complete the issue tasks within the specified issue  period.    [JINGJI RIBAO] Seen from the present situation, what is your  appraisal of the prospects for this year's financial and tax  reforms and budget implementation?    [Liu] Perfecting the reform measures will still require a  lot of work. In the following several months, there will also  appear many factors which will reduce revenue and increase  expenditure. Thus, in respect of the overall annual situation,  we must not be blindly optimistic and relax our efforts.  However, if we put all our efforts into it and do good work, we  will be able to absorb the effects of the disadvantageous  factors. I believe that if we are able to firmly uphold the  macroeconomic regulatory and control targets; maintain a  rational scale of investment, scale of credit and price levels;  and continue to put efforts into organizing revenue, controlling  expenditure and seriously handling the problems which appear in  reform, it will be fully possible to guarantee the normal  implementation of the reforms and to complete the annual  budgetary tasks.</p>

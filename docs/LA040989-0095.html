			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COPING WITH TRAGEDY AT ORANGE GLEN HIGH  </P> <P> Orange Glen High School has had more than its share of tragedy this year.  </P> <P> A teacher's aide and two former students were charged with murder, two students  committed suicide and then an arson fire severely damaged the Escondido school.  </P> <P> That's been hard on many of the school's nearly 2,000 students and has put an  extra demand on the counselors.  </P> <P> But perhaps the counselor most affected was Darwin Bree, a history and  psychology teacher who also runs the school's peer counseling program.  </P> <P> The popular teacher has been a focal point for students trying to cope with the  tragedies because he teaches the students who serve as peer counselors.  Further, his classroom was destroyed in the fire, and he lost 22 years of books  and notes he used for classes.  </P> <P> But he remained upbeat in the aftermath of the March 18 fire. Despite his  personal loss, he continued to give solace to those in need.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, however, Bree realized he needed to get away, and he asked for  a few days off to deal with his own loss.  </P> <P> That may not be noteworthy in and of itself, but what is noteworthy is that  Bree was willing to share those feelings with Times reporter David Smollar, who  happened to be at the school.  </P> <P> By sharing a little of how the losses had affected him and what he was doing to  cope with the stresses, he may have helped others in the community. People he  will never meet. People who may think that seeking help is a sign of weakness.  </P> <P> Through that moment of openness, Bree reached beyond the young people he helps  every day, giving us a glimpse of someone practicing what he preaches. It's  easy to see why he is so well respected at Orange Glen High School.  </P></p>

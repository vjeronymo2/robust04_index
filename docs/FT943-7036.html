			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Medway behind 78% leap at Mersey Docks Mersey Docks and Harbour, the UK's second-largest port group, yesterday announced a 79 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.86m to Pounds 15.9m, reflecting the impact of the recently-acquired Medway Ports. Profits from the Port of Liverpool continued to surge in the six months to June 30, recording a 17 per cent advance, while Medway contributed close to Pounds 6m. Medway, acquired for Pounds 103.7m last September, has been beset by difficulties. Three of Medway's directors resigned, and it has lost both the Olau Line's ferry service and the import/export contract for Toyota cars. However, Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director, said the management vacuum had been satisfactorily filled and Medway's profits were in line with forecasts at the time of its acquisition. Overall, Mersey achieved a 37 per cent increase in turnover, from Pounds 44.8m to Pounds 61.5m. The Port of Liverpool suffered from a decline in throughput in coal and scrap steel, but achieved total throughput of 13.6m tonnes, marginally higher than in 1993. The company won new business from ABC Container lines and Canada Maritime/OOCL, which it said would more than offset losses from two other customers. In the Medway, car throughput at Sheerness remained high, with 177,000 units handled in the first half of the year. Toyota is estimated to account for about 40,000 units a year, and Mr Furlong was confident that a replacement contract could be won. The loss of Olau has been partly replaced by Mersey itself, which is chartering two ships to provide its own service to the Netherlands. This service is currently being expanded. The company invested Pounds 9.3m in the first half in new cranes and warehousing, and will spend about Pounds 20m for the full year, including substantial new storage space in Birkenhead. Net borrowings totalled Pounds 24.5m, amounting to gearing of 15.5 per cent. The interim dividend is lifted from 2.85p to 3.3p, a rise of 16 per cent. Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent from 8.98p to 11.72p. COMMENT Mersey Docks is into its fifth year of double digit profits, and has demonstrated that teething problems at Medway have not hurt its growth trend  -operating profit margins from its port business were 31 per cent. With a high proportion of fixed costs, any new business will feed through rapidly into profits, and although competition among the ports remains intense, Mersey has demonstrated its ability to win new custom. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 24m for the year, putting the shares on a p/e of 18. Current growth trends and the management track record fully justify this premium.</p>

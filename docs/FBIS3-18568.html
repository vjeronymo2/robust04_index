The university and high school students blocked the  capital's  Latin Quarter as police sealed off the nearby residence of the  prime minister, where he was holding a roundtable meeting on  employment with trade union leaders and employers'  representatives.    The students shouted "Balladur, you've had it. The kids have  taken to the streets."    Among them was the secretary general of the powerful  communist-led CGT [General Labor Confederation] union, Louis  Viannet, who walked out of the meeting with the prime minister  after he had refused to withdraw his plan.    Also among the demonstrators were Communist Party leader  Robert Hue and Socialist Party official Jean-Christophe  Cambadelis. [passage omitted]</p>

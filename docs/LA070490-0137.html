			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> PRESERVATIONIST HAILE PLANNING RHAPSODY IN RED, WHITE &amp; BLUE;  </P> <P> THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY WILL PLAY SELECTIONS BY SOUSA, GERSHWIN, VICTOR HERBERT  AND OTHERS AT IRVINE MEADOWS AMPHITHEATRE. IT WILL END WITH A FIREWORKS  DISPLAY.  </P> <P> Many conductors are worried that the niceties of playing Baroque music are  properly vanishing into the mists of time. Evans Haile has similar fears about  the American musical.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of wonderful material -- shows by Gershwin, Victor Herbert and  others -- that is not being done," Haile said from his home in New York. "I do  not think these are museum pieces or can only be done one way. But I believe  very strongly there are valid reasons for hearing them."  </P> <P> An example is Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's 1937 musical, "Babes in Arms,"  which Haile resurrected in its original form last year in New York and has  recently recorded. Haile will conduct selections from the show on a program of  American music played by the Pacific Symphony today at 8 p.m. at Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre. The program will also include music by Sousa, Gershwin, Victor  Herbert and others, and will end with a fireworks display.  </P> <P> A graduate of the Juilliard School of Music in New York, Haile said that, in  his case, "necessity was the mother of invention."  </P> <P> Haile and a friend formed a company to produce a series of concerts at Town  Hall in New York in 1981-86.  </P> <P> "When you first get out of school, you want to work," he said. "It was a  practical decision from that end. Our idea was to re-create these shows the way  the creators had envisioned them.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of shows where the original orchestrations and original  material had been lost and had to be reconstructed. It's not an unwise thing to  take a look at these. The orchestrations give evidence of the period. They were  so clearly done and so wittily done. They can clue you into why a lot of these  shows did work."  </P> <P> Other discoveries included changes in the "original routing of the numbers, or  what key someone is singing in, or even what characters do the numbers."  </P> <P> "Don't forget that a lot of these shows in (later) productions, after the  composers died, were given in cut-down productions," Haile said. "The point of  our series in Town Hall was to do them with the full resources as they  originally had thought them out. If the chorus was 45, we had them."  </P> <P> Of course, shows changed in the tryouts given in other cities before moving on  to the Big Apple and Broadway.  </P> <P> "If a song was cut from a show, that doesn't mean you should put it back in,"  Haile said. "Theater pieces are living, breathing animals that you mold and you  shape. But I think opera is the same way. Like Verdi's 'Masked Ball' or  Wagner's 'Tannhauser,' there are different editions. You have to make decisions  (which to use). It's the same with these pieces. I do think there is a validity  to see what's going on."  </P> <P> At the Pacific concert, Haile will be both the conductor and the piano soloist  for Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." In keeping with the patriotic theme -- and  also as a touring artist for Baldwin pianos -- Haile will be playing on a red,  white and blue piano.  </P> <P> "It's more tasteful than it sounds," he said. "The piano is red-and-white  striped, with a blue interior. . . . Actually it is quite handsome, for a red,  white and blue piano. It's very befitting for an outdoor concert."  </P> <P> Still, despite his fame in American musicals, Haile also has a "serious music"  side to his career. He, for instance, conducted a Wagner "Ring" cycle for the  Seattle Opera in 1984, 1986 and 1987.  </P> <P> "I hate (being called) a 'specialist in music of the American musical,' " Haile  said. "I don't read just one author's books or eat one type of food. Nor do  most people. And I think that anyone who is aware of the world is going to be  open to the world and aware of the whole variety, open to what's going on in  the world.  </P> <P> "Good music is good music, whether it's by Rodgers and Hart or Wagner. It's  music that has withstood the test of time."  </P> <P>  Evans Haile will conduct the Pacific Symphony in a program of music by  American composers today at 8 p.m. at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine  Center Drive, Irvine. Judy Balzer will be soprano soloist. The concert will end  with fireworks. Tickets: $10.50 to $37.50. Lawn seating: $8.50. Information:  (714) 474-4233.  </P></p>

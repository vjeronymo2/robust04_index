			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day appointment this week AMBER DAY, the retailer that has suffered a collapse of its share price from 126p to 38p in six months, is expected to announce the appointment of a new finance director this week. The move is seen by the company's advisers as a first step towards regaining the support of investors who have lost confidence in Mr Philip Green, the chairman and chief executive. Mr Green's success in developing the 'pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap' formula through the What Everyone Wants retail chain has been in marked contrast with his inability to build a sound bridge to his institutional investors. A flurry of stories about Mr Green's personal affairs and business relations with a key shareholder - all of which he and his advisers, Samuel Montagu, say carry no water - has undermined support for Mr Green and the stock. Two weeks ago, Mr Green also had to announce that the company would not meet analysts' pre-tax profits forecasts of about Pounds 14m-15m and that the finance director, Mr Graham Coles, and the company's only non-executive director, Mr Leslie Warman, were to resign. The appointment of a new finance director is unlikely, on its own, to staunch the growing tide of institutional disenchantment until Mr Green's role is split and a new and forceful executive chairman is appointed. Last week, as the share price continued to tumble, one analyst described Amber Day as a 'friendless stock'. 'All those who believe in Mr Green already hold the stock and those who don't won't touch it even at this price.' The persistent lack of support has also generated bid rumours, with In-Shops, the Birmingham retailer, the latest candidate. In-Shops, which reports its preliminary results today, has a market capitalisation of about Pounds 31m - a fifth of Amber Day's value at its peak last year. It made a pre-tax profit in the six months to September 1991 of Pounds 1.05m, down from Pounds 1.91m. When Amber Day bought the What Everyone Wants retail chain in 1990, In-Shops was also a potential purchaser. Amber Day's new finance director, currently a senior finance man at a well-known retailer, will replace Mr Coles who is moving to First Leisure.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 14/6/1994 -- The leadership of  the opposition National Peasant Christian Democratic [PNTCD]  triggered at the end of last week the procedure of suspending  Romanian President Ion Iliescu from office, its demarche resting  on a statement made by the Romanian number one three weeks ago  and termed as anti-constitutional. The PNTCD claims that Ion  Iliescu sustained that the court decisions on the retrocession  of houses nationalized 50 years ago should not be enforced,  since the Parliament was debating a bill that would give legal  solution to the situation of such houses. His statement was  branded by the PNTCD as not being consistent with the principle  of separation of powers.    Why did the PNTCD keep silent for two weeks and then come up  with "an abrupt initiative"? as daily CRONICA ROMANA puts it.  PNTCD leader Corneliu Coposu explained the delay was meant to  allow the presidency to deny the allegation, but political  commentators say that the PNTCD leaders "are too experienced not  to know they don't stand a chance of success" and consider that  the real explanation of the initiative ought to be looked for  elsewhere. The daily VOCEA ROMANIEI attributes to the PNTCD  gesture what it calls "the anti- presidential syndrome of the  right".    From the PNTCD allies' first reactions, termed by the press  as "confused" and "puzzled", the political columnists conclude  that they were not consulted. The constitutional procedure of  suspending the country's president from office stipulates at  least two stages to be covered, i.e. the initiative shall be  sustained by at least one third of the parliamentarians, and  then, there shall be a majority of votes.    Daily ADEVARUL notes that the PNTCD initiative is only meant  to increase the tension generated by the union actions announced  for these days, by the parliamentary disputes and by the  arguments among politicians. The daily opines that the PNTCD  runs the risk of a "sacrifice of political credit" that can have  an impact on the opposition as a whole but it mentions that "the  risk has been assumed".    The daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI assessed in its yesterday's  editorial that the gesture "has no value" in point of practical  efficiency, but it can force some clarifications in the current  political climate, which is consistent with the rules of the  democratic game.</p>

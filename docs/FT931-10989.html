			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Exporters angry at cost of cover THOUSANDS of British jobs are at risk, and hundreds of millions of pounds in exports is being lost, because of the high cost and limited availability of export credit cover, says a group of leading British exporters. Recent examples include a Pounds 40m contract to build a urea complex in China that will now be bid for by Snamprogetti in Italy instead of the company's Basingstoke subsidiary because an export credit insurance premium of 2.1 per cent was offered by Italy's state insurer, compared with the 5.6 per cent premium required by Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Exporters are inflamed by a letter from the ECGD this week telling them that 'as a result of recent business success in the (Indonesian) market, ECGD cover is now fully committed and therefore we cannot currently accommodate' cover for more business. The letter arrived days after an intensive and strongly supported export-promotion seminar on Indonesia in London by the Department of Trade and Industry. Evidence was presented this week to the Commons trade and industry select committee by major British Exporters, 10 leading UK companies active in construction, power plant and engineering, that the high cost of UK export finance presented exporters with 'one of two unpalatable alternatives: to abandon the business altogether, or to try to move as much work as possible offshore to countries whose export credit authorities are more accommodating'. Mr John Fletcher, Trafalgar House's marketing and business development director, said ECGD refusal to provide cover for a Pounds 200m contract to build a synthetic medicine plant in Russia forced his company to give the work to its US subsidiary, where the US Eximbank was willing to offer cover. The exporters' group called for ECGD country coverage comparable with that of competitors; for premium rates to be harmonised with those of competitor countries; and for the government to provide aid-supported finance where competitors provided it.</p>

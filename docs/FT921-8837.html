			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Libya to put bomb suspects before judge THE two Libyans accused of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing will appear at a public hearing before the Libyan judge investigating the case, the official Libyan news agency JANA said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tunis. The Libyan announcement follows moves by Britain, France and the US to prepare a UN Security Council resolution imposing an air and arms embargo on Libya until it hands over the suspects. A British lawyer who interviewed the suspects says they are eager to go on trial to prove their innocence. The US and Britain allege the two men were Libyan intelligence agents and were involved in bombing the Pan Am airliner over Scotland which killed 270 people. Four other Libyans are suspected of blowing up a French UTA airliner over Niger in 1989 in which 271 died.</p>

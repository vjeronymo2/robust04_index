			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVANTAGES AND PITFALLS OF 'WRAPAROUND' LOAN  </P> <P> QUESTION: My wife and I have been trying to sell our house for some time. We  purchased the house about 15 years ago, and we have an existing assumable  mortgage that carries a very low interest rate. Recently, a friend told us  about a "wraparound" mortgage. Can you tell us how this works, and whether it  would have any advantages or disadvantages for us?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Wraparound mortgages gained popularity during the period of high  interest rates in the mid-1970s and again in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> A wraparound mortgage works like this: You have an existing mortgage with a  present balance of $80,000 at 8% interest, and you would like to sell your  house for $150,000. Your purchaser is able to come up with 20% of the purchase  price, or $30,000, and would have to obtain a loan for $120,000 to buy your  house.  </P> <P> One way to achieve this financing is for the purchaser to apply for a  conventional 80% loan. Under this arrangement, the purchaser would have to pay  appraisal and credit report charges, as well as points, which could be as high  as $3,000 (three points).  </P> <P> Alternatively, the purchaser could assume your existing first trust (mortgage)  and seek second trust financing for all or a portion of the remaining money  above the first, which in this case would be $70,000.  </P> <P> Of course, the interest rate on the second trust will be higher than the  interest rate on a new first trust. However, the combined effective interest  rate (and the combined monthly payment) may not be greater than a single first  trust in the higher amount.  </P> <P> A third way of working with this situation would be a wraparound mortgage.  Under such an arrangement, the purchaser would first assume your existing  mortgage.  </P> <P> You would then give to the purchaser what amounts to a second trust on the  property for the full amount of the financing ($120,000), although at the  beginning of the loan, you are really only lending $40,000.  </P> <P> Keep in mind, because you have not advanced all of the $120,000 at the  inception of the loan, you may make a "profit" on the difference between the  interest rate of the first trust and the interest rate on the second trust. The  result to you is a yield (profit) in excess of the amount of interest stated in  the second trust.  </P> <P> To be more specific. If you take back a second trust in the amount of $120,000  at, for example, 10%, and you continue to make the interest payments at 8% on  the existing $80,000 first, you will be making 2% on the existing $80,000, and  a full 10% on the $40,000 difference that you are in fact lending to your  borrower.  </P> <P> This situation may seem too good to be true, but there are problems also.  </P> <P> Although usury laws have been relaxed in recent years, once in a while you run  into a situation where local law requires certain conditions or imposes certain  limitations on a second mortgage. You should also discuss this with your  attorney, to make sure that you are not violating any local law.  </P> <P> Your buyer may also object to this format since it may inhibit his ability to  place further financing on the property. Rather than being encumbered by a  single loan, the property will be subject to total liens of the first and  second mortgages in the amount of $120,000.  </P> <P> This may inhibit the ability of the purchaser down the road to obtain a  home-equity loan, since the lender would no doubt be in third-trust position,  unless you are paid in full on your wraparound.  </P> <P> The purchaser may be somewhat hesitant to rely on you to make payments on his  or her behalf. You can often solve this problem, however, by agreeing to send  monthly or quarterly proof of payments to your borrower by sending him a copy  of your monthly canceled checks.  </P> <P> In some instances, the seller can give the borrower a year's worth of postdated  checks, and the borrower then sends the monthly payment check to the first  trust lender each month on time.  </P> <P> Under the proper circumstances, a wraparound mortgage can be both practical and  advantageous. It certainly can be a marketing tool when real estate is  difficult to sell, since it assures the buyer that a loan is available, and  clearly saves the buyer a lot of up front lender costs.  </P> <P> You must make sure, however, that your loan is freely assumable. Additionally,  since there is always the possibility that your borrower may default, you want  to make sure that the wraparound deed of trust and promissory note that your  buyer signs is valid and enforceable in your jurisdiction. It is advisable to  have an attorney prepare the necessary legal documentation in this case.  </P> <P> Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist specializing in real estate  and tax matters.

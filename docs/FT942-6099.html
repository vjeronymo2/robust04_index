			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals hit United Breweries Exceptional charges and a substantial property write-down combined to push United Breweries, the USM-traded regional brewer and pub operator, deeper into the red. Despite what Mr Vijay Mallya, chairman, described as 'extremely difficult trading conditions' turnover during the year to November 30 jumped 68 per cent to Pounds 4.14m, while operating profits before the exceptionals improved from just Pounds 38,000 to Pounds 463,000. The pre-tax line, however, showed a deficit of Pounds 8.57m (Pounds 978,954) following non-recurring exceptional charges of Pounds 758,570 against the Chainmaker division, bad debt write-offs and 'other known losses'. Interest charges increased from Pounds 720,177 to Pounds 815,279. As announced in April, a revaluation of the group's 76 public houses resulted in a Pounds 7.49m write-down, effectively eliminating the company's reserves and leading it to breach its banking covenants. Nevertheless, Mr Mallya remained cautiously optimistic: 'The underlying business continues to improve through operational efficiency. Negotiations for both the restructuring and acquisitions continue.' Losses per share widened from 8.58p to 10.65p.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Treuhand's kiss of life for potash - Resuscitation of an ailing east German industry WHEN THE Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern German industry, started tackling the region's potash sector, it was horrified at what it discovered. Before 1989, eastern Germany's potash mines were producing more than 3m tonnes a year with a workforce of over 33,000. In contrast, western Germany was producing 2.4m tonnes with less than 11,000 employees. Furthermore, the region's agriculture was using in excess of 20 per cent of potash. 'The land didn't need fertilisers for at least three years at the rate the potash was being applied,' said Mr Helmut Ballon, the Treuhand's director of mining and non-metallic minerals. Compounding the problem for the Treuhand in its efforts to restructure this industry is world over-capacity in potash production. Last year, 35m tonnes were produced world-wide, but less than 25m tonnes were sold. Against this background of inefficiency, on the one hand and over-capacity, on the other, the Treuhand had to think long and hard about how to restructure eastern Germany's potash mines. After 1990, when the Treuhand was set up, it set about drawing up a plan for the industry. Its task was influenced by the collapse of the Soviet and eastern European markets that bought east German potash, largely through a barter system. But once monetary union was introduced in Germany this market virtually collapsed overnight, because these countries did not have the available hard currency to buy east German potash. Russia, a large producer of potash, got around this problem by selling its product at any price, which means that German potash cannot compete with practices which amount to dumping. Moreover, most European countries tend to import potash from Canada, because of its better quality - it has a higher potash content in its basic salt - and because production costs in Canada are lower than Germany's. With these unfavourable circumstances in mind, the Treuhand moved quickly to close down eastern Germany's most inefficient and loss-making potash mines. Only four of the original 10 are now operating, and only 7,000 of the original 33,000 workforce are employed in the industry. These two developments led to a sharp reduction in the sector's output. Last year, eastern Germany produced 500,000 tonnes, but it still managed to sell only 100,000 tonnes. With these very high job losses, mostly in the southern Lander of Thuringia, the Treuhand was reluctant to close down the remaining mines, even though it was still saddled with the problem of overcapacity throughout Germany and on the world market. It asked Goldman Sachs, the investment bankers, to seek out a foreign buyer. 'We asked 48 foreign companies if they were interested,' explained Mr Paul Achleitner, an executive director at the Goldman Sachs investment banking division. 'But there were no takers. Some only wanted the cherries.' Without a foreign taker, the Treuhand had few alternatives. 'What could we do?' asked Mr Ballon. 'Close the rest of the potash mines down in eastern Germany, which would lead to more job losses? We couldn't do that. Yet any responsible producer of potash has to think about reducing capacity, and not acquiring additional capacity. So, we decided on a radical, new approach, which will not only save jobs, but perhaps give a new lease of life to Germany's potash industry.' The plan, the first of its kind embarked on by the Treuhand, involves merging Mitteldeutsche Kali, the eastern German potash mines, with Kali + Salz AG, a subsidiary of BASF, Germany's large chemicals group. Kali + Salz had a loss of more than DM10.8m in 1991 on a DM1.4bn turnover, while last year's loss for Mitteldeutsche Kali is estimated at DM100m on a turnover of about DM1bn. Under the terms of the fusion plan, both sides, merged into a new company, will reduce capacity and employment. This will bring annual production in Germany down to 3.1m tonnes and the combined labour force to fewer than 7,500. But (and this is the novel element of the package) the Treuhand itself will take a 49 per cent share in the new company, worth DM1bn (Pounds 400m). It will retain the right to sell its share within five years, but in the meantime the Treuhand believes it might be able to turn the new company around and find markets for Germany's potash. More than DM700m of the Treuhand's stake, will be earmarked for investments. 'We will introduce new product lines, particularly in eastern Germany, and completely restructure the eastern side of the company,' explained Mr Ballon. 'Essentially, what we are doing is bringing in our assets. In order to make the two sides equal, we have to inject fresh money, anchored on a business plan spread over five years. Both sides will eventually have the same productivity levels.' The remaining DM300m will be used to pick up old debts and service losses which will accumulate for some time yet. This unprecedented deal, underpinned by political and social considerations, particularly since unemployment in eastern Germany is about 30 per cent of the 9m labour force (taking into account short-term employment and job creation schemes) has to be approved by the finance ministry. The decision has been postponed for a short time because a west German has belatedly expressed interest in buying one of the potash mines in eastern Germany. But whatever the outcome, the Treuhand will be able to demonstrate to some east Germans that privatisation means more than closing a mine and locking the gates.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Italy's Northern League in purge Italy's Northern League party yesterday expelled three prominent critics of its tough-talking leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, in a purge of dissenters, Reuter reports from Milan. A party statement said the expulsion of Mr Franco Rocchetta, Ms Marilena Marin and Mr Vittorio Aliprandi, all members of parliament from the Veneto region of north-east Italy, had been decided unanimously by the movement's ruling federal council. Mr Rocchetta, a junior foreign minister in Italy's coalition government who holds the largely honorary rank of League president, has accused Mr Bossi of running a dictatorship. He told Italian reporters in Berlin, where he was attending a European conference, that the federal council was 'a prison in which every voice of dissent is smothered'. In an apparent reference to Mr Bossi, he said it was 'peculiar that of the more than 20 members of the council only one understands anything about politics . . . like a second Mao'. Mr Rocchetta led internal criticism of Mr Bossi's rumbustious brand of politics last week after the League leader hit the headlines with bizarre claims that he had personally prevented an armed revolt by northern Italians incensed at corruption in Rome in the mid-1980s. Mr Bossi followed this up with uncorroborated claims that the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, was plotting to hold snap elections to rid his fragile four-month-old coalition of the League, which provides its parliamentary majority. Mr Bossi has engaged in a near non-stop slanging match with Mr Berlusconi, whom he accuses of trying to brake the League's federalist ambitions. Last week Mr Bossi offered to resign as the League's federal secretary, the effective leadership post, if members wanted but pledged to root out his enemies if he stayed in the job. A League statement headlined 'Big Purge in the Northern League' said Mr Rocchetta and Ms Marin had been expelled for trying to damage the movement. It accused them of plotting to form a single party with Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia 'in order to delay federalism'. Mr Aliprandi was expelled for 'being in cahoots with Marin and Rocchetta', the statement said. The three have the right of appeal.</p>

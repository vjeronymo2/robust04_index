			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ahold lifted by strong sales in third term Ahold, the Dutch-based international supermarket and retail group, said third-quarter net profit rose by nearly 25 per cent to Fl 90.9m (Dollars 51.4m), reflecting buoyant growth in the Netherlands, the US and Portugal. The figures took nine-month net profit to Fl 295.4m, an increase of 20.4 per cent, prompting the company to repeat its earlier forecast that full-year profits would rise considerably, compared with those of 1993. The third-quarter rise would have been even more pronounced but for the weaker dollar, which meant that Ahold's large sales and profits in the US were translated into guilders at a rate of only Fl 1.75 to the dollar, against Fl 1.87 a year earlier. If the dollar had not fallen, Ahold's net profit would have shown an additional increase of 3.6 percentage points. In the US - where Ahold operates six supermarket chains that generate half of total group turnover - operating results were up 26.4 per cent at Dollars 40.3m. The strong rise was due partly to better results from two chains, Finast and Edwards, whose formats have been changed to make their prices more competitive. In the Netherlands, where Ahold's Albert Heijn supermarket chain is the market leader, operating results rose 8.9 per cent to Fl 75.9m. The cost of the chain's new distribution system was again charged against profits in the quarter, holding back the overall rate of increase. Ahold's relatively new activities in Portugal lifted profits in the rest of Europe 49.1 per cent to Fl 22.3m. Start-up costs continued to keep results in the Czech Republic in the red, but Ahold said results were improved compared with the same period of 1993.</p>

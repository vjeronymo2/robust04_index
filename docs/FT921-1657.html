			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Vice-chairman to take over as Jaguar chief MR BILL HAYDEN, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, the loss-making luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is to retire at the end of the month. He will be replaced by Mr Nick Scheele, previously president of Ford of Mexico, and Jaguar vice-chairman since January 1. Mr Scheele's job is to implement the Jaguar new-product plan devised after Ford's Pounds 1.6bn takeover at the end of 1989. The plan is aimed at boosting production by the end of the decade to more than 100,000 cars a year, four times last year's depressed level. Jaguar's plans for the 1990s include: A revised version of its XJ6 saloon, code-named the X300, to be launched in 1994. A replacement for the XJS coupe and convertible ranges, code-named X100, to be launched in 1996. The launch, probably in 1998, of a smaller sporty saloon, code-named the X200, to compete with rivals such as the BMW 5-Series. Jaguar hopes it will be able to more than double annual production from between 50,000 and 70,000 for the other car ranges to between 100,000 and 150,000. Mr Scheele said Jaguar planned to raise production this year to 27,500, but 'that assumes a recovery in the second half of the year, and at the moment the signs are not good'. Mr Hayden said Jaguar's break-even point has been reduced to about 34,000 cars a year. The company is also planning to reduce its workforce by about 10 per cent or some 800 people this year. Jaguar, in loss for the past three years, suffered a record deficit of Pounds 226m last year. More Spring in the cat, Page 16</p>

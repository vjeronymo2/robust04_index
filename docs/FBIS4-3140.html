During an interview with this  reporter, Fu Xishou, deputy to the Eighth National People's  Congress and governor of Anhui, frankly said that Anhui is  determined to realize this goal in the near future.    Fu Xishou said: "In the past, we Anhui people were unwilling  to shake off the label of being poor. The reason behind this is  that if they remain poor they would get help. In fact, nothing  was gained by assuming this posture. Moreover, it caused the  cadres in some areas to fail to concentrate on economic  development. This posture not only showed that Anhui people  lacked fighting will but also adversely affected their image.  To change this image and Anhui's appearance, we must depend on  ourselves, seize opportunities, and work hard in a down-to-earth  way."    Fu Xishou told the reporter: In the past two years, the  people of the province have emancipated their minds, changed  their old concepts, and strove to catch up with other areas.  The provincial party committee and the provincial government  promptly put forward the "one line, two points" strategy aimed  at developing the Wanjiang basin, responding to the call for  developing Pudong, concentrating on developing the economic belt  along the Chang Jiang, and accelerating the development of Hefei  and Huangshan Cities. The implementation of this strategy has  stimulated economic development throughout the province. Last  year, Anhui's economic growth rate broke all previous records.  Its gross domestic product totaled 94 billion yuan, up 22  percent over 1992; its total industrial output value amounted to  140 billion yuan, including 10 billion yuan from the output  value of town and village enterprises. All sectors of the rural  economy developed, with total agricultural output value  amounting to 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent,  ranking fifth in the country in terms of growth. Exports in  1993 totaled $960 million yuan, up 16 percent. Last year Anhui  approved 1,040 foreign-funded enterprises, with a contract  volume exceeding $700 million, which is the sum total of foreign  investment in the past nine years. Household appliances and  other processing industries, which used to be Anhui's weak  points, have gradually become its strong points.    The governor, who graduated from Qinghua University in the  1950's, understood very well how these achievements were made in  1993: "We cannot say that our current economic strength is very  great. There is a wide gap if we compare our economy with that  of other developed provinces. We must not lower our vigilance.  We must continue to work hard."    Fu Xishou said: To enable Anhui's economy to develop in a  sustained, rapid, and healthy way, it is necessary to carry out  the following two tasks. First, it is necessary to accelerate  the construction of basic industries and infrastructural  facilities, both of which will become Anhui's advantages.  Second, town and village enterprises and state-owned  enterprises should do a good job in importing technologies and  carrying out technical transformation. Infrastructural  facilities and basic industries are the mainstays supporting  Anhui's economic development, and importation of technologies  and technical transformation are like "wings" that can stimulate  Anhui's economic development.    Fu Xishou said: This year is a crucial year in building a  socialist market economic structure. Anhui must accomplish the  following tasks: First, accelerating the development of a  market economy in rural areas and striving to increase farmers'  income; second, maintaining healthy and rapid industrial growth,  while focusing on structural readjustment and efficiency; third,  accelerating changing the operating mechanisms of state-owned  enterprises and finding an effective way of establishing modern  enterprises; and fourth, opening up to the outside world in all  directions and domains and developing an open economy.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DELAYED BIDS OPENED ON FREEWAY PROJECT  </P> <P> Ending more than two years of delay caused by a dispute over whether to include  a car-pool lane, bids for widening the traffic-clogged Ventura Freeway across  the San Fernando Valley were opened Thursday, preparing the way for  construction in about two months, Caltrans officials announced.  </P> <P> Highway engineers had worried that the project, estimated to cost $35.8  million, might come in significantly over budget, forcing a new round of  bidding.  </P> <P> But the low bid of $36.9 million submitted by Tutor-Saliba Corp. of Sylmar was  only about 3% over the Caltrans estimate.  </P> <P> The 22-month project is expected to bring short-term relief to the Valley's  main east-west artery, which carries 280,000 vehicles daily and has eight to 10  hours of congestion each weekday.  </P> <P> The freeway, which is a patchwork of eight and 10-lane-wide sections, is to be  expanded to 10 lanes from the Hollywood Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard, a  distance of 15 miles.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Salzmann, chairman of the board and </F> director general of Komercni Banka: "What Will the 1994 Bring  in the Czech Economy"]    [Text] I assume that the continuing development of the  private sector, which had better results than the state sector  already this year, will bring with it a tendency to a gradual  growth of the gross national product. A production growth,  however, can be expected only in some branches of industry (i.e.  consumer goods, chemicals, wood-processing, and some areas of  mechanical engineering) and in construction. On the other hand,  a further decline is likely in coal mining, metallurgy, and  agriculture. We can again expect imports to grow faster than  exports. This is a result of the growth of personal and public  consumption and the demand for investments arising from the  necessary change of the production basis. This deficit will be  probably covered by a surplus of services in the balance of  payments, which, as a whole, will be balanced.    Our economic development will be favorably affected next  year  particularly by the following:    -- a continuing stability of the currency    -- a substantial decline in the rate of inflation    -- the interest of private owners in good management    -- a recovery of demand (a moderate increase in personal  consumption and investment activities on the domestic market and  the possibility of placing Czech goods on some foreign markets)    -- social peace and, in comparison with other countries, a  relatively low rate of unemployment    -- budget stability    -- an increased interest of foreign capital in investing in  the Czech Republic.    On the other hand, the ongoing recovery process in our  economy will apparently bring also some negative trends, for  instance:    -- pressure for a growth of wages faster than that of social  productivity    -- a high insolvency of companies and enterprises    -- the harmful effect of bankruptcies on business partners  of  the bankrupt enterprises, i.e. also on banks    -- a regional disparity of certain phenomena, such as  unemployment, for instance.    Of the foreign influences, in addition to the, on the whole,  already compensated-for losses of the markets in the former  socialist camp, we can be unfavorably affected, above all, by  the following:    -- the certain uncertainty in the future development of the  economic relations with the Slovak Republic    -- the surviving protectionist efforts of the economically  advanced countries    -- the continuing economic stagnation in the countries of  our  most important trade partners, demonstrated not only by the  closing of their domestic markets, but also by their intent  interest in third markets.    The gradual liberalization of some more prices (rent, power,  etc.) can combined with the growing unemployment reflected in  the decline in the pace of growth of the purchasing power of the  population, and, in extension, effect the deposits by the  population and thereby the bank resources. That could weaken  the activity of the banking sector -- credits, capital market  operations, etc. Thus, the interest of the banks in domestic  primary deposits will grow, and the banks will seek funds  abroad. This will increase the importance of audits of bank  balances according to international standards as a token of  their reliability for foreign partners.    The basic systemic measures of the transformation have been  adopted. Next year, we expect the government to fine tune the  conditions for the support for the growth of the economy as, for  instance, exports advancement law, tax adjustment, details of  the legislative conditions for the entry of foreign investors,  the drafting of housing market legislation, etc. The work will  continue on the prerequisites for the external convertibility of  the Czech koruna, and both more radical avenues and slower  gradual steps will be investigated. We expect an amendment to  the law on banking, which will facilitate the development of  other types of banking operations (mortgage loans, for  instance). The ongoing privatization, with the emergence of  stockholding companies, will put great demands on the perfection  of the capital market with securities. Many of the shareholders  (there are several million of them in the Czech Republic) will  gradually start trading either on the exchange or on the  RM-system.    The reduced inflation will result in pressure on reducing  the  interest rates. Over the next two years, the interest rates on  the Czech banking market will gradually adjust to the rates in  the advanced countries. It is, together with other  prerequisites, one of the steps the banking sector must take in  preparation for a possible entry of the Czech Republic into the  European Community.    What are then the tasks of the Komercni Banka [Commercial  bank] for the next year?    We want to keep and reinforce our position as a leading  Czech  universal bank, and that while fully respecting the  legislatively defined monopoly limits. We must complete the  organizational and technical restructuring, began three years  ago, to a standard modern European bank, and so improve the  services to our customers. We will enhance the extent of our  business activities, in credits as well as in trading on the  capital and financial markets. We will, above all, expand  credits for the private sector. For selected, superior  projects, we have prepared a so-called KB PRO program with  better credit conditions (substantially lower interest rates,  lower collateral required, etc.) and, at the same time, with  demanding criteria for assessment of these projects. We intend  to more than double the trade in securities, and we will  continue to expand the operation on the interbank market. To  improve the situation in resources, we will expand our offer of  deposit products, particularly the term deposits, so we satisfy  the demands of our customers to the utmost. We are also  preparing another bond issue.    The possibilities of the development of the business  activities of the Komercni banka are limited by its capital as  assessed by the index of capital adequacy [kapitalove  primerenosti] set by the Czech National Bank. Therefore, we  have decided to raise the bank's capital from the original 5  billion korunas at the end of 1992 to at least 9.5 billion  korunas in 1994. We are conducting this increase in two steps --  first, by an increase of 2.5 billion korunas from the equity  ratio, and second, by a new issue of shares in the nominal value  of 2 billion korunas. The talks on the preparation of the new  issue indicate a great interest of the current shareholders as  well as of the selected foreign investors. This interest is  given, among other things, by the fact that the price of KB  shares listed on the market show a mostly advancing trend and is  a multiple of the nominal value.    The Komercni banka intends to continue in the policy of the  lowest interest rates on credits, while keeping the  corresponding real level of interest on deposits. In practice,  this means another decline in the bank margin.    The Komercni banka has founded a home ownership saving bank  and is preparing a mortgage bank as subsidiaries. Thus, it  intends to fill the voids in the banking services in the Czech  Republic. The home ownership savings and the mortgage loans may  contribute significantly to the development of the Czech economy  by stimulating the demand for construction, but also for the  industry manufacturing needs for the construction and equipment  of housing etc.    I believe that the banking sector in general and the  Komercni  Banka in particular will make another step in 1994 towards an  increase in both the number and quality of financial services  that are necessary for the development of a healthy market  economy.</p>

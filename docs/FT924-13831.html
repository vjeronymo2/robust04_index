			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / SA government and Inkatha to meet MR FW de Klerk, the South African president, said yesterday that government officials would meet the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party within a fortnight, removing one of the most serious obstacles to the resumption of multi-party talks on a new constitution. Delivering a 'state of the nation' address to a special session of parliament in Cape Town, he stressed his determination to proceed with constitutional negotiations with the ANC and other parties, including Inkatha which suspended talks with the government two weeks ago. He lashed out, however, at the African National Congress shortly after thousands of ANC protesters surrounded the parliament building. He demanded that the organisation scale down its campaign of mass action which he blames for exacerbating political violence in South Africa. The ANC demonstration, called to protest at the continued exclusion of blacks from parliament and at government plans to amnesty police and army officers, was much smaller than expected. Only about 5,000 people took part. Organisers had expected a crowd of 25,000. Top ANC leaders addressed the crowd, which formed a human chain around the parliament building. 'We want this place closed down and replaced by a people's parliament,' South African Communist party veteran Joe Slovo demanded. 'The people have no vote here. The only parliament you can participate in is the parliament of the streets,' he said. ANC leaders condemned government plans to introduce legislation in parliament within the next 10 days to amnesty security force officers who committed crimes under apartheid. Mr de Klerk outlined principles on which he demanded agreement before an interim constitution could be agreed, including devolution of power to regional and local governments, multi-party power sharing at the executive level of government, and a bicameral legislature to protect special interests. The ANC and government positions on all of these issues remain sharply at odds.</p>

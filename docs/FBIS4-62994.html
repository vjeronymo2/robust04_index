			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Although  Russian-Finnish trade and economic relations have now entered a  more active period, we still have not managed to regain the peak  levels of former years, said Russian Federation Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin today after holding talks with President  Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. In order to achieve this objective  the Russian Government assigns a significant role to the  country's regions, which are capable of establishing partnership  ties with Finland of their own accord. During 1993, overall  trade between the two countries grew by 40 percent compared with  the preceding year.    President Ahtisaari, who is paying an official visit to  Russia, expressed satisfaction with his talks in Moscow. Among  other things, specific plans for economic cooperation between  the two countries were discussed. Responding to a question from  an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the Finnish president said that  Finland's forthcoming membership of the European Community will  not impair but, on the contrary, will expand opportunities for  bilateral Russian-Finnish cooperation. He cited the example of  funding for joint projects.    The further development of traditional trade and economic  relations between Russia and Finland is essential to both  countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin noted at a short briefing after  the talks. We see no obstacles or special difficulties in the  way of this. With whom have we always found mutual  understanding, if not with Finland, the Russian premier asked?</p>

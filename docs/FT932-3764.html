			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Opinion poll setback for PM TWO THIRDS of the people asked in a poll for ICM think Mr John Major cannot remain as a credible leader of the Tory party, and almost the same number think there should be a contest for the party leadership. The poll, in today's Daily Mail, finds that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, was the most popular choice for the putative leader most likely to improve the Tories' standing with ordinary voters, just ahead of Baroness Thatcher and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.</p>

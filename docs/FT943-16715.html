			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Property (Australia): Where street sales are a way of life - Roadside auctions provide popular entertainment in the state of Victoria Victoria is 'the auction capital of Australia, if not the world', according to the state government's planning and development department. Its advice booklet on buying or selling a home, which it prints in 12 languages, goes on to note that 'the traditional Saturday street-side auctions of properties, ranging from modest weatherboard cottages to million-dollar mansions, is a popular weekend entertainment in Victoria's cities'. The majority of homes for sale in Victoria are offered by auction. Only if a property fails to sell is a buyer sought by private treaty. Victoria, in the south-east corner of Australia, has 4.4m people, most of whom (3.1m) live in Melbourne, the nation's second-largest city. The state's estate agents compete fiercely and most quote 'AH' (after hours) telephone numbers in auction advertisements. New buyers must learn the many abbreviations. BICs are built-in cupboards, IGP an in-ground pool and LUG a lock-up garage. ELF is not a garden gnome - it refers to electric light fittings. An OFP (open fireplace) always gets a mention with Victoria properties. Plenty of homes have laundries and a number even have sewing rooms. There are a great many references to alarm systems and security. Do not, however, expect the detailed foolscap pages or glossy brochures with colour photographs that you get from a British estate agent. Initially, you might have to make do with a single sheet containing a line drawing of the property, the briefest description and a floor plan. You can see why the department's booklet suggests potential buyers should take their own photographs of properties they like. The booklet offers guidance on procedure. This includes getting legal documents copied, the property vetted by an architect or builder, and a mortgage approved. A successful purchaser at auction pays a 10 per cent deposit - but he forfeits the deposit if he finds he cannot proceed. A private treaty purchaser is entitled to a three-day cooling-off period, during which he can withdraw, if the price does not exceed ADollars 250,000 (about Pounds 120,000). But there is no cooling-off time for an auction buyer. How does a system weighted so heavily towards the saleroom work in practice? Janet and Stewart Simmons are a British couple who, after renting flats in Victoria, decided last year to buy a house. They had noted that property prices were about to start rising after diving in the recession. They wanted a place with a garden in a part of Melbourne where their children could grow up happily. A suburb adjacent to Port Philip bay seemed just the thing so they made arrangements for a bank mortgage, started viewing houses and attending auctions. 'Often,' she recalls, 'the auctions were outside in the street. There could be anything from 20 to 60 people. Everyone stands on the pavement. Half the street turns out to see what is going on. People in cars slow down, then drive on again.' They went to one auction fully prepared to buy but did not even manage a bid as the price soared above their limit. At another, they managed a few bids but then dropped out. 'In the end, I got cold feet and we did not buy at auction,' Simmons says. Instead, they negotiated successfully for a property which was due to be auctioned but where the owner was willing to sell privately if the right price was offered. What they got was a detached, three-bedroom bungalow built of brick in 1946 with a lounge, family/dining area, kitchen, bathroom and laundry. There is also the ubiquitous OFP and central heating plus W/W (wall-to-wall carpets) and drapes, a garage and a garden with a range of trees: silver birch, elm, maple and oak. They feel they will need to build an additional room but do not see that as a problem. Some people in the road have had a complete storey added: hence, prices there range from the equivalent of Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 120,000. Auction or private treaty: which is the better method? Simmons, who has had previous experience of buying in England, hedges her bets. She prefers buying by private treaty but accepts that auction could be a better way to sell. Victoria-born Robin Wilson, now an auctioneer with London-based agent Winkworth, finds it logical for a property to go to auction first to establish its worth. He says such a sale is open to everyone and there is no argument about the price. Wilson adds: 'Everybody in England says: 'As a last resort, we can put it to auction'.' In his view, that is the wrong approach. Simmons' husband has dual citizenship, so he had no difficulty making the purchase. But other foreigners hoping to move to Australia and, eventually, buy a home there should check with the Foreign Investment Review Board (a department of the Treasury) at Parkes Place, Parkes, ACT 2600, Australia. It will tell you if permission is necessary and if, taking into account your circumstances, you are likely to get it.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT REQUIRES LOCAL ELECTIONS -- WHICH REQUIRE U.S. SUPPORT  </P> <P> American Jews have, on the whole, kept to themselves their misgivings about the  way Israel is handling the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, tending to  express their concerns only "in the family." Few have wanted to criticize  Israel, or U.S. policy in support of Israel, on an issue so intimately linked  to the security of Israel, which not only all Jews but most other Americans  strongly support. Yet today the suppression of voices of concern may actually  be undermining the security of Israel by prolonging the intifada, postponing  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and weakening the hand of the U.S. government  in moving the Middle East peace process forward at a time when real movement  seems more possible than it has for many years.  </P> <P> Although opinion polls in Israel show that there is a substantial majority for  trading land in the territories for peace, and a thin majority for negotiating  the issue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir is strongly against doing either. This position is supported by the  Jewish lobby in Washington so effectively that few senators and members of  Congress have challenged it (the letter to the prime minister signed by 30  senators last March was a notable exception).  </P> <P> Without the support of at least a substantial part of the Jewish community in  America, Secretary of State James A. Baker III will find it as difficult as his  predecessors to promote a negotiated solution to the Palestinian conflict. Now  that the PLO is tentatively trying out a more moderate approach, America's  dialogue with the PLO is only the first step toward realism and peace. Further  steps can be encouraged or discouraged according to how the winds of public  opinion blow on Washington and on Jerusalem. We have only to look at the  instant effect that American Jews had on Israeli politics when they felt  threatened by the proposed redefinition of "who is a Jew?" They created enough  pressure to secure a coalition that excluded the religious parties pushing for  the new legislation.  </P> <P> The Israeli coalition's position is based on support for municipal elections in  the occupied territories as the key to opening a way to negotiations with the  Palestinians. For the past 16 months, the Sadat Peace Foundation has been  promoting this solution with both parties to the conflict through two channels.  An ongoing citizen diplomacy program meets regularly with Israeli and Arab  leaders. The other effort is to focus U.S. senators' attention on the  advantages of municipal elections as an element in raising the prospect for  peace in the region.  </P> <P> The foundation's conflict-resolution efforts provide an alternative to help the  Israeli government move forward on the peace process. Prime Minister Shamir has  said that he would "never" talk to the PLO, and the United States' decision to  do so will not be enough to bring him to follow suit immediately. He needs an  interim partner, not from Tunis but from the territories, and free municipal  elections under U.N. or other international supervision are the obvious means  for giving him such a Palestinian partner.  </P> <P> On Jan. 29, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel Rahman said that municipal elections  under these conditions would be acceptable, but he stressed that U.N. forces  would first have to replace Israeli forces in the territories. This signals PLO  readiness for the first time to authorize indigenous Palestinian leaders to  start the process of negotiating with the Israeli government.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Labor Party and some members of Likud are on record favoring a  withdrawal of Israeli forces from centers of population prior to municipal  elections, so it no longer seems too much to anticipate that a solid agreement  may be within reach on this preliminary stage of the peace process, and that  with such an agreement the intifada would come to an end. All it needs is a  push from public opinion, primarily from the American Jewish community.  </P> <P> Some Israelis fear that municipal elections would be the first step toward the  creation of a Palestinian state that would have a population much larger than  that of Israel, and in due course probably would be armed by Arab neighbors to  join in the final battle to push the Israelis into the sea.  </P> <P> Every grouping in the Middle East has its own private nightmares. Lately,  generals and statesmen of Israel, many of them now speaking out from the  freedom of retirement from official positions of power, have been pleading for  their compatriots to awaken from fears deeply implanted in their consciousness  30 or 40 years ago. They argue, impressively, that Israel is now the strongest  military power in the region, and its security is not dependent on retaining  total control over a few miles of occupied territory that modern missiles and  aircraft can traverse in seconds. Their expert testimony is that Israeli  security is much better served by trading some land for real peace,  internationally supervised and guaranteed by both the United States and the  Soviet Union, leaving their Palestinian neighbors unarmed in whatever entity is  eventually negotiated.  </P> <P> To continue the stalemate, even at the present level of violence, is too  costly, politically and economically, for both parties. If this opportunity is  missed through intransigence, then the real-life nightmare for Israel will be  not just an intifada but a jihad -- a holy war. It will be led by fanatics who  are being fed by present frustrations, and who will make the PLO look like  genuine moderates.  </P> <P> It is a momentous choice, and one that is likely to be made, for better or for  worse, this year. It is a choice that will affect not only Israelis and  Palestinians, but all of us on this shrinking planet. It is time for all who  see the danger and the opportunity to be heard while there is still time to  unite our voices to give peace a chance now.  </P></p>

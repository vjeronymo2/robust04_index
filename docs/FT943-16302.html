			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 109,500 bonus for Steel chief Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, received a Pounds 109,500 performance-related bonus for the 1994 fiscal year, when the company bounced back into profit after two years of losses. The bonus, detailed in the group's annual report, formed part of Pounds 389,667 in performance-related payments to British Steel's seven executive directors for the year ended April 2. British Steel paid no bonuses under the scheme for executive directors in the previous two years, when pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 204m. Last month, however, it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m for the year to end-April. Excluding the bonus, Mr Moffat received Pounds 386,690 in salary and related benefits, compared with Pounds 321,630 in the previous year. The rise reflects his appointment in May last year as chairman, in addition to his role as chief executive.</p>

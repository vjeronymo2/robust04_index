			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAP LOCAL RESOURCES FOR ADVICE ON WHAT AND WHERE TO PLANT  </P> <P> Trees are remarkable plants, arborists say. They use carbon dioxide and produce  oxygen, thereby helping to clean our air. They cool our buildings, reducing  energy consumption. They provide shelter for wildlife and psychological solace  for the human spirit. And they ask very little from us in return. Provided,  that is, we give some forethought to what and where we plant.  </P> <P> "If you define the conditions of the area where you want to plant and then  select a tree that will thrive under those conditions, trees require very  little maintenance," says arborist Alden Kelly, a member of Street Trees  Seminar, a local professional association dedicated to the promotion of street  trees and improvement of street tree management.  </P> <P> These resources can help in making an informed decision:  </P> <P> Street Trees Seminar: The organization has produced a chart of 65 trees  classified by the area required for the root system. The chart includes  information on the type of tree, shape, eventual size, soil requirements,  growth rate, useful life span, potential problems, general availability, and  more. It is available for $5, which includes postage and handling. Contact Al  Remyn at (714) 532-0325.  </P> <P> Tree Society of Orange County: The society offers free two-hour seminars on the  proper selection, planting and maintenance of trees at the Fullerton Arboretum  the first three Saturdays of every month. The society also offers presentations  on tree-related topics at locations throughout the county. Call (714) 449-7170  to make seminar reservations or obtain information on other events.  </P> <P> University of California Cooperative Extension, Orange County: The extension  has a library of prerecorded educational messages regarding home and garden  concerns. Ext. 262 contains a message on planting landscape trees; Ext. 263,  staking landscape trees; Ext. 264, training young landscape trees. The TELETIP  line is (714) 447-7190. Call (714) 447-7150 for a complete list of messages and  a catalogue of Extension publications, a number of which are related to trees.  </P> <P> California Releaf: If you are interested in replenishing the county's urban  forest -- beyond the borders of your own yard -- contact Genni Cross, Releaf  coordinator for Southern California, at (714) 725-0323 for a step-by-step guide  to organizing a Releaf Effort in your community. Guides are also available for  municipalities wanting to get involved. SHARON COHOON  </P></p>

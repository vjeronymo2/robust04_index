			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott urges party compromise MR JOHN PRESCOTT urged yesterday a compromise between the Labour leadership and the unions to avoid a damaging clash over internal party democracy at the party's autumn conference. But senior Labour officials underlined Mr John Smith's determination not to retreat from the introduction of the one-member-one-vote principle for the selection of parliamentary candidates. Mr Prescott, a member of both the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive and an influential voice on the left of the party, said it was still possible to reconcile Mr Smith's proposals with the unions' demands for a collective voice in the party's affairs. Speaking ahead of Mr Smith's speech later today to the TGWU general union, Mr Prescott said that the unions should retain a significant share of the votes in the electoral college which chooses the leader of the party. These could be cast on the basis of a register of political levy-payers and would recognise the leader's role as that of the entire Labour movement. But Mr Prescott, who is likely to be a pivotal figure in the backroom bargaining ahead of the conference, supported Mr Smith's insistence that only Labour party members should be entitled to vote in the selection of candidates. He suggested that an agreement on leadership elections which preserved a collective, albeit disaggregrated, vote for the unions - an idea on which the Labour leader has indicated he is open to discussion - could swing a number of unions behind the introduction of one-member-one-vote for parliamentary selections. Mr Smith intends to use his speech to the TGWU today to warn the unions that he will not retreat from that principle and that he wants a settlement of the issue at this year's conference</p>

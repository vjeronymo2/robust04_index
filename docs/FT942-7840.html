			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / 'Undemocratic' moves to cut red tape spark anger The government's de-regulation bill was given a third reading amid backbench protests that sweeping new powers for ministers to cut red tape were undemocratic. The measure, which was passed by 291 votes to 242, will give ministers the ability to repeal or amend de-regulation laws through orders, which can be dealt with on a single Commons vote rather than through the more lengthy legislative process.

He accused the government of trying to bring an administrative device to govern England, Scotland and Wales as it governs Ulster. Mr Gary Waller, MP for Keighley, said: 'A general power to create or amend the law, even with limitations, is a power which should certainly give us as parliamentarians pause for thought, and we should at the very least set a time limit on its application.

Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's industry spokesman, said no Labour government would use the powers, which he described as 'an abuse of the House of Commons'. Earlier, Labour had attacked plans to reduce regulations governing standards for operators of heavy trucks, fearing the move would harm road safety. Mr Fatchett said: 'All the evidence points to the need for the current system to be maintained or toughened up - not weakened.'</p>

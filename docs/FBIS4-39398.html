			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- The Liberal Democratic Party  of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, whose programme and tactics were often  compared to that of Adolf Hitler, fired back on Wednesday  branding the "Democratic Russia" movement as "fascist" and  demanding to ban it.    Vyacheslav Marychev, a member of Zhirinovskiy's faction in  the State Duma, proposed to discuss the issue of "banning the  anti-popular fascist movement `Democratic Russia'" because,  according to him, it is to blame for the current economic plight  of the country.    The "Democratic Russia" was the major movement which helped  Boris Yeltsin come to power.    The Duma rejected the proposal and Speaker Ivan Rybkin  stressed that such a question is outside the powers of the lower  chamber.</p>

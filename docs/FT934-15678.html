			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Craxi to help in probe MR Bettino Craxi, the former Italian Socialist leader, has suddenly changed tactics in defending himself against a string of corruption charges. He now appears willing to collaborate with the magistrates. On his own initiative he arranged a meeting in Rome on Saturday with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the Milan magistrate whom he has constantly castigated since the corruption scandals first broke in early 1992. The meeting marks a turning point in the long investigations into political corruption and illicit party financing. Until now, no senior politician in any of the previous administrations has sought to co-operate with the inquiries. Instead, they have hidden behind the protection of parliamentary immunity until forced by public opinion to waive it. Mr Craxi has never ceased to protest his innocence and in March fought hard to avoid losing his immunity. He waived it, only to face the two more minor charges linked to illicit party financing, while his parliamentary colleagues refused to let him face the more serious charges of extortion and receiving illicitly obtained money. Milan magistrates are appealing against the constitutionality of parliament's right to prevent him facing these charges, which related to the alleged raising of nearly L40bn (Pounds 17m). Meanwhile, Mr Craxi, Italy's prime minister from 1983 to 1987, has been advised that he is under investigation for numerous other corruption offences. However, the magistrates cannot question him unless he consents. As one of the most powerful figures in Italy from 1980 until his enforced resignation from the Socialist party this February, the former premier may be in a position to tell a lot of secrets.</p>

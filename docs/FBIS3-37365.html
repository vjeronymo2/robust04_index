			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Wednesday Ella Pamfilova, Russia's Social  Security Minister, reported to INTERFAX about her "final and  firm" intention to resign. "This decision is a result of much  thinking and three notes on resignation which I have presented  to the Cabinet's leadership since this January," Pamfilova said  in her exclusive interview with our news agency.    "I do not want to be a screen nor to reassure in vain people  who need social support and security. I cannot do anything in  the government with such a composition. At the same time I do  not want this government to fall because real chaos could come  out of the ruin," said Pamfilova.    At the same time, she admits that an opportunity for the  present Cabinet could be lost in the near "two-three months." I  would not like to be among the people who are willy-nilly  building the road to Zhrinovskiy's power," declared Pamfilova.  In her words, the government would become viable if Yegor  Gaydar returns to it as the first prime minister and Boris  Fedorov -- as leader of the economic sphere.    "I hope I shall have an opportunity to explain my decision  and my position to President Yeltsin in detail," said Pamfilova.    On Wednesday she conducted a conference with her  department's  staff and explained the motives for her resignation.</p>

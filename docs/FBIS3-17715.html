But It Is an Expensive Business"]    [Text] The parliamentary hearings in the State Duma  Thursday [24 March] showed how complex the situation is in  connection with Russia's international commitments in the sphere  of the destruction of chemical weapons (CW). Defense Ministry  spokesman Major General Yuriy Tarasevich stressed that the  military department expects the deputies to provide legislative  support in such a difficult and expensive business as the  destruction of chemical weapons. According to the military, the  blueprint for CW destruction needs to be legislatively  formalized. A draft blueprint will be presented to the State  Duma in mid-April. We also need laws on CW destruction and on  the social protection of the population in areas where these  weapons are being destroyed.    Funding for all measures connected with preparations for the  actual recovery of toxic substances and munitions is extremely  uneven and inadequate. Getting rid of Russian chemical weapons  will cost two trillion rubles [R] in 1993 prices. Meanwhile,  some R10.4 billion are supposed to be allocated for this purpose  in the current year. But we all know full well how funds are  being allocated this year. The CW disarmament program is no  exception.    There was a note of anxiety in what Maj. Gen. Yuriy  Tarasevich said. A number of arsenals established back in the  fifties in Udmurtia and Saratov Oblast are in need of a complete  overhaul. In existing conditions, such an overhaul is a very  difficult and dangerous business. One would like this to be not  an exlusively military headache. Let us hope the hearings go  some way toward this.    The military-political aspects of Russia's joining the  Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons were also  examined during the hearings. The inevitable question arose:  Might it not happen that our country will abandon this type of  weapon, while other countries, including those bordering on  Russia, will remain "chemically" armed and, moreover, will reach  a new level as a result of scientific developments? In general  terms, the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry spokesmen  assured those present that in this case there are reliable  control mechanisms in place and the world community provides  certain guarantees. But the detailed reply to this question  obviously had to wait until the hearings resumed behind closed  doors.    We would point out that the Convention on Chemical Weapons  was signed in Paris in 1993. So far it has been signed by 156  states, but it has been ratified by only four: Sweden,  Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Fiji. Whether Russia is to  become the fifth depends on how convincing the Foreign and  Defense Ministries' proratification arguments are in the eyes of  the parliamentarians. All I would say is that, in the event of  ratification, we will be able to count on financial assistance  from Western countries and the United States.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology: Genetic search for CF cure Two new approaches to the genetic treatment of cystic fibrosis, Britain's most common inherited disease, will be developed at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London. Bob Williamson, professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics, yesterday announced details of a Pounds 1m research programme, funded by a gift to the Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust from the late Leopold Muller, a London hotelier. US scientists are planning to use genetically engineered human viruses (either adenoviruses or retroviruses) to carry correct copies of the CFTR gene, which is defective in cystic fibrosis, into the lungs of CF patients. The St Mary's group will develop a different type of virus - bacteriophages which normally infect bacteria rather than human cells - to carry the CFTR gene into the lungs. A potential advantage of the bacteriophage approach is that it removes some safety concerns associated with genetically altered human viruses. For the long term, the St Mary's scientists are working on a second, more radical approach. They will construct artificial 'mini-chromosomes' to add to the complement of 46 chromosomes which contain the natural genetic material in human cells. The mini-chromosome would be large enough to carry the CFTR gene and all its associated control sequences, to ensure that the cells produce the missing protein in the right quantities. Some of these control sequences have to be removed when viruses are used, because there would otherwise be too much DNA for the virus to carry. If mini-chromosomes can be made to replicate alongside all the normal human chromosomes when cells divide, gene therapy would treat the disease once and for all; viral techniques, on the other hand, will almost certainly require repeated treatments. And mini-chromosomes could in theory to expanded to carry more than one human gene, to treat multiple genetic disorders including heart disease.</p>

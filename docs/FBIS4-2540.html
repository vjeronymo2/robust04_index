			<p>BFN     [Text] Liaoning Province has scored marked achievements in  clearing up illegal mobile telephones. It has discovered 1,399  illegal mobile telephones users in 13 categories. In the past,  some supply and marketing units have imported a large number of  mobile telephones of various styles in spite of state  regulations. Such telephone systems caused serious interference  to radio and television broadcasting and to other radio  facilities, about which the society lodged a strong complaint.  Since the beginning of 1993, six units, including the provincial  radio management committee and the provincial post and  telecommunications bureau, jointly with localities throughout  the province, started their work of ferreting out and handling  the illegal mobile telephones. Various cities have basically  been kept informed of the sale and usage of mobile telephones in  their own localities by adopting various measures. Benxi city  has cleared up and consolidated the sale markets and had six  stores sealed up because they had seriously violated the  regulations and refused to mend their ways despite repeated  admonition. Dalian city confiscated mobile telephones from 78  illegal users. The cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Tieling, and  others have also adopted active measures to check the illegal  mobile telephones. Through the large-scale activities of check,  the province's radio environment has been purified and the  interference encountered by the radio and television  broadcasting stations and other radio facilities has achieved an  obvious turn for the better.</p>

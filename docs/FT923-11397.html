			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak demand hits US oil groups EXXON, the largest US oil and gas company, and Texaco, the third ranked company, yesterday reported lower second-quarter net earnings as the squeeze on petroleum product margins and weak demand continued to take a toll on the US energy industry. The Texas-based Exxon suffered a 15.1 per cent drop in second-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 955m. This is the lowest quarterly net profit for the company since 1989, the year of the Alaskan oil spill from the Exxon Valdez. Exxon's earnings per share were down to 76 cents from 90 cents a year ago. Revenues in the quarter were 1.8 per cent higher at Dollars 27.76bn. For the first six months of 1992 Exxon's net income was down by 31.5 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn, on revenues that were 4 per cent lower at Dollars 55.67bn. Texaco of White Plains, New York, said its second-quarter net income was Dollars 245m, a decline of 8.9 per cent. Earnings per share were 85 cents, against 94 cents in 1991. Revenues were 4.4 per cent higher at Dollars 9.4bn. For the first half of 1992 Texaco's net earnings were 34.9 per cent lower at Dollars 445m, on revenues that were 6.3 per cent down at Dollars 18bn. The second-quarter net profit at Occidental Petroleum, based in Los Angeles, was nearly halved - from Dollars 147m, or 49 cents a share, a year ago to Dollars 75m, or 25 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, against Dollars 2.4bn. For the first six months Occidental, undergoing a substantial restructuring programme, suffered a 38.7 per cent drop in net income, to Dollars 173m. Revenues were down to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars 5.2bn in the first half of 1991. The drop in earnings at these companies continues a trend started on Wednesday, when Amoco, the fifth largest US oil and gas company, reported a 22.5 per cent fall in underlying second-quarter earnings and a Dollars 478m net loss after taking an Dollars 805m charge for restructuring and severance payment costs. Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, said the group's performance was affected by lower petroleum product margins, which were in turn affected by rising crude supply costs, weak economic conditions and soft demand in many markets. Earnings from exploration and production operation were Dollars 83m higher at Dollars 725m while income from the refining and marketing side slumped by Dollars 352m to Dollars 180m, due mainly to problems in the US market. Included in the second-quarter results was a Dollars 75m charge for restructuring Exxon's US oil and gas businesses. The tendency of energy companies to direct exploration spending away from the US was illustrated by Exxon's devoting 70 per cent of its worldwide capital and exploration expenditures to projects outside the US. Mr James Kinnear, chief executive of Texaco, stressed the company's effort to maintain the strength of its financial position in the face of generally weak industry conditions. He said Texaco expected to produce full-year cash savings of around Dollars 700m from reductions in planned capital spending and expenses. On Wall Street, Exxon's share price closed Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 63; Texaco's price improved Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 1/2 ; and Occidental's price was Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 19 5/8 .</p>

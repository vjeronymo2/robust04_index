			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: You pays your money and takes your choice - The Speculator / The esoteric world of equity options where gambles are the order of the day EQUITY options are a way of speculating on share price movements without putting up large amounts of money. You invest only as much money as you can afford to lose, but your gamble can pay off with substantial gains. Options are written (issued) by market-makers or other investors, who demand a premium for giving you the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a package of shares at a certain price (the 'exercise' or 'strike' price) within a fixed period. The right to buy is known as a call option, and the right to sell is a put option. Options on the shares of about 70 large companies, mostly in the FT-SE 100, are traded on the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe, pronounced 'life'). Business is still carried out in the traditional style, where traders gesticulate to each other in a crowded trading pit. Private investors can access the market through stockbrokers. By buying an option, you are gambling on whether you think a share's price will rise or fall. The goal for investors is to end up with a call option which has an exercise price lower than the share's actual price, or a put option with a higher exercise price. Options are available for various expiry dates and exercise prices, so you need to judge how far and fast a share will move. Some people base decisions on their opinion of a company's fundamentals, while others rely on technical analysis of charts. Expiry dates are fixed at three-monthly intervals, with a maximum life of nine months. So, at any time, there will be three option expiry dates available for each share and, for each date, there will be a range of possible exercise prices, usually at 10p or 20p intervals. The premium you pay for an option is determined by two factors. One is whether the option already has some intrinsic value - that is, a call option's exercise price is lower than the share price, or a put option's exercise price is higher. This is combined with the 'time value,' calculated from how long the option has left before it expires and how volatile the share price has been. The higher the strike price of a call option relative to the share price, and the closer the expiry date, the cheaper it will be - but the more likely you are to lose your money. The jargon can sometimes be confusing for investors. When an option has some intrinsic value it is said to be 'in the money.' If the exercise price of a call/put option is higher/lower than the share price, it is 'out the money.' And if it is roughly the same as the share price, it is 'at the money.' Options are popular speculative instruments because of their gearing potential: a small rise in the underlying share price can translate into a much larger rise in the option price. The cash price of the option is much lower than that of the share but, once an option's strike price has been reached, its price goes up by the same amount in cash terms as the underlying equity (less the dwindling time value). The proportionate return on your investment is thus far greater (see the table). Put options work in a mirror image fashion except that, rather than increasing the size of your profit compared with buying shares, they translate small losses into larger gains. Although the potential loss is limited to the price of the option, the risk of losing all the money invested in options is much higher than when buying actual shares. This is partly because you are gambling on the size and timing of movements in one direction, but also because options have a limited life. If your option does not make it 'into the money' by the expiry date, it will expire worthless. You cannot hold on to an option for years, hoping it will eventually regain its value. More than 90 per cent of options are never exercised; they either expire worthless or, if they increase in value, are sold back into the market. One advantage in doing this is that you do not have to find large sums of money actually to buy the shares; pay more commission; or be prepared to hold the share long term. Additionally, you can profit from any time value still attached to the option, as well as from the share price movement. Dabbling in options is not for beginners or those with only small amounts of money to spare. 'The money should be money that you are prepared to lose,' emphasises Graeme Hatch, an options broker at Killik &amp; Co. He says options should form a maximum of 10 per cent of an investor's portfolio. Contracts are usually for 1,000 shares (although Liffe can adjust this to take account of rights issues etc), so one contract could cost as little as Pounds 20. Every time you buy and sell, however, you will have to pay commission (minimum Pounds 30 at Killik), so each trade has to be reasonably large to be worthwhile - at least Pounds 500-Pounds 1,000, Hatch recommends. There is also a bid-offer spread on option prices just as there is on the underlying equities. Information on a limited range of option prices can be found daily in the Financial Times and also on Ceefax. Brokers should have access to a full range of up-to-date prices. Liffe produces a free information pack on equity and index options, including a list of brokers dealing in options and details of explanatory seminars.

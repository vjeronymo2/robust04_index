			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA today published a statement by  the Russian Federation Committee for the Press officially  warning OBSHCHAYA GAZETA that its actions are regarded as a  deliberate attempt to destabilize society and undermine the  constitutional power.    Let me remind you that this refers to the recent publication  of the scandalous version No. 1 of a coup d'etat allegedly being  planned.    In reply to these accusations, Yegor Yakovlev, the founder  of  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA today told our television agency:    [Begin Yakovlev recording] [Video shows Yakovlev seated in  office] If the Committee for the Press has not read OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA, which stated that it was publishing a document known to  be false and proving why it was false [pauses]... This is the  first point.    Second, there is Article 58 of the law on the press, or  rather on the mass media, which says that any attempt to hamper  the publishing of information will be subject to disciplinary,  administrative, and criminal punishment. I do not know who  signed this statement, whether it was Mr. (Mironov) or someone  else, but when Mr. (Mironov) accused OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of warning  society against this provocation -- and it was the first to  publish this and was punished for doing it -- in this way we are  being told: If you learn about another provocation, keep quiet.  When a doctor tells his patient that he is ill, there is no  point in hurling accusations at the doctor; similarly, this was  a sick document produced by a sick society. We just  demonstrated this.    Another thing -- otherwise it would be too sad to talk about  these attacks and persecutions. I recall the time when  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI was being persecuted in about the same way,  with the same zeal, and more or less by the same organizations,  though by different newspapers - yet now they say that  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI was always right.

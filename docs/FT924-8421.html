			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Personal View: How to help industry The phrase 'industrial strategy' means very different things to different people. To many industrialists it means simply a recognition of the importance of industry to the economic well-being of the nation, and a determination to conduct government business in a way which encourages industry in its task of wealth creation. To the Labour party it has traditionally meant government intervention in industrial matters, often with undesirable results stemming from the lack of familiarity of politicians and civil servants with the issues, but also from the party's distrust of the activities of industrial management. This distrust has stemmed in part from Labour's close relationship with the trade unions but also from a belief that industrialists do not generally act in the best interests of the nation. The more realistic attitude of the trade unions in recent years has yet to influence the attitudes of Labour politicians in a constructive way. Be that as it may, Labour governments have usually had positive industrial strategies, although sometimes interventionist and ill-conceived. By contrast, Conservative governments have generally avoided any form of industrial strategy, preferring to rely on market forces and the 'invisible hand' of competition. The Conservative party regards itself as the natural party of industry, and many of its regulatory initiatives on labour law have been helpful. But in general its policies have been dogma-based, and have contributed little of a positive nature to the industrial base. Indeed, ideological measures have sometimes been pursued in a way that has harmed industry. Recent examples have been the attempt to maintain a fixed exchange rate within the ERM at enormous cost in terms of employment, bankruptcies and industrial capacity, and the precipitate way in which the electricity supply industry was privatised with no regard to the need for an energy policy which market forces are incapable of managing. The recent ill-conceived pit-closure proposals were the inevitable result. Happily, the traumatic events which led up to and followed the withdrawal of the pound from the ERM may have induced a change of heart and a recognition that governments are elected to serve the interests of the electors rather than to pursue ideological ends. But there is no evidence that the cabinet has come fully to terms with a long-term strategy directed towards industrial prosperity. The simile which seems best to describe recent economic measures is that of ministers playing Monopoly in a locked room, with a secret rule book, while wearing ear muffs. An industrial strategy need not demand vast disbursement of public funds on pet projects - although it must be noted that such programmes as Alvey, which spent Pounds 350m on fostering industry/university collaboration in information technology, could qualify for the description of misguided and expensive government intervention. I would like to see the government make a commitment to an industrial strategy which would go some way to closing the gap with overseas competitors. This could begin with the following measures: Subject every government measure - legislative, fiscal or regulatory - to the question: 'Will this do anything for British industry?' If the answer is negative or neutral the proposal should be reformulated to derive maximum benefit. Examine the ways in which government policies hamper British industry in international markets. Export credit insurance premiums, for example, are often three or four times as expensive as those in competitor countries. The government claims that such measures distort the perfect market and other nations should follow our example of theoretical purity. Well, they don't and they won't, and in the meantime British industry is rendered uncompetitive. Start an intensive programme to convince politicians and civil servants of the importance of industry. The educational background and tradition of those groups will make the task a difficult one, but we should take heart from the way the diplomatic service, with similar handicaps, has transformed itself over the past 20 years. The support now available from overseas missions to industry equals and often surpasses that available to competitors. A vital factor in this transformation has been the linking of career prospects with commercial postings and experience. Similar determined action is needed in the wider civil service. Make the DTI an important department with a heavyweight minister staying in the post for the life of the parliament. And concentrate more of the general management role of government in the DTI rather than, as at present, in the dead hands of the Treasury. Such measures would do much to restore the international competitiveness of British industry and help correct the long-standing indifference of the present government to the wealth-creating sector on which, ultimately, all other activities depend.

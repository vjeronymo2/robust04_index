			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (4): Authorities back a five-year initiative - Marketing the city ST DAVID's Day is always special for the Welsh, but this year March 1 was extra special for Cardiff. In the presence of the Princess of Wales, and with the young Prince William making his first public appearance, the city launched a marketing campaign to make itself better known and understood around the world. Under the aegis of the city, five public bodies unveiled a Pounds 10m marketing programme with the title: Just Capital. The five are: South Glamorgan county council, the Welsh Development Agency, the Wales Tourist Board, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and the city council. They guaranteed to put up Pounds 5m over the next five years, and set out to find a similar sum from the private sector. Marks and Spencer immediately contributed Pounds 20,000. At the same time, it was announced that Wynford Evans, chairman of the recently-privatised South Wales Electricity, would become chairman of Cardiff Marketing, a private company established out of the ashes of the municipally-run Cardiff Marketing Bureau, on June 1; and that Norma Jarboe would take over immediately as chief executive. 'The problem Cardiff has always had to face,' says Mr David Seligman, a solicitor and city councillor who headed the move to go private, and who remains chairman of Cardiff Marketing until Mr Evans takes over, 'is that people have the wrong impression about the city. Abroad, they simply wonder where it is in the UK. Here at home, it is generally seen as a dirty place with few amenities, not worth a visit. Incredibly, people still think it's a town of coal and steel. 'Once they get here, they find a magnificent modern city, a city that can fill a theatre with opera and a concert hall on the same night. What they find is not at all what they imagined. Our task is therefore to get the world to see that Cardiff is a fine place: that way, we shall attract tourists, inward investment, more jobs and help enlarge the city's prosperity.' That view is echoed by Miss Jarboe, who can take a dispassionate approach. 'Changing the image is what we must be about,' she says. 'People who come are bowled over, and are only too happy to return.' Discounting the fact that it is Miss Jarboe's job to 'sell' the city, she can be more dispassionate than the locally-born solicitor who is her present chairman, because she is an American and her links with the Welsh capital were minimal before her appointment. Norma Jarboe, who is 44, was born in New Mexico, moved east to college in Denver, and still farther east to work in New York on urban affairs and public-policy planning for Citibank. Soon after the Brixton riots in London, in 1981, the bank was asked to second someone to London to work on inner-city problem areas, and she was 'volunteered'. Although primarily concerned with Brixton after her arrival in London, her work subsequently branched into fellowship programmes and youth enterprise schemes; until 1986, when she herself branched out as a consultant in the field of public affairs, community relations, sponsorship and communications. The thinking behind Cardiff's marketing programme has been heavily influenced not only by the need to alter perceptions of the city, but also by the success that Glasgow achieved with its Glasgow's Miles Better campaign. 'Glasgow have done what we want to do here,' Mr Seligman says. 'At one time Glasgow was thought of as a rough, tough city. Today, it is seen as a city of culture, a place of refinement, a place in which to do business, and a place where people will happily move to work.' Mr Seligman wants people around the world to think in the same way about Cardiff. 'Despite the general perception, we have already had a lot of success in attracting companies here. We have attracted Tesco with a headquarters operation, for instance, National Provident Institution and Rothschild. All of these have come in the past few years, so we knew that with a bit of a push we could use the campaign to broaden and develop the economic base of the city.' Miss Jarboe says that the first step will be to bring the message to the city itself. Already posters with the Just Capital logo are beginning to appear on sites around the city. 'We must give them a sense of involvement, a sense of pride,' she says. Miss Jarboe speaks quickly. Thoughts and ideas pour out of her. 'Take the taxi drivers,' she says. 'They are often the first people a visiting businessman meets. Get them to enthuse about the city, give them civic pride, and they will help influence the visitor. When we have laid the groundwork here in Cardiff, we'll take the programme wider: national within the UK first, then international. This has always been an international city, and we will capitalise on that.' All this is planned on Pounds 2m a year in each of the coming five years. Can it be achieved? More important, can the Pounds 5m that has to come from the private sector be raised? Cardiff is not a city of big employers. Few have more than 1,000 people, and few of these have their headquarters in the city. Most of the potential donors that Mr Evans will have to approach probably have headquarters in the south east of England, so their allegiance to the Welsh capital is not as deep as his own. His task as chairman of Cardiff Marketing is all about money and raising it; but in the present economic climate, charitable giving is being reduced. The Welsh politician, Ray Gunter, said in 1964, when Harold Wilson appointed him minister of labour, that he had been given the 'bed of nails'. The parallel with Mr Evans' task is not inapposite.</p>

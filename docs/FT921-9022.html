			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Letter: Japan and its nuclear future Sir, Michael Cross's article, 'Japan sidles towards a nuclear future' (January 25), in our view contains a number of misconceptions. However, I will confine myself to setting the record straight on just three items of direct relevance to our agency. First, the IAEA already inspects all the nuclear power plants in Japan. In addition, the agency inspects all other types of Japanese nuclear facilities, including research reactors and fuel fabrication plants. Second, there is no evidence that these inspections alarm the public, as implied by Mr Cross. Quite the reverse. Third, Japan - one of the big contributors to the IAEA's budget - has always co-operated fully with the agency in the safeguards field.

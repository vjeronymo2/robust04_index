A spokesman for the Foreign  Ministry in Tehran said that "Jordan's decision has come to our  attention and we are going to implement it."    Diplomatic sources have said that the decision to expel the  diplomats was taken at "the highest level." And that King  Husayn during his visit to Washington received "comprehensive  documents" about what were termed subversive activities carried  out by 26 Iranian diplomats in Amman. The sources pointed out  that other "intelligence information" from the United States and  Israel reveals the Iranian Embassy's implication in "activities  harmful to Jordanian interests."    Iranian sources say that Jordan's decision is part of a  broader "U.S. effort" to isolate Iran. And that Washington  asked two other Arab states, namely Oman and Qatar, to  reconsider their policies toward Iran. But the diplomatic  sources said that Iran is accused of involvement in the  following actions:  --Distributing huge quantities of propagandist informational  items in Jordan. These items are sometimes transported by  trucks.    --Financing "suspect candidates" in the November elections.    --Trying to cause a split and instigate opposition to  Jordan's position on the peace process in the Middle East.    --Financing radical groups to oppose the peace process.    --Encouraging certain terrorist operations like the attack  on cinemas in Amman and al-Zarqa'.    --Iran's possible involvement--via Hizballah--in the  assassination of a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut.</p>

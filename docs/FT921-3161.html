			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Internal threat to Russian unity increases THE UNITY of the Russian Federation is increasingly being called into question, with the issue of independence for autonomous republics now seen to be as grave a threat to the government in Moscow as the economic crisis. The extent of the problem was highlighted last Friday when two of Russia's 20 autonomous republics refused to initial a federative treaty aimed at establishing relationships between these republics and the federal government. The two - Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia - are both relatively oil-rich, and see their economic future as brighter with independence from Russia. Tatarstan holds a referendum on independence next Saturday, amid warnings from Russian politicians that a yes vote would spark off a dangerous constitutional struggle. Mr Valdimir Lysenko, a member of the constitutional commission, said: 'Tatarstan did not sign the treaty because I believe it plans to secede from the federation.' Of the other republics which initialled the treaty, a number - including Bashkiria, Yakutia, Komi and Karelia - have raised strong objections to the agreement, which is to be part of the Russian federation's new constitution. The agreement must also be ratified by the parliaments of these republics, in many cases now strongly independence-minded. Critics of the government's policy - foremost among them, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, are calling for a crackdown on the republican authorities before the independence bandwagons become unstoppable. The terms of the treaty allow for central control over most military, economic and foreign affairs issues. The autonomous republics will have control over mineral resources - an important concession, especially to a republic like Yakutia with the largest diamond reserves in Russia. The threat to Russian unity comes as nationalist and communist forces, now formally united, plan a huge rally tomorrow in the centre of Moscow to coincide with an attempt by former Soviet deputies to hold a session of the USSR Congress of People's Deputies. Both the demonstration and the session are aimed at providing a focus and a sounding board for dissatisfactions over prices, national disintegration and fears of increased violence and tension between the former Soviet republics. Mr Rutskoi, speaking at a conference yesterday in Moscow warned that the break-up of the army brought a risk of civil war.</p>

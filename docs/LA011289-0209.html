			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> EPA ALLOWS STOCKS OF BANNED PESTICIDE TO BE USED ON COTTON  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it will permit cotton  farmers to use remaining stocks of the pesticide chlordimeform this year but  will not allow them to buy more after Feb. 19.  </P> <P> The agency last year announced its intention of canceling licenses to sell  chlordimeform, which it said has been shown to cause tumors in laboratory  animals.  </P> <P> In recent years, about 1 million pounds a year went to control the eggs and  larvae of the cotton bollworm and tobacco budworm on about 12% of the nation's  cotton crop.  </P> <P> The two manufacturers, Ciba-Geigy Corp. of Greensboro, N.C., and Nor-Am  Chemical Co. of Wilmington, Del., had requested cancellation of the licenses  and said they would recall inventories from sellers. Those requests were made  after the EPA had announced that it intended to conduct a special study of  chlordimeform.  </P> <P> The EPA said it is requiring that those recalls be made, is canceling the  licenses as of Feb. 19 and is not permitting any use by farmers after Oct. 1.  </P> <P> The agency said it had assumed that inventories would be used up during the  1988 growing season but "drought and fewer pest problems" reduced use  considerably and resulted in leftover stocks of 100,000 to 250,000 pounds on  farms.  </P></p>

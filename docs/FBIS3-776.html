"I am asking for a special urgent meeting of the Freedom  Alliance as this action is materially affecting the security  situation," said Gen Viljoen in a statement.    Gen Viljoen said an AVF force in Bophuthatswana was  withdrawn  after South African Defence Force [SADF] Chief Gen Georg Meiring  gave an assurance that the SADF would not be instrumental in  toppling Mr Mangope.    The toppling of Mr Mangope affected "hopes of an  all-inclusive settlement, not even to mention participation in  the elections," said Gen Viljoen.    "I am also calling on the international community to use  their influence in solving this new crisis."</p>

Two interparty policy  forums on foreign affairs and education will soon be set up, a  move aimed at accelerating Hosokawa's attempt to establish a  policy study group, believed to be a preliminary step before  forming a seven-party joint parliamentary group, the sources  said.    Three key coalition figures -- Hosokawa, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa -- held talks on March 13 and  agreed to launch the study group with a view to the forming of a  new party, the sources said.    They are eyeing setting up as early as April a seven-party  study group which could ultimately develop into a new party  after absorbing the two forums and establishing a parliamentary  group, they said.    The seven coalition components remain divided over how to  fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  in the next general election for the House of Representatives.  The LDP, which was ousted from power last August, still retains  the largest number of seats in the Diet of any single party.    The next general election is expected to be held under a new  electoral system mixing single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation.    Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, both core  coalition parties, are advocating the necessity of uniting the  seven coalition parties to defeat the LDP.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is the largest  member of the coalition bloc, the new party Sakigake [Harbinger]  and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are in favor of a  multi-party system. The SDP and Sakigake are opposed to  Hosokawa's plan to establish a joint parliamentary group among  the seven coalition parties.    Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP) which is closely  tied with Sakigake, has recently tilted heavily in favor of the  Shinseito-Komeito line, coalition sources said.    Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at  a  disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame  internal rivalry and agreed to back a joint candidate in each of  the 300 single-seat districts.    Hosokawa is expected to dissolve the next House of  Representatives for a snap general election some time before the  four-year term of the incumbent lower house expires in July 1997.</p>

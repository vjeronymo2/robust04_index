			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, after meeting for seven hours, the  Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] Assembly called for  immediately and radically changing the country's neoliberal  economic course. The FSLN ratified the position that it "cannot  endorse any agreement" with the characteristics of the Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility [ESAF], a position that had  already been presented to IMF Director Michael Camdessus.    The FSLN communique affirms that "the nation cannot resist  an  adjustment plan like the one being planned." The communique  also backs the demands of ranchers, businessmen, industrialists,  and producers who want policy changes in favor of production.    Originally convoked to discuss preparations for the FSLN  Special Congress, the assembly dedicated a lot of time to  analyzing the wave of massive evictions of humble families  throughout the country and condemned the government and the  Judicial Branch for the grave social consequences that these  abuses will have. The assembly also supported the resistance  that the Communal Movement has promoted against the evictions  and urged the National Police not to lend themselves to unjust  actions against townspeople.    The Sandinist Assembly stated its backing for the work the  Sandinist bench at the National Assembly is carrying out in  favor of the Legislative Branch's independence and rejected the  report that the U.S. State Department drafted on the human  rights situation in Nicaragua, considering the report to be  "biased and meddlesome."    Regarding the organization of a special FSLN Congress  session, the assembly confirmed that the session, which has been  named Augusto Cesar Sandino -- for Sandinist Unity -- will be  held on 20, 21, and 22 May.    The Sandinist Assembly authorized department organizations  to  elect, as guests to the FSLN National Congress, a number of  militants equal to 30 percent of the delegates to that congress.  These guests may speak but have no vote. Of them, 50 percent  must be women, and 50 percent must be between 16 and 25 years  old.    The FSLN will consult the National Council of Political  Parties on the possibility of filling the vacancies left by  deceased Congress members.    The document "vehemently asks that public debates between  Sandinists be free of insults and personal caustic remarks" and  urged party members to accept and abide by whatever decisions  are adopted by the majority at the Congress.    Regarding electoral results in the Atlantic coast, the  Sandinist Assembly accepted as valid complaints local Sandinists  have filed because of the late delivery of material and economic  support for their campaign. The Sandinist Assembly admitted  that "the failure to adequately resolve political  responsibilities in the Atlantic Coast" is an error of national  FSLN organizations. The Sandinist Assembly especially  acknowledged the work carried out under adverse conditions by  the Sandinists on the coast, work that permitted the FSLN to  emerge as "a decisive political force in both autonomous  regions." The FSLN has backed the Atlantico Norte Sandinists'  decision to convoke a coastal unity government tasked with  struggling for full autonomy in the Atlantic Coast and extended  an offer to the Atlantico Sur forces.</p>

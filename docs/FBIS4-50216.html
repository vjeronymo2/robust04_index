			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] The prospect of labour unrest in China has  increased because governments and banks in many cities have run  out of money to pay workers, some of whom are owed several  months' salary. It had been standing orders to pay strikers'  wage demands in state-owned factories, but in several cities  banks and administrations have refused to do so.    Beijing sources said yesterday the State Council was taken  aback by their refusal. The sources said incidents of  industrial unrest were occurring once or twice a week in  depressed sectors, such as coal and textiles, in Hubei, Hunan,  Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces. "To prevent the strikes  and protests from developing into political incidents, Beijing  has ordered lower-level governments to satisfy the demands of  workers whenever possible," an industrial source said.  "However, numerous local leaders have refused to pay, either  because they have no money or they think the practice, which  often involves printing money, would exacerbate inflation."    The source said in most cases Beijing had been able to  confine strikes by using a carrot-and-stick approach a  combination of the pay-up policy and the deployment of police to  prevent workers from spreading their action to other factories.  But it is understood the State Council is worried about the  labour situation worsening in the wake of cities refusing to  hand out money to pacify strikers.    At the same time, the authorities are being confronted with  protests by civil servants in rural areas, many of whom are paid  only three or four times a year. Chinese sources said more than  a dozen counties in Hunan could only pay civil servants  irregularly, leading to poor morale and go-slow protests.</p>

Andrey Kozyrev told Russian and foreign journalists on  Monday  night at the Foreign Ministry that at present it is necessary  for Russia, the United States, and other states to unite efforts  in the search for a political settlement in Bosnia. There is  only one way toward peace in Bosnia -- not through escalation of  violence and using air power, but through a joint search for a  political solution, he said.    Now, following the initiative of the Russian president, it  is  important not to lose momentum, tackle the problems of setting  up safety zones, and work on the implementation of what has  already been agreed with regard to stabilization of the  situation in the region, the minister stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Indro Montanelli: "Europe, A Case of Public </F> Forgery"]    [Text] Next Sunday [12 June] the European Community as a  whole will vote in the European elections. It is easy to  predict that, in terms of the turnout, Italy will be the most  diligent. We will be much praised for this prelacy, which has  been ours for some considerable time, and which will be  interpreted as evidence of strong European commitment on our  part. But, among ourselves, this is not really the issue at  stake.    Only a very small proportion of Italians who will vote will  do so thinking of Europe or in the hope of contributing to its  unification. Out of the 80 European deputies who will be  elected only a fraction will make their way to the parliament in  Strasbourg with the aim of attempting to achieve something  there. As for the vast majority of both candidates and voters,  Sunday's elections are only a testing ground for national  politics, one which will reveal the actual balance of forces,  not so much between the majority and the opposition as between  the parties within the majority.    In other words -- and so much for Europe -- the real issue  will be to decide who among [National Alliance leader] Fini,  [League Secretary] Bossi, and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi is the  strongest. In the continuing and, indeed, increasingly marked  absence of effective opposition forces (namely, the center and  the Left), accounts are essentially to be settled among the  ruling Right's three bosses. Of course, we resort to such  labels -- center, Right, and Left --only for the sake of  expediency and simplicity. In fact, these terms belong to the  language of archaeology. So much so that, in order to give some  sort of contents to their arguments, what do they focus on? On  the merits and shortcomings of statesman Mussolini, or on the  "values of the Resistance." No less than 50 years later.    We are not saying all this in order to discourage voters  from  going to the polls, but rather to prevent any misunderstandings  about the significance of the elections. Nobody, or hardly  anybody, will cast their vote with the Maastricht Treaty in mind  (in fact, nobody or hardly anybody knows anything at all about  Maastricht). Everybody, or almost everybody, will vote thinking  of Bossi, Fini, or Berlusconi, as apparent from the fact that  all three are heading their respective lists, even thought  everybody knows that Berlusconi will never be able to go to  Strasbourg since this is incompatible with his post as prime  minister; that Bossi will never want to go there because the  Lombard dialect is not yet one of the official languages in  Strasbourg; and that, as far as Fini is concerned, it would be  best if he does not go to Strasbourg because too many rumors (of  an ideological kind, of course) are circulating about him in  Europe.    All three, should they be chosen by voters, will delegate  their duties to their henchmen. However, they will not be the  sole absentees in a European Parliament in which Italian  representatives have always held -- with a few rare exceptions  -- three not very honorable records, namely those of  absenteeism, salaries (the highest in Europe), and incompetence  on almost every issue tabled. Indeed, it is equally notorious  that, despite the financial rewards and the numerous related  benefits, Italian politicians (once again, I repeat, with a few  commendable exceptions) consider a seat in Strasbourg as a  "consolation prize" which the bosses reserve for their most  zealous, albeit dumb, minor vassals.    All this turns Sunday's European elections into a sort of  public forgery, without however any penal consequences. Yet,  there is no choice but to vote. Not for Europe's sake, since  nobody is interested in Europe, anyway. Rather, in order to see  how much Berlusconi will manage to bleed Bossi, and therefore to  what extent he will have to reach an understanding with him or,  alternatively, get rid of him. This is not an irrelevant issue.  Many things, both good and bad, may result from it. For us,  though -- not for Europe.</p>

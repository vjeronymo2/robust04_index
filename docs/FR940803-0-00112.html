			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Gas Guzzler Tax Applicability to Alternative-Fueled Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Alternative Motor Fuels Act did not address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of the so-called ``gas guzzler tax'' to dedicated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dual alternative-fueled vehicles. The Energy Tax Act of 1978, 26  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 4064, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the Secretary of Transportation) to include in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the gas guzzler tax program automobiles fueled with any product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of petroleum or natural gas if such inclusion is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need of the nation to conserve energy. While alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels thus could be included in the gas guzzler tax program, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of Treasury has not included such fuels by regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this section to date, and dedicated alternative-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automobiles thus do not appear to be currently subject to the gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guzzler tax. However, since dual-fueled automobiles can operate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on gasoline, the applicability of the gas guzzler tax under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current law is less clear. The EPA solicited comments regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether alternative-fueled automobiles or dual-fueled automobiles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be included in the gas guzzler tax program, but did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make any proposals in the NPRM. These comments were submitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Internal Revenue Service for their consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several automobile manufacturers provided comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommending that dedicated and dual alternative-fueled vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be included in the gas guzzler tax program. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers stated that the purpose of the AMFA is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate widespread use of alternative fuels through incentives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that subjecting these vehicles to the gas guzzler tax program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would contravene the goals of the AMFA. The Senate bill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally included a section intended to ``clarify that the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy content of the alternative fuels covered by this bill do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not trigger the so-called 'gas-guzzler' tax provisions of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law.'' However, this section was deleted since taxes are revenue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related matters that most appropriately should originate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> House of Representatives. Senator Rockefeller stated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional Record&hyph;Senate of April 15, 1988, page S. 4101:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``in deleting section 8 from S.1518 that we believe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of the law should remain exactly as it was with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 8 in the bill.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ARCO recommended that any motor fuel tax be applied equally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all motor fuels including alternative fuels to preserve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy conservation intent of the Energy Tax Act of 1978. ARCO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that dual-fueled vehicles be subject to the gas guzzler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tax based on the fuel economy when operated on gasoline. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will appropriately tax vehicles that are designed to run on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel but will most likely operate inefficiently on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline. The generation of CAFE credits provided by the AMFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would likely result in the production of gas-guzzling vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ARCO provided an example that showed that a M85 dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle which has an mpg rating of 20 while operating on gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 16 while operating on M85 would have a calculated fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy under the CAFE credit provisions of the AMFA of 34 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They state for this example, at 34 mpg, that the dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle would not be taxed as a gas guzzler. However, at 20 mpg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline fuel economy, ARCO feels that the tax would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justifiable and consistent with the intent of the Energy Tax Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conserve energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESEA stated that because of the positive attributes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative-fueled vehicles and the urgency of switching away  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from oil-fueled cars, alternative-fueled and dual-fueled vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be included in the gas guzzler tax program as this is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excellent first step in acknowledging the real costs of running  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline powered vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA does not have the authority to decide which vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fuels are subject to the gas guzzler tax program. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority lies with the Department of Treasury. The IRS agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that EPA's decision to label dual-fueled automobiles for gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guzzler tax purposes based on the fuel economy while operating on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline is in accordance with the law. Therefore, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label dual-fueled vehicles using the current regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline-fueled vehicles contained in 40 CFR part 600, &sect;600.513.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Technical Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To save the time and printing costs involved in publishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them under a separate notice, the following technical amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the 40 CFR parts 86 and 600 are included in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical amendments described under items A and B below were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the NPRM. EPA received no comments on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments and therefore will be included in the final rule as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. Technical amendments described under items C, D, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E, were not included in the NPRM. By issuing these technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments directly as a final rule, EPA is foregoing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of an NPRM and the opportunity for public comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal provided by the NPRM rulemaking process. Such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> curtailed procedure is permitted by 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 307(d) of the Clean Air Act when issuance of a proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the public interest. The Agency is publishing this action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without prior proposal because these are non-controversial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections that rectify minor errors and omissions in the Part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600 regulations in a manner that does not substantively change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of the final rule. The Agency finds that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) for a determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the issuance of an NPRM is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. A formaldehyde concentration term is being added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilution factor equation located in 40 CFR 86.144&hyph;90(c)(7)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 86.144&hyph;94(c)(7)(ii). Although the magnitude of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formaldehyde concentration is very low, it is possible that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumption of zero concentration could lead to a slight change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated fuel economy. There is no reason why the formaldehyde  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration term should be left out of the equation. With this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment, all measured carbon-containing compounds will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the dilution factor equation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The symbol ``x'' is struck from the dilution factor equation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on 40 CFR 86.144&hyph;90(c)(7)(ii) and 86.144&hyph;94(c)(7)(ii) the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time it appears in the equation. The first time ``x'' appears in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equation, it is used to represent multiplication. All other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurrences of ``x'' in the equation represent the measured fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition parameter: C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> z <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . By dropping the first occurrence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``x'', only the latter meaning is retained. The multiplication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function can be assumed by virtue of a number adjacent to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable enclosed in parenthesis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Part 600.513&hyph;91 (b)(2)(xii) currently reads ``(xii) At least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.5 mpg, the gas guzzler tax statement shall show a tax of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $7,700''. This has been mis-typed; ``At least'' should read ``Less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than''. Therefore, the statement is amended to read: ``Less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12.5 mpg, the gas guzzler tax statement shall show a tax of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $7,700''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

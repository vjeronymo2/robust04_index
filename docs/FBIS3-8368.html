			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The political department of the Croatian Ministry of  Defense has issued the following statement:    Shortly after 1200 today a Spanish UN Protection Force plane  took off from Zagreb for Split. When it was above the Plasko  area, which is under the control of Serb terrorists, two  missiles were fired at it. One missed the target and the other  exploded near the plane and damaged its tail.    It can be reliably said that the missiles were fired by Serb  terrorists, members of the so-called 39th Banija Corps.    There were four crew members and five passengers on the  plane. Three of them were slightly wounded. The missiles were  fired at 1235.    The plane made an emergency landing at Krk airport at 1252,  the statement says.</p>

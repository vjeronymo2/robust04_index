			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rosa Costa and Diana Fernandes] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- At a meeting with Justice Minister  Alexandre Dupeyrat and the government leaders in Congress,  President Itamar Franco today will begin discussing the  possibility of the federal government exploiting the numbers  game. The government considers this to be "an emergency  solution" to fight the widespread corruption system set up by  the numbers game kingpins around betting places. According to  Pedro Simon (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do  Sul State), who is the government leader in the Senate, the  inclusion of the numbers game on the list of crimes forced it to  go underground and to generate a system of "related crimes,"  such as trafficking in drugs and arms and holdups of armored  bank vans.    Minister Dupeyrat will propose at the meeting that the  numbers game continue to be considered an illegal activity if it  is exploited without the government's authorization. He claims  that to simply legalize it -- as proposed by some -- would only  benefit those offenders who now are facing charges because the  courts would then have to dismiss all charges. Dupeyrat  believes the problem may be solved by authorizing the Federal  Savings Bank (CEF) or another government institution to exploit  the game to compete with the illegal operators.    Dupeyrat said: "The numbers game is being exploited by  criminals who are obtaining very high profits because they are  withholding part of the prizes." He added: "If the game is  exploited adequately and if higher prizes are distributed to  bettors, the people will prefer the government-run game."  Planalto Palace expects to learn today whether the CEF has the  capability to include another betting game in its lottery system.    Sen. Simon believes, however, that a solution should start  by  excluding the numbers game from the list of crimes and by  legalizing it. He wants it to become a legal activity that  would be supervised by the government and would be liable for  taxes. He said: "That would put an end to payments of bribes  to policemen and government officials." He added: "It also  would become much easier to fight the number of crimes  surrounding betting places." Playing on Simon's side is the  fact that he "legalized" the numbers game upon his inauguration  as governor of Rio Grande do Sul as soon as he realized that  one-third of police personnel in the state were officially  assigned to fighting this crime, but that in reality they were  only offering protection in exchange for kickbacks.    The proposal now being discussed by the government will  block  a Congress vote on a previous proposal that virtually reserves  the market for the current numbers game operators. The bill,  which already has been approved by the Constitution and Justice  Committee, legalizes the numbers game and authorizes its current  operators to continue to exploit it exclusively. The proposal,  which was endorsed by the Rio de Janeiro kingpins, was sponsored  by Deputy Paulo Almeida (Democratic Social Party-Rio de  Janeiro), who is the president of the League of Samba Schools,  Liesa.</p>

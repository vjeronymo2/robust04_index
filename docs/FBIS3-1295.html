Oelofse] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The South African Police  Union [SAPU] has condemned the government's "apparently  apathetic attitude" towards police personnel. In a statement on  Wednesday, SAPU said it was a shocking fact, particularly when  seen in the light of what was happening in self-governing areas,  that politicians could "play with" the country's future.    "It is obvious the government has no idea of the perilous  circumstances that have laid low the morale of police personnel  to its present dangerous level," the statement said.    SAPU claimed to have had no reaction from government to a  memorandum handed to the state president more than a month ago  in which it was clearly spelt out that immediate attention had  to be given to the "reasonable demands" of police personnel.  The union warns that it will not for much longer be in a  position to ward off "drastic labour unrest" in police ranks.    SAPU has demanded immediate salary adjustments for its  members to bring them in line with members of the National  Peacekeeping Force and also that immediate attention be given to  the perilous working conditions of its members.</p>

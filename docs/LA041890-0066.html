			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUGE REBATES FOR WATER CONSERVATION  APPROVED  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District on Tuesday approved a plan to pay millions of  dollars in rebates to water agencies that get customers to cut use by more than  5% this summer.  </P> <P> The plan, approved without comment by the Board of Directors, would rebate $100  for every acre-foot of water that local agencies conserve between June 1 and  Sept. 30.  </P> <P> The program would bring an estimated $10 million to the 27 Southern California  water agencies served by the Los Angeles-based agency. An acre-foot is enough  water to cover an acre to a depth of one foot, or 326,000 gallons -- roughly  the amount of water used by two families in a year.  </P> <P> The money could be passed along to retail customers as rewards, pay for  conservation programs, or could be used to offset lower sales by local water  agencies, officials said.  </P></p>

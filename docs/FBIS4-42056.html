			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marcelino Oreja, European commissioner for </F> transport and energy, by Francisco de Andres in Brussels; date  not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [De Andres] What, Mr. Oreja,  are your ambitions as a commissioner?    [Oreja] Basically that of encouraging the European Union  [EU] to respect the member states' national identities. There  is no incompatibility between the European interest and that of  each particular nation, because the former is not something  abstract: It is a real interest formed by that of the states  comprising the Community.    [De Andres] Which values, in your opinion, should the EU  recover or highlight in order to surmount the disenchantment  caused by its apparent powerlessness in the face of problems  such as unemployment, the Yugoslav crisis, or the internal  differences over the model of [European] building?    [Oreja] I believe that, above all, it is necessary to  implement the Maastricht Treaty to the letter, and, at the same  time, to ensure that citizens know what is being done. In my  opinion, the greatest failure on the part of the EU and the  Commission has been the difficulty which they have encountered  in convincing citizens that what is being done is something that  directly affects their interests and ideals.    [De Andres] To what do you attribute this lack of  understanding between the Community authorities and the public?    [Oreja] There are perhaps several reasons. There is an  economic crisis which creates the temptation to renationalize  policies, forgetting that a better solution to the potential  problems which arise in the member states can often be found  within the European framework. And then there is another crisis  -- very grave, in my opinion -- which is the very widespread  crisis of values in Europe. In my opinion, this situation  requires greater vigilance, on the part not only of the  governments but also of the citizens themselves, through  associations and intermediate bodies. Indifference to moral  values is a very worrying sign of our times, and, in my opinion,  their recovery depends very much on economic recovery.    [De Andres] Owing to the circumstances, you will keep Abel  Matutes' portfolios -- transport and energy -- until the end of  this year. Do you see yourself holding other responsibilities,  perhaps in the area of the Community's external policy, in the  next European Commission?    [Oreja] One of the customs hitherto observed in the  Commission is that a country does not repeat portfolios,  although there is no written rule. In any event, I feel very  content with the energy and transport portfolio, because it has  a content characteristic of the treaty's "heart."    [De Andres] During your predecessor's time in the post,  there was talk of a tacit "nonaggression pact" between Abel  Matutes and Spanish official policy. Your appointment to the  post of European commissioner has also required the support of  Felipe Gonzalez' government. Who will prevail? Marcelino Oreja  the diplomat or the Christian Democratic politician?    [Oreja] In the first place, I wish to point out that it is a  matter not of a policy of "nonaggression" but of a policy of  cooperation. In my opinion, irrespective of the still existing  ideological differences, there should be good cooperation  between the two Spanish citizens working in the Commission for  one fundamental reason -- in order to make known, when  necessary, the situation in one of the member states, which is  the one which we know best. I emphasize that this is not to the  detriment of our main task, which is safeguarding the European  interest.    [De Andres] Nevertheless, do you also intend to be  responsive to the Community interests outlined by Madrid?    [Oreja] There is an article in the treaty which is  categorical and which lays down that a commissioner can receive  no instruction from a government or from any other institution  or association. This does not prevent my having a good  relationship with the government and with all the Spanish social  and economic sectors, because the commissioner must make known  the situation in the state to which he belongs in the Community  executive's deliberations. In my case, both my political career  and my ideology -- which conforms to the principles of Christian  humanism -- are unequivocal, and I will never renounce what is  part of myself.    [De Andres] You have made several references to your role as  a communicator of the situation in Spain, whose image is not at  its best right now....    [Oreja] I would like to explain that the commissioner's role  is not to sell his country's image, this is the responsibility  of the minister or the ambassador. Everybody must know how to  play his role. In what I believe to be the defense of national  interests, insofar as they coincide with European interests --  and they should be able to do so -- I see no reason for not  performing the task well.    [De Andres] Do you see Spain in the third stage of Economic  and Monetary Union in 1997?    [Oreja] It seems very difficult to me at present. In fact,  it is also difficult to make forecasts right now. Two months  ago, I would have said that it was impossible that there could  be a sufficient "critical mass" of countries at the end of 1996  to open the way to monetary union. Right now, the fact is that  four new states are preparing to join the EU, and they will  probably meet the Maastricht criteria in inflation and the  public deficit. Today Spain is very far from achieving these  results, at least in some of the convergence criteria.    [De Andres] What consequences would this "uncoupling" from  the economies of the north have?    [Oreja] I believe that ensuring that the convergence process  continues is more important than whether monetary union occurs  in 1997 or 1999, and to this end appropriate economic policies  must be adopted. As long as there are countries which have  higher wage costs, energy costs, and fiscal and financial costs  than the other countries, this gap will be sustained for want of  the necessary competitiveness. The problem of competitiveness  does not mainly concern enterprises but rather the economic  policies mistakenly advocated by some European countries.    [De Andres] Together with the possible creation of the  single currency, another of the key tasks of the next European  Commission will be the cooperation with the 1996  intergovernmental conference, which is to establish the new  balances of power within the Community. How could Spain be left  politically after that occasion?    [Oreja] This is a very important matter for Europe's future,  and so there should be no improvisation. I believe that in 1996  it is necessary also to involve the Commission and the  Parliament, together with the personal representatives of the  heads of government. I understand that there could be different  rates of integration, provided that the final aim is for this to  affect all the member states.    [De Andres] What impact, in your opinion, will next month's  elections to the European Parliament have? Will they be just a  settling of scores over national issues?    [Oreja] I believe that the "European" impact of those  elections will be slight at the time that they are held, but  important in its consequences from 13 June onward, because it  makes a difference whether the future parliamentary majority is  Socialist or People's Party.</p>

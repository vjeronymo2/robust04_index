			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the information-gathering processes for agreements established by the Commission immediately after passage of the 1984 Act have served their purpose adequately, the increasingly comprehensive and complex agreements filed in recent years indicate a need for updating and augmentation. Agreements with multi- country geographic ranges are now common. New devices and arrangements for dealing with excess capacity have appeared. Rate discussion agreements between conference and nonconference lines have become more prevalent, and such arrangements have not been required to include the procompetitive provisions applicable to conferences. Networks of vessel and space charter agreements covering a multitude of trade lanes have been established, and some of those agreements operate within larger conference agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, some of the provisions of the current information form have not produced much useful information. It appears that these provisions either have become outdated or, with the benefit of hindsight, were not sufficiently relevant to the Commission's pre-implementation review of a new agreement under the standards of the 1984 Act. This is particularly true of Part VI, which concerns whether the agreement was entered into as a response to a law or other action by a foreign government, and Part VII, which allows the carriers to describe the expected benefits of the agreement if they wish. Further, the activity queries in Part II of the current form which, if answered in the affirmative, trigger the further requirements of Parts III, IV and VIII, do not reach rate discussion agreements between independent lines or between conference lines and independents, nor do they reach agreements to discuss costs or exchange cost information. These types of agreements do not directly authorize rate setting but nonetheless have a direct and substantial impact on rate competition, as discussed further below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the limitations of the current post-implementation reporting requirements, monitoring of effective agreements at present depends primarily on other reports that are not required by regulation, but rather must be negotiated as to content and frequency by the Commission's staff with the carrier parties during the initial review period. Such reports produce data bearing on the carriers' concerted practices and operating results, such as percentage of capacity being utilized by shippers and average gross revenue per twenty-foot-equivalent container unit (``TEU'') of cargo. Major agreements that currently are subject to negotiated reporting requirements include the Trans Atlantic Conference Agreement, the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement and the Inter-American Discussion Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obtaining data about the economic impact of effective agreements through  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad hoc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  negotiations during the initial review period has been a flawed procedure. Carrier representatives have shown good will and substantial cooperation, but both they and the Commission's staff are inevitably hampered by the 1984 Act's strict time limits for agreement processing. Once an agreement has gone into effect, the Commission can always issue an order under section 15 of the 1984 Act to obtain information from the member carriers, <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  but that power is better suited for special circumstances than for day-to-day regulation. In sum, neither the current practice of negotiating  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad hoc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reports nor the authority set forth in section 15 is an efficacious method of achieving consistent and predictable oversight of significant carrier agreements after they have gone into effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 15(a) states: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission may require any common carrier, or any officer, receiver, trustee, lessee, agent, or employee thereof, to file with it any periodical or special report or any account, record, rate, or charge, or memorandum of any facts and transactions appertaining to the business of that common carrier. The report, account, record, rate, charge, or memorandum shall be made under oath whenever the Commission so requires, and shall be furnished in the form and within the time prescribed by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46 U.S.C. app. 1714(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. The Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission addresses the concerns discussed above by proposing new regulations that are designed to elicit more detailed and specific information on ocean carrier agreements in a more structured and comprehensive manner. The proposed rule formulates a sliding scale of information demands for three classes of agreements, ``Class A,'' ``Class B'' and ``Class C.'' Where an agreement fits on the scale depends on the activities it authorizes and the parties' combined market share. These criteria are discussed further below. An agreement that does not authorize any of the specified activities would still be required by law to be filed with the Commission (unless it qualifies for one of the existing exemptions), but would not have any information form or reporting obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The draft section 241 would have permitted the Revenue to gain permission for a raid from someone authorised by one of its board members. There would have been no automatic right for the accountant to appeal against this power. It specified that a belief that a tax accountant knew a tax return of a client was incorrect would be sufficient to justify a raid to gain access to papers. This substantially enhanced the Revenue's ability to gain access to accountants' records. The position was modified in guidance notes issued by the Revenue last week, which said that a board member would have to approve the raid, and that the accountant would be able to appeal. Mr Peter Wyman, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'If the Revenue needs additional powers they should have them, but there must be a way to provide adequate safeguards.'</p>

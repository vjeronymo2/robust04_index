			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Time for a defence review This week, amid the familiar clamour about base closures and job losses, the government will present what at first sight will look like welcome news. In unveiling a new round of defence cuts it will claim, in effect, that Britain's armed forces are to carry on doing exactly the same job at greatly reduced cost to the taxpayer. If this strategy were sustainable, it would indeed be welcome. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that it is not: that in being asked to pursue a fixed set of tasks in ever more economical ways, the forces are being stretched too thin. In the process, the fundamental question - whether straitened circumstances dictate reordered priorities - is left unanswered. After this week's cuts, the forces will still be shouldering three 'defence roles': to protect Britain and dependent territories; to insure against threats to Britain or its allies; and to help maintain international peace and stability. Although the government now discloses the number of forces nominally assigned to each role, it has never explained in detail what it understands by these tasks. The government has its reasons for shying away from a full-blown defence review. One is that it dare not further alienate constituents by adding the insult of a confusing new defence philosophy to the injury of reduced military spending. Another is the unpredictability of the subject. Nobody can forecast how long, and on what scale, the US will be prepared to commit money and men to the defence of Europe. Nobody can tell where Russia's new assertiveness in Europe will lead; or which extremist regime will be the next to acquire ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction. Respond flexibly Yet this very uncertainty should be a spur to think harder about how Britain can, within the limits of its budget, enhance its capacity to respond flexibly and rapidly to potential threats. The geopolitical challenges faced by France and Germany are no less complex than those confronting Britain; yet both those countries have published wide-ranging white papers on defence this year. Britain eschews such a theoretical approach, preferring to focus on practical experience: its involvement in Bosnia, for example, which has highlighted some basic vulnerabilities as well as strengths. Although the UK contingent has played a crucial role in saving Bosnian lives and  - so far - in preventing the conflict from spreading, its deployment has stretched Britain's forces to the limit. In some new international crisis requiring the despatch of another multinational peace-keeping force, it seems unlikely that Britain would have the spare capacity to help. Searching questions That is one important reason why the government needs now to undertake a fundamental review of defence policy. Such a review should be completed before 1996, when the European Union is due to consider common security policies as part of its next inter-governmental conference. And it should ask searching questions about the potential threats facing Britain and the resources available to deal with them. How best can Britain contribute to multinational peace-keeping coalitions, and what does this imply in particular for future levels of land and sea forces? Is there scope for further cuts in the army's permanent strength in Germany, without sacrificing the advantages derived from frequent training and exercising with allies? Is the cost of defending Britain's remaining dependent territories justified by any strategic advantage or overriding moral commitment? How useful is Britain's submarine-based nuclear deterrent, and how does this compare with, say, the case for anti-missile defences? Perhaps above all, with the US pressing Europe to develop greater self sufficiency in defence and encouraging Germany to play a leading role, which aspects of the US-UK relationship can be sustained indefinitely? These are, of course, all issues of the utmost sensitivity in British politics - and the picture is complicated further by Britain's need to maintain a substantial presence in northern Ireland. But that is no excuse for continuing to sweep debate under the rug. In the end, such a review might make it easier, not harder, to muster political support for the necessary changes in spending priorities.</p>

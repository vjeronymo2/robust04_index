			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / EC drops commitment to mandatory works councils A SENIOR European Commission official indicated yesterday that Brussels was no longer committed to legislation forcing companies to set up works councils. Dr Hermanus van Zonneveld, head of working conditions and labour law in the commission's social affairs directorate, said he thought progress could best be achieved by voluntary agreements. Speaking to the annual conference of the Institute of Personnel Management in Harrogate, he said: 'A settlement between the two sides of industry can better take into account the many specific situations of companies with quite often complex structures than a piece of legislation coming from the Commission civil servants.' The shift in the Commission's strategy brings Brussels closer to the UK government, which has consistently opposed European legislation to set up works councils, the company-based consultation forums for employers and employees. Dr van Zonneveld hinted that the voluntary agreements would cover Britain because they would avoid the need for a vote under the social chapter of the Treaty of Maastricht, which the UK has not signed. He told the conference that many employers recognised the importance of employee involvement, especially in the recession. About 20 European companies had established structures for information and consultation procedures, and voluntary labour management councils were widespread in Japanese companies, where they played an 'important role'. He said that member states had failed to agree legislation after more than 20 years of negotiations. The latest legislation proposed by the commission last year can be adopted only if the 12 agree. It is opposed by one government and two others have reservations.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / NatWest to correct erroneous accounts NATIONAL Westminster Bank last night said it had made a mistake in accounts it had filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and would have to reissue them. The original accounts had shown that Britain's second biggest bank was having far worse difficulties in collecting mortgage payments than any other UK bank. Brokers said yesterday that a fall of almost 10 per cent in the bank's share price last week was partly the result of these apparent loan problems. But last night, Mr Ray Cottle, NatWest's chief accountant, said the problem loans in the accounts had been overstated by Pounds 300m, adding: 'It's an absolute cock-up.' He said there had been 'double-counting'. He plans to reissue the accounts, showing that the deterioration in the mortgage book has been in fact far less severe. The accounts were filed with the SEC, regulator of the US securities industry, on August 11. They indicated a dramatic rise in the number of loans on which interest was overdue. They showed that at June 30 the bank had Pounds 1.1bn of loans on its balance sheet whose interest payments were more than 90 days overdue. This compared with Pounds 513m at the end of last December. A doubling in this category of problem loans suggested NatWest was trapped in an appalling spiral of rising bad debts. But the matter seemed to be even more serious, because the loans in trouble appeared to be almost entirely mortgages. Up to now, mortgages have been the one category of loan on which the banks have suffered relatively small losses. In a note to the accounts, NatWest said the deterioration was 'substantially attributable to National Westminster Home Loans, reflecting the impact of the recession on the UK economy'. UK stockbroking analysts last week obtained copies of the accounts. After spotting the apparent deterioration in the loan book, some of them became alarmed that NatWest would continue to suffer from a far higher level of bad debts than they had thought. This pessimism was in part responsible for the fall in NatWest's share price during the week of almost 10 per cent, from 323p to 294p. Mr Richard Rushton, deputy managing director of NatWest Homeloans, yesterday said he had been puzzled by the US accounts. There had been an increase of 25 per cent in mortgages on which interest was more than 90 days overdue to around Pounds 500m - which was worse than some of the bank's rivals - but far less than suggested in the US accounts. So yesterday afternoon the bank asked Mr Cottle to recalculate the numbers. Last night he was remorseful. 'I apologise for putting out an erroneous note.' He said that the figure for loans on which interest was overdue had been overstated by approximately Pounds 300m. He believes the correct figure for 30 June will turn out to be Pounds 792m. When he is absolutely sure, he will send a correction to the SEC. Swiss police start hunt for Lloyds Bank employee, Page 8</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Sport: Power but not enough glory - Rugby Union / Under Dudley Wood England has grown rich. He tells Derek Wyatt his plans Dudley Wood is a big lad. He needs to be. As secretary of the Rugby Football Union, he sits on a rugby throne whose power and wealth has swelled in the seven years that he has occupied it. Since 1986, the Rugby Union's business has grown from Pounds 5m to nearer Pounds 45m; the staff from 50 to more than 100. It owned the Twickenham ground, an assortment of allotments, better known as car parks, and 26 houses nearby, now it has a rebuilt stadium and a second ground complete with hotel in Wolverhampton. You have to pinch yourself to remember that all this has happened while the economy has been in reverse. This increased financial strength has made England the dominant nation in the talking-shop which some refer to as the Four Home Unions committee. But on the field progress has stalled. The All Blacks triumphal progress round Britain suggests that this afternoon's international will provide another demonstration of the gap between England and the top nations in the southern hemisphere. Wood is using his muscle to persuade the other home unions to accept changes which serve England's aspirations rather than their own interests. Wood plans changes to club rugby in Europe, in the way tours are handled and in the five nations championship and the distribution of the television revenue it generates. 'In future we will be looking to develop a Test series against an incoming country like Australia. I suspect this would be two Tests. it would be nice to think that we could hold one in the north and one at Twickenham. We had the South Africans at Elland Road (Leeds United's ground) last year and this year the crowds at Anfield (in Liverpool) and Gateshead for the New Zealanders suggest there is a large audience for our game,' said Wood. The reality is that with Pounds 28m raised to complete the north and east stands at Twickenham - the latter is opened today - and the west stand due for rebuilding starting in May,a two Test series would have to be played entirely at Twickenham in the immediate future to maximise income. Whether English rugby remains fashionable depends on how the team fares in the world cup, due to be held in South Africa in 12 games', or 19 months', time. Certainly, England's club structure, though heaving under the strain of home and away Courage league fixtures, is vibrant and the envy of all, save the French. The Welsh, whose domestic league is sponsored by Heineken beer, want to improve competition for their top clubs and have urged the creation an Anglo-Welsh league. Woods said: 'There is no urgency to establish an Anglo-Welsh league. The home and away fixtures must stay for one more season, so we can best see how to adjust the numbers in the top three divisions. There's no flexibility at present and if we had a bad winter I'm not sure how we would fit in those matches cancelled. 'The four English clubs who met their Welsh counterparts the other day did telephone me to tell me what they were doing. Of course, we understand that these fixtures were and are important to them and add extra spice and revenue. It is probably true too that at the moment the Welsh clubs need the English clubs more than we need them. We have sponsorship deals to honour - in Courage's case we've another three and a half seasons to go - and we won't be dictated to by other sponsors. 'Adding more to the time-table would impact on the Five Nations which we have been trying to push back towards the end of the season but we cannot convince the French who do not wish to move their club competition. I'm not sure we can expand it either. Romania is not the strength it was and our B team has comprehensively beaten Italy and Spain so they must wait. America is struggling and only Canada would be worth considering and two leagues of five probably wouldn't work.' The Five Nations Championships is the envy of all other sports. No-one in their right minds would tamper with it, except . . . except . . . the tournament is not serving the aspirations of French or English rugby. The quality of the play in the five nations has fallen. The standards set by Australia in the Parc des Princes three weeks ago against France and the power of the All Blacks showed last Saturday against an embarrassingly weak Scotland team, showed that it has become too inward looking. While New Zealand has its sights on the World Cup in 1995, England has its sights on the Five Nations and the World Cup. To some extent the Five Nations is now an irritant in the preparation of the squad. Yet, it is the proverbial jewel in the crown where television is concerned even though the existing contracts are confused. In France, the broadcaster Antenne 2 owns the rights for France's championship home games until 1995. The BBC owns the rights to games in the UK until 1994. Another UK broadcaster - Sky or ITV - could buy the rights to the French games from Antenne 2 and put any new UK deal in jeopardy. Ireland's state broadcaster RTE could do a similar deal. There is nothing to stop them. The Four Home Unions television sub-committee has not kept abreast of developments in the European media and is still trying to formulate a contract to put out to tender. Wood conceded as much: 'It has been a tricky series of negotiations between the four home unions and about what we want to put in the tender. We are aware of the holes that exist.' In the past the four home unions have divided the cake into equal parts and though Wood would not commit himself it is apparent that this will no longer be the case. England, with the largest rugby population, will receive more than the others, possibly as much as 40 per cent of the total. The senior clubs, who want to negotiate their own television contract, shot themselves in the foot a few weeks back. Racing at Ascot was called off and BBC television offered to take the second half of the Wasps v Bath game live for Pounds 15,000. The senior clubs refused, fearing it would harm their gates that afternoon. Televising it would have given them some idea of the pull of the leagues and some reaction from their sponsors. It is sometimes easy to forget that all these developments have come about because of the 15 England players who will try to stem the All Black tide this afternoon. It is they who have created the increasing demand for the game. Their development is being held up by the parochialism of the home unions. If they had their way, I believe, they would want England to plot its own future independent of the other three home countries.</p>

Khudoley; place and date  not given; published under the rubric "Interview at the End of  the Year": "The Market Breaks Down Stereotypes"]    [Text]    [Khudoley] If you do not object, Vitalie Vasilyevich, let us  begin our discussion with the results of the agricultural year.  After all, no matter what happens, the food complex is the  sphere of material production in whose situation everyone  without exception is interested. The more so during our  difficult and complicated times, and on the threshold of winter  at that.    True, reports and comments about this appear in the mass  media from time to time. But these have all been fragmentary,  scattered information, although even from this it is clear that  the preliminary prognosis was not fully justified. Is this true?  Our readers would like to know about this, as it were, first  hand....    [Gorincioi] Indeed, there were quite a few optimistic  predictions during the spring and summer. But most frequently  they did not come from agrarians and certainly not from our  ministry. Both traditional peasant customs and the  unpredictability of production out under the open sky make it  impossible for a serious agrarian to give out easy promises. So  there is no need to ascribe others' sins to us, we have enough  of our own.    If there is something for which many of us can be  reproached,  it is the habit of looking for reasons why the results promised  by the politicians were not achieved. Most often we blame the  unkindness of nature. In this case that would not be altogether  true. Of course, in the spring there are always strong rains  that wash away part of the planted areas, and during the  summer--hail in the first half and drought in the second. But on  the whole the year was not that bad. Especially for the good  farms.    The problems were on a different plane. Above all there was  the poor supply of fuel, mineral fertilizers, means of plant  protection, and containers.    But, I repeat, looking at the larger picture, the year was  favorable. And the results were generally not bad. Take just the  indicators of the first grain harvesting. More than 42 quintals  of high-quality wheat grain per hectare--Moldova has never had  such a yield before. And it was on a larger area than usual.    According to preliminary calculations, the gross grain yield  from all categories of farms, that is, including private, will  be about 3 million tonnes.    Will this be sufficient or not? Of course, having learned  from last year's bitter experience when because of the drought  the livestock experienced a critical shortage of manufactured  feed concentrates during wintering, many owners have been  storing up grain. Nonetheless, more than 400,000 tonnes have  been sold to the state. State procurements would probably have  been greater if the banks had been able to allot sufficient  credit resources.    But the main thing is that the population has bread to eat.  Thus the kolkhoz and sovkhoz workers alone have been issued  about a million tonnes of grain in the form of in-kind payments  and preferential sales. In many villages, particularly in  Drokiyevskiy Rayon, agricultural enterprises have extended this  benefit to pensioners, teachers, and medical workers as well.    But although grain may be on everybody's mind, man needs  many  other things as well. For instance, the peasants have tried to  give the food industry all the raw material it needed. In spite  of the fact that, as I have already said, the rains eroded a  considerable area planted in sugar beets, the productivity of  this crop is fairly high. The quantity of sugar beets processed  this season will be 1.8 million tonnes. This means that the  output of sugar will reach 210,000-215,000 tonnes. Half of this  what they call strategic product will be taken into state  resources. It is intended for sale to the population at fixed  prices and also for hospitals and other closed institutions.    As for other agricultural crops, the results have varied  here  too. For sunflower seeds, say, the indicator is mediocre. In any  case the yield was lower than was expected in the spring and the  beginning of the summer. Nonetheless we managed to grow them and  harvest 185,000 tonnes of this oil-bearing raw material.    True, the agricultural enterprises have had to keep most of  these agricultural products, since the processors do not have  the credit resources to buy them.    Incidentally, it is only in our country that until recently  the state has tried to buy up all the agricultural products from  the farmers all at once and at any price. And procurement prices  for them have been established at the very beginning of the  harvest. Experts from the International Monetary Fund and other  European organizations do not conceal their surprise at this.    Incidentally, at first glance such a procurement system  seems  advantageous to the agricultural enterprises since they can  immediately obtain large sums of money. But in reality, under  conditions of inflation and late settlements, the agricultural  enterprises only stand to lose. There is no doubt that today it  is more expedient to have stage-by-stage sale of products in  batches with the corresponding price regulation. For instance,  for sunflower seeds the sizes of the procured batches are  determined by the monthly productivity of the processing  enterprises.    With such a system of credit resources in the first stage it  was necessary to purchase only 35,000 tonnes of raw material,  and the rest of the batches of it were acquired with earnings  from the sale of the oil.    This summer the farmers' concern about difficulties with the  harvest and the sale of the fruit and vegetable crops has  frequently shown through in the newspapers. True, the gross  yield of these products is not a record, but there have indeed  been additional problems with them.    It would seem that the demand for fresh fruits should  increase. Because perhaps for the first time Moldovan orchard  growers have managed to obtain an intensive type of almost  ecologically pure fruits in their planted areas.    Nonetheless, there were frequent cases where our traditional  customers refused our fruit last year. Incidentally, more and  more frequently the suppliers themselves have been forced to  reject partnership with nearby foreign countries. The main  reason is the excessively high rates for rail transportation: It  costs one-half to one-third as much to buy a kilogram of apples  as it does to ship them to the Urals. And so it has turned out  that of the 750,000 tonnes of fruit that were harvested, less  than one-third was delivered fresh, and the rest of it was  processed at our own enterprises.    Of course, this is not the best solution, but there simply  was no other. True, the demand for dried fruits was good, but  they are an even more energy-intensive product than the  preserves and compotes. Since the beginning of the year canners  have produced more than 1 billion conventional containers of  products, and by the end of December the output will exceed  20-25 percent of the level of any past year.    And this is under conditions with an extremely critical  shortage of energy and material resources. After all, not all  the banks followed precisely the parliament's decree on granting  credit to agricultural enterprises for acquiring containers, and  the canning plants--for buying glass jars, lids, and so forth.    Grape and tobacco growers were counting on hefty incomes  this  year. But industry was able to accept from grape growers only  half a million tonnes of their products. The rest--about 200,000  tonnes--was sold to the population or turned over for processing  to be returned to the suppliers later, thus partially  eliminating the immense interest on credit. Incidentally, grape  growers cannot count on anything even for the raw material that  has been shipped: So far the agricultural enterprises have been  paid only 15 million lei. They are promising to repay their debt  of 45 million as they receive their earnings from the wine that  is sold.    The shortage of credit resources drove the tobacco growers  into a corner as well. Agricultural enterprises grew about  50,000 tonnes of dried leaves and are gradually selling them,  but the specialized association is first paying for 15,000  tonnes for the tobacco combine and then 10,000 tonnes to be  exchanged for grades that are in short supply for cigarette  production. The rest of the raw material is being processed, and  as customers are found, the money is returned to the farms.    [Khudoley] So even in the autumn the agricultural  enterprises, leaseholders, and farmers did not get especially  rich.    [Gorincioi] If you keep in mind that under current  conditions  settlements for raw material are made not in advance but as the  final products are sold, of course, immense one-time receipts of  money into the accounts of the farms are not to be anticipated.  But still the deficit of credit resources has ultimately worked  to their advantage. If the old practice continues, neither the  agro-industrial complex nor, above all, the processing branch  will ever be able to get out of debt to the banks, with their  enormous interest rates on credit which erode incomes and make  products more costly. It is important to get away from  intermediate credit at any price. With the creation on the basis  of the processing enterprises of joint-stock companies involving  the participation of agricultural enterprises, one must assume  that this need will fall away. But the situation requires that  we reduce the use of bank credit to a minimum even today.    Understandably, it is difficult to break old traditions,  including the procurement mechanism that has been established,  but there is no other way. What kind of effectiveness can there  be if, for example, the agricultural enterprises ship grain to  the elevators during July-August and are not paid for it until  the beginning of November!    And such delays have become a part of the system. So it is  better to switch to stage-by-stage procurements with revised  prices for raw material.    To a certain extent the mechanism for procuring animal  husbandry products is like this, and the ministry is making sure  that it is strictly observed. In a number of cases it has even  been necessary to resort to such a measure as suspending the  issuance of wages to those processing enterprises that do not  pay for their raw material for a long time.    It seems that in time the contractual-financial discipline  of  the partners will straighten out. But the situation is indeed  critical within the animal husbandry branch itself. It has set  the goal of producing 800,000 tonnes of milk per year, but from  all appearances it will produce no more than half a million. The  public sector of agriculture will produce 120,000-130,000 tonnes  of meat instead of the earmarked 200,000. True, taking private  farms into account, there will be more of these products. After  all, the overall number of head of livestock in the republic has  not decreased.    The reasons for the decline are known. Above all, last  year's  drought took its toll, leaving many farms on a starvation  ration. And large complexes were left to the will of fate by  farm-shareholders after the administrative-command system, which  sustained them during difficult periods, collapsed.    One must assume that these complexes could have adapted to  market conditions as well were it not for all kinds of  restrictions. In particular, holding down the prices of animal  husbandry products did not work to the advantage either of the  branch or of the consumers. Regardless of how high they may have  been against the background of the low buying power of the  majority of the population, expenditures of agricultural  enterprises are still not being covered, and there is nothing  with which to compensate for the state overexpenditure.    And yet one must keep in mind that the agro-industrial  complex, above all animal husbandry, is not working solely for  the domestic market. Meat, powdered milk, butter, and so forth  are practically the most marketable goods for which we can  obtain the energy resources we need so much. For this reason  alone we must produce them even at a loss to ourselves.    [Khudoley] Judging from the reports from agricultural  enterprises, perhaps this is the first time so many of them have  kept up with the fall complex of field work....    [Gorincioi] It would be more correct to say this: We are  speaking for the first time about the adversities suffered by  the peasants. We said nothing when the sugar beets were  delivered to the plants several months after they had shut down,  when the corn was processed in the fields, when thousands of  hectares of vineyards with unharvested grapes were covered with  snow, or when areas planted in tomatoes and table beets were  left to freeze.    Unfortunately, we have not managed to avoid losses now  either. About 1,400 hectares of sugar beets and almost 3,000  hectares of corn suffered from severe frosts. But if there is  hope of saving these products (in particular, the harvesting of  corn has not ceased for a single hour), it is impossible to save  frozen fruits. The only thing they might be used for is jam.    But the most alarming thing is that 200,000 hectares of land  on agricultural enterprises and about 80,000 hectares turned  over to private possession of the peasants under Article 82 of  the Land Code went unplowed. There are also farmstead plots that  need to be plowed.    This happened because initially there was no fuel or  lubricants, and then severe frosts struck unexpectedly at the  beginning of November.    Now the fuel necessary to complete the plowing has been  shipped in. There is also technical equipment. If there are  "windows of time in winter" (and they are not a rarity in our  region), we will be able to finish this work in 10-15 days. In  any case, that is what the machine operators think. For, be that  as it may, land plowed poorly in the fall is better than land  plowed well in the spring.    It is especially important to do this work more quickly in  the southern zone, where there are frequent dry winds in the  spring and the only way of counteracting them is to plant in  such a way that the plants have already developed roots and  become strong by this time.    [Khudoley] Is it not too early for the state to abandon its  concern about resource support for the farms? Does the ministry  have an effective alternative that would make it possible to  ensure their normal functioning? Or does everyone have to fend  for himself?    [Gorincioi] Indeed, when encountering the shortages and the  high cost of fuel on the market, many agrarians more and more  frequently ask the question: What next? If the fuel problem is  exacerbated so much, will there be a need for technical  equipment, which becomes more difficult to restore each season?  Is there any point in expending so much money and food in order  to start running hundreds of thousands of motors in the fields,  farms, and orchards?    If anyone is interested in my opinion, it is simple. If a  person assumes that today it is possible to work the land  without machine technology, he is deeply deluded. That would  mean failure. Of course, it is useful to keep horses and oxen.  But you will not plow very quickly or very well with this kind  of power, and in general you will not receive a good harvest.    Therefore it is necessary to look in a different direction  for a way out of the crisis--namely in modern technologies and  the latest achievements of scientific and technical progress. On  each agricultural enterprise and in the republic as a whole we  must decide right now what we will do next year. Which structure  of the planted areas will be most expedient? What should we grow  in order both to satisfy the domestic market and to earn good  money by selling products abroad? Even today we must know  precisely what to sell and where and how to sell it.    Incidentally, we must spend intelligently as well. As for  the  major expenditure item, it is energy sources, as usual. They  cost Moldova almost $600 million, and the agro-industrial  complex can and does provide the lion's share of these funds.    But still, it is time to utilize these resources efficiently  and move from slogans about economizing to practice. I have in  mind not only guarantees against all kinds of losses but also a  combination, especially on small farms, of modern machines and  mini-equipment and horses. In many operations it is impossible  to do without manual labor. But on most of the areas we must  continue to rely on mechanization, chemization, and land  reclamation.    [Khudoley] What is your assessment of the agrarian reform in  Moldova? How accurate are the suggestions from experts of the  European Community regarding the mechanism for economic reforms  in your branch?    [Gorincioi] Reforms in agroeconomics are not simply  mechanical redistribution of the land. Their meaning lies in  completely different relations between the sphere of production  of raw material and the sphere of its processing, between the  producer and the state. Completely different relations are  required today within the former kolkhozes and sovkhozes as well.    In a word, the purpose of the reforms is by no means to  divide up collective or state wealth and drag it off into our  own little corn bins and then rejoice in such "innovation." We  need a reform that will provide for increased production and  high labor compensation. And it is possible to interest the  peasant in efficient management only if he feels that he is  working for himself.    That is, as it were, the internal side of the reforms that  are taking place. But today it is apparently not without reason  that we are asked this question: "What are you doing in order to  enter a qualitatively different orbit of relations with the  West?" For now we must admit that only the first steps are being  taken on this plane. They come to us from there with one goal in  mind--to earn more. And they will really cooperate with us when  they see us as equal partners with good intentions and good  potential.    But there has been a breakthrough in the creation of joint  ventures. In particular, in the sphere of meat production and  processing, where there will be an entire group of these  productions with the participation of American capital. One of  them is already being formed in Oknitskiy Rayon. A protocol of  intentions has been signed. In grape growing and wine making,  common interests with Dutch, British, German, and other firms  have been discovered. There are proposals for joint production  and processing of tobacco from an Australian firm, but its  conditions (it demands 51 percent of the authorized capital for  itself) do not suit us. We are working on the question of  building a glass bottle plant which will be financed both by  enterprises of the republic and foreign banks. This plant is  extremely necessary. But when accepting assistance we must  remember that it will be necessary to pay for it....    Incidentally, the special demand of producers of energy  sources for animal husbandry products forces agricultural  enterprises and organs of local self-government to revise their  attitude toward complexes.    People can say to me that this initiative must come from the  ministry or even from the government. But most frequently that  is what happens; we are convinced of this by the special-purpose  allotment of preferential credit and taxation, the writing off  of debts on credit, subsidies, etc. It is another matter,  apparently, that we should not disperse this assistance but  concentrate it in the leading areas and positions. If only to  provide goods for the domestic food market.    And in general the initially forced reduction of subsidies  and compensations for agriculture brought about by the state  budget deficit is also exerting a positive influence. People are  gradually breaking the habit of placing their hopes in the state  and learning to manage efficiently themselves, taking their  capabilities and reserves into account. In a word--doing what a  market economy requires. All the plans for technical assistance  developed by experts from the European Community are aimed at  reforms that provide for a transition to the market. They have  now begun to be implemented and this is sensitively reflected in  the standard of living of the underprivileged.    In order to weaken the negative consequences, the government  is trying to take advantage of every opportunity to strengthen  the social protection of the underprivileged segments of the  population. Precisely because the reforms affect these  categories of citizens first of all, the government is forced to  be extremely cautious in implementing them.    Throughout this winter (during the summer and autumn the  peasants were not up to reorganizing) we suggest taking the  fundamental measures of agrarian reform. We have already begun  to transform the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that wish to create  independent peasant farms. We are also prepared to integrate the  production of raw material with processing in joint-stock  companies.    Under modern conditions the ministry's role has also changed  from what it was when it mainly distributed funds. We see our  task in implementing the corresponding section of the government  program for bringing the economy out of its crisis.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: WWF urges Gatt to take benign view Efforts to make the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade more responsive to environmental concerns risk being held up by unwarranted fears over 'green protectionism', the World Wide Fund for Nature says in a report released today, writes Frances Williams from Geneva. The WWF says Gatt rules already provide safeguards against green protectionism, which it defines as trade restrictions which in practice bring no environmental benefit. However, it wants Gatt to take a more benign view of so-called trade-related environmental measures which harness trade restrictions to environmental goals.</p>

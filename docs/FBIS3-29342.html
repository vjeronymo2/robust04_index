			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan says Asia has  a vested interest in seeing the United States resolve its trade  differences with Japan. Tensions between the two economic  powers have heightened, with the United States now threatening  to impose sanctions in 30 days unless Japan acts to allow U.S.  access to its cellular telephone market. Senator McMullan says  there is still time for the two countries to sort out their  differences amicably. Over the past few days, Australia has  maintained its stance of not taking sides in the dispute.  Camille Fennell asked the trade minister why Australia was  adopting such a stance:    [Begin recording] [McMullan] Well, we are saying very  forthrightly that we are opposed to the idea of managed trade,  but there is no reason for us to take sides. We strongly have  the view that Japan should open its markets and we also strongly  have the view that they should not be opened in a discriminatory  way -- in a way that discriminates against Australia's interests  -- and we are making representations on both those matters to  Tokyo and to Washington, and we will continue to do so.    [Fennell] Well, I understand you have had our ambassadors in  Washington and Tokyo both assessing Australia's point of view.    [McMullan] That's right.    [Fennell] It appears you haven't had much of a hearing in  Washington. What has been the reception in Japan?    [McMullan] Well, it is not so much that we haven't had a  hearing. I mean, there we are just one voice in the  international community. We should not overestimate our  influence. It is important that our ambassadors express our  views and that we express it forthrightly, because we've got an  interest in this matter. But we should not get carried away and  say just because the Australian ambassador to the United States  expresses a view, or the Australian Government does, that the  U.S. and Japan are going to sit bolt upright and say wow, I  never thought of that, and change their position. We are  seeking to add our voice to the other voices who are saying it  is in the international interest -- it is in the self-interest  of the U.S. and Japan -- that this matter is resolved amicably,  fairly, and in a way that does not particularly inhibit the  economic growth in Japan, because their economic recovery is  very important to the whole world. But we also know the U.S.  economy is looking stronger, but we don't want to see any  inhibition to its recovery either, but it is not the one that is  particularly vulnerable at the moment.    [Fennell] Well, some commentators have suggested that the  United States is taking unfair advantage of Japan at the moment,  considering it is in its worst recession since World War II. Is  there any merit in that?    [McMullan] Well, I don't think they are being motivated by  that, but I do think that all of us -- the United States  included -- have to be sensitive to the impact of any events --  any actions we might take -- on the nascent Japanese recovery,  because the demand for American goods, as for Australians, is  significantly influenced by how well the Japanese economy does.  So it is quite clearly contrary to the self-interests of the  United States to impede the Japanese recovery, because we want  them to be importing our products; the Americans want them to be  importing American products. The balance of the trade deficit  won't change if the Japanese economy doesn't have the strength  to import American products. [end recording]</p>

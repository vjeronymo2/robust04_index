			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says he  believes that China does not think North Korea has developed the  capability to build nuclear weapons. Speaking in Beijing after  meetings with senior Chinese officials, Senator Evans said China  was very conscious of the stakes involved and very conscious of  its own interests in keeping nuclear weapons off the Korean  peninsula. He said Chinese ministers and leaders had a  relatively relaxed attitude to the issue, leading him to think  that the Chinese did not believe Pyongyang had yet made  formidable developments. However, Senator Evans said he  believed North Korea was certainly far enough advanced to  justify thorough international inspections. Australia's foreign  minister said there was great optimism on the Chinese part the  dialogue would be successful in resolving the Korean crisis.</p>

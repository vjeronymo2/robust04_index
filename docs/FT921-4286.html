			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Joint venture bank set up in the Ukraine AIOC, a New York-based commodity trader, has joined forces with four Ukrainian state enterprises and with Bank Mees &amp; Hope, the merchant banking division of ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, to form a joint venture bank in the Ukraine. The new bank, with initial capital of Dollars 20m, will be called First Ukrainian International Bank and will be run by an executive of Bank Mees &amp; Hope who will move from Amsterdam to Kiev. AIOC is the largest single shareholder, with more than 25 per cent of the bank, while Bank Mees &amp; Hope has less than 25 per cent. The remaining 50 per cent of the bank is owned by Promstrojbank, the state-owned bank, plus three Ukrainian state enterprises. Mr Alan Clingman, president and majority shareholder of AIOC, said the idea of forming a bank developed as he and other commodity traders found it difficult to do business in the Ukraine without any local institutions that had foreign exchange expertise.</p>

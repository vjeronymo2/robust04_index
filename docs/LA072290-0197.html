			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS  </P> <P> Lost Trees -- The fast-moving brush fire that scorched more than 6,500 acres  last weekend did much of its damage in Chino Hills State Park, starting near  one of the park's Orange County entrances (near Rim Crest Drive in Yorba Linda)  and burning northeast.  </P> <P> Most of the damage was to grass-covered hills, which will probably recover  within a few months.  </P> <P> However, some California walnut trees were lost in Telegraph Canyon, the park's  major east-west canyon, along with nearly all the trees in an adjoining side  canyon.  </P> <P> The park remains open, but park officials say it is more important than ever to  stay on trails. Traveling over the now-denuded hills, especially by bike or  horse, can lead to serious erosion problems.  </P> <P> Chino Hills State Park comprises more than 10,000 acres of undeveloped hills  and canyons covering portions of Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and  Riverside counties. The fire was started accidentally by a boy playing with a  model rocket.  </P> <P> Animal Jazz -- Santa Ana Zoo visitors can enjoy the sounds of live jazz today,  beginning at 4 p.m. The annual "Jazz at the Zoo" event features music by Rico  Garcia, Axiom and the John Anello Group, along with food from the Studio Cafe  in Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> The event is co-sponsored by Saddleback College's jazz station, KSBR (88.5 FM)  in Mission Viejo. Admission at the gate is $12 ($10 for members). Information:  (714) 953-8555.  </P></p>

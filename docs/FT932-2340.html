			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Prisa confirms plans for UK PRISA, the Spanish media group that owns the El Pais newspaper and SER, the leading domestic commercial radio station, confirmed that plans to lift its 18.3 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, the UK group which controls The Independent and The Independent on Sunday newspapers. The Spanish group reported consolidated profits last year of Pta5.1bn (Dollars 413m), 28.4 per cent up on 1991. Canal Plus, a pay television channel launched in 1990 that is 25 per cent Prisa owned, came close to breaking even last year and is forecast to add some Pta2bn to Prisa's consolidated balance sheet. Mr Juan Luis Cebrian, Prisa's chief executive, told shareholders he believed it was 'necessary to strengthen' the group's position in the British newspaper publishing company at a time when the UK appeared to be emerging from recession. Prisa, together with La Repubblica, the daily owned by Italy's L'Espresso group which also owns an 18.3 per cent stake in the UK publishing company, are jointly examining the possibility of raising their respective stakes in The Independent to just under 25 per cent. This would effectively give them a controlling say in the British newspaper. The two continental Europe groups entered Newspaper Publishing's equity in 1991 and their final decision on whether to press for an increased shareholding is expected shortly. Prisa and L'Espresso are also studying the creation of a French morning newspaper together with The Independent and Le Monde.</p>

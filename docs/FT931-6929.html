			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Canadian issues rally from Mulroney resignation fall THE Canadian dollar market yesterday remained a focus for international borrowers, as government bond prices bounced back from news of prime minister Brian Mulroney's resignation the day before. The Republic of Austria raised CDollars 300m through a 10-year issue, while Rabobank issued CDollars 125m of bonds over five years. Both deals reflect the good opportunities offered by the Canadian dollar swap market, allowing borrowers to switch to a floating-rate liability at an advantageous level. Austria's issue was thought to have equated to an all-in cost of around 25 basis points below Libor. Strong demand in Canada for fixed-rate mortgages explains the continuing opportunity for international borrowers to find attractive levels in the swap market. Canadian government bond prices advanced after the set-back on Wednesday, with the yield spread between the Canadian and US bond markets tightening from 142 basis points to 135 basis points. Austria's issue was said by banks involved in the transaction to have been aggressively priced, although some reported that the bonds had sold well regardless. The Rabobank issue was modelled closely on a CDollars 125m five-year issue brought earlier in the week for the City of Vienna. That was offered at a yield 47 basis points above government bonds, while Rabobank's bonds were launched with a yield spread of 45 basis points. Meanwhile, Royal Insurance became the latest UK insurer to come to the sterling bond market, raising Pounds 100m through a subordinated 10-year issue. It follows Confederation Life, which raised Pounds 100m through a similar 10-year transaction last month. Royal said the issue, which follows a Pounds 76m convertible at the end of last year, was intended to extend the maturity of its debt, a third of which now had a life of 10 years or more. The 175 basis point spread over gilts compared with a 150 basis point spread from Confederation Life. Royal said it had no need to borrow for a longer period, though observers pointed out that a long-dated issue would have added considerably to the company's borrowing costs. Bass, the UK brewer, raised Dollars 300m through an issue in the US domestic market. The 6 5/8 per cent notes, expected to be rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's, yield 63 basis points over comparable US Treasuries.</p>

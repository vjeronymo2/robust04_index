Perez Trevino has been municipal president of Ciudad Acuna,  Coahuila, a federal deputy and a leader of the Chamber of  Deputies in that state. He is an agronomist who graduated from  the University of Texas at Austin. The PARM candidate is a  nephew of General Jacinto Blas Trevino, the founder of the  political organization. Gen. Trevino left the ranks of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the 1950's due to  differences of opinion with the party's leadership to found a  new organization.    With the nomination of Perez Trevino, each of the nine  officially registered parties now have their own presidential  candidate with whom to go out on the campaign trail in search of  votes. At the same time, the announcement also put an end to  the intentions of several parties to run for the Mexican  presidency with a common candidate.    The other presidential candidates are: Luis Donaldo Colosio  of the PRI; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the National Action  Party; Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Party of the  Democratic Revolution; Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party; Marcela  Lombardo Otero of the Popular Socialist Party; Rafael Aguilar  Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction  Party; Pablo Emilio Madero of the National Opposition Union; and  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Mexican Green Ecologist Party.    A group of parties formed a coalition known as the National  Democratic Front in 1988, which nominated Cuauhtemoc Cardenas  Solorzano. This, in turn, made that year's elections the most  criticized in recent decades. Election legislation reforms made  it extremely difficult to create coalitions among political  parties, consequently, each party was forced to select their own  candidate for 1994.</p>

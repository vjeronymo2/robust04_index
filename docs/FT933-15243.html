			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Authority pension schemes win best returns LOCAL Authority Superann-uation Funds, the pension schemes of local authorities, earned significantly better returns on their assets in the year to March 31 than did other pension schemes. According to the WM Company, a performance measurement service, local authorities earned total returns on average of 24.5 per cent for that 12 month period compared with returns for the industry as a whole of 23.3 per cent. 'The difference has occurred due to the better UK equity stock selection of local authority funds,' WM Company said. Of the 20 top performing funds, 18 had better than average stock selection, while all of the bottom 20 funds had lower than average stock selection. Thus, policy or asset mix have proved less significant to a fund's performance than the manager's ability to pick stocks. The performance represents the best annual return for local authorities since the 1985-86 fiscal year. Among the funds, larger ones with assets of Pounds 500m or more outperformed the average in UK equities. The return of 26.8 per cent was better than in any other size band and has been a consistent feature of large funds with better returns over five and 10 years. However, the ability to outperform in UK equities is not reflected in total assets. The WM Company noted that the level of new money coming into local authority funds has fallen to its lowest level ever, partly reflecting the declining numbers of direct local authority employees.</p>

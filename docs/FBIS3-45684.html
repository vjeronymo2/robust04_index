Rita Suessmuth, president of Germany's Federal Assembly,  gave  a banquet here in honor of Qiao Shi, chairman of China's  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, who is  paying an official goodwill visit to Germany as Suessmuth's  guest.    In her speech, Suessmuth praised China's policy of reform  and  opening up, and the highly speeded growth of economies in Asian  countries including China as well as the improvement of people's  living standard.    She said Germany and China should boost ties not only in  economy, but also in culture, science and technology.    Qiao said the growth of friendly relations between the two  nations demonstrates again that countries differing in social  systems and ideologies are able to develop their long-term and  stable relations and cooperation so long as they strictly abide  by the principles of mutual respect, seeking common grounds  while reserving differences, non-interference in each other's  internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit    Qiao said since the Cold War and bipolar structure came to  an  end, some positive changes have taken place in international  relations. But the world is far from tranquility and the world  people are still facing the issues of peace and development.    He said China and Germany, as two important and influential  countries in the world, are respectively at an important period  of historical development.    Strengthening dialogues and expanding cooperation between  the  two countries will not only conform to the interests of the two  peoples, but also benefit the world peace, stability and  development, he said.    "I am deeply convinced that there exists a grand prospect  for  the development of Sino-German relations which are facing toward  the 21st century," Qiao added.</p>

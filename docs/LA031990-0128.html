			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YALE BRIDGES BURNING ISSUE IN IRVINE VOTE;  </P> <P> JUNE BALLOT: AFTER 12 YEARS OF DEBATE, VOTERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER TWO  PEDESTRIAN OVERPASSES WILL BE WIDENED TO ACCOMMODATE AUTOMOBILES. CITY  OFFICIALS' JOBS ARE ALSO ON THE LINE.  </P> <P> In a city that has recently approved a precedent-setting ban on chemical  pollutants, thoughtfully debated reallocation of national defense spending and  lobbied hard to build Orange County's first transportation monorail, a  startlingly mundane and parochial issue has moved to the center of this year's  municipal elections.  </P> <P> The Yale overpasses, two Yale Avenue pedestrian bridges proposed for widening  to allow vehicles to use them, have become the unlikely objects of Irvine  political machinations in recent months, raising tempers and setting the stage  for a climactic political showdown in June. After 12 years of rancorous debate,  voters finally will decide the fate of the bridges on the June 5 ballot.  </P> <P> Privately, many city officials -- including some bridge opponents -- believe  that the proposal to widen the bridges will pass, though most are cautious  about making predictions this early.  </P> <P> "The Yale overpasses are a very big issue in this community, and many people  feel that they've been wronged," said Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who  supports the proposal. "You're going to see plenty of action on this between  now and June."  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran, an opponent of the measure and Sheridan's rival in the  mayor's race, agrees, predicting that the issue -- along with the related topic  of neighborhood preservation -- will dominate much of the campaign debate, if  not its outcome.  </P> <P> The two proposed vehicular overpasses -- one over the San Diego Freeway, the  other over the Atchison, Topeka &amp; the Santa Fe Railroad tracks -- are  included in the city's General Plan, but the council voted in 1988 to study  amending the plan so the bridges would stay as pedestrian overpasses. Angered  by that vote, overpass proponents circulated petitions, which call for the  bridge widenings to remain in the General Plan, though only as two-lane roads  instead of four-lane ones.  </P> <P> The petition gathered 7,002 signatures, enough to force the council to put the  matter to a vote. In response, the council put a second bridge measure on the  ballot, allowing residents to reject widening altogether, rather than simply  choosing between two and four lanes.  </P> <P> The petitioners who forced the matter argue that wider bridges will alleviate  traffic on the city's main arteries by giving residents an alternative route  for short trips. Opponents retort that gains in convenience will come at the  expense of safety, particularly of children who use the pedestrian overpasses  to get to school.  </P> <P> Residents are sharply divided, and council meetings have become a regular forum  for furious debate. Opposing sides cannot even agree on the city's "impartial"  ballot analysis of the bridge proposal, and proponents are now threatening to  sue for a new one.  </P> <P> "It's become a very emotional issue, probably more of an emotional issue than  any that the city has faced in recent years," said Gary Vanderpol, treasurer of  Yale Action, the residents' group pressing for the bridges to be widened.  </P> <P> The bridges have been the object of debate since the late 1970s, and passions  flared so high in 1987 that nearly 1,000 residents packed the largest public  hearing in Irvine's history to debate the overpasses.  </P> <P> But despite years of deliberation, even the most basic details are in dispute:  Opponents say it will cost about $9 million to expand the bridges; supporters  put the figure at about half that. Opponents say the bridges will cause traffic  and pedestrian hazards; proponents maintain that traffic on other streets will  be alleviated and that accidents, injuries and pollution actually would  decrease.  </P> <P> What increases the stakes in the debate this time around is that residents will  cast their votes for mayor at the same time they settle the bridge dispute.  Most city political observers agree that the mayoral campaign's central issue  could be the bridges and all they have come to represent.  </P> <P> "This issue goes to the heart of defining what a neighborhood is all about,"  Agran said, citing questions such as traffic and safety. "These are issues that  have been swimming around for 10 years or more, and now they are coming to the  surface."  </P> <P> On the council, sentiment runs strongly against the overpasses. Agran is  vociferous in his opposition, and three of his colleagues share his position.  Sheridan is the lone exception, as she is on many issues.  </P> <P> "A lot of people counted on these bridges being built," she said. "Then, in the  last election, the mayor said he would take those bridges out of the General  Plan. That's made the other side very mad."  </P> <P> Sheridan, who refers to the council majority as "one vote and three echoes,"  predicts that the overpass issue could prove crucial to the outcome of the  mayor's race, though she added that many other questions separate her and Agran  as well.  </P> <P> As Yale overpass feuding has grown more intense, opponents of the two-lane  bridge proposal show signs of concern. Councilman Cameron Cosgrove, a bridge  opponent who is up for reelection, agreed with other council members when he  said he hopes that voters will resist the temptation to cast "single issue  ballots." Candidates, he and other council members stressed, embody a host of  positions beyond the Yale overpass question.  </P></p>

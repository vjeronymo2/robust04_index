			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan's Dangerous Nuclear Activities Must Be Called in </F> Question" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] in a recent communique issued over the  discovery of 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium at the Tokaimura  nuclear fuel-making plant reportedly said it did not call it in  question, claiming that the nuclear facilities of Japan "are  under a complete inspection."    This is an extremely unreasonable act of conniving at  Japan's  moves to become a nuclear power and encouraging them, which  fully reveals the double-standard policy and partiality of the  IAEA in the solution of the nuclear issue.    Who believes the claim of the agency that the nuclear  facilities of Japan "are under complete inspection"?    As much as 70 kg of plutonium has been accumulated and  concealed unreported in five years at a Japan's plant where the  agency's inspectors teams are said to be permanently stationed.  This fact itself clearly proves that there is a problem in the  inspection by the agency.    Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan  have been in operation for scores of years, it is crystal clear  that the recently discovered plutonium is a tiny part of the  whole amount of hidden plutonium.    World opinion is demanding a probe into the truth behind the  case out of the apprehension that a huge amount of plutonium  might be concealed in Japan and it probably has been diverted  to the production of nuclear weapons.    Nevertheless, the agency stated that it did not call the  case  of concealment in question. It is hardly understandable and it  gives rise to greater doubt about the inspection by the agency.    The unjustifiable attitude cannot be regarded otherwise than  a criminal act of defending the nuclear criminal who has been  caught red-handed while wantonly violating the publicly accepted  international law and, moreover, encouraging the nuclear  armament of Japan which is posing a grave threat to peace and  security on the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia.    The double-standard policy and partiality of the agency  which  calls in question the declared minimum amount of plutonium of  the DPRK extracted for the experimental purpose, magnifying it,  while conniving at the huge amount of unaccounted-for plutonium  of Japan the diversion of which is highly probable, only  undermine confidence of the international community in the  agency.    The agency must call in question the dangerous nuclear  activities of Japan and strictly observe the principle of  impartiality in its activities in compliance with the unbiased  public opinion.</p>

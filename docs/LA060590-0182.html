			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LENDL OPENS WIMBLEDON QUEST  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl started his quest for a Wimbledon title today by trouncing Neil  Borwick, 6-1, 6-1, in less than an hour in the second round of a warm-up  tournament at Beckenham.  </P> <P> Lendl, ranked No. 1 in the world, has made Wimbledon his top priority.  </P> <P> His two-month practice for the title that has always eluded him included  workouts with former Australian tennis greats Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe and  his personal coach, Tony Roche.  </P> <P> "I would like to win it, there's no secret about that," Lendl said. "It would  mean I achieved what I wanted to do."  </P> <P> Lendl even passed up the French Open, an event he's won three times, in his  desire for success on the manicured lawns of the All England Club.  </P> <P> "The French is something I've accomplished," said Lendl, noting the tournament  still holds great importance as a Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> "I wish there would be four weeks between these two and I could play both of  them."  </P></p>

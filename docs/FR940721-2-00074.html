App 2). The Task Force's charter was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 7, 1993 at 58 FR 3039. The Task Force was created to review all rules, policy statements, handbooks and technical assistance memoranda issued by the Department on the standards and obligations governing residency in public and assisted housing; and make recommendations in its final report to HUD and Congress for the establishment of reasonable criteria for occupancy, so that HUD could revise its standards, regulations, and guidelines to provide accurate and complete guidance to owners and managers of federally assisted housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preliminary report of the task force was made available by a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice published on August 31, 1993, at 58 FR 45905.

The issue of housing choice, along with many other concerns the Task Force addressed, is complicated by scarcity of resources. The Task Force therefore proposes a number of recommendations aimed specifically at funding and cost issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Chapter 1_The Application Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In preparing its report, the Occupancy Task Force decided that it would be more useful to begin by addressing the sequential tenancy process: the application process, occupancy and eviction. The first stage of this process, during which applicants are screened for eligibility and tenant selection criteria, is an extremely important one in that the applicants who are selected will become members of the resident community and those who are not selected will be denied the opportunity to live in federally assisted housing. Thus, the Task Force spent significant time considering the issues contained in the Application Process Chapter. In doing so, the Task Force balanced the rights of housing providers to choose residents who will fulfill their lease obligations and the rights of applicants to be chosen fairly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to including the Task Force's specific recommendations, Chapter One describes the application process from start to finish in order to provide a full context for the recommendations. In particular, the application process issues addressed by the Task Force include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

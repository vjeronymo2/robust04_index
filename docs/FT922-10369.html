			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Arnault lifted by Agache gain ARNAULT &amp; Associes, one of the quoted companies through which Mr Bernard Arnault, the chairman, controls the prestigious LVMH luxury goods group, saw its net profits in 1991 rise sharply to FFr582m (Dollars 104.3m) from FFr102m the previous year. The company has property interests in Paris as well as its stake in LVMH, - which markets such luxury brands as Louis Vuitton luggage and Moet et Chandon champagne. Arnault also has a stake in Agache, which controls the Au Bon Marche department stores and the Christian Lacroix fashion house. Earlier this week Agache announced an increase in net profits to FFr1.82bn from FFr230m the previous year. LVMH recently reported an 11 per cent rise in net income to FFr3.74bn from FFr3.37bn. The global luxury goods market had a difficult year in 1991 because of the instability caused by the Gulf war to the important duty-free sector in the first quarter and the deterioration in economic conditions during the rest of the year. Arnault's overall turnover slipped from FFr30.39bn to FFr29.28bn last year partly because of the competitive trading climate and partly because Agache had ceded control of the Conforama chain of furniture stores to the Pinault industrial group half way through the year. The Conforama deal contributed to an increase in exceptional profits to FFr1.55bn against FFr118m. Arnault has decided to double its dividend from FFr1.75 in 1990 to FFr3.5 a share in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Kudos to KNBC for its excellent coverage of the opening of the Richard M. Nixon  Library in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> My health prevented me from attending in person, but thanks to Channel 4, I was  still able to enjoy the ceremonies.  </P> <P> This was a historic event regardless of how a person feels about the former  President. The four Presidents together (Nixon, George Bush, Ronald Reagan,  Gerald Ford) made quite a picture, as did their First Ladies. Thanks again,  KNBC. I think you've won a new viewer of your news.  </P> <P> Brenda Hester, Garden Grove  </P></p>

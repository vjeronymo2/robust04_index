			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pearson beats forecasts with Pounds 151m PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group which owns the Financial Times, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 150.8m for 1992, a fall of 16 per cent, but significantly better than forecasts which ranged as low as Pounds 134m. The result, coupled with a proposed increase in the final dividend to 6.625p (6.25p) for a total of 12p (11.625p), boosted the Pearson share price which closed up 27p at 404p. Earnings per share were 19.3p (24.7p). Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive, said that despite lower profits the company was starting to see benefits from a cost reduction programme which had included some 3,000 redundancies in just over two years. 'We generated more cash than ever before, and held or increased our share of sales in many of our markets,' he said. Reporting under the new FRS 3 accounting standard, the 1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 179.6m was boosted by a Pounds 33.2m gain on the sale of an associate. Interest payable fell to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 19.6m). Operating profit from continuing operations, at Pounds 155.6m, was down 8 per cent. The main reason was the collapse in profits of oil services from Pounds 34.7m to Pounds 500,000 on turnover down from Pounds 318.7m to Pounds 289.8m. Mr David Veit, chief executive of the division, blamed a fall in gas prices and drilling activity. A total of Dollars 20m (Pounds 14m) was spent on redundancies and closures, and capital expenditure was cut from Dollars 42m to Dollars 24m. The division has been profitable so far this year. Books were 'the star performer', with operating profit up 35 per cent to Pounds 80.4m. Penguin profits doubled to Pounds 26.3m on record sales and had eight titles in the January best sellers list in the New York Times. The Financial Times group increased profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 18.5m including contributions from foreign newspapers such as Les Echos but excluding associate companies. The newspapers division overall made Pounds 31.1m, a 5 per cent improvement. Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson's chief operating officer, said that BSkyB was now making operating profits of more than Pounds 1m a week. The first return in the form of interest on loan stock was expected this year. Investment banking showed a 9 per cent fall, with an operating profit of Pounds 23.7m. Profits from fine china fell by 39 per cent to Pounds 10.7m. Lord Blakenham said Pearson was now 'potentially very profitable' following cost-cutting and savings. Mr Guy Lamming, a James Capel media analyst, yesterday described the results as 'mixed' with better-than-expected performances from books and banking. 'There is the feeling that they have scraped the bottom and things are looking up for the company,' he said, increasing his 1993 pre-tax forecast from Pounds 170m to Pounds 179m.</p>

The demonstration was addressed by CMKOS Chairman Vladimir  Petrus, who said that the unions could not be accused of  extremism. The unionists merely considered it their  responsibility to point out that "dissatisfaction of the people"  threatened. They were not therefore going against parliament,  but they asked that the government and parliament "showed social  perceptiveness."    At the end of the demonstration the participants approved  appeals to the government and to parliamentary deputies, which  states that the union members "consider it very dangerous when  even government bills contain attempts to transfer the burden of  essential economic reforms on to those least able to protect  themselves."    It asks ministers that the amendment to the labor code and  the basis of the law on pension insurance be not put before  parliament until they are properly prepared and take into  account the union members' comments.    In the appeal addressed to deputies, the union members point  to their demands concerning the making of repeated contracts,  the position of pregnant women and mothers with small children,  the increase in the pension age, the management of money set  aside for pension insurance and the ban on trade union activity  in the civil service.    The demonstrators were also greeted by General Secretary of  the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, Enzo  Friso, who assured them of the confederation's support.    Messages from foreign organizations. [sentence as received]  Concrete support was expressed by the Polish trade union  movement Solidarity, which managed to drive radio cars with  loudspeakers to Prague overnight, after the demonstration's  organizers had not been able to get hold of any in the Czech  Republic.    Czech Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich  Vodicka also came to the Old Town Square, but he was for the  most part greeted with whistles and various displays of  indignation. Union members came to Prague from all over the  Czech Republic in 400 buses, and filled most of the square.</p>

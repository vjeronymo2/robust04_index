			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCIENCE;  </P> <P> COLD FUSION INVESTIGATION BEGINS  </P> <P> A panel of scientists today began reviewing Utah's National Cold Fusion  Institute, with a member saying their study of the controversial research would  be open and objective.  </P> <P> As the meeting got under way, electrochemist B. Stanley Pons -- who along with  British colleague Martin Fleischmann claims to have produced nuclear fusion in  room-temperature experiments -- ducked from television cameras after being  spotted sitting in the back row.  </P> <P> All the meetings are closed. A sign posted outside the door of the meeting room  states: "It is required that only those persons who have signed a National Cold  Fusion Institute confidentiality agreement attend this review."  </P> <P> Last year's claim by Pons and Fleischmann that they had created energy through  so-called "cold fusion" created a sensation in the scientific world. But  controversy erupted when many other scientists said they could not duplicate  the Utah scientists' findings.  </P></p>

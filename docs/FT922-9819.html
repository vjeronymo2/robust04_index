			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Observer: Happy ending? There is an increasing end of an era ring about the recent non-stop festivities in the Associated Newspapers' stable. The Mail on Sunday had its tenth birthday and great fuss was made of the 21st anniversary of the Daily Mail going 'compact'. It is also the 21st anniversary of Sir David English's time at the Daily Mail's editorial helm, and the din of champagne corks popping cannot subdue the growing speculation that Britain's longest serving national newspaper editor may be preparing to sign off his day-to day editorial responsibilities. One possible clue is that Sir David is starting to add to his non-daily work load. Associated has just won the new 10-year teletext licence and Sir David will be the chairman. He already chairs two of Viscount Rothermere's other media ventures - a magazine publishing company and an independent television producer. If Sir David steps down as editor - he would almost certainly remain editor-in-chief - the smart money is on his replacement being Paul Dacre who has piled on sales at London's Evening Standard while driving it firmly to the political right.</p>

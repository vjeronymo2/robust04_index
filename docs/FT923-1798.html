			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Russia before the winter A NEW SESSION of Russia's parliament opens tomorrow with every sign pointing to the most bruising clash yet between the legislative and executive powers. Russia's government has still little to offer the people but more sweat and tears: and its legion of enemies in the parliament and in the country will be anxious to see some of its blood. Vast dangers threaten the country. Inflation is now said by leading government figures to be rising sharply towards hyper inflationary levels - while the government bemoans its lack of control over or agreement with a big-spending central bank. The budget deficit, on the most recent figures, stands at close to Rbs1,000bn from a total income of Rbs3.300bn. Production continues to fall - and though some of that is accounted for by goods no one wants (guns), an important part consists of goods people do want (butter), or the country desperately needs to trade (oil). Although the grain harvest is likely to be better this year (the potato harvest will be worse), the central and local authorities are already raising the spectre of winter hunger in the cities before western aid donors. There has been growth in the number of private farmers in Russia, but state and collective farms still predominate and distribution and storage continue to worsen. Add to this the following: taxes which are widely evaded; hard currency which is poured out of the country into secret bank accounts; corruption at every administrative level; a rouble zone covering nearly all the former Soviet republics without the former Soviet monetary discipline; a state managerial class hostile to foreign investment, to its own government and perfectly prepared to enter into league with the unions to hold the state to ransom; and a clutch of opportunist politicians each with a sure way of getting out of the crisis. In logic, this constitutes not a crisis in the making, but a crisis made. There is another reality, however, which is to be found as much outside of Moscow as within its rutted beltway. It lies in the steadily increasing privatisations of small shops; the ever present activity of foreign companies, even individuals; the growth of market activity on every roadside with kiosks, stalls or just a few commodities displayed on a piece of cloth; the growing self confidence (and conspicuous consumption) of the entrepreneurial class; the multiplication of cultural, commercial, social, academic and political links with foreign states; the hollowing out of the often-stagnant institutes and academies as their people leave to make money; and the plurality of views still vehemently expressed and able to be expressed in print, on the air or in the street. Even with all that weighs them down, the government is still maintaining a momentum on its programme for the privatisation of large companies. Every kind of lobby is against this, and the population appears sceptical. But the government is so far holding firm, and next month should see the first privatisation plans being approved. As ministers will gloomily admit - even insist, this being a government in part composed of painfully honest Moscow intellectuals - radical reform is gone. But reform is not dead, nor its cause lost, as the virulence of their critics confirms. Foreign assistance to this process has always been much less important than domestic effort - but it remains crucially important, even though the lamp of attention has been greatly and damagingly dimmed and is likely to remain so. Those who still pay attention, in western cabinets and boardrooms, need to counsel patience, flexibility - but continued and close engagement in and argument for the process of change, for change is indeed taking hold. This will be very hard: none of the Group of Seven governments which have put themselves in charge of aiding Russia now have much taste for generosity. Besides, the Russian ministers (and their counterparts in the other former Soviet states) will give them an excuse to be stingy, since they are no position easily to repay debts. The hopes that a dose of 'shock therapy' could electrify the system and jolt it out of its seven-decades long Soviet groove have proved groundless: this will be a long haul. But the government of Russia can still be assisted and the task should not be impossible.</p>

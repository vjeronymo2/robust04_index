			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Agreement on EU steel rescue: International News Digest European Union industry ministers agreed yesterday to prolong the EU's steel rescue plan if the industry could come up with 19m tonnes of capacity cuts, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said. But questions remained about whether an Italian aid proposal to help a group of plants in the Brescia region shut down 5m tonnes of capacity complied with EU subsidy rules. Mr Van Miert said he assured ministers the Commission would monitor the aid strictly. The ministers will discuss the industry's restructuring efforts again in either June or September. The European Commission worked out a deal with steel companies last month to give them until next autumn to make capacity cuts and qualify for a rescue plan involving financial aid to cover some 50,000 job losses. The plan also includes import restrictions on steel from the former Czechoslovakia and loans to finance closures. Mr Van Miert said ministers discussed complaints that Germany's Saarstahl steel plant was still producing steel, despite declaring bankruptcy.</p>

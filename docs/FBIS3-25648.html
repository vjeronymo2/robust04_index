Every day a new pretext emerges,  thus retarding the peace talks. There are changes after changes  just because the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] makes demands that are difficult to meet. Our  correspondent Joao Ligio reports.    The mediators continued their separate consultations today  in  search of details to draw up the third version of specific  principles. It is thought that this third version could be part  of tomorrow's proceedings. If that happens, it will be one step  forward.    What was not taken into consideration, however, was the  demand by Jonas Savimbi's followers that as long as the  government does not say something about recent statements made  by deputy Lucio Lara and General Joao de Matos, the peace talks  will not move forward. Alioune Blondin Beye, special  representative of the UN secretary general, brushed aside the  demand, recalling that it has already been accepted and signed  that events outside Lusaka should not disturb the course of the  peace talks. To overcome this tense atmosphere, Alioune Blondin  Beye had to place the Black Cockerel's men between a rock and a  hard place, exhibiting a new document entitled Guiding Document.  In this document, the mediators outline all points that the  parties must take into consideration. This new form of  undertaking involving signatures is aimed at preventing the  parties from recanting previous protocols, and it is viewed as a  compulsory guideline.</p>

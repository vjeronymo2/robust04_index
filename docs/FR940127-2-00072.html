Establishment of Transitional Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 502 of the Act establishes a new Subchapter D in Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Group Eligibility Requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AMENDED LAW <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Subsection (a) of section 250 is titled Group Eligibility Requirements. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) sets out the criteria for certifying a worker group for NAFTA&hyph;TAA as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A group of workers (including workers in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) shall be certified as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under subsection (b) if the Secretary determines that a significant number or proportion of the workers in such workers' firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and either_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) the sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision have increased, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) the increase in imports under clause (ii) contributed importantly to such workers' separation or threat of separation and to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADMINISTRATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As mentioned above, paragraph (a)(1) sets out the group eligibility criteria for certifying worker groups for transitional adjustment assistance. Two sets of criteria are included in subparagraphs (A) and (B). The criteria in subparagraph (A) are similar to the eligibility criteria in the regular TAA program (section 222 of the Trade Act), except that the criteria for NAFTA&hyph;TAA petitions provide that increased imports must come from Mexico or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, and without reference to whether there have been increased imports from Mexico or Canada under subparagraph (A), the criterion under subparagraph (B) confers eligibility if the firm or subdivision of the firm has shifted production to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the firm or subdivision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of Criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of section 250, the following terms are applied: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appropriate subdivision <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means an establishment in a multi-establishment firm which produces the domestic articles in question or a distinct part or section of an establishment (whether or not the firm has more than one establishment) where the articles are produced. The term ``appropriate subdivision'' includes auxiliary facilities operated in conjunction with (whether or not physically separate from) production facilities. (OTAA has interpreted the term ``establishment'' to include a place of business together with its employees, merchandise, equipment, etc.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Firm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (including a development corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy, and receiver under decree of any court. A firm, together with any predecessor or successor-in-interest, or together with any affiliated firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same persons, may be considered a single firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Significant number or proportion of workers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. In most cases the total or partial separations, or both, in a firm or appropriate subdivision thereof, are the equivalent to a total unemployment of five (5) percent of the workers or 50 workers, whichever is less; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

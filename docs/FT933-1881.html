			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / New constitution for Cambodia: The move which signals the departure of the UN CAMBODIA'S parliament yesterday adopted a new democratic constitution, signalling the imminent end of the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) United Nations peacekeeping mandate in the country and the return to the throne of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The 70-year-old Prince Sihanouk is expected to fly to Cambodia from his home in Beijing tomorrow to promulgate the constitution. He will become king for the first time since he abdicated to enter politics in 1955, and will then appoint the leaders of the new government. 'This is a great success for the Cambodian people and the international community,' said Prince Ranariddh, Prince Sihanouk's son, after the parliament voted by 113 to five, with two abstentions, in favour of the constitution. Prince Ranariddh's royalist party Funcinpec won the largest number of seats in parliament in the UN-organised elections in May, and he will be the senior of two prime ministers in the new government. Many Cambodians, however, remain apprehensive about the future after more than two decades of civil war. Not all of them are happy to see the soldiers and officials of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) packing their bags ahead of the departure of the last UN contingents in mid-November. As the constitution was being debated last week, Cambodian human rights activists, western diplomats and Untac officials expressed concern about whether human rights in general and the rights of racial minorities in particular would in practice be safeguarded, and whether it would be possible to create an independent judiciary. Untac is holding four prisoners accused of murder and torture and the interim government has so far refused to take them over and put them on trial. There are also fears that Prince Sihanouk will be unable to resist involvement in politics, although he is supposed to be a figurehead according to the constitutional monarchy adopted yesterday, and although he says he may have prostate cancer. Another concern is that Funcinpec and the Cambodian People's party (CPP), the former ruling communist party installed by Vietnam in 1979, will find it difficult to remain in a coalition government. The interim coalition appears to be working fairly smoothly at the ministerial level in the capital Phnom Penh, and Mr Hun Sen, the former CPP prime minister, has agreed to be junior prime minister under Prince Ranariddh in the new government. But CPP hardliners, who are powerful in the provinces and the security services, are unhappy about their loss of influence since the election. Under the old CPP one-party government, there was little distinction between the property of the state and the property of the party. The Finance Ministry, under Mr Sam Rainsy of Funcinpec, is taking an inventory of all public assets. The government's lack of control has been underlined by a rash of armed robberies to seize equipment from Untac and foreign aid organisations. Untac has lost 170 cars so far, and some have been found in the possession of Cambodian army and police officers. Such lawlessness may spread: Untac, after three months of payments costing Dollars 13m, will now stop funding the salaries of some 140,000 soldiers and police. Meanwhile, Cambodia is expected to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a Dollars 9m short-term loan to help the transformation from a communist to a market economy, and with the World Bank for a further Dollars 64m, the finance minister said. Multilateral and bilateral lenders and donors have pledged a total of Dollars 1bn in aid to Cambodia since mid-1992. Perhaps the best news for the Cambodian government is the recent weakening of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla army, which boycotted the election but is nevertheless demanding a share of power. Government officials say about 1,300 Khmer Rouge frontline troops, or a tenth of the organisation's fighting force, have defected in recent weeks after a government offensive in which the CPP-dominated army was aided by Funcinpec soldiers - who were once allies of the Khmer Rouge. Defectors have given Cambodian and Untac officials valuable information about Khmer Rouge strategy and damning evidence of Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge in violation of the 1991 Paris peace accords which created Untac and provided for the election. For Mr Pol Pot, the reclusive Khmer Rouge leader, few television images can have been more galling than that of Prince Ranariddh, his former ally, and Mr Hun Sen, his former enemy, walking together out of parliament yesterday to form a national government in which he has no part.</p>

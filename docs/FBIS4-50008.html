			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata today dispelled concerns that Tokyo may move toward  active overseas military deployments.    Hata told a plenary session of the House of Representatives  that Japan's Constitution prohibits the country's involvement in  collective security and that he has no intention of changing the  conventional interpretation of the constitution on this issue.    This was in response to a question from Yohei Kono,  president  of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.    The prime minister's remarks were apparently designed to  ease  apprehension among opposition legislators that his  administration is moving toward more active involvement by  Japan's Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts.    Hata also denied that Japan had secretly agreed with the  United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms  on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian  allies.    He was referring to a recent allegation in a book written by  Kei Wakaizumi, former special emissary of then Prime Minister  Cisaku Sato, that Sato and Nixon signed a top-secret memorandum  at the White House on November 21, 1969, saying that Japan is  aware of U.S. expectations for a favorable response to possible  U.S. requests to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of  crisis.</p>

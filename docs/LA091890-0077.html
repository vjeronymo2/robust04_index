			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> NEWPORT BLVD. TO BE REDUCED TO 1 LANE  </P> <P> Beginning this week, Caltrans will reduce southbound traffic on Newport  Boulevard to one lane between 19th and 22nd streets, and to two lanes between  22nd and Fair Drive.  </P> <P> The lane reduction is expected to last until early 1991 to allow Caltrans to  work on an extension to the Costa Mesa Freeway.  </P> <P> Caltrans is asking drivers to find alternate routes during this time.  </P> <P> When completed, the new freeway segment will link central Orange County and the  beach communities. The extension also is expected to relieve congestion on  Newport Boulevard, which now carries much of the area's beach traffic.  </P> <P> During the construction, traffic will be routed west on Victoria Street, south  on Harbor Boulevard and back to Newport Boulevard near 19th Street.  </P></p>

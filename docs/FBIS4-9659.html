			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in  Spanish on 30 March publishes on pages 1A and 10A a 150-word  report on the results of a public opinion poll of Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the Institutional Revolutionary Party's  (PRI) new presidential candidate.    The item, published under the headline "Zedillo Has A Good  Image," is comprised of four pie charts that show the results of  a survey conducted shortly after the PRI announced Zedillo as  its new candidate. The survey questioned 407 people in  Monterrey and the surrounding metropolitan area and 450 people  in Mexico City. The item mentions three questions.    The first question was: "In general, what is your opinion of  Ernesto Zedillo?" In Monterrey, 44 percent said they had a good  opinion; 23 percent said they did not know anything about him;  18 percent said their opinion was neutral; 13 percent said they  had a very good opinion; and 2 percent they had a bad opinion.  In Mexico City, 39 percent responded positively; 29 percent did  not know anything about him; 22 percent were neutral; 5 percent  had a bad opinion; 4 percent a very good opinion; and 1 percent  a very bad opinion.    The second question was: "What do you think are the PRI's  chances of winning the presidency of the republic with Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon as its candidate? Good, little, or none."  The report gives the general response to this question; it does  not give separate percentages for each of the places polled. The  results were: 64 percent said good; 27 percent said little; 6  percent said they did not know; and 3 percent said none.    The third question was: "Would you vote for Ernesto Zedillo  Ponce de Leon?" The item also gives a general response to this  question. Results: 65 percent said yes; 19 percent said no; and  15 percent said they did not know.</p>

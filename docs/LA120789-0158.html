			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOVIETS TWIRL AND LEAP INTO SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> ACROBATICS: TROUPE PROVIDES A BUFFET OF ROUTINES FOR AUDIENCES AT THE OLD GLOBE  THEATRE.  </P> <P> They twirl, they leap, they balance, they dance.  </P> <P> They are the Soviet Acrobatic Revue at the Old Globe Theatre, and if the  American premiere of this Soviet import proves anything, it is that a circus in  any country is still a circus.  </P> <P> Thus said, this one-ring troupe provides a dandy little divertissement, with  talented performers who are eager to please. It is not the ultimate circus and  certainly not the ultimate acrobatic revue, despite the considerable charm and  skill of its performers -- four of which are family acts. And it does not help  to have the very practiced and justly acclaimed "Le Cirque du Soleil"  performing simultaneously on the other side of Balboa Park.  </P> <P> The Soviet Acrobatic Revue, a last-minute replacement for the Peking Acrobats  whose visas were held up by the Chinese government in the wake of the summer  uprising in Beijing, was assembled by promoter Don Hughes as a collage of top  Soviet dance, acrobatic and comic acts.  </P> <P> What the troupe provides, consequently, is a sampler of many styles of  performance -- a buffet of some sparkling individual numbers that never quite  find the common harmony that would blend the parts into a whole.  </P> <P> The brevity of the 21 acts (at about six minutes each) -- beautifully costumed  in great bursts of color -- worked best with the children in the audience who  moved easily from the oohing and aahing over Shamhal and Muhtar Abakarov, the  Daghestan father and son tightrope walkers (imagine walking blindfolded and in  a black sack across the high wire) to the giggles elicited by the clown, Sergei  Alexandrevich Pavlov, who seems to have no problem tap dancing, juggling and  making faces while he plays "Blue Moon" on the trumpet.  </P> <P> Still there is something for the unjaded of any age here: Charlie Chaplin and  the little flower girl gliding gracefully on roller ice skates (Alexander  Rozanov and Liliya Mandrychenko); a birdlike contortionist (Rusanna Vardanyan),  complete with white wings, transforming her body atop a bird cage; a  beautifully fluid acrobat (Inga Dianova) doing her twists, turns and loops  inside a steel ring balanced on husband Ahmed Dianov's forehead.  </P> <P> And a Cossack who does his flips with spears (Mikhail Sklyadnev); the brick  juggling by the remarkably cheerful Anvar Dianov who performs as if it is a  rare kick rather than a challenge to balance 15 bricks while putting on his  jacket; the athletic dancing of a five-member company that includes the show's  artistic director, Uriy Zamyatnin, and athletics so smooth, it looked like  dancing from Ivan Pristupa, wife Ludmila Pristupa and Uriy Sugrobov.  </P> <P> Another quality the Soviets have in common with their grease-painted brethren  everywhere is the trick of making tricks look easy. There were intimations of  how difficult some of these numbers are when Vladimir Serov, riding a unicycle  on a slack wire, almost dropped the fifth cup he was balancing on the fifth  saucer on his head. Blame opening night jitters if you will, but not Serov, who  distinguished himself later with balancing upside down on a teapot on a  sideways unicycle that he pedaled with his hands across the slack wire.  (Serov's partner, wife Iraida Serova, also handled five hula hoops on a  unicycle with evident ease.)  </P> <P> The show ended with the Soviet and United States flags side by side, a trick  that got the biggest applause of all from the opening-night audience -- another  difference between the Soviet Acrobatic Revue and Le Cirque, which does not  wave a Canadian or American flag at the end of its show. The way to tell when  glasnost is really here is when such self-conscious demonstrations of  friendship seem unnecessarily quaint.  </P> <P> "THE SOVIET ACROBATIC REVUE"  </P> <P> Artistic director is Uriy Zamyatnin. Costumes by Papzyan of Germes, Moscow.  Stage manager is John Highkin. At 8 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday and 7 p.m. Sundays  with Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 through Dec. 17.

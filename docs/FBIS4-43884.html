			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union) has welcomed Russia's joining the  NATO Partnership for Peace program. In Bonn, the minister spoke  of a "historical milestone in a process, which gives Europe more  stability and thus safeguards peace." With this, NATO has very  quickly taken up the proposals presented by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev in Brussels on 24 May and turned them  into a future-oriented project. The NATO program is proving to  be a flexible mechanism, which permits living up to the  participants' individual interests in the spirit of the common  whole.</p>

A spokesman for General Aidid's Somali National Alliance  (SNA) said US troops on Monday "deliberately killed innocent  people" in an unprovoked attack, but the US charge d'affaires,  Stevenson McIlvaine, said he was "convinced" that Somali gunmen  had opened fire first.    Military spokesman for the US Army and the UN Operation in  Somalia (UNOSOM II) said the capital had remained calm  overnight, but there were unconfirmed reports that a young  Somali had been killed in the evening by American troops in the  port district.    Monday's brief firefight, the bloodiest incident since  Aidid's militiamen declared a ceasefire last October, took place  at the crowded Kilometre-4 junction on the busy Afgooye Road in  southern Mogadishu and left at least five Somalis dead and a  score of others injured, including women and children.    "I am now convinced that the incident started...when two  Somali gunmen opened fire on the Marines" escorting US liaison  office personnel to a meeting with SNA reprentatives," McIlvaine  said Tuesday. "This was a tragic incident," he added. "Some  people have been hit and should not have been hit."    But McIlvaine warned that "this is a sort of terrible  accident that is going to happen as long as the streets of  Mogadishu, particularly the streets near the (UN) compound and  the streets that we use are crowded with gunmen."    Among those killed by the marines, who were in a convoy  including Humvee armoured vehicles mounted with heavy guns, was  a renowned Somali elder in his 60s, Sabriye Alale Barise, who  had been walking by on the pavement.    The secretary-general of the United Somali Congress-SNA  (USC-  SNA), Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali, categorically denied that Somalis  were the first to open fire. "How could we organise an ambush  on a crowded street? There was no shooting towards the US  (troops)," he told AFP on Tuesday. "The US soldier in the first  car was very nervous, he started shooting... They deliberately  killed innocent people."    Ahmed Ali charged that the soldiers "did it on purpose. This  is a revenge for what happened on the 3rd of October," when  Somali gunmen loyal to Aidid killed 18 US troops in a pitched  battle after the marines mounted a raid to capture Aidid aides.  After that fight, the SNA declared a ceasefire and the United  Nations suspended a hunt for Aidid, who had been declared a  wanted man accused of ordering attacks on UN peacekeepers.    "We've asked our people to keep quiet, to hold the  ceasefire," Ahmed Ali added. "We are doing our best to solve  Somali problems internally. We will continue to talk with  everybody."    The first secretary at the Ethiopian embassy here, Yemane  Abadi, who had organised Monday's planned meeting between the US  officials and the SNA representatives, said he also did not  think "it was an intended attack" and called it "a tragic  accident."    All sides called for a continued effort to reconcile Somali  clans, who plunged the country into bloody strife and famine  after the January 1991 ouster of strongman Mohamed Siad Barre.</p>

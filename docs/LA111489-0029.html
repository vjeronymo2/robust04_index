			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S TIME TO TRY AGAIN  </P> <P> Battered but resilient, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House are  preparing to call for another vote to approve pay raises for members of  Congress and certain other federal officials. This takes no small political  courage, given the working over Congress suffered earlier this year at the  hands of an organized anti-pay- raise lobby. But the House leadership is  displaying more than bravery as it prepares to face renewed wrath. It is also  acting realistically and responsibly.  </P> <P> For when all the shouting is over, this fact remains: In a competitive  marketplace, federal judges and other high-level officials are underpaid. The  overdue effort to raise federal pay deserves not demagogic condemnation but  public support.  </P> <P> No one argues that public service need be as remunerative as the private  sector, but at the same time it's absurd to ask those who go into public  service to accept severe economic penalties. Current top pay for Congress and  federal officials and judges is $89,500. Measured against average family  income, measured, indeed, against the realistic aspirations of most wage  earners, that's a lot of money. It is not a lot, however, given what talented  people in federal service could earn in the private sector. There are probably  very few federal judges, assistant secretaries or senior civil servants who  couldn't expect to double or even triple their pay by opting out of public  life.  </P> <P> And Congress? The argument for raising congressional pay is not so much a  matter of equity as of ethical practicality. To augment their salaries members  of Congress have for years left themselves free to solicit and accept outside  income, $26,850 annually in the case of representatives, $35,000 for senators.  Where does this money come from? In almost every case, it comes from people or  organizations that are eager to curry favor or buy influence. This is  demeaning, corrupting and scandalous, a taxpayer-robbing abuse of public trust  that has long cried out for elimination.  </P> <P> The measure being prepared for a House vote would junk so-called honorariums --  never was a word so misapplied -- as well as sharply restrict outside income  and fees for professional services. In exchange, top federal officials would  get a two-tier pay raise to about $120,500 in 1991. The exact scope of the  proposed ban isn't yet clear. It may be that a toughening beyond what is  contemplated will be required. What is known is that a pay increase for senior  federal officials is overdue, and so is a far stricter ethical system governing  outside congressional income. The chance to deal responsibly with both these  questions is again at hand.  </P></p>

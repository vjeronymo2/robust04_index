Katyal: "Restrictions Persist in Trade With </F> Pakistan"]    [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 20--Whatever else the latest Geneva  accord within the framework of GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) may or may not mean for India, it does not  automatically open the normal trade channels between this  country and Pakistan. The economic dealings between them will  continue to be constrained by extraneous considerations unless  the two governments take bold decisions to remedy the present  artificial situation. The onus for this lies with Pakistan which  has not responded favourably to repeated Indian pleas for a  normal trade flow. There is nothing to suggest that Islamabad is  in a mood to remove the restrictions imposed by it.    New Delhi has been prepared to accord the  most-favoured-nation treatment to Pakistan but so far it has not  received a favourable response for reciprocal status for Indian  exporters--a point that was confirmed in reply to a question in  the Rajya Sabha today. Pakistan has restricted its imports from  India to 570 items (not all of which have a potential for  cross-border dealings). However, two months ago, Islamabad  allowed the import of cement and pulses, which are not among the  570, as a one-time exception.    India has no objection to a small negative list which may be  considered necessary for safeguarding of indigenous industries,  but has made no secret of its disapproval of the present  practice, based on the positive list. Even in regard to these  items, Pakistani importers cannot deal directly with their  Indian counterparts. The cumbersome licensing regulations bring  the official machinery into the picture--and contributes to  restrictiveness. The recent annual figures of trade turnover  speak for themselves--Indian exports: Rs.[rupees] 151 crores,  Pakistan's exports; Rs. 373 crores.    Limited initiative: In the framework of the South  Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) both India  and Pakistan accepted, at the Dhaka summit earlier this year, a  limited initiative to promote trade in the region. This took the  form of SAPTA (South Asia Preferential Trade Arrangement). The  negotiations that preceded the Dhaka decision were marked by  hesitations on the part of Pakistan which would have liked  either to dilute the arrangement or to give it a longer  time-frame. By contrast, other SAARC members--Bangladesh, Sri  Lanka and Nepal--were ardent votaries of freer trade in the  region. However, preliminary steps even in this limited context  have yet to be taken.    For a brief while, after the Shimla Agreement, India and  Pakistan did open bilateral trade as part of the measures to  restore normality. But soon after, a strong lobby of  industrialists in Pakistan prevailed upon their government to  change its policy. The swamping of Pakistan's markets by Indian  products, they contended, would destroy its nascent industries.  In the climate of bilateral suspicion and distrust, this  argument instantaneously appealed to the government and it  clamped heavy curbs, which continue till today.    India and Pakistan have been buying each other's  articles--but through third countries. This arrangement only  deprives them of the gains which should accrue to them because  of physical proximity and the complementarity of their  economies. Responsible persons in Pakistan's ruling  establishment, of late, have spoken in favour of doing away with  restrictions but have not been able to translate these  sentiments into policy decisions.    There is a strong case for the Foreign Secretaries to take  up  trade at some stage of their forthcoming dialogue. But any such  suggestion from the Indian side is bound to arouse  suspicion--and be viewed as a trick to divert attention from  Kashmir.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOODS OF DIABETICS  </P> <P>  Question: A friend of mine has diabetes, and he's been having a problem in  getting his insulin adjusted. He's usually a very pleasant person, but lately  his personality seems to have changed. I don't know if it's because he's  worried about the insulin, or whether insulin itself has such an effect. Can  insulin cause depression?  </P> <P> Answer: Insulin-dependent persons sometimes do experience feelings of  depression, but, although insulin is involved, it's actually changes in the  blood-sugar level that are responsible. Although it may take a little time,  these feelings should disappear when the dose of insulin and the timing of its  administration are adjusted to keep the patient's blood-sugar level on a  steadier keel.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon for insulin-related mood disorders to occur at night. Too  much insulin or failure to have a snack before going to bed may cause  blood-sugar levels to fall too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia. As a  result, the patient's sleep may be disturbed, or he or she may not be able to  sleep at all. On the other hand, too much insulin may cause the patient to feel  hungry and spur eating.  </P> <P> These varied reactions can lead to feelings of anxiety, an inability to  concentrate and irritability. This can all add up to depression.  </P></p>

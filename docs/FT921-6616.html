			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: EC clears trade deal with east SENIOR European Community diplomats yesterday cleared the way for implementation of the free trade agreements between the EC and Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but asked the European Commission to continue discussions with the Poles about their alleged discrimination in favour of certain EC car imports. EC objections to Poland's plan to divide its quota of duty-free car imports between General Motors, Fiat and Volkswagen - and impose a duty on other EC car imports - had threatened to delay implementation of the agreements on March 1. But diplomats agreed yesterday to freeze the relevant clauses of the agreement with Poland until the dispute was resolved. In effect, this will mean that trade in cars can continue, but neither side will introduce a duty-free quota system until the Commission and the Polish government have found a solution. France raised last-minute objections to Poland's plans at Tuesday's meeting of EC internal market ministers, and was backed by the Commission and other member states. An EC official said that Greece had also dropped its threat to block the agreements with Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Getting to grips with IT networks MANAGING information across a local or wide area network can be the stuff IT department nightmares are made off. UK-based Digital Networks International has developed the Help Desk Expert, a PC network software package which enables all the optional modules to inter-relate and to update one another. The software, developed using Clarion, a fourth-generation language, centralises all IT documentation and associated databases within larger organisations and then distributes the maintenance of the data to those best suited to carry it out. Some 11 add-on modules, ranging from purchase order tracking and training schedules to PABX planning and even the IT department payroll, have been added to its basic features.

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wanted: smaller firms' exchange - The new SEATS system for share trading / Diary of a Private Investor FOR SOME years, I have complained about the difficulties of trading in the shares of some small companies. I found it was either impossible to buy any of their shares immediately, or that shares could be acquired only in small amounts of perhaps 250 at a time. This made dealing costs, based on a minimum commission charge per deal, rather expensive. To sell the shares might also mean waiting some considerable time for a buyer to appear, or having to let them go in small parcels. In a Weekend FT article last year, I welcomed the stock exchange's introduction of a Bulletin Board service with details of around 120 UK-listed and USM small companies. Brokers were able to use its screen pages to display details of their clients' requirements. In November, the exchange replaced Bulletin Board with something even better: SEATS (the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service). Sadly, this has not received all the publicity it deserves. While Bulletin Board improved dealings in the shares of companies included on it, concerns were expressed that the lack of competing limit orders for certain shares sometimes meant there was no two-way price available. This affected brokers' ability to deal and to place an effective valuation on the shares concerned. With SEATS, the Bulletin Board type of display continues, with brokers being able to act on a 'matched bargain' basis. But where a company has a single market-maker, it must now display a bid-to-offer price at all times. Brokers wishing to deal in those shares must disclose what they want to do and allow the market-maker first refusal of it. With various other incentives for market-makers, SEATS should encourage a more active market (although there are still some companies without a market-maker at all). But the success of the system will depend on the number of people buying and selling shares in companies displayed on it. The more who trade, the better the service. One broking firm seeking to alert private investors to its advantages is Dunbar Boyle &amp; Kingsley. It has sent letters to a number of people (including myself) with shares in SEATS companies, enclosing a brief research report on the company in which the investor has a holding and inviting him to request similar reports on a further 14. DB &amp; K's Robin Boyle explains in his letter that his firm has made a particular point of researching the SEATS market. He says he is 'worried about the way the larger firms are working more and more for the big institutions' and, in his opinion, 'ignoring the needs of the private investor.' Boyle claims that 'a number of the large financial concerns have stopped being market-makers to a selection of interesting smaller companies, simply because they can no longer see their way to making a suitably large profit from working in that particular line of business.' He continues: 'Smaller companies are the life blood of the British economy: it is unfortunate that the larger financial institutions are simply walking away from their responsibility, leaving the crucial task of research and dealing to smaller firms such as ourselves.' The 15 companies mentioned by DB&amp;K include Fortnum &amp; Mason (the up-market London department store); John Swann &amp; Sons (a Scottish livestock auctioneer); British &amp; American Film Holdings (an investment company); and Toye &amp; Co (a maker of badges and other insignia, and uniforms). I requested all the available reports written by Mark Wheeler, the firm's smaller companies research analyst, and found them very interesting although I am not seeking to increase my exposure to SEATS companies just now as I already have direct, or personal pension scheme, holdings in three of them. But anyone wishing to receive copies of Wheeler's reports, and details of the firm's broking services, can write to Boyle at Gun House, 1/4 Artillery Passage, London E1 7LJ. In my view, there should be a rival to the stock exchange specialising in smaller companies. After all, in Canada (with a smaller population than the UK) there is a main stock exchange plus the Vancouver exchange specialising in smaller issues. In the US, the American Stock Exchange enjoys enormous success trading largely in shares of small to medium size concerns, while the New York Stock Exchange concentrates mainly on the larger companies. Why should the UK Stock Exchange enjoy a monopoly of trading - especially as the traumas of the coming Taurus system are likely to make a non-Taurus-based stock market even more appealing to the private investor and to smaller companies? In the absence of such a second exchange, though, SEATS is the next best thing. I have long believed that more money can be made over the long term by investing in small companies than in giant corporations. As recent events have shown, yet again, it is easier for a small company to increase its profits by, say, 25-50 per cent in a year than it is for a company the size of IBM. It should always be remembered, however, that not all SEATS companies have shares worth buying: their future prospects may be dismal. And even well-run SEATS companies with good prospects can sometimes find their shares subject to sharp variations in price. So, the private investor has to be particularly careful when spending his money.</p>

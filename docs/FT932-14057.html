			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Peking fearful 14% growth is unsustainable CHINESE officials face some unenviable decisions before mid-year following the release this week of economic data indicating that China's economy is overheating. While China's leaders show no sign yet of 'hitting the panic button', officials are saying privately that growth rates of 14 per cent - the figure for the first quarter of 1993 - are unsustainable. Western economists expect the leadership will want to monitor developments in the second quarter before taking more decisive measures to restrain economic growth and cool pressures on prices; but at the same time they believe China's economic managers cannot afford to delay too long. Mr Ross Garnaut, professor of economics at the Australian National University and a former Australian ambassador to Beijing, said yesterday that if measures adopted late last year, including credit restrictions, did not bite soon then 'heavier controls' on investment, as well as 'strong action' on monetary policy would be required. 'Present economic growth is not sustainable,' he said. 'The big question is whether it can be brought back into a sustainable range or whether a hard landing may be required.' Growth rates of 9 to 10 per cent were probably manageable. Among fears in the foreign business and investment community is that the worrying inflation figures of nearly 16 per cent and higher than expected growth will panic China's leadership into reverting to the 'stop-go' economic policies of the 1980s that slowed reform and contributed ultimately to political unrest. In 1988, China's economy grew by some 12 per cent before brutal credit restrictions and other measures brought growth down abruptly to 3.9 per cent in 1989. China's economy grew by 5 per cent in 1990; and 7 per cent in 1991 before rocketing ahead by 12.8 per cent last year. Efforts by the authorities to introduce a mild credit squeeze have failed, judging by figures showing credit for 1992 grew by 21 per cent, much the same as the year before. The broader M2 measure of money supply also continued to gallop along with growth of 30.6 per cent last year. Western officials caution inflation figures for the first quarter are generally higher than for the rest of the year. They say wage increases are more than keeping pace with price rises that have been fuelled partly by structural reforms such as abolition of subsidies. Some argue that as much as 60 per cent of increases are attributable to the freeing of prices on basic items like rice and fuel.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Straw calls for end to Clause 4 Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary and a close ally of Labour leader Mr Tony Blair, last night criticised Clause 4 of the party's constitution as a 'sop to middle-class activists' which should be replaced by a clear set of principles, Roland Rudd writes. Mr Straw condemned the clause as a 'creature of its time which has long since lost its meaning'. He said: 'The truth is that despite Clause 4, or maybe even because of it, Labour has throughout much of its history been a resolutely unideological party. It is as if Clause 4 was a sop to keep middle-class party activists happy rather than a guiding philosophy for the party.' Mr Straw said there was little evidence that Labour in government ever sought to take 'the means of production into public ownership' as outlined by the clause. Instead Labour governments pursued a more pragmatic policy and never tried to nationalise private businesses other than public utilities, public services and ailing companies. It had been a convenient tool for pragmatists, he said. 'They could use it to reassure activists that Labour was an avowedly socialist party in the full knowledge that no one expected them to implement it. Clause 4 is a deliberately vague and ambiguous aspiration.' This was why the debate on Labour's aims and values was so important, he said, since nothing short of a renewed statement of democratic socialism in the place of Clause 4 would enthuse voters with Labour's visions of 'New Britain'.</p>

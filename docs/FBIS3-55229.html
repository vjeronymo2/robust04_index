			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] S. Shushkevich has described the upcoming  official visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton as an important  and positive event for Belarus. As S. Shushkevich said in an  interview with the ZVYAZDA newspaper correspondent, one of the  most important tasks at the Belarus-U.S. talks is to clarify  positions on the basic strategic issues of our policy and, in  particular, issues concerning the security of Belarus. "When  Belarus implements its constitutional law on neutrality and  nuclear-free status it would like to have guarantees for the  preservation of its neutral status, such as those that at one  time Finland had from the United States and the USSR," stressed  S. Shushkevich.    Concerning B. Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative,  S. Shushkevich noted that he also considers it expedient to  examine the official strategy of Belarus in creating in Central  Europe a belt of neutral states with certain guarantees from the  great states of the world.    Furthermore, S. Shushkevich considers that B. Clinton's  visit  to Minsk will encourage U.S. investment in its economy. [passage  omitted]</p>

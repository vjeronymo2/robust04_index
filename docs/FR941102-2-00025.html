No determination has been made that the submittal constitutes a complete filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the applicant, the topping-cycle cogeneration facility will be located in Cleburne, Texas, and will consist of a combustion turbine generator, a heat recovery boiler equipped with duct burning, and an extraction/condensing steam turbine generator. Steam recovered from the facility will be used by the applicant for the manufacturing of distill water for sale to a third party. The primary energy source will be natural gas. The maximum net electric power production capacity of the facility will be 284 MW. Construction of the facility is scheduled to begin in April, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thirty days from the date published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 17.

The application was filed pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by Energy Policy Act of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 824j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its application, WPPI requests that network service be provided commencing on May 1, 1995, and continuing on a long-term basis thereafter. The total transmission capacity requested would be sufficient for WPPI to integrate its load in eastern Wisconsin (now approximately 482 MW) with WPPI's resources. The service requested is network service over the integrated transmission grid of the EWU. The service requested includes both long and short-term firm and non-firm use, comparable in all respects to the EWU's use of the EWU grid. WPPI seeks services that will allow it, subject to existing power purchase contracts, (i) to schedule power and energy from a variety of sources within and outside of the EWU grid to WPPI's loads within the control areas of WP&amp;L, WEPCO and WPS on an economic dispatch basis and in response to planned and unplanned outages and (ii) to engage in coordination purchases and sales using the EWU grid in the same manner as the owners of that grid schedule their power and energy transactions. The service would be costed on single-system basis for the EWU, with one joint rate for use of the integrated transmission system of three utilities. Revenues would be shared by the EWU. WPPI also requested that the EWU unbundle their transmission services from power sales services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the application have been served upon the affected parties, WEPCO, WP&amp;L, WPS, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and upon Madison Gas &amp; Electric Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> E.

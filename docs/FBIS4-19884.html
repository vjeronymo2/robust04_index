			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition parties are waiting before they assess  the Papandreou-Clinton meeting in the White House yesterday,  while the left wing considers the results negative.    New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert said that the visit  has been neutral--neither positive nor negative--and this has  caused some optimism in the Greek delegation. Mr. Evert noted  that we have received more pressure on the Bosnian and Turkish  issues and that the Greek prime minister did not succeed in  convincing the Americans to put pressure on Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. He added: I believe  that tomorrow's meeting between Mr. Karolos Papoulias and Mr.  Cyrus Vance will be important; we will see how the situation  develops. Mr. Evert concluded: It is a colorless visit with  compliments and nice speeches, but I have not as yet seen any  results.    Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said: Despite the  dangerous concessions and serious vagueness that appeared at  yesterday's news conference, I would not like to make my  positions known in public so long as the country's prime  minister is abroad. I will wait for his return and his briefing  of the opposition. Mr. Samaras concluded: The only thing I can  say now is that I am deeply concerned.    Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis made a  statement today referring to the question of Skopje's name. He  said: Nobody can deny that it is better to be named North  Macedonia or New Macedonia rather than plain Macedonia. There  is no doubt about this. As soon as Mitsotakis' statement became  known, New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert responded: New  Democracy's positions are known and firm.    The Greek Communist Party has assessed that the prime  minister's visit to the United States marks and seals Greece's  full submission to the U.S. aggressive and warlike policy in the  Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. This policy aims at  converting this region, at any cost, into a zone of U.S.  interests and influence.    Commenting on the statements by the Greek prime minister and  the U.S. President, the Coalition of the Left and of Progress  Party points out, among other things, that excessive  expectations are being cultivated once again about the  development of our national issues for reasons of domestic  consumption. Unfortunately, the party statement adds, Mr.  Papandreou's belated pro-American turn continues to be based on  self-illusions about the role and aims of the U.S. policy on the  Balkans.</p>

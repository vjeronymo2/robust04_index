			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Joerg Sottorf: "Growing Concern Among the </F> Social Democrats"]    [Text] Bonn -- There is a relaxed atmosphere in coalition  circles. The party leaders and chairmen of Bundestag groups  have been slapping -- figuratively speaking -- each others backs  and are pleased at the success they have been experiencing over  the past few months.    The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] bosses thanked their  liberal colleagues for the "signal from Rostock," which confirms  the will to cooperate following a success in the Bundestag  elections in October. For their part, the FDP [Free Democratic  Party] coalition partners congratulated CDU chairman and  Chancellor Helmut Kohl for his successful appearances in the  European election campaign in the new laender.    In the federal chancellery, one is surprised, but naturally  delighted, that Kohl has been so successful on town squares in  the new laender. The squares were normally full and no tomatoes  and eggs were thrown.    The good mood in the CDU has received encouragement from the  latest opinion polls, which place the CDU/CSU [Christian Social  Union], with 36.5 percent, before the SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany], with 35.5 percent. The prediction that the  Republikaner would only receive 2.5 percent and would no longer  have seats in the European Parliament was also considered  pleasing. The FDP, however, is still nervous, despite a  forecast of 6 percent of the vote, that it can no longer be sure  of crossing the 5-percent hurdle in the European elections.    In contrast to the good mood among the coalition parties,  there is growing skepticism within the SPD. The certainty that  it will become the strongest party in the FRG European elections  has evaporated. The criticism is that the SPD has mobilization  problems. That not only applies to the European election  campaign, but also to the dispute over domestic political  problems. There is a feeling that a perfectly organized  election campaign, like the one that has been conducted about  Europe, will not help the party. This has been all the more  disappointing when one considers that the CDU/CSU was extremely  thrifty with funds in the case of the European election campaign  and evidently wants to retain money for the federal election  campaign. The CDU has placed the person of Kohl, a great  promoter of Europe, at the forefront of its election campaign.  The SPD has not done that, although party leader Rudolf  Scharping has been desperately fighting to catch up with Kohl by  making special train journeys.    SPD analysts have explained the disappointment by pointing  out that the slow economic upturn is evidently linked with a  change of mood among the population. In terms of foreign policy,  the coalition has got better cards in its hands, because new  crises have been avoided, and in terms of domestic policy, the  SPD has created risks for itself.    This last admission is directly linked to the party's party  political strategy and to the person of Scharping. Now that the  FDP has come out clearly in favor of a continuation of the  coalition with the CDU/CSU, strong domestic policy forces within  the SPD are calling for a rival strategy that could only be  modeled on the red-green coalition of Lower Saxony's Minister  President Gerhard Schroeder. Scharping, however, wants to keep  all his options open and to avoid making a statement on a  coalition at all costs. He is being accused of still being  inclined toward forming an alliance with the FDP or, if  necessary, an alliance with the FDP and the Greens.    Following the fierce attacks from the FDP and the party  conference decisions at Rostock, Scharping's election campaign  strategists appear to be shocked. Such tough attacks were not  expected from the FDP and are comparable to the attacks that the  Liberals once launched against the CSU and its chairman Strauss  in order to achieve an election campaign polarization that would  get them over the 5-percent hurdle, and, as we know, they were  very successful in that.    The question of why the SPD party leader and candidate for  chancellor is not as popular among citizens and evidently within  the party itself as at one time has greatly irritated the  election campaign strategists in the Erich Ollenhauer House in  Bonn. His "gross-net" confusion in connection with the  supplementary charge called for by the SPD was the start of the  Scharping dilemma. This was evidently a mistake -- one that was  rapidly corrected -- that employees have found it very difficult  to forgive.    There is confusion within the party about a policy toward  the  CDU. The fact that the person in question has remained silent  has prompted conflicts within the SPD. However, at the upcoming  party conference in Halle, Scharping also wants to avoid a  statement on the coalition at all costs. The conference will  see a secret and written vote on Scharping as a candidate for  chancellor and that means that Scharping will face a difficult  test within the party.    In view of the disappointing mood, SPD politicians have  become overactive and are continually presenting new specialist  programs, which has already made the CDU indulge in scorn and  derision. Speaking in Bonn yesterday, CDU Spokesman Rofl Kiefer  said: "The SPD program panic shows that Scharping is helpless  and does not know what to do."</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY CENTER SETS LECTURE SERIES  </P> <P> In honor of the 150th anniversary of the art of photography, the Los Angeles  Photography Center will launch a lecture series that will feature nine Southern  California photographers next month.  </P> <P> Called "Visual Statement," the series will take place each Wednesday and  Saturday night, 7:30-10 p.m., at the center, 412 South Park View St. Each  program will consist of a slide show, lecture, exhibition and  question-and-answer period.  </P> <P> "We felt it was a good opportunity to spotlight photographers who work in  Southern California, and give the community a chance to interact with them. Too  often, the only place you see the works of these photographers is in books and  we want to let the public see them in action," said Willie Middlebrook,  director of the center, which currently boasts 500 members.  </P> <P> The schedule:  </P> <P> April 1, Bruce Barnbaum, nature photography; April 5, Jose Galvez, Los Angeles  Times photographer; April 8, Kenda North, on the 24x24-inch Polaroid; April 12,  Robert Glenn Ketchum, landscape photography; April 15, Laura Parker, fine art  photography; April 19, Ray McSavaney, landscape/nature photography; April 22,  Bruce W. Palamon, photojournalism (covered the '84 and '88 Jesse Jackson  presidential campaigns for Time magazine); April 26, Meibao Nee, Asian-American  culture photography; April 29, Jan Pietrzak, nature photography.  </P></p>

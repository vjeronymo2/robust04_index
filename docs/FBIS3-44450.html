Mentioning the Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping said:  Britain is stirring up certain political trouble [gao xie zheng  zhi feng bo 2269 0067 2398 3112 7364 3134] to probe our reaction  and this is what we have long anticipated. It would be strange  if the British did not do such things and in the remaining time,  they will continue to do such things. Britain is unwilling to  see the disappearance of its political and economic influence  [shi li 0528 0500] in Hong Kong. However, the British Government  should be aware that the Chinese Government and the Chinese  people will not sit idly by and allow Britain to do such things.  The timetable for recovering Hong Kong is determined by the  Chinese Government.    The sources also said that Zeng Qinghong, director of the  CPC  Central Committee's General Office, told Deng that in two  opinion polls in some major mainland cities, 99 percent of the  people supported the Central Government's policy on the Hong  Kong issue. However, some people thought that the central  government was not tough enough toward Britain and still  cherished unrealistic "illusions." Some people even criticized  the central government for being "rightist" on this issue.  Deng said: I do not think there is any rightism. We  should give time to Britain to perform. The Preliminary Work  Committee should now quicken its work and should work in a  down-to-earth manner. Britain's political attempts will not  succeed because Hong Kong belongs to China.    According to sources, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing  and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu recently gave separate  speeches on the situation in the Sino-British talks and the  central policy on the Hong Kong issue to various central  departments, commissions, offices, and military academies.  Jiang Enzhu also answered questions raised by cadres in the  Ministry of National Defense and its affiliate institutions.  Li Lanqing said: In addition to playing political tricks,  Britain also tried to undermine Hong Kong's economy, including  Hong Kong's financial conditions. The central authorities were  prepared against this in 1990. When talking with British  Foreign Secretary Howe on 31 July 1984, Comrade Xiaoping  expressed the hope that the British Hong Kong authorities would  persuade British companies not to take the lead in transferring  funds out of Hong Kong. However, if the British decided to  withdraw their funds, we would not try to keep them from  quitting; if they tried to reenter Hong Kong later, we would not  hold a welcome meeting. If some people want to quit, it is  certain that other people are willing to come. The key lies in  China's political stability and vigorous economic development,  with the policy toward Hong Kong remaining unchanged. Britain  is trying to stir up trouble and undermine the Hong Kong economy  in order to prolong its colonial rule. Britain's attempt to  foster a pro- British and anti-China force, which attaches  itself to foreigners, to disrupt Hong Kong's smooth transition  and disrupt the work of the future special administrative region  [SAR] government will not succeed. The central government has  the ability and strength to ensure Hong Kong's long-term  stability and development. We shall not only protect  local-funded enterprises but also foreign-funded enterprises in  Hong Kong and we shall create more favorable conditions for  foreign investors. The Hong Kong stock market has been soaring  in recent months and many foreign investments are long- or  medium-term ones. Foreign investment in China was almost twice  as much as that in the same period of last year. This shows  that the troublesome events in Hong Kong only had a temporary  impact on the situation and it was China's policies that played  a decisive role in maintaining Hong Kong's development. Even if  disorder occurs in Hong Kong, the unrest will not last long.  The central government will adopt resolute measures to solve  the problem.    Li Lanqing also said: In the future, China will give full  consideration to the foreign companies and businessmen who have  made substantial contributions to Hong Kong's economic  development, and have sincerely cooperated with the Chinese  Government, will be given more favorable consideration regarding  their interests and development space in China. The Chinese  Government acts in good faith and greatly cherishes friendship.    Jiang Enzhu said: When holding talks with the British  Government on the convergence of Hong Kong's political structure  before and after 1997, the Chinese Government did not give up  its principles. It was the British side which deliberately  stirred up trouble to undermine the talks but the decision of  the Chinese Government to hold the talks was still correct. In  the 17 rounds of talks, the British side fully laid bare its  sinister purpose of stirring up political trouble in order to  prolong British colonial rule or the influence of the British  colonialist ideology. This was a good thing.    Jiang Enzhu added: Because Britain violated the Sino-British  Joint Declaration, the Joint Declaration has lost its function  and value. Britain went as far as to flagrantly negate the  existence of the agreements reached by the Chinese and British  Governments. This is rarely seen in international relations.  The statements and agreements between the two countries and  between the two governments must be jointly observed and  implemented by the two sides. If one side seriously violates  the agreement and insists on continuing such violation, or even  negates the existence of such statements and agreements, then  the statements and agreements will lose their binding force on  the other side.    Jiang also said: On the Hong Kong issue, Britain even  interfered in China's internal affairs and challenged China's  sovereign power. It was natural that Britain's practice was  rejected by the Chinese Government.    Jiang said: The central government still does not endorse  the demand of some localities, departments, institutions, and  schools to stage demonstrations in front of the British Embassy  and consulates. Such a form of expression is not suited to our  country's current political environment but this idea cannot be  regarded as a wrong one.    Reportedly, since early December, more than 40 institutions,  schools, and organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,  Chongqing, and Guangzhou have applied to stage demonstrations to  protest against Britain's behavior in trampling upon the  Sino-British Joint Declaration but their applications were not  approved by the authorities.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Scottish Variety - the Fabulous Fifties / The Edinburgh Festival The Edinburgh Festival is resolutely elitist this year (nothing wrong with that, of course.) But it did throw up its skirts once - for performances of Scottish Variety - the Fabulous Fifties. This was a recreation of the last days of the music hall, when all the Grands and Empires throughout the land still presented weekly variety bills consisting of rough comedians and twee sopranos, drag acts and dog acts. But the show at the King's Theatre was hardly a recreation. The theatre has changed little in 40 years. There is the red plush curtain; the brightly painted backdrops; the illuminated number board at the side to identify the acts; and, bless 'em, many of the old performers, Jimmy Logan, the Tiller Girls, and yes, even Susan Maughan, still hoofing it. Time really was frozen. 'Mr Happiness', Johnny Beattie, told jokes about seaside landladies and those idiots from Glasgow with impeccable timing; the Tiller Girls jack-knifed across the stage, smiles superglued; there was even another chance for that extinct art form, the Scottish sketch, with a Rangers fan converting to Celtic on his death bed so that the auld enemy would have one less supporter. Of course you were reminded how awful much of it was - the 1950s must have been the worst decade for music this century - and some acts survived on routines that would make Bob Monkhouse blush. But it was clean and jolly and it really was variety. So what if the trampoliners muffed their climax; who cares if a Tiller tumbles; and tough luck that Susan Maughan is no longer 'Bobby's Girl'. The entertainers of the 1950s were at one with their audience and any snarling, expletive-ridden alternative comedian would have been silenced at last by this display of genuine folk art. He might even have risen and joined in the National Anthem at the end.</p>

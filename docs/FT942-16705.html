			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Row develops over Banesto bids The battle to control Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) following the Spanish banking group's financial restructuring is becoming increasingly acrimonious, with complaints from potential bidders that they have been given inadequate information. Up to five other leading Spanish banks are in a position to bid for the controlling stake in Banesto after buying documentation on the sale from the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the body which temporarily holds 73 per cent as a result of a capital increase approved last month. Three - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander and the semi-state Argentaria  -are considered firm candidates. Banco Central Hispano, created by a merger three years ago, has indicated it is not contemplating taking a controlling stake but might be interested in parts of the Banesto empire. The fifth bank, Banco Popular, which is still undecided whether to bid, has stated publicly that it has 'a long list of unanswered questions' to put to Salomon Brothers, the US bank which is advising the Bank of Spain and the Deposit Guarantee Fund on the sale. Other banks have complained privately about the paucity of information in the documents, for which each bank has paid Pta100m (Dollars 715,000). Complaints refer to details about questionable loans, which are said to occupy only two pages in the eight-volume dossier, activities of subsidiary companies and foreign currency positions. Argentaria said that with the information available, it was 'impossible to make an adequate valuation' in order to put forward a bid.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Glimmer of confidence: The hopes of Lebanon's prime minister to rebuild the 'Paris of the Orient' Reminders of Lebanon's former glamour can still be glimpsed amid the shelled ruins of present-day Beirut. The gutted Hotel St Georges may today be guarded by a solitary, bored Syrian soldier where once it greeted a high-rolling cast of Gulf Arabs, arms dealers, spies and journalists. But beside the adjacent marina, the scions of Beirut's wealthy still gather on sunny Sundays in a bravura display of tanned flesh, chic attire and flashy cars. Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, is this week seeking, during a visit to London, to rekindle the image his country once had as the 'Paris of the Orient'. At a meeting yesterday with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, he achieved one of his priorities: the restoration of government-backed export credit insurance for UK exporters to the country. As part of his ambitious plans to rebuild Lebanon as a regional economic centre, Mr Hariri is also pressing for aid, which so far has come in limited quantities from the west. In the City, he will be encouraging reticent businessmen and financial institutions to re-enter what Lebanese officials believe will become the region's fastest-growing capital market. Above all, Mr Hariri will argue that, since becoming prime minister in October 1992, he has massively boosted Lebanon's confidence in itself. Peace  -agreed between Lebanon's belligerent factions under the 1989 Taif pact, which strengthened Moslem political power at the expense of the Christians, and ensured by the presence of 35,000 Syrian troops - is poised to bloom into economic growth and durable political stability. Lebanon's economic prospects appear to be promising. Since Mr Hariri arrived in Lebanon from Saudi Arabia, where his construction business made him a billionaire, Lebanon's ravaged economy has begun to recover. GDP growth last year was about 7 per cent and the same is expected for 1994. A Dollars 600m balance of payments deficit in 1991 has turned around, to an expected Dollars 1bn surplus for 1993. Mr Riad Salame, Lebanon's central bank governor, says Dollars 7bn of capital which left the country in the 17-year civil war has come back since 1992. But the most prized indicator has been the success this month of the share offer for Solidere, the company Mr Hariri and his advisers created to manage the reconstruction of 1.6m sq metres of central Beirut. The offering, to raise Dollars 650m towards the cost of a 25-year project to create a leisure and commercial district from the rubble of downtown Beirut, was oversubscribed by 42 per cent. According to Mr Nasser Chammaa, Solidere's founding general secretary, more than 90 per cent of the 20,000 subscriptions came from Lebanese nationals, mostly expatriates. Solidere is the pivotal project in Mr Hariri's rehabilitation plans. Mr Chammaa reckons it will create up to 20,000 jobs and could boost GDP by up to 10 per cent over the next few years. Its success raises the prospect of tapping more of the estimated Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn that Lebanese, living in the country or abroad, hold overseas. 'It proves there will be no problem in raising funds for future projects,' says Mr Freddie Baz, adviser to Banque Audi, a Lebanese commercial bank. For its supporters, Solidere epitomises what they call the 'Hariri effect': the confidence generated by the expertise of a man of undoubted commercial acumen. President Elias Hrawi intended precisely that effect when he invited Mr Hariri to form a government in 1992. But some Lebanese are suspicious of Hariri's businessman's approach to government, believing there may be potential conflicts of interest in a construction magnate overseeing Beirut's reconstruction. Most distrustful are those who claim to have been dispossessed by Solidere, which, with government backing, forced the exchange of Dollars 1.17bn worth of shares for the property rights of about 130,000 people owning property in those parts of central Beirut due for development. Hundreds of such people contest Solidere's legality, believing they have a case for its dissolution. 'Not only did they take our land cheaply, they took it against our will,' says Mr Omar Daouk, a litigant whose family has run shops in the area since the 1800s. For many, Mr Hariri's wealth is both a blessing and a bane. It has enabled Mr Hariri to pump-prime Lebanon's economic revival - he subscribed, for example, for 19 per cent of the Solidere shares on issue. It has also allowed him to establish teams of staff, some working apart from government structures, undertaking some central reconstruction tasks. But critics argue that his wealth has enabled him to avoid what they see as necessary reform of Lebanon's government structure. 'He has basically decided the public administration is hopeless, cannot be reformed, and has set up a parallel administration,' says Mr Paul Salem, director of the Lebanese Centre for Policy Studies, an independent think-tank. Nevertheless, even most critics accept Mr Hariri's dynamism and commercial skills offer Lebanon the best hope of recovery from a catastrophic civil war, costing 140,000 lives and prompting 400,000 Lebanese to flee the country. The danger is that Lebanon's redevelopment is seen to rest on Mr Hariri alone. For now, there is nothing to suggest Mr Hariri will go. Few see any domestic political challenge. The peace signed between the Christians and Moslems in 1989 remains in place. Moreover, Mr Hariri retains the confidence of the Syrian government, which continues to keep Lebanon firmly under its control and has deployed 35,000 troops on its soil since the late 1980s. This 'pax Syriana' will remain the most important factor of Lebanon's internal politics for some time. A Syrian-policed peace in Lebanon and the control of such anti-Israeli groups as Hezbollah are seen in Tel Aviv and Washington as important guarantees of success in broader Middle East peace talks. The longer-term political stability which would enable Mr Hariri to fulfil his plans for Lebanon will be influenced primarily, therefore, by what happens in the resumed Washington peace talks rather than anything which might happen at home. In the meantime, Mr Hariri's chief role is to make a success of his rebuilding project at home, while inspiring renewed confidence in Lebanon abroad. If he succeeds, someone might usefully consider removing the Syrian soldier from the door of the Hotel St Georges and start reglazing its windows.</p>

Utter said Valenti brought the craft down on the  northbound lane of the highway, causing traffic delays for about an hour while  a mechanic made preliminary repairs.  </P> <P> The pilot then taxied the helicopter to a nearby clearing, where the repairs  were completed, and flew the craft home an hour later, police said.

The department will also be responsible for reviewing  treatment procedures associated with in-custody patient deaths, according to  county officials.  </P> <P> Health services officials are currently taking steps -- including acquiring  necessary medical records and meeting with sheriff's jail management -- toward  establishing the permanent inmate-death review committee.  </P></p>

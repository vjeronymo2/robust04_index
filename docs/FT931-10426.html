			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cold comfort for Siberia's big earners MR ZIMFIR Yabukov, a 32-year-old engineer, has moved from his home town in the Urals to monitor a gas gathering station in the Yamburg field in western Siberia, where he earns eight times more than he would at home. Mr Yabukov has had to leave his wife and two children at home, 2,000 km away, much to his wife's distress, but he says the salary is so good he will do the job for at least three more years. He is employed by Gazprom, the Russian state gas production company at its Yamburg field inside the arctic circle. The Yamburg settlement where he lives for two weeks before returning on a free flight for two weeks' home leave, has the wild-west feel of a pioneer town. No children under 18 years are allowed at the settlement and few workers bring their wives. Gazprom must pay high salaries and entice its employees with a range of subsidised consumer goods in order to get engineers to work in the harsh conditions where temperatures can fall as low as minus 60 degrees centigrade (-76 F). Yamburg means 'end of the earth' in the language of the local Nenets people. Mr Yabukov's salary has increased sharply in recent years as Gazprom must review payments monthly while inflation in Russia is rampant. His room and board in a employee apartment block are free. Novy Urengoi, also in western Siberia but south of Yamburg, is a full-scale town set up by Gazprom 15 years' ago. Here, salaries are five times those in the rest of the country. Company officials say it was difficult to get people to work in Siberia, but it is getting easier as other companies make engineers redundant.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : FEW STAND STILL FOR BRAZILIAN CARNAVAL AT PALLADIUM  </P> <P> The frigid weather undoubtedly caused some last-minute reconsiderations of  tropical costume themes outside the Hollywood Palladium on Saturday, but things  warmed up considerably on the packed dance floor at the annual Brazilian  Carnaval '89.  </P> <P> It was mainly a grand party -- with face-painting in the lobby, door prizes and  costume contests, green and pink balloons at every table, and several costumes  that barely met the legal requirement for decent exposure. And the party was  savored by the remarkably mixed crowd packing the dance floor -- from young  mothers walking their toddlers to a healthy contingent of men and women with  gray hair in the thick of the action.  </P> <P> The high-energy local group Embra Samba's set sparked long conga lines snaking  through the milling dancers, as the horn section played flashy melodies and  tempo changes by the percussionists signaled the transitions between songs.  </P> <P> In contrast, Martinho da Vila's excellent headlining set strikingly emphasized  the seductive lilt of Brazilian samba. The Brazilian's deep, soothing voice was  suited to the medium tempos, and one measure of his prowess was his success at  commanding the audience's attention for the 20-minute a cappella segment that  opened his hourlong performance.

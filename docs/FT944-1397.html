			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Ben &amp; Jerry shares fall after loss warning Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the US ice-cream company famous for its oddball approach to business, yesterday surprised the stock market by warning that it expected to turn in a net loss of between Dollars 700,000 and Dollars 900,000 in the quarter to December because of a downturn in sales. The company said it had maintained its 42 per cent share of the super premium ice-cream market, but the sector as a whole had shrunk because of exceptionally heavy promotional activity by companies in the premium sector. As a result, the company's sales were down by 5 per cent. Ben &amp; Jerry's shares, which traded at nearly Dollars 34 at the height of the company's growth in 1992, plunged Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 after the announcement. Ben &amp; Jerry, which donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to charity, has grown rapidly since its inception in 1978: it made net profits of Dollars 7.2m on sales of Dollars 140.3m last year. But it has recently been struggling to maintain its momentum. Earlier this year Mr Ben Cohen, one of the founders, announced that he was stepping aside as chief executive and invited applicants to send in essays explaining in 100 words: 'Why I would be a great CEO for Ben &amp; Jerry's'. The job has not yet been filled. Yesterday Mr Chuck Lacy, chief operating officer, said the super premium category had been sluggish this year because of 'unprecedented' promotional activity in the premium sector. In last year's fourth quarter Ben &amp; Jerry's made net profits of Dollars 1.1m.</p>

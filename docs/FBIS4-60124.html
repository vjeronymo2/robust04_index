			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Fatah's Revoulutionary Council at the </F> end of its 12th ordinary session on 16 and 17 May]    [Excerpts] The national liberation movement, Fatah, since  its establishment, has faced great challenges and has  consistently overcome them, and is able, through practice and  the right political standce to adopt a set of principles and a  program which serves the Palestinian people. Our movement  revolted against the reality of the 1967 defeat and adopted the  slogans of the masses to achieve the goals of the masses in  returning and establishing an independent Palestinian state,  with Holy Jerusalem as its capital.    It is normal that global difficulties affected the regional  situation, which made our march a difficult and bitter one,  marked with huge sacrifices. Our march was able to resist  because of the huge sacrifices made by the Mujahid people and  its struggling forces, despite the fact that its achievements  were vulnerable to all means and attempts to dominate and even  destroy them.    Therefore, starting from our conviction for a just and  comprehensive peace, the movement took part in the peace process  approved by the Palestinian National Council, prior to our  delegation leaving for Madrid, putting before our eyes the  objectives of our Palestinian people and with determination to  establish its presence in the midst of these international  changes. [sentence as heard]    The accord which was recently signed in Cairo is a natural  outcome to the struggle of our people and its heavy sacrifices  in the shadow of these accelerating international changes.    The Fatah Movement is confident that our people, wherever  they are, will stand in a single rank in the battle of  construction and building, the battle of building their  independent state as they have always stood during all stages of  the national struggle, one consequence of which is what we have  achieved on the ground in the homeland.    Therefore, the unity of our people is the genuine guarantee  for the success of Palestinian authority and a safe way toward  the realization of an independent Palestinian state, with holy  Jerusalem as its capital.    Therefore, we in the Fatah Movement call upon the Arab  brothers and all friends to stand by us at this fateful moment,  to back us in the building of our state as it is a Pan-Arab  objective, and to firmly establish a just and comprehensive  peace in our area, with all the consequences this will have on  the entire Arab situation. We call for mutual assistance and  solidarity in order to underpin the joint Arab position in the  clash of civilizations in the area.    We in Fatah have waged our sincere and loyal struggle and  our  solid realistic practices for many years. Throughout the long  dialogue with our brothers in the other factions -- even before  their emergence -- it has taken us a long time to convince them  of our work and what we are struggling for. We are now facing  the political battle and creating a new policy in the area in  the shadow of the new international order, the facts and  [?settings] of which rule the entire area.    We are confident that our dialogue with all brothers is to  clarify positions, facts, and variables, and to teach everyone  of their national and Pan-Arab responsibilities, as we did  during the jihad and the armed struggle after the great  achievement at the eternal al-Karamah battle, during which the  Fatah Movement offered the best of its youth and cadres.    We are facing a new era that is taking shape on the ground  and requires every effort and perseverance from everyone. It  requires from us -- after realization of the beginning of the  return with the arrival of the Palestinian security forces in  the homeland -- the rebuilding of the homeland, the  infrastructure, and the creation of work opportunities for our  struggling masses.    One of the main points of strength on which we depend is the  strength of the starting point -- the revolution -- its  achievements and influence on world opinion, the effectiveness  of the blessed Intifadhah, the determination of our Palestinian  people inside the occupied homeland and outside to accomplish  their national objectives, their adherence to unity and  cohesion, and denying the enemies all chances of creating  division and conflicts within their ranks, and attempts to  create alternatives to their leadership.    These points of strength will themselves firmly establish  the  Palestinian people on the map of the Middle East and the world.  However, this by far falls short of their ambitions or rights  and below the requirements of justice. However, it is the  beginning from which we start to work toward the elimination of  the Zionist occupation of our land and to realize our legitimate  rights, according to the resolutions of the United Nations.    The clash between cultures and the competition between  civilizations is a legitimate matter, and it is the real test  for our relations with Israel. We can score some points in this  area.    The world is going through a phase which totally rejects  the policy of no peace, no war. We, as a movement, are required  to take our people out of the tunnel of the Cold War in order to  establish them on the political and geographic map of the region  and the world. The phase of moving to a homeland requires a  definition of the bases and the concept of this move, and of  Fatah's role in the phase which would follow the move to the  homeland. It also requires a definition of Fatah's view of the  principles and provisions of carrying out national duties in  order to build a Palestinian state and a Palestinian society  within the history and civilization of the Palestinian people.  This course is based on its affiliation spiritually,  nationally, and organically to its Arab nation, and on its just  rights to a homeland and free choices of its right to return and  to self-determination.    The Fatah Movement values the great stand taken by the  Egyptian president, Government, and people in supporting the  peace process and hosting the talks on its territory. Fatah  also appreciates the stand of the brotherly Jordanian king,  Government, and people, marked by their persistent support for  the Palestinian issues, the latest of which was facilitating the  crossing of our forces to our dear land.    Also, the stand of the brothers in the Gulf, at the  forefront  of whom are the brothers in Saudi Arabia, led by His Majesty  King Fahd, custodian of the two holy places, who are  transporting our forces from where they are stationed to the  homeland. In addition, there is also the stand of the brothers  in Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Mauritania, Lebanon, and Syria,  who are hosting their Palestinian brothers.    We also send salutations to the sincere brotherly stand of  fraternal Tunisia and its president Zine El Abidine, Zine El  Arab [as heard], its government, and its fraternal people, for  providing all requirements of success for the work and activity  of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and its institutions,  and for its strong support to the Palestinian positions in the  peace process. [passage omitted]    We besiege God to guide our steps on the road to building  our  independent state on our national soil. It is a revolution  until victory.</p>

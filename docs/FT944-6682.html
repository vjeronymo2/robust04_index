			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Senate Republicans start to jockey for position The nascent rivalry between two potential Republican presidential candidates  -Senators Robert Dole and Phil Gramm - could get an early airing this week as the party begins to choose senior congressional leadership positions. Mr Dole is certain to be elected majority leader by his peers on Friday but it is far from clear who will be his number two - Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming or Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. While both are conservative, Mr Lott has made no secret of his support for Mr Gramm's candidacy for the Republican nomination and the Senator from Texas has returned the compliment by openly preferring his Mississippi colleague to be Mr Dole's deputy. Mr Gramm's argument, which he is not shy in expressing, is that if Mr Dole is frequently going to be absent in pursuit of his national ambitions, Mr Lott would be a more effective deputy. Some political observers translate this into the belief that Mr Gramm would urge Mr Lott to undercut the majority leader on key policy issues relevant to the 1996 campaign. The Dole-Simpson connection is based more on a record of pragmatism, plus a shared reputation for being ascerbic. Both support abortion rights, unlike many party dogmatists, while the Senator from Wyoming, probably the leading congressional authority on immigration, is less inclined to take the hard line against all immigration currently popular among right-wing Republicans. Mr Lott also has some history of accommodating party moderates, both in the Senate and as a House whip in the 1980s. In a recent interview Mr Lott urged the conservative forces lined up behind Congressman Newt Gingrich, who is due to be elected next Speaker of the House on January 4, 'to cool their jets a bit.' But he is also contrasting his 'more extensive and personal' relationships with the new House leadership to those of Mr Dole and Mr Simpson. Mr Simpson told the New York Times in typically blunt language that he was the best candidate to combat what he described as the Republicans' 'atavistic desire to clobber themselves when they begin to give each other the saliva test of purity.' The new Republican committee chairmanships in both houses will not be settled until early January. But, over the weekend, Mr Dole pretty much laid to rest flickering speculation that Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina would not take over the foreign relations committee following his extraordinary attacks on President Bill Clinton. 'If you're going to start knocking down seniority,' Mr Dole said, 'there's going to be an avalanche.' This was taken as a clear warning that any challenge to Mr Helms could lead to conservative attempts to oust party moderates in line for committee chairmanships, such as Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island who is due to take over the environment and public works panel. Democrats also have some close leadership contests to decide. The party's House members must decide tomorrow whether to remove two of the old hierarchy, Congressmen Richard Gephardt and David Bonior. They are the outgoing majority leader and chief whip and are under challenge for both positions in the new minority from a pair of southern conservatives, Congressmen Charlie Rose of North Carolina and Charles Stenholm from Texas respectively. A third contest - for chairmanship of the party caucus, pits Congressman Vic Fazio against Kweisi Mfume, now head of the black caucus. On Friday, Senate Democrats will choose a new minority leader from between senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Mr Daschle is the protege of Sen George Mitchell, the outgoing majority leader.</p>

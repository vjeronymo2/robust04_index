			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Maurice Saatchi accepts move to performance pay Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's largest advertising groups, yesterday renounced his five-year rolling contract, worth Pounds 625,000 a year, as part of a move to performance-related pay for its top executives. Mr Saatchi told the group's annual meeting that he was leading by example in his move to a three-year fixed-term contract at a base salary of Pounds 200,000 a year. Additional bonuses will be based on revenue growth and he will also take part in a new performance-related share option scheme which is due to come up for approval at an extraordinary general meeting in the next few months. Mr Saatchi has foregone about half of his entitlement under his contract in recent years. Mr Charles Scott, chief executive, said the company was enjoying the best period of new business in the past four years. 'Revenue growth is essential to the company, and this encouraging trend is an early tangible sign that our operating performance is at last improving.' The group returned to profitability in 1993 for the first time since 1988, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m. However, if currency movements are taken into account, revenue for 1993 was flat. Mr Scott said revenues in 1994 were now expected to be higher than budgeted, although still significantly lower than last year. However, profits would still be higher than 1993 because of cost reductions. 'I am now able to say with confidence that I believe we are on the road to recovery,' he added. The shares rose 8p to close at 141p. Mr Saatchi's new fixed-term contract was met with approval by shareholders at the meeting who also questioned the chairman about the conflict between himself and Mr Scott which surfaced in the press earlier this year. Mr Saatchi said there was a 'capacity for tension' between the roles of chairman and chief executive in any company. The tension had been resolved and had had a 'cathartic effect'. It was also announced yesterday that all board members would stand for re-election every year, instead of the present three years.</p>

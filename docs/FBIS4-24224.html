			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 24 SAPA -- Price stability is the  overall social and economic strategy of President Nelson  Mandela's new government, Finance Deputy Minister Alec Erwin  said Friday [24 June] in Johannesburg.    "We're not just grandstanding for international investors  and  the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Stable prices are  fundamental to this government achieving its objectives," he  told the SA Chamber of Business budget seminar.    Inflation would erode the government's Reconstruction and  Development Programme and impinge more heavily on the people it  was targetted at, the poor.    In addition, industrial restructuring, to improve future  economic growth, could only be successful in a regime of stable  prices. "We all know key industries will have to restructure.  It's not just because we're a member of GATT (the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) but because the economy is just  not going to grow," he said.    He believed the budget presented on Wednesday by Finance  Minister Derek Keys had illustrated the government's commitment  to fiscal discipline and a non-inflationary environment.    In re-ordering government's spending priorities, the  government had succeeded in restraining the overall expenditure  level. "It would have been a fatal mistake to increase our  expenditure. It's much easier to increase your expenditure to  meet your objectives. It's a lot more difficult to re-organise  your current expenditure... But we're not going to spend our way  out of restructuring."    Mr Erwin urged business to now take the lead in boosting  investment within the disciplined fiscal framework. "If we wait  for government to do nicer and nicer things, the economy will  stagnate," he said. You (business) can influence government  decisions by taking your own decisions. This country is going  to have to grow and you have to take the lead."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is an additional report from the Pailin  battlefield on 12 and 13 April.    1. The areas in and around Pailin:    On 12 April, we attacked and seized control of the general  command post of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed  government at Boeng Pralit. Its commander fled back to Pailin.  At 1400 on 12 April, we seized five enemy soldiers and two T-54  tanks.    On the morning of 12 April, we fired at enemy trucks,  damaging two of them and setting two others on fire in the  southern part of Phnum Veng north of Route 10.    Also on 12 April, we set an oil tanker on fire in an area  between Phnum Yat and O Ta Vau.    We still control O Rum-el and Ba Tang So. We have continued  to attack Pailin with infantry forces and artillery fire.    2. On the eastern part of Pailin:    We set another military truck on fire, south of Phnum Srang  hill adjacent to Phnum Veng. All troops on the truck were  killed or wounded.    We continue to control Sala Krau.    Here is the situation on 13 April. The invading forces of  the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government have  begun to collapse bit by bit. They have been plunged into  confusion. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea is  attacking them from all directions. They have run out of  ammunition, food, and medicine. Many of those who were killed or  wounded were left scattered about. Nobody cares about anybody  else. Their supply routes have been cut off completely for  several consecutive days now.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The dilemma over dividends FT-SE Index: 2,562.1 (+0.1) With the FT-SE index despairingly stuck in a narrow 30 point trading range this week, UK dividend policy predictably held centre stage. The early evidence from companies, though, is far from conclusive. If anything, the payouts announced thus far have been a mite more generous than the market expected, the shock of Royal's decision to pass its final mitigated by relief that the Vickers cut was less savage than it might have been, and that Midland's final was held. The mood could change next week, however, when at least 10 of the 17 major companies reporting their results may cut, or at best maintain, their final payouts. It is worth remembering, too, that while most of the attention is focused on the cutters, there is also scope for disappointment from the more robust companies, as Williams Holdings and to a lesser extent SmithKline proved this week. Considerations for the strong are a lower market benchmark, lower inflation, and the cost of replacing cash removed from the business at a time when high real interest rates mean capital is expensive. The question for investors is whether a prospective 5 per cent market yield provides effective underpinning for equities at current levels. The main worry, notably in the financials and capital goods sectors, is dividend cover, which for the market as a whole may drop as low as 1.8 to 1.9 times, against an average of roughly 2.5 times throughout the 1980s. To put this in context, it will take at least three years of double digit earnings growth, and no dividend increases, to restore cover to its former level. The more positive view is that falling inflation puts equities on a prospective real yield of 1-1.5 per cent this year - a phenomenon not seen since the mid-1980s. The trouble is that this will only be reversed by improving prospects for dividends, or a pick-up in inflation, neither of which looks imminent.</p>

Semenchenko; UDC 519.6]    [Abstract] This article gives a brief outline of the  parallel cross sections method implemented on a YeS  multiprocessor computer and presents some results obtained in  experimental calculations. The basic steps taken to solve a  system of linear algebraic equations in this computing system  are described. The system of equations is assumed to include a  packed matrix. The system is pre-ordered, reducing the matrix to  a block-diagonal form with edging. The pre-ordering process is  described. The matrix pre-ordering programs are written in  Fortran. The second step is the construction of matrix blocks.  This is followed by construction of external files of initial  data for the computing system. The results are sent to  arithmetic processors and the pre-ordered system is solved using  special algorithms described in this article. Examples are  presented. Conditions in which this method may be efficiently  used are described. Figures 3; table 1; references 7 (Russian).</p>

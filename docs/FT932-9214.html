			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa recovery continues in first quarter LUFTHANSA, the troubled German state airline, yesterday announced a reduced first-quarter loss and predicted that its loss for this year as a whole would be less than that for 1992. Mr Jurgen Weber said at a press conference that Lufthansa would press on with cost-cutting measures, thus ensuring that the 1993 deficit would be less than last year's pre-tax loss of DM297m (Dollars 186m). This would be Lufthansa's second annual loss reduction. Last year's deficit was DM34m, down from the DM331m pre-tax loss of 1991. Mr Weber's oft-vaunted goal is to return the airline to the black by 1995. In the first three months of the current year, the airline's group loss narrowed to DM245m, down from DM386m in the first three months of last year. The improvement was exaggerated by the effect of changes in the way of accounting for depreciation, which benefited the figures by DM95m. But there was a significant increase in capacity utilisation as the airline increased its load factors in both freight and passenger business. Costs dropped by 3.3 per cent for the quarter, reflecting a 6 per cent reduction in staff levels to 48,251 employees from 51,335. Personnel costs dropped by 7.6 per cent to DM1.08bn from DM1.17bn. Mr Weber vowed to continue with cost-cutting over the course of the year, but voiced the by-now familiar complaint that the government - which owns 51 per cent of the airline - should help to make the group more efficient. He reiterated his condemnation of US air transport policy, which he said encouraged bankrupt companies to survive under Chapter 11 arrangements (which protect insolvent companies from creditors) and to 'ruin the market with dumping prices'.</p>

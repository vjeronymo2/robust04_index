			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets: Clarke's move leaves dealers guessing - London Well, he finally did it. The half-percentage-point increase in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent announced on Monday by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was the first rise in UK interest rates for nearly five years. This assumes, of course, that memory casts a discreet veil over the two panic increases in base rates announced almost exactly two years ago, on September 16 - the day Britain was pushed out of the European exchange rate mechanism by the weight of international speculation against the pound. On that fateful Wednesday - Black or White now, according to personal taste  -rates were pushed up from 10 per cent to first 12 and then 15 per cent, before Clarke's predecessor, Norman Lamont, admitted defeat. The fall in interest rates to 6 per cent over the following four months, and the substantial devaluation of sterling, fuelled a 1,200-point rally in the FT-SE 100 which only peaked February this year, when the index touched 3,491.5. This week's confirmation that the UK interest rate cycle has finally turned upwards received a much more muted and uncertain response from the equity market than Britain's escape from the deflationary shackles of the ERM. Partly this was because Clarke wrong-footed traders. When the previous week's meeting between the chancellor and Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, passed off without an announcement, the City assumed that base rates would not increase before next month at the earliest. Clarke said he had decided to raise rates 'to take no risks with inflation' at a time of strong economic growth. No one can remember when a UK government last tightened monetary conditions while retail price inflation is subdued. Underlying inflation, at 2.2 per cent in July, was at a 27-year low. The chancellor said he was looking 12 to 18 months ahead and was determined to keep the recovery healthy and lasting. This was well received on Monday and the FT-SE 100 made up more than half an early 25-point loss to finish 10.5 points down at 3,128.8. The chancellor's move lost some its shine on Wednesday. A jump in August's inflation figures and an unexpectedly sharp drop in unemployment raised suspicions that the base rate cut was not nearly as far-sighted and pre-emptive as Clarke had suggested. The prospect of the need for further base rate increases prompted a sharp decline in share and bond prices, with the FT-SE 100 falling 41.6 points to close the day at 3,079.8. The market recovered 32.9 points on Thursday, when news of a drop in retail sales last month allayed concerns that another base rate increase would soon be necessary. But the FT-SE 100 again lost ground yesterday when a surge in US production and capacity utilisation figures triggered talk of an imminent increase in US interest rates. One reason for investors' erratic response is growing unease about the relative valuation of equities, compared with gilts. The ratio of bond to equity yields in the UK is at a historically high 2.3 times. That can be justified only so long as companies deliver strong growth in earnings and dividends, which may become more difficult now that Clarke has started to apply the brakes to the economic recovery - however gently. Few industrialists think a half-percentage-point increase will make a crucial difference in the long run, but the effect on sentiment could be significant. The 0.3 per cent drop in retail sales between July and August shows that consumer confidence remains fragile. The chart illustrates one reason: the increase in average earnings, adjusted for increased taxes and prices, has been lagging behind the growth in retail sales since early 1993. One of the UK's largest retail groups, Kingfisher - which includes B &amp; Q, Comet, Superdrug and Woolworths - this week reported a 7.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits but admitted the results were less than satisfactory. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, said he remained cautious about UK retail markets. Alan Smith, chief executive, said Kingfisher's priorities were to improve ranges, value for money and service. Cost-cutting would continue and some job losses would result. He said it would take time to implement Kingfisher's Everyday Low Pricing strategy - permanently lower prices, leading to higher sales and profits - throughout the group. Such an approach may bode well for the inflation outlook, but it is not an easy environment for companies to make money in. APV, the food processing equipment specialist, said the threat to profits margins been increased by the pressure which retailers in Europe and the US are putting on the group's main customers, the leading food processors. The chancellor is clearly determined to avoid having to choke off an overheating economy in the run-up to the next election. He has therefore signalled his intention to keep control of inflation - even if that entails some risk of slowing the recovery. With the peak of the interim reporting season passed, analysts will have fewer indications of how companies are coping in this new world of rising raw material prices, reluctant consumers and squeezed profit margins. Yesterday's concern over a possible increase in US interest rates took the FT-SE 100 down 47.6 points to close the week 3,065.1. Some analysts are still sticking with year-end forecasts of up to 3,500, but those now look extremely ambitious. Brokers still expect strong dividend growth over the next couple of years, but equities are unlikely to advance much until the turbulence in the international bonds market calms.</p>

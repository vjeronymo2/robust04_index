			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Hoechst hit by further toxic mishap A CLOUD of acid fumes leaked from the main plant at Hoechst yesterday, the ninth time in five weeks the German chemical company has suffered a toxic mishap, AP reports from Frankfurt. Fumes from the acid apparently escaped over a neighboring residential area, said Frankfurt police spokesman Manfred Feist. Residents were warned to stay indoors. Hoechst spokesman Mr Hartmut Hennen confirmed the accident but said it was unclear how much toxic material leaked from the plant or how it happened. He said the gas consisted of a concentrated form of sulphuric acid that is irritating to the eyes and throat. Hoechst is one of the world's biggest chemical, textile and pharmaceutical companies, with production facilities in more than 60 countries and exports to 170. The company's main Frankfurt operations had a spotless safety record for years until February 22, when a cloud of toxic chemicals leaked over the city. Seven other accidents quickly followed, including a methanol tank explosion that killed a worker last month and seriously injured another. Hoechst's string of mishaps have spurred calls in Germany for closer monitoring of environmental safeguards at private industries.</p>

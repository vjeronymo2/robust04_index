			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 21 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI  newspaper prints a series of articles by Russian intellectuals  under the general heading "Who Will Not Kill War, Will Be Killed  by War". They explain why they signed the social accord treaty.    Here is what actor Mikhail Ulyanov, chairman of the  Theatrical Artists' Union, says in this connection: "Men of  culture and arts are sons and daughers of their people, who sing  their songs, guess their thoughts, protect their interests and  laud the homeland.    "But they need peace to do all this. If it brings our  society even by a jot to wisdom, calm and accord, we must sign  this document."    Noting that ceremonies of signing the above treaty continue  in the Kremlin, the TRUD newspaper deplors that events which  took place in the country last week, "happened not in line" with  this agreement.    Writing about the declared all-Russian strike of civil  aviators (although most flights were made according to  schedule), the newspaper notes that even if politicians agree on  a temporary moratorium in the struggle for power, "it is highly  improbable that armistice will come into effect in the social  sphere in the near future, since the social and economic  situation is not improving."    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper singles out the events in and  outside the Crimea. "If a conflict flares up, it will eclipse in  its scale everything we encountered before," the newspaper  claims in its commentary. "Because it will inevitably involve  the Black Sea Fleet which has not been divided up to this time."    The newspaper expresses hope that the worst forecasts "will  not come true and that the recent contacts between the Russian  and Ukrainian presidents will calm down the situation".    At the same time, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA draws a parallel between  the situation in the Crimea and the one which preceded "the  bloody and protracted wars in Karabakh, Abkhazia and the  Dniester area".    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA calls attention to a decision taken  on Friday by the Crimean parliament to reinstate the  constitution of 1992, pointing that its many provisions are at  variance with the Ukrainian Constitution and the hitherto  operating fundamental law of the Crimea Republic.    The newspaper carries an interview with Lilya Budzhurova, a  Crimean parliament member from the Council of Crimean Tatars,  claiming that Crimean parliamentarians "made the first step to  destabilise the political situation not only in the Crimea but  in Ukraine as whole".    According to Budzhurova, this "will be a conflict not only  between the Crimea and Ukraine: Russia will be also drawn into  it".    The same newspaper concentrates on preliminary results of a  successful operation carried out by law enforcement officers on  may 19 to free hostages from a currency exchange point captured  by criminals on the Frunzenskaya Embankment in Moscow.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper notes in an article about  privileges that the government appropriated over nine times more  funds than last year "for the medical centre at the Russian  Government", despite a very modest increase in outlays for the  country's public health.    Nearly 24 billion roubles or 6.7 per cent of all  appropriations for public health, the newspaper continues, "will  be used to treat the bureaucratic elite of the poor state".  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA sums up by saying that "the struggle  started against privileges can be regarded as completed ...  with a victory of the privileged".    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA prints a full text of explanations  given by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy at the Moscow  prosecutor's office in connection with directions given by  acting Prosecutor-General of Russia Ilyushenko to examine  legality of public statements by opposition leaders on May 9 and  14, current.    The newspaper singles out Rutskoy's words that to change  radically the present situation in the country, "we now need a  new idea, a spiritual and moral idea meeting the interests of  people and homeland".    In turn, the PRAVDA newspaper summarises the above  explanations by Rutskoy where he claims that "President  Yeltsin's autocratic regime is now reigning the country".    The newspaper features an article on unemployment in Russia.  "Although 1,400,000 people receive officially unemployment  benefits in Russia, according to various but concurring  estimates, between 15 and 20 million people (20-25 per cent of  all labour force) work part-time or do not receive wages at  all," PRAVDA writes.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Property: Tax farming - an old crop is revived / Gerald Cadogan finds that the price of the rich soil of England is rising Last year was one of the cheeriest for farmers for a long time. They made profits. How 1994 will be, it is too early to judge as little has happened down on the farm except lambing. In the short-term, prospects look good. But it is not clear what the effect will be of the European Union review of its Common Agricultural Policy in 1996. UK land prices have risen, but, even though insurance companies and pension funds have been disinvesting for several years, the market echoes the groan from the residential market: 'There is not enough for sale.' The turnaround came with Black Monday in September 1992. As the pound fell against the European Currency Unit, CAP payments to farmers rose by around 20 per cent. Helped by lower interest rates on overdrafts, farming swung into profit. The other development was the change in 1992 in inheritance tax. Under certain circumstances agricultural land qualifies for 100 per cent relief where before the ceiling was 50 per cent. These changes govern the market. The green Ecu, which is what CAP support prices are set in, is worth about 92p. In August 1992, when land prices were at their lowest, it was 80p and its peak since Britain left the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was 98p. The typical price for bare land (meaning free of houses, cottages and other buildings) in the south of England peaked at around Pounds 2,000 an acre in the late 1980s, fell to Pounds 1,000, and has recovered to around Pounds 1,250 with considerable variations. (At such a price, a yield of 6-7 per cent is quite feasible.) Near Grimsby in Humberside, Walter's recently sold 450 acres in lots, some for 25 per cent above the guide price of Pounds 1,500. Andrew Macpherson of Clegg Kennedy Drew reports bare land going for around Pounds 1,600 an acre in the sale of the Exton Grange estate in Lincolnshire which is currently being agreed. The land figure is 'at least 20 per cent higher than we would have achieved 12 months previously'. Many of the buyers are neighbouring farmers who want to increase their acreage to take best advantage of the CAP payments. Some, says Rupert Bradstock, of buying agent Property Vision, are charitable trusts, attracted by the yield and the security. In effect, they are following the ancient pattern of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges, who have disinvested far less than the insurance companies and other financial institutions. Jim Ward, of Savills Agricultural Research, estimates that those institutions released about 50,000 acres in 1993 (as in 1992) and that their holdings have shrunk from a peak of 500,000 acres to about 200,000. Eagle Star is selling the Dunley estate in north Hampshire between Winchester and Newbury. The estate is 2,136 acres and includes 1,600 acres of arable land and a first-class pheasant shoot. The guide price from Strutt &amp; Parker and Smiths Gore is Pounds 3.5m for the whole. Interest is 'staggering', says James Laing of Strutt &amp; Parker. Also in Hampshire, Hays Farms (Hursley) is for sale. This subsidiary of Hays plc has a company tenancy of 5,500 acres and 34 dwellings from property company St Martin's. Savills must receive tenders by May 31. Foreign buyers, with the exception of some Danes and Dutch eager to farm in the UK, look for sporting estates. British buyers now include the rich eager to take advantage of the new inheritance tax rules. Sell a house in the English home counties, says Christopher Wilson of buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, and put the proceeds into a farm with vacant possession. Work it for two years, perhaps by contracting out, and IHT will vanish. His firm and accountants Grant Thornton have formed a 'City landowners service' to handle this sort of work. To qualify for the IHT exemption, you must be using the land to make a profit. That could include a sporting estate, as long it is not just for the owner's recreation, says Bradstock. But the value of the house and the value of the land must balance so that the Revenue will not regard the farming as just a ploy to escape IHT. Bradstock suggests 500 acres as a minimum. Laing fears that some owners - or their heirs - may receive a shock when the large house is refused exemption. The law's emphasis on proper husbandry mirrors best farming practice. There is no point going into farming, unless you are committed. It is often frustrating, which is why farmers are traditionally moaners. And it needs time and capital. That is why most farmers want to pass the business on to their children. A successful recent sale was Jays Farm at Roundhurst, a smallholding of 162 acres near Haslemere in Surrey, which Hamptons Messenger May sold at auction for Pounds 433,500. At the beginning of the year Count Christoph Grots and German investors put together an estate in east Norfolk that had been split more than 100 years ago. Deciding to buy the 2,090 acre Burnley Hall estate (which includes 580 acres of Grade 1 silt land), they asked Royal Life about adding the adjacent 930 acre (all Grade I silt) Winterton and Somerton estate. The total bill was nearly Pounds 6m for some of the best land in the country (Grade I Silt land in Norfolk is about Pounds 2,250 an acre) which also has the first wind farm in East Anglia. Brown &amp; Co was selling agent for both estates. An estate in east Norfolk, on the market for the first time since 1640, (when the Preston family bought it) is Beeston Hall with 570 acres and pheasant and duck shooting. No footpaths or rights of way cross the estate. The house is Georgian Gothic. This attractive morsel is priced at Pounds 1.5m from Francis Hornor or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. In south Humberside, Savills is selling the 1834-acre Worlaby estate, with its Georgian house and a 16,000-bird poultry unit, for about Pounds 3m. The sale of Tonge's Farm in Lincolnshire will be a good test of the market, Robert Hindle of agent Walter's says. It is the first commercial farm for sale in the area for some time, and has 3.5m tonnes of sand and gravel to offer as well as the arable land. He has already sent out more than 600 sets of particulars. The guide price is Pounds 1.29m. Tenders are due on Thursday. So farms are coming to market, even if some farmers have decided not to sell but pass the farm to the children. Strutt &amp; Parker reports instructions on 34 farms across the country totalling almost 20,000 acres, as against 25 farms and 12,000 acres a year ago. Some buyers are happy to purchase farms with sitting tenants (who are otherwise well placed to buy themselves out). And with less pressure from the banks to sell land to reduce the overdraft, those who do sell are in a strong position.

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Former Gulf Group chairman remanded Mr Abbas Gokal, former chairman of the Gulf Group shipping organisation, was remanded in custody by City of London magistrates yesterday after UK authorities investigating the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International charged him with six offences of fraud. Mr Gokal was extradited from Frankfurt on Thursday after a request from the government on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office. He was arrested by German police in July. He was escorted to the UK by City of London police and formally charged on two counts of conspiracy to defraud, one of conspiracy to account falsely and three of false accounting. The charges of conspiracy to defraud allege that Mr Gokal conspired with his brothers Mustafa and Murtaza Gokal, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the former BCCI chairman, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief executive, and others to defraud BCCI investors and shareholders between 1985 and 1991. It is alleged that this was done by Mr Gokal and others concealing the true nature of the relationship between BCCI and Gulf Group, creating companies to fraudulently receive funds from BCCI, creating documents to facilitate fraudulent transactions, falsely procuring the signatures of Gulf Group employees, preventing the BCCI auditors doing their job properly and arranging false payments into the Gulf Group accounts to give the auditors the impression that its loan exposure had been reduced. The charge of conspiracy to account falsely alleges that between 1985 and 1991 Mr Gokal conspired with Mr Abedi, Mr Naqvi and others to falsify documents relating to Gulf Group and obtaining signatures by deception. The three false accounting charges allege that in 1988 Mr Gokal falsified letters of instruction which suggested that three money transfers totalling Dollars 3.8m were bona fide. Mr Gokal was remanded in custody until December 13.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, KOHL DRAFT KEY COMPROMISES;  </P> <P> SUMMIT: AGREEMENTS ON SOVIET AID, GLOBAL WARMING AND TRADE ARE LIKELY TO SHAPE  THE 7-NATION DECLARATION.  </P> <P> Faced with the threat of divisive conflicts, President Bush and West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl forged a series of tentative compromises Monday on the  major issues facing the economic summit: aid to the Soviet Union, global  warming and trade.  </P> <P> Meeting privately in advance of the formal opening of the summit, the two  leaders engaged in a high-stakes round of horse-trading that appears likely to  shape the final declaration that the seven summit nations will issue at the  conclusion of their meetings here Wednesday.  </P> <P> The agreements are the most tangible result to date of the "special  relationship" that aides to both men say Bush and Kohl have forged in recent  months.  </P> <P> The overall shape of the deal appears to give Kohl most of what he wanted on  financial aid to the Soviets, which he has favored and Bush has opposed. In  return, West Germany made concessions to the United States on trade and the  environment, including a major pullback on global warming that deeply  disappointed environmental activists here.  </P> <P> "It's the Bush-Kohl special relationship aided by Germany's victory in the  World Cup," said one senior Administration official, referring to the  quadrennial soccer championship won Sunday by the West German national team  over Argentina. "It never hurts to catch people when they're up."  </P> <P> After formal welcoming ceremonies featuring 21-gun salutes and Army drill teams  in colonial uniforms marching under a blazingly hot and humid Texas sky, the  leaders of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, West Germany and the United  States began their first summit sessions behind closed doors on the campus of  Rice University.  </P> <P> They followed the afternoon session with an elegant dinner and returned to work  Monday night.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the proposed compromise worked out by Bush and Kohl, aid to  the Soviet Union -- unpopular in the United States, especially with Bush's  conservative supporters -- would be linked with the more politically palatable  idea of aid to the new non-Communist governments of Eastern Europe, U.S. and  West German officials said.  </P> <P> The allies would create an umbrella aid program for nominally collective  action, but each of the Western nations and Japan would be free to choose for  itself which nations to help. Bush, an Administration official said, planned to  present the idea formally to the full summit at the dinner meeting Monday  night.  </P> <P> On global warming, West Germany had been pushing for a summit declaration that  would have committed the seven nations to "clear reductions" in emissions of  carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" that are considered the chief  causes of a slow but ominous warming of the Earth's climate.  </P> <P> Bush has opposed any such declaration, and, in the strongest public statement  yet of the Administration's opposition, White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu in the morning denounced as a threat to economic growth the efforts to  mandate reduced carbon dioxide levels.  </P> <P> "Any growth at all, then, would not be permitted," Sununu said.  </P> <P> West German officials rejected that argument. Kohl had told Bush in their  meeting that "there is no contradiction between global environmental protection  and growth," West German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel told reporters.  </P> <P> But in Monday's meeting, Bonn agreed to back away from the declaration that it  had sought, settling instead for a joint plan by the industrial world to help  Brazil preserve its Amazon rain forest. The vast rain forest ecosystem plays a  major role in stabilizing carbon dioxide levels worldwide.  </P> <P> West German officials provided the outline of the new arrangement to reporters,  and American officials later confirmed it.  </P> <P> Environmentalists, who had been counting on German support for a major effort  to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, denounced the deal.  </P> <P> "It would be a gross disappointment," said Daniel Becker, a spokesman here for  the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> Although preserving the Brazilian rain forest has been a major priority for  environmentalists, the trade-off of strong measures to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions in the industrial world is too high a price to pay, environmental  activists here said, especially since it is not clear how significant the  preservation effort would turn out to be.  </P> <P> U.S. and West German officials were meeting late Monday night in efforts to  flesh out the details of the rain forest proposal and final compromise language  on the overall issue of global warming.  </P> <P> On trade, West Germany also made a concession, agreeing on a framework for  negotiating reductions in agricultural subsidies that U.S. officials had  favored. Agricultural subsidies have been the chief problem for negotiators in  the current round of international talks aimed at reducing global trade  barriers.  </P> <P> To the Administration, farm subsidies and related programs have stood as a  major barrier to the exporting of agricultural products to Europe and Japan by  less-developed nations -- and by American farmers. Unless the industrialized  nations are willing to open their agricultural markets to producers in other  countries, it is argued, the poorer nations will be unable to buy the  industrial products produced in Europe and Japan.  </P> <P> Conversely, failure to make progress on agriculture could set off protectionist  retaliation among the less-developed nations. No less important to the  Administration, such protectionism would prove costly to American farmers, who  are among the world's most efficient producers and thus can profit from free  markets for agriculture.  </P> <P> Aid to the Soviets dominated the Bush-Kohl meeting, as it has the public  discussion before the summit, according to German officials.  </P> <P> Kohl, said one official, emphasized to Bush that in the past "we spent  tremendous sums to protect the world against Soviet expansion." Now, for "just  a tiny fraction" of those sums, the Western nations can ensure a Soviet  transition to democracy, the official quoted Kohl as adding.  </P> <P> Under those conditions, aid "lies in our common interest," the official said.  </P> <P> The West German proposal to link Soviet and Eastern European aid has grown out  of West Germany's experience in the last few months of incorporating the East  German economy, West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said. The  economies are so intertwined that "you can't do it in Central Europe without  aiding the Soviets," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, the proposal provides substantial political benefits. By  linking aid to the Soviet Union with aid to Eastern and Central Europe, as the  Germans are understood to have proposed, the summit would preserve the  appearance of unity among the major industrial powers while giving Bush  protection from conservatives who oppose any assistance to the Soviets.  </P> <P> On the environment, the summit had been heading for a major confrontation in  which the United States would have been alone in opposing measures being sought  by Kohl and other European leaders.  </P> <P> At last year's summit, the leaders of the seven major industrial powers  announced that they "strongly advocate common efforts" to limit emissions of  carbon dioxide and other gases that are believed responsible for an apparent  slow but ominous warming of the Earth's climate.  </P> <P> Carbon dioxide is released whenever anything is burned. The use of oil, coal  and wood for energy, coupled with the cutting of tropical forests, are believed  to be the chief man-made causes of an increase in carbon dioxide production  worldwide.  </P> <P> This year, Kohl had been urging that the summit go much further. In a letter to  the other six summit participants late last month, the text of which was  released Monday, Kohl called for "internationally binding regulations" to limit  carbon dioxide emissions "at the earliest possible date."  </P> <P> The West German government, he noted, has pledged that by 2005 it will reduce  Germany's production of carbon dioxide to a level 25% lower than current  amounts. Britain, which has largely aligned itself with Germany on the issue,  has made a somewhat less dramatic pledge, to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions  at the 1990 level.  </P> <P> But while the European sense of urgency on the issue has increased over the  last year, the Bush Administration has headed in the other direction. Bush's  major advisers, led by Sununu, insist that scientific evidence of the causes  and effects of global warming are too sketchy to justify potentially costly  actions to reduce the use of fossil fuels.  </P> <P> Sununu and Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, have both  made public statements in recent weeks harshly critical of environmentalists  for advocating positions that, they say, would stifle economic growth. The  European emphasis on global warming is a result of "emotional responses" and  the strength of environmentalist political parties, Sununu said in a Cable News  Network interview Saturday.  </P> <P> On Monday, before the Bush-Kohl meeting, Sununu told reporters that "the words  that people are seeking" for the final summit communique would damage both the  United States and the developing nations of the Third World. "Any growth at all  would not be permitted."  </P> <P> Moreover, Sununu insisted, efforts to combat global climate change by focusing  on human activities are misguided because "96% of the carbon dioxide that flows  into the atmosphere comes from natural sources."  </P> <P> Environmental activists were quick to denounce Sununu's statement, likening it  to former President Ronald Reagan's well-known 1980 campaign remark about air  pollution being caused by trees.  </P> <P> In fact, Sununu's statistics are technically correct: The vast bulk of carbon  dioxide emitted into the atmosphere does come from natural processes,  everything from the breath exhaled by every animal to the decaying of leaves on  a forest floor.  </P> <P> But over the ages, those natural emissions have been balanced by other natural  processes that absorb carbon dioxide. What has changed has been a rapid  increase in human activities that add to the carbon dioxide put into the  atmosphere, along with a parallel reduction in nature's ability to  counterbalance the increase.  </P> <P> Trees and other green plants absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, but  worldwide deforestation has reduced the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon  dioxide.  </P> <P> The 4% of carbon dioxide coming from man-made sources that Sununu referred to  has been enough to cause a noticeable increase in the levels of the gas in the  atmosphere. Many scientific studies indicate that because carbon dioxide tends  to trap heat, the result has been to warm the Earth, a process that eventually  could cause dramatically damaging changes in sea levels, agriculture and  weather patterns.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: A10  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUSH AND KOHL: HORSE-TRADING IN HOUSTON  </P> <P> President Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl resolved three major  issues in talks before the formal opening of the Houston summit:  </P> <P> Soviet aid: Agreed to link aid to Moscow with support for the new non-Communist  regimes of Eastern Europe. The allies would create an umbrella program for  collective action, but each would be free to choose which nations to help.  </P> <P> Global warming: Agreed to help Brazil preserve its Amazon rain forest.  </P> <P> Trade: Agreed on a framework for negotiating cuts in agricultural subsidies,  the key problem for negotiators in international talks aimed at reducing trade  barriers.  </P></p>

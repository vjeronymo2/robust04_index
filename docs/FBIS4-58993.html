			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "US and Super 301"] </F>   [Text] The Indian Government cannot be blamed if it  despairs of pumping sense and sensitivity into the Clinton  Administration. In keeping with the Superman syndrome by which  it is possessed, the US is once again raring to upset the  applecart by threatening India with imposition of sanctions  under the Super 301 law for its alleged failure on a variety of  counts which properly fall within the mandate of the World Trade  Organisation (WTO). The US has thus cocked its snook at the  nearly 120 plenipotentiaries who gathered at Marrakesh barely 8  few weeks ago to issue a solemn Ministerial Declaration. The  signatories were enjoined, with immediate effect and until the  WTO came formally into being, not to take any unilateral trade  measures or sanctions that would detract from the sanctity of  the Final Act and start a bush fire of protectionism. The  Clinton Administration has reportedly assured the US Congress in  effect that, whatever the Final Act may permit or prohibit, the  US will continue to have the cake and eat it as well by grabbing  all the goodies of GATT and by imposing unilateral sanctions  whenever it felt so disposed.    The US has backtracked to the extent of holding the Super  301  steps against India in abeyance for two months, hoping no doubt  for applause for small mercies. Actually, the deferment is true  to the pattern of `say (or do) now, think later' that is now  governing the conduct of the US. Slowing down on Super 301 must  have been the result of its suddenly dawning on US officials  that the Indian Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, is slated  to visit their country in mid May. Invoking Super 301 just a  few weeks before his visit, ostensibly for friendly exchange of  views with the US President, would have been, even for the US,  an act of insufferable boorishness. But that does not, by any  means, take away the sting. Mr. Rao will be left in no doubt,  implied or otherwise of the Damocles' sword hung over his head,  as a way of warning `or else'. The US has been making no  allowances at all for the susceptibilities of others, whether it  is China, Japan, North Korea or India, and insisting on having  things its way. Like a spoilt child, it expects unquestioned  submission to its dictates from the rest of the world. Thereby,  it has been throwing to the four winds not just diplomatic  niceties but the time-honoured, sacrosanct virtue of good  neighbourliness marked by consideration and accommodation. One  is really puzzled as to what to make of all this. Being left  with no counterweight on the world balance after the collapse of  the Soviet Union, does the US feel free to go on a rampage at  will? Has some undiagnosed paranoia taken hold of some of the  Administration functionaries, unversed in the art of  international relations, and do they feel continually insecure  without flexing their muscles? Whatever it is, what is being  witnessed is the worst possible manifestation of the old chant:  what is good for the General Motors is good for America and what  is good for America is good for all the world!    So much the pity. For, the US is still the world's exemplar  in the openness of its society and the lively, forthcoming and  open nature of its people. Its instincts are generous as when it  went all out for saving the world from Hitler or poured billions  of dollars as part of the Marshall Plan. It has been foremost  in rushing to the succour of nations in the grip of famine and  starvation. It has given refuge to thousands fleeing from  oppression and persecution. A country with such high credentials  as a free society, as a democracy and as a friend of the world's  needy and hungry has no reason at all to abandon grace and throw  its weight about.    All that apart, the question of questions now is: With the  US in no mood to make amends but, on the contrary, being prone  to indulge in rude antics, should the Prime Minister visit the  US as scheduled? Or should he call off the trip? How will he  look if, without even waiting for his back to turn, the US  clamps Super 301 or does something equally offensive? The US  itself in the past thought nothing of blackballing the leaders  of the countries for some real or fancied slight. When Lal  Bahadur Shastri had the temerity to comment on American  intervention in Vietnam some weeks before a planned official  visit to the US, President Johnson called it off abruptly  without any compunction. Mr. Rao will do well to think twice  about the heavy price he and the country may have to pay just  for the pleasure of a photo session with President Clinton.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: C&amp;W/AT&amp;T AT&amp;T's international alliance has caused disarray in Cable &amp; Wireless's ranks. Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, was almost sucked into AT&amp;T's Worldsource grouping. Hongkong Telecom, a 57.5 per cent owned subsidiary, may yet join. All this puts a big question mark over C&amp;W's strategy of maintaining its independence from the three big telecoms alliances formed in recent months. Its own plan is to form a 'federation' by knitting together its multitude of stakes in telecoms operators scattered across the globe. The snag is not simply that members of the federation are doubtful of its value. Investors attribute no value to it either. C&amp;W is viewed like an investment trust, with the group's market Pounds 9.3bn capitalisation roughly Pounds 2bn less than the sum of its parts. There are several ways C&amp;W could realise greater value. One would be to demerge C&amp;W into its constituent parts. Another would be to beef up the federation so that it becomes a serious fourth alliance. It is hard to see how this can be done without a more substantial presence in the US long-distance market. There is not much left to buy and C&amp;W could end up paying over the odds. Much wiser would be to do what Sprint and MCI have done and sell a minority share of itself to a foreign sugar daddy at a handsome premium. AT&amp;T still looks the best candidate. But if the Baby Bells are freed to enter the US long-distance market as expected, they could play that role too.</p>

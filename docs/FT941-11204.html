			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Moving into a new and bigger league The unprecedented demand for shares in the European privatisation trusts being launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management is good news for both fund management groups. Managing such large amounts of money, however, could bring its problems, particularly if the managers were not expecting to be operating on that scale. Between them, the two trusts will be bigger than all the existing UK-listed general European investment trusts put together. The largest fund in the sector at the moment is the Fleming Continental European fund, with assets of Pounds 236.3m. Mercury has more than Pounds 55bn of assets under management, while Kleinwort Benson has Pounds 12bn. Although neither group has an existing European investment trust, both have unit trusts in that area. Their performance is largely lacklustre. Kleinwort Benson's European trust, which had assets of Pounds 104m at the end of last year, ranked 103 out of 125 in its sector in the year to January 1, and 78 out of 92 over five years. Kleinwort's European Special trust is smaller, at about Pounds 20m, but its performance record is similar. Mercury's European Growth trust, which has assets of Pounds 203.5m, ranked 51 over one year and 42 over five years. The Mercury New Europe trust, run by the same manager as the privatisation trust, Mr Paul Harwood, was only launched in March 1992, but ranked a slightly more encouraging 13 over one year. It has a net asset value of more than Pounds 40m. Mr Harwood has been specialising in European equities since 1991, but before that his career at Mercury and Newton Investment Management was mostly in UK equities and fixed interest. He will be assisted by Mercury's 15-person European team, who are also responsible for the unit trusts and institutional funds. The day-to-day manager and stock selector for the Kleinwort trust is to be Ms Vicky Sleddon. She has been working in European equities since 1990, managing institutional equity accounts, a Spanish equity fund and a convertible bond fund, but this is her first large European retail fund. Overall investment strategy will be the responsibility of Mr Kenneth King, head of international equities. He has been at Kleinwort since 1989, and was previously with NM Rothschild.</p>

The world has entered the post-Cold War period, an age  of new great changes, also bringing international competition to  a new stage. In this age of transition to a new century, the  international test of overall national might based on S&amp;T is  growing increasingly sharper, with all countries engaged in this  competition going all out to keep from being left behind. As  this race is essentially an economic one, economics is  increasingly becoming the fundamental factor in international  competition. This is precisely why the economic relations  among countries is acquiring an ever more prominent status in  international relations, with a country's foreign affairs  evolving increasingly into economic diplomacy. Matters such as  social stability, national might, foreign relations,  international standing, national self-esteem, and cultural  endurance are all closely tied to economic development. In  this age of internationalization and growing economic importance  that is so full of challenges and opportunities, we need even  more so to evaluate China's development in the context of the  overall order of world development, as well as evaluating  China's administrative reform in the context of the overall  order of China's social development, which is the only way to  see clearly certain matters of fundamental importance.    In our over a decade of reform and opening since the late  1970s, Chinese society has undergone enormous changes. Whether  in economics, politics, and culture or in systems, mechanisms,  and concepts, we have experienced a process of profound change.  Chinese society is now in a period of full-scale conversion.  This social transformation can be seen in the following:    1. The conversion from a planned to a market  economy. We are converting the decisionmaking on our  disposition of resources from planning to markets. In a planned  economy, as production factors such as capital, technology, and  labor are planned and set by governments at all levels based on  subordinate relations, forcing and making it possible only for  enterprises to carry out their production activities in  accordance with the orders of the government departments  responsible for them, a planned economy is actually a command  economy. But in a market economy, as factors such as capital,  technology, and labor are organized in an optimum fashion by  markets, with enterprises carrying out production activities  according to market signals, there is a more efficient  disposition of resources. This is a great conversion of our  economic system and its operating forces.    2. The transformation from an agricultural to an  industrial society. This transformation is symbolized by  the steady drop in the percentage of our GNP made up by  agriculture, accompanied by a rapid upswing in the percentage  accounted for by industrial output value, with the sudden coming  to the fore as a new force of township enterprises sharply  accelerating this transformation. As our agricultural  productivity grows, our rural areas are experiencing a large  amount of surplus labor. As urbanization accelerates, our rural  and urban populations are in a state of one declining while the  other grows.    3. The conversion from a closed to an open  society. China's closed society used to be reflected in two  areas. 1. We were closed to the outside world, unilaterally  emphasizing independence and self-sufficiency free from  international competition, resulting in a steadily widening gap  with advanced international levels. 2. We were closed  internally, with industries, systems, and regions closed off  from each other, responsible only to superiors in various  subordinate relationships, and taking orders from superiors  instead of conducting lateral economic intercourse, which  violated the laws of general socialized production, and created  a huge waste of resources. But through over a decade of reform,  Chinese society today is in a state of openness in all  directions, both internally and to the outside world.    4. The transformation from an ethical to a legal  society. In an ethical society, social behavior is largely  standardized by family bloodlines and marriage and family  relations; but in a legal society, social behavior is more  equally standardized by mostly laws. So the transformation from  the former to the latter is one from favoritism through dealing  with different people in different ways to universalism  through equal treatment without discrimination, and from a  society dominated by status to one dominated by contract.    In such a process of profound social transformation, the new  and old systems, orders, standards, and forces will coexist and  overlap for quite a sustained period of time, producing various  frictions, conflicts, and clashes that may grow particularly  sharp for a time. This puts high demands on the government's  role, administration, and management. From a macroperspective,  the conflicts and clashes of the conversion period can be seen  mainly in four areas.    1. The conflict between higher living standards and  increased accumulation and investment. Any country that  wants to develop its economy needs large-scale investment,  meaning large amounts of funding. While some funding can be  acquired from abroad, most capital formation must occur  domestically, causing a conflict between steadily growing  consumer aspirations and increased fund accumulation and  investment. In a consumption-driven climate, the large amount of  social resources urgently needed for economic development can  slip away. In addition, in an initial period of economic growth,  income-distribution inequality can increase, being further  sharpened by a developed country's "demonstration effect,"  confronting the government with new pressures.    2. The contradiction between political participation  and change, and stability. Basic political stability is a  condition needed for economic growth. Policy formulation and  enforcement can be effective only in a relatively stable  political environment. In the course of a social transformation,  public participation is bound to grow, even to the point of a  so-called "participation explosion." So how to maintain basic  political stability along with sustained change, and to preserve  the necessary political order while public political  participation is growing, are key matters that governments must  resolve during periods of social transformation.    3. The conflict between economic system-conversion and  balanced control. Economic system-conversion and the  transformation of economic operating forces are the economic  features of a period of social transformation. But a good start  for economic activities also requires a good economic climate  and order, meaning certain regulation and control mechanisms.  M. J. Levy notes that after the modernization process begins,  regardless whether development is as smooth or effective as  imagined, it still requires a completely different type of more  concentrated management, control, and coordination, which is  needed for the modernization process per se. So while  proceeding steadily with system conversion, it is necessary to  establish a certain balanced control, to give the government  diversified means of regulating and controlling economic  activities. Otherwise, economic activities might no longer  have rules and order, to land in a state of chaos and disorder.    4. The contradiction between cultural traditions and  replacements. During periods of social transformation, the  clash of outside cultures and values is often like surging  waves, causing a contradiction between cultural traditions and  replacements. Any society's development proceeds on its own  unique historical and cultural terms, so that in the course of  social transformation, while a society must change and renew, it  absolutely must not wholly abandon its own cultural traditions.  In fact, no society can first create a vacuum and then proceed  to develop. So how to balance tradition with change is also a  crucial matter.    And in real life, the conflicts brought by social  transformation might be far greater than even these, with their  manifestations also possibly being far more complex. Such  intricate contradictions put enormous pressure on government,  with how to effectively cope and deal with them being a  formidable government mission.    Studies in modernization theory show that modernization in  backward countries has two general features. 1. Political change  often becomes the forerunner of economic and social change, with  marked political change bringing striking economic and social  change. 2. When modernization begins, as the outside world  already has a far more developed society, modernization in  backward countries becomes a sort of "catch-up" modernization.  Japanese sociologist Fuyong Jianyi [1381 3057 0256 0001] has  pointed out that social development in backward countries has  the following five features: 1. Social development proceeds  step by step based on particular development stages, with it  being impossible to leap over intermediate stages; 2. In order  for modernization and industrialization to take social roots in  backward countries, government-led and conscientious  modernization and industrialization policies "from top to  bottom" are indispensable; 3. It is necessary to overcome  clashes among domestic groups holding varying views on  modernization; 4. In order to internalize as one's country's own  things elements of industrial civilization, mostly S&amp;T, that  are  received through cultural transmission, it is necessary for  someone to undertake this internalization; 5. It is necessary  to shake off the yoke of adverse international economic  relations. Obviously, these five features are all very  important to the course of modernization in backward countries.    Historically, governments have played varying roles in  different countries. In Britain, the first country to achieve  modernization, the role played by government in economic  development was more secondary. The only matters that Adam  Smith's Wealth of Nations required government to  handle were maintaining law and order and coping with foreign  invasions. Decisionmaking on resource utilization and income  distribution was left to markets, with government acting only as  referee. But as time passed, government influence on  economic development gradually expanded to the point where,  without active government support, there was no successful  economic development. In the second group of countries to  develop, on the western part of the European continent (such as  France and Germany), the system of government played a more  important role in economic and social modernization. And in  the countries that later modernized successfully (such as the  Soviet Union and Japan), the political impact was often  dominant. In other words, from the perspective of the course  of worldwide economic development from modern times to  contemporary to current, the economic development process has  undergone a basic change from being market-determined to a state  in which the role played by government is growing steadily.  Meanwhile, in backward countries, the various issues necessary  to be resolved for modernization, such as eliminating poverty,  converting systems, expanding participation, raising  literacy rates, preventing excessive income-distribution  inequality, and accumulating the necessary economic development  capital as quickly as possible, have steadily appeared one after  another in a very short period of time. This means that the  governments of backward countries must play a dynamic positive  role in economic and social development, acting as powerful  organizers and drivers of economic development.    In the course of a country's economic growth, once the  economy begins to get into a good cycle, there is often a stage  of rapid growth. This stage is usually also one of powerful  government dominance, such as from 1955 to 1973 in Japan, fom  1961 to 1979 in South Korea, and throughout the 1960s in Taiwan,  all of which stages were ones of rapid economic growth with  obvious government direction, guidance, and drive. As to  China, this stage has begun, and can be predicted to continue  through the end of this century and the beginning of the next.  During rapid growth, the government has many ways and means of  driving rapid economic growth, such as taking many protectionist  steps for the country's young industries (protectionist policy),  giving priority to propping up key strategic industries that the  country needs urgently (industrial policy), controlling the  labor movement (labor policy), and gradually increasing the  international competitiveness of manufactured goods, while  actively cultivating a modern market system. Taking industrial  policy for instance, the crux of industrial policy is to  concentrate the use of the country's limited resources in  industries most advantageous to national development, by  strengthening the country's industrial structure, in order to  raise its international market competitiveness. Industrial  policy and its expressed structural adjustment are strong  leaders, not waiting for spontaneous market adjustment, but  rather taking the initiative to powerfully guide structural  adjustment and upgrading. And this leading role carries a  certain flavor of opposition to markets. This is because the  structural orientation of industrial policy does not adhere  rigidly to the market dogma of "comparative advantage," often  requiring rather that comparatively inferior industries be  propped up to become ones with comparative advantage, thus  steadily achieving industrial structural adjustment and  industrial upgrading, to catch up to and even surpass advanced  international standards.    In order for government to successfully play a dominant role  in periods of rapid growth, it needs certain qualifications, the  crux of which is an efficient system of government  administration. This can be seen mainly in the two areas: the  need for government to have enough capability to formulate and  implement policy and the need for government policymaking to be  scientific and optimized.    1. Government must have an adequate and strong enough  capability for it to be able to play a positive and dynamic role  in economic and social development, as a government without such  capability would be bound to be incapable of accomplishing  anything. Government capabilities include:    1. The ability to maintain order. Any reform and  development can proceed smoothly only if there is a climate of  basic stability. So it can be said that a certain amount of  order and stability is a prerequisite for development. Creating  this prerequisite for national development is an essential  governrment responsibility.    2. The capacity to mobilize the public. Catch-up and  concentrated development often requires government to have great  mobilization capacity and appeal, so that it can mobilize all  public resources and focus all social forces to work  collectively toward certain designated national targets.    3. The capability to create new policy. As the domestic and  external environment for a country's economic and social  development is constantly changing, the government needs to  create new policies in a timely way, by making prompt responses  to changes in this environment, in order to control the  development-initiative authority.    4. The ability to carry out policies. Contemporary  political science studies show that a crisis often faced by  developing countries is an implementation crisis, in that they  cannot conscientiously carry out policies, so are unable to  achieve strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. In such  a state of affairs, government policies are ineffective no  matter how timely or correct, so that it is only with adequate  implementation capability that government will can be converted  into practical action.    2. Policymaking must be scientific. As  governments in backward, catch-up economies need to play a  dominant role, scientific government policymaking is decisive.    While the duties and responsibilities of the central  government and local governments at all levels differ,  optimizing government policymaking is an urgent joint  responsibility. In government-dominated economic development,  directed regulation, control, and guidance of policy is crucial.  While the positive role of correct policy goes without saying,  the negative impact of wrong policy must also not be downplayed.  It is only scientific and optimized policymaking that produces  correct strategies, timely policies, and effective measures, to  ensure successful government dominance.    In light of this, our administrative reform targets are  clear  at a glance. As our system of government administration  occupies such an important position in the catch-up  modernization process, administrative reform targeted at  speeding up and promoting an effective system of government  administration also becomes a very pressing matter. As change  is a constant subject of administration for all countries  throughout the world, whether developed or developing,  emphasizing and conscientiously conducting administrative-reform  studies and practice has become a universal global phenomenon.  In developed countries, as political and economic pluralism is  more extensive, administrative reform generally focuses on  cutting administrative spending and raising administrative  efficiency to get more output (good policy) from less input  (human and material resources). But in developing countries,  in addition to cutting spending and raising efficiency,  administrative reform is focused even more so on promoting  economic development. Catch-up modernization means that backward  countries have to complete in a shorter period of time the  industrialization process that took developed countries a longer  period of time to accomplish. Today's China is in this stage,  which will continue into the next century. So at the turn of the  century, with sharp international competition confronting  China with a stiff challenge, how to meet this challenge  successfully is a large matter that will determine China's fate.  The most crucial things will be upgrading our economy and  increasing our economic might. From the 1990s to the early  21st century, as long as the domestic and external climate does  not undergo a significant critical change, and our domestic  political and social stability is not undermined, there is hope  that China's economy will maintain a state of sustained rapid  growth. Until this stage is over, government dominance will be  exceptionally intense. The basic mission of China's  administrative reform will be to steadily reform and optimize  our administrative system, by establishing a corps of officials  who are of high quality, efficient, and good at dealing with  contingencies flexibly, and while speeding up the establishment  of a socialist market economy, will be capable of strengthening  government guidance and speeding up economic growth. So our  corresponding administrative reform strategies should be:    To raise government efficiency, with the primary option  being  to strengthen government capability;    To make sustained and rapid economic growth our strategic  orientation;    To take a rational disposition of public resources as our  major means;    To make system optimization and organizational creativity  our  key ways.    During this age of sharp international competition, in the  great international race toward the 21st century, the key to  keeping China invincible will be economic development. To adapt  to the needs of the times and our need for economic development,  an effective and high-quality system of government  administration will ensure and accelerate our economic and  social development, which is the crux of administrative reform.  Grasping this will mean getting a firm hold on China's  administrative reform direction.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ADT improves to Dollars 35.6m in third quarter ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group with operations in North America, the UK and continental Europe, yesterday reported a modest 3.5 per cent increase in third quarter pre-tax profits. The Bermuda-registered group which does much of its business in the US but retains a UK quote, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 35.6m in the three months to September 30, against Dollars 34.4m last time. Operating profits before goodwill amortisation of Dollars 6.5m (Dollars 6.6m) increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 60.2m (Dollars 54.2m) on turnover ahead 8 per cent to Dollars 340.3m (Dollars 315.7m). Net interest costs increased from Dollars 13.4m to Dollars 14.2m and earnings per share fell to 18 cents (22 cents). The electronic security services division contributed Dollars 44.7m (Dollars 39.1m) to operating profits on sales of Dollars 249m (Dollars 231.3m), while vehicle auction services reported operating profits of Dollars 15.5m (Dollars 15.1m) on sales of Dollars 91.3m (Dollars 84.4m). Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said third quarter results 'were in line with management's expectations'. The third quarter results lifted pre-tax profits for the nine months to Dollars 111.2m (Dollars 104.8m), on sales which advanced to Dollars 1.02bn (Dollars 950.8m). Earnings per share for nine months were down from 67 cents to 56 cents. The year-on-year decline reflects the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the group's refinancing package in August last year. ADT's shares closed up 30p at 740p in London.</p>

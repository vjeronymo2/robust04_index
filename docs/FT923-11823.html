			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Citicorp ahead despite property loss CITICORP, the largest banking group in the US, yesterday provided evidence of a solid recovery in overall earnings in spite of trebled North American commercial property losses. The bank's second-quarter net profit was Dollars 171m (Pounds 89.5m), compared with Dollars 11m in the same period of 1991. Earnings per share were 32 cents against a loss of 12 cents. A second-quarter loss of Dollars 355m was reported for the North American commercial property division, more than three times the Dollars 108m loss of a year ago. Mr John Reed, chairman, said the results showed the bank to be on track in meeting the objectives of its reorganisation and capital building programme. He cited the improved operating margin of Dollars 1.8bn, an increase of 24 per cent year-on-year. The bank's core consumer division achieved a 34 per cent rise in net earnings to Dollars 234m, on revenues 4 per cent up at Dollars 2.6bn. The global corporate business achieved Dollars 294m of net income in the quarter, against a Dollars 10m loss. Revenues of Dollars 1.4bn were 12 per cent improved year-on-year. The cross-border refinancing portfolio produced Dollars 105m of net income, against Dollars 3m a year ago. For the first six months of 1992 Citicorp's net income was Dollars 354m (69 cents per share), against Dollars 104m (5 cents per share) in the first half of last year. Citicorp wrote off Dollars 356m of North American commercial property loans during the second quarter, against Dollars 90m a year ago. Total second-quarter loan write-offs were down to Dollars 908m from Dollars 1.68bn a year ago, due to the absence of last year's heavy cross-border loan write-offs and the benefit of corporate division loan write-offs of Dollars 126m - less than one third last year's level. Bad debt provisions were unchanged year-on-year at Dollars 1bn while non-performing corporate side loans totalled Dollars 8.1bn against Dollars 7.9bn a year ago. Non-performing North American commercial property loans represented 24 per cent of the Dollars 11.95bn loan book, but when foreclosed property is added this rises to Dollars 6.3bn, or 52.6 per cent. Mr Tom Hanley, an analyst at First Boston, said the figures showed property-related bad debt provisions would remain high this year, but 'it looks like the worst is past in terms of credit quality problems'. On Wall Street, Citicorp's shares rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 1/4 .</p>

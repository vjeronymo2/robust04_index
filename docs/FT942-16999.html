			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Observer: Historically challenged In terms of sporting disasters, the cancellation of England's friendly football match with the Germans does not rank with last year's Grand National fiasco. But someone deserves a red card. When did the Football Association first wake up to the fact that the match fell on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth? Seemingly, no one there knows much about history - which is a mite surprising given the age of some FA members. If the organisers of today's annual Anglo-German Konigswinter conference had invited along the odd FA official, this sort of mistake might have been prevented. Meanwhile, the German football federation does not emerge from the affair any better. It talked tough about wanting the game to go on, presumably in the hope that the cowardly Brits would cancel it. As for Terry Venables, new manager of the England team, he's lost the chance to make his mark. The last time there was as big a fuss over a match (1938), England beat the Germans 6-3 . . . and went on to win the war.</p>

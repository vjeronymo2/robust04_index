			<p>931115 FT  15 NOV 93 / EU bank settlement reform EUROPEAN Union central bankers have agreed to try to reduce the risks of banking system failures by ensuring that banks settle large cash payment claims against each other immediately. A working group of bankers led by Mr Tomaso Padoa-Schioppa, chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision, a committee of the Bank for International Settlements, has recommended that EU states should establish real-time settlement systems 'as soon as feasible'. Banks in most EU countries currently settle net obligations to each other through central banks at the end of each day. However, this is thought to carry risks of systemic financial failure. Most EU states are working on a move towards 'real time gross settlement'. Britain is planning to convert its interbank payments system from net end of day settlement to real time by the end of 1995.</p>

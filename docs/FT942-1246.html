			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / EU leaders pressed to pick Delors successor: Germany will call another summit next month if deadlock remains European Union leaders were under pressure last night to settle at their Greek summit the divisive issue of who should replace Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president. The 12 heads of government arrived in Corfu last night for the two-day summit, where chances of breaking the deadlock are generally believed to be, at best, even. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, appeared to retain a clear lead over his main rival, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister. But the UK and Italy have still not signalled an intention to back either of them. Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned on Wednesday that the German EU presidency would call another summit next month if the 12 failed to agree on a successor to Mr Delors during their time in Corfu. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, tried to be positive by suggesting that 'we'll do everything we can' to reach agreement: 'I want to be optimistic. I think we will succeed.' Mr John Major, the British prime minister, formally backs Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, as an outside contender, but the UK prefers Mr Lubbers to Mr Dehaene, who is being promoted by France and Germany. On arriving, Mr Major said: 'It is important to get the right result. Whether that will be here or not I'm not sure.' He refused to comment on Mr Dehaene's candidacy. In the UK yesterday, Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, was quoting Mr Dehaene as 1-3 (on) favourite and Mr Lubbers at 7-2. Mr Brittan was trailing on 7-1 and Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing head of the Gatt world trade organisation, was quoted at 8-1. The Belgian and Dutch leaders, both Christian Democrats, agreed at a meeting of EU Christian Democrat parties in Brussels on Wednesday that neither would veto the other. Both are expected to leave a dinner tonight when their colleagues try to break the deadlock. The Netherlands intends to push hard its claim to the top Brussels job, according to Dutch officials, on the grounds that it is the only founder-member of the Euro-club not to have held the Commission presidency. It will also be argued that the Netherlands will shortly become the largest net contributor to the EU budget on a per capita basis. The Dutch may also seek to exploit fears that France and Germany, the driving axis of the EU, are overstretching their power in trying to impose Mr Dehaene. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian premier, is yet to indicate his preference. He is looking to bargain for a settlement of a long-running row over Italy's flouting of EU limits on milk production, and has threatened to delay the EU budget increase planned for next year unless he is satisfied. Mr Delors told journalists he was pessimistic about a deal on his successor. The powerful Commission president may himself become a focus of controversy. Mr Kohl wants him to head the group of experts the Corfu summit is expected to set up to pave the way for the 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Delors is understood to be weighing the possibility against his prospects of running as a Socialist candidate for the French presidency next year. After this spring's voting rights dispute between the UK and its partners, the 1996 review is expected to be as stormy as the talks leading up to Maastricht.</p>

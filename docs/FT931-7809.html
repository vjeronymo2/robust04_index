			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / US plans to drop relief supplies THE US has decided to parachute relief supplies to blockaded Moslems in eastern Bosnia, but President Bill Clinton is consulting with the United Nations and western leaders before making the announcement, administration officials said last night. The officials said the airdrops under protection of US navy aircraft could begin as early as this week, but no final timetable had been set. Britain said yesterday it would not take part in an airdrop but was not opposed to the US doing so. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, said last night that an airdrop must have UN authorisation. Foreign Office officials in London said the US administration had not been in touch with Britain on plans to parachute supplies. 'However, we have no problem with an operation of this kind if they want to go ahead with it,' a spokesman said. The lack of British enthusiasm for an airdrop is based on the advice of defence officials that it would be dangerous and was unlikely to be effective in the mountainous regions of eastern Bosnia. By contrast, the officials stressed that Britain was taking an active part in joint planning for a large-scale deployment of ground troops in Bosnia to enforce a peace settlement, if and when such an agreement is reached. The UN yesterday resumed its airlift to Sarajevo after city officials agreed to distribute food throughout the Bosnian capital. The airlift was suspended on February 12.

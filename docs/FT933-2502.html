			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / British National party expected to focus on the capital AN IMMEDIATE question posed by the British National party's victory in London's Docklands was whether the party would now break through to success in other local authority elections. In a statement issued after his win in Tower Hamlets, the BNP's candidate Mr Derek Beackon spoke pointedly of 'the Isle of Dogs and nearby Greenwich' once being the heart of Britain's greatness as a trading and maritime nation. The BNP puts substantial effort into organising in parts of the borough of Greenwich - the presence of its bookshop in Bexley, just outside the area, is a frequent source of tension with anti-racist campaigners. It is likely that the party will concentrate heavily on next year's London elections, fielding candidates in Greenwich and boroughs such as Hackney, Newham and Brent as well as trying to make further gains in Tower Hamlets. Representatives of the mainstream parties were yesterday of the view that the BNP will find it impossible to maintain momentum in next May's elections, and will lose its Isle of Dogs seat. A similar view was taken of its prospects elsewhere in the country. Mr Nigel Todd, a Labour councillor in Newcastle upon Tyne and a founder member of the Tyne and Wear Anti-Fascist Association, said he thought there was little chance of the BNP doing as well in north-east England. Mr Malik Chaudhry, housing officer of the Tyne and Wear Racial Equality Council, said there were signs that Sunderland was being targeted by far-right groups. 'Sunderland has seen increased activity in a rather organised way,' he said. 'It looks like there have been incidents where they have been leafleting, putting up stickers and insignias.' Mr Chaudhry said there had also been incidents of racial attacks on housing estates in Sunderland. People had had to be rehoused, he said. Mr Sukhdev Grewal, acting regional officer for the Commission for Racial Equality in the north of England and Scotland, said the BNP and the National Front tried, without success, to win council seats in Durham a few years ago. In Cardiff, the BNP stood in the May local elections in the Glan Ely ward, but its candidate came bottom of the poll - with just 47 votes. The Ely area was the scene last year of a riot sparked by an attack on an Asian shopkeeper, and some members of the Asian community are said to still feel threatened. But political observers in Cardiff say that attempts to exploit hostile feelings by extremists appear to have come from outside the area.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEMOND'S SHADOW IS STILL 5 SECONDS AHEAD;  </P> <P> CYCLING: CHIAPPUCCI MIRRORS MOVES OF HIS RIVAL IN MAINTAINING HIS LEAD IN THE  TOUR DE FRANCE.  </P> <P> Greg LeMond has been calling Claudio Chiappucci, his chief rival in this year's  Tour de France, "Cappuccino."  </P> <P> LeMond knows the difference between Italian coffee and Italian bicycle racers,  so the malaprop is intended to tweak his opponent.  </P> <P> Chiappucci is not responding. Nor is he capitulating. He says LeMond must  perform perfectly in Saturday's telling time trial to win his third Tour de  France.  </P> <P> The give-and-take between the Tour leaders was about all the drama there was in  Thursday's 18th stage as cyclists descended the Pyrenees at Pau to the  vineyards of Bordeaux.  </P> <P> The verbal digs are just about all that separate LeMond and Chiappucci, who  retained his five-second lead in the 124-mile stage.  </P> <P> After two demanding stages in the Pyrenees, the leaders were content to relax  on a scorching day in southern France.  </P> <P> After the riders crossed the finish line near the Garonne River, they said the  95-degree temperatures made it difficult to break away for any length of time.  </P> <P> Still, a surge over Bordeaux's winding streets about two miles from the finish  helped Eric Breukink of the Netherlands gain a nine-second lead over Pedro  Delgado of Spain in the race for third place overall, 3:31 behind Chiappucci.  Gianni Bugno of Italy won the stage in 5 hours 41 minutes 33 seconds. Breukink  was one second behind and well ahead of the peloton -- the group of riders who  cluster for much of each day.  </P> <P> In the chess game for first place, LeMond could not rid himself of Chiappucci  when the peloton broke apart. LeMond is considered an excellent strategist who  turns the slightest opportunity into a big advantage. But Chiappucci shadowed  his every move.  </P> <P> LeMond could be seen searching the peloton for the leader's yellow jersey worn  by Chiappucci. For most of the stage, he did not need to look past his back  wheel.  </P> <P> "I'll do everything I can to widen the gap today," Chiappucci said, referring  to the 19th stage from Castillon to Limoges. "My chances are 50-50. Greg has to  be in excellent shape, or I will keep the yellow jersey to Paris."  </P> <P> Chiappucci, from Varese, near the Swiss border, is competing in only his second  Tour de France. Yet, he is exuding the kind of confidence usually reserved for  the LeMonds of the world.  </P> <P> At least, this is the overriding sentiment of the media entourage covering the  world's most prestigious bicycle race.  </P> <P> "LeMond is in great shape; no one will be able to beat him," said Luuk Blyboom,  a Dutch journalist.  </P> <P> Perhaps, but Chiappucci is making the chase fascinating.  </P> <P> Wednesday, when a flat tire deflated LeMond's momentum in the Pyrenees,  Chiappucci and his Carrera teammates did the unthinkable -- they attacked.  </P> <P> Such tactics are considered unsportsmanlike. And in France, etiquette is  everything.  </P> <P> If a challenger has a technical failure, the unwritten rule of cycling says you  wait.  </P> <P> Chiappucci, sensing a huge opportunity, did not. Eventually, LeMond and his Z  teammates caught Chiappucci to avert disaster.  </P> <P> But LeMond implied that such disrespect could backfire, saying: "If Chiappucci  wants to be unsportsmanlike, it could come back to haunt him."  </P> <P> If Chiappucci is worried, he is not saying.  </P> <P> He has been riding professionally for six seasons but did not win a race for  four years. He was relegated to the role of domestique, or worker, for his  team's best riders. In last year's Tour de France, Chiappucci worked for Urs  Zimmermann, who now rides for 7-Eleven.  </P> <P> Chiappucci finished 81st last year, 1 hour 53 minutes 4 seconds behind LeMond,  who edged Laurent Fignon in Paris.  </P> <P> After the 1989 Tour, however, Chiappucci started improving rapidly. With  Zimmermann struggling, Chiappucci was free to ride for himself.  </P> <P> He won the Coppa Place one-day event in Italy a week after the Tour. Then he  won the Tour de Piedmont in France last October.  </P> <P> In June, Chiappucci finished 12th in the Giro d'Italia but was named that  tour's best mountain rider. He also had an outstanding time trial, which has  boosted his confidence for Saturday's showdown, a 27.9-mile race against the  clock, preceding Sunday's finale into Paris.  </P> <P> Today's 114-mile stage through the Dordogne region of southwest France is not  expected to produce a dramatic change in the standings.  </P> <P> "They are going to conserve their energy for Saturday," Blyboom said.  </P></p>

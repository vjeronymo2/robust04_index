			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SEMITISM  </P> <P> In his Dec. 10 letter, Teodor Polak criticizes Deborah Lipstadt for  exaggerating the extent of anti-Semitism in Poland, indicating the actions,  allegedly, of a few are used to tar an entire people.  </P> <P> That can be a reasonable argument, but he undermines it by showing that he does  not recognize his own anti-Semitism.  </P> <P> This chairman of the Polish American Congress, Los Angeles, blames Jews for the  "bad fate" of contemporary Polish-Jewish relations. After all, Polak claims,  "Communism was forced on Poland with significant participation by Polish Jews.  The terror followed."  </P> <P> Polak's twisted logic sadly exposes the hatred and ignorance that has helped  perpetuate anti-Semitism in Poland.  </P> <P> SHELDON MARAM  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev  can take place only on condition that the Chechen leader  recognizes that his republic is a part of the Russian  Federation. Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service, said this at a meeting on Thursday  evening with members of the parliament and government of  Kabarda-Balkaria in Nalchik. He expressed the view that Viktor  Chernomyrdin is most likely to hold a dialogue with the Chechen  leader since economic talks are the main way of resolving  relations between Moscow and Groznyy.    Regarding the situation in the northern Caucasus, the  director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service noted that  one cannot speak of stabilization in the region without a  settlement of relations with Chechnya. Stepashin said that, in  its present form this republic represents a threat to the  stability of the Russian Federation. In the view of the head of  Russian counterintelligence, dialogue with Dudayev should be  conducted in a tough manner and the primary task is  normalization of the situation on the railroads crossing  Chechnya.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shimon Peres, foreign minister, by </F> correspondent Jon Snow; Peres in Tel Aviv and Snow in the London  studio; from the "Channel Four" program--live]    [Text] [Snow] Foreign Minister, three months down the road  from the Washington handshake are you running out of time with  your own electorate?    [Peres] No, I don't think so. You know a government is not a  hospital, we don't have to take the temperature every morning  and we shall be judged by the end of the process which I am sure  will be a successful one.    [Snow] Now on Monday [10 January] you meet again in Taba  with  the PLO. Is that a last chance encounter as far as the  Gaza-Jericho deal goes?    [Peres] We have still a long list of problems that should be  solved, we are doing something which is unprecedented, we are  doing something that you cannot draw any lessons from another  experiment. So it takes time and we encounter problems that we  didn't anticipate, but I am sure we shall go down the road -- it  may take a month more or a month less, it doesn't matter, we  shall arrive at the destination.    [Snow] Is one of the biggest problems that's arisen since  September been the question of whether Yasir 'Arafat really any  longer leads a significant body of Palestinians with whom you  can negotiate?    [Peres] I wouldn't buy it. I think most of the Palestinians  support peace, and maybe they support the PLO because they  support peace, not the other way around. They need peace, we  need peace, this is the naked truth which will accompany us more  and more in the future.    [Snow] Are you having to pursue a twin-track approach on  this  -- in other words are you in fact talking at some level with  Hamas?    [Peres] No, I don't think so. Hamas is clearly against  peace, Hamas is clearly against the PLO, Hamas is trying to kill  the people who support peace and to bring an end to peace  itself, so I do not seen any room for compromise with Hamas.    [Snow] Then presumably speed is of the essence however  complex these last negotiations that you describe are. You  surely have only got very limited time before you have somehow  got to ...    [Peres, interrupting] Why?    [Snow] Well, because presumably with the passage of time  frustration builds, support for Hamas is likely to build and the  people with whom you are talking presumably become less relevant?    [Peres] I am not sure. Well, anyway we have suggested the  plan. The timing is in the hands of the Palestinians, if they  want to make it fast it is OK with us, if they want to go slow  it is their business. We would surely like to do it as soon as  possible and as speedy as we can, but if they will try to  postpone, to interrupt, to hesitate, it is their problem. We do  not seek in any way to humiliate the Palestinians or to hurt  their feelings, on the contrary we would like to see them in a  dignified position, feeling well, feeling strong, feeling  successful. Our only consideration is the security problems of  Israel, but basically we would like to see this Palestinian  story becoming a success story. We feel very strongly the  better the neighbor feels, the better a neighbor we are having.    [Snow] Foreign Minister, you have proved yourself an  optimist  by ever going to Washington in the first place to shake hands ...    [Peres, interrupting] May I ask you, is it right to be an  optimist or a pessimist, what can you do with pessimism?    [Snow] Let me ask you with your optimistic hat on what are  the chances then that this deal will go through and that we will  see a settlement say within eight weeks?    [Peres] No, eight weeks I wouldn't take, but it will go  through undoubtedly. I suggest we have not the slightest  reluctance or hesitation about our capacity and our  determination for peace.    [Snow] But the timetable?    [Peres] I don't know, it may take weeks it may take months.  I wish it would take weeks, but how can I tell how long it will  take if I don't know yet what sort of problems we shall have to  negotiate about. Until now I can say that we are able to  overcome extremely complicated situations with ingenuity, with  creativity, and since we see before our eyes a clear-cut goal, a  clear-cut destination, and nobody will move us aside or derail  us from the peace process. I am sure we shall arrive at the  appointed station.</p>

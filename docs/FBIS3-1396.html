Mr Tillett, an IFP spokesman, said: "We've just received  information from intelligence sources that the ANC planted  snipers in the crowd. There are deliberate plans to discredit  Zulus in the Transvaal. The ANC will claim this is an IFP march  and this will probably be an attempt to discredit the IFP as  well."    He stressed it was not an IFP march but rather one organised  by "indunas" [chiefs].</p>

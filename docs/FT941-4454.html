			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / US warns Japan on surplus: 'Great nations keep their commitments,' says Christopher Japan was warned yesterday to live up to its commitment to reduce its current account surplus significantly or risk losing international credibility. 'Great nations keep their commitments,' Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in Tokyo. The US had kept its part of the bargain, made in bilateral framework negotiations, to take steps to reduce its deficit. Japan had voluntarily agreed to lower its surplus, but 'no one would agree with the contention that Japan has met its commitment,' Mr Christopher said. While in other respects, the US's single most important bilateral relationship was healthy, it continued to be troubled by the trade situation. 'Compliance with the framework agreement should be the basis for going forward,' Mr Christopher said. Although there were no breakthroughs in his talks yesterday with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime and foreign ministers, Mr Christopher said he had sensed a greater recognition that the status quo was unsatisfactory to the US. Japanese officials had assured him that Japan would draw up by the end of the month steps to fulfil its framework agreements. Mr Christopher further defended the US government's decision to revive the Super 301 provision in the 1988 US trade act giving it the right to retaliate against unfair trade practices. The US decision has come under attack from several quarters, including the European Union, as going against the trend of 'multilateralising' trade issues. Yesterday Mr Gerard Longuet, French trade and industry minister, joined growing international criticism of Washington's decision to revive Super 301 saying as an 'unjustified attack' on Japan. Super 301 was a tool to open Japan's markets not only to the US, but to all countries, Mr Christopher said. Neither the US nor Japan wanted a trade war and Super 301 was useful in encouraging the parties to have the kind of dialogue that rendered retaliation unnecessary. Mr Christopher said that while other countries might not agree with the measures employed by the US in opening up Japan's markets, 'the world looks to the US for leadership' and 'will be very glad to reap the benefits of what the US is doing. Whatever their position,' he said, 'the rest of the world will applaud if we can achieve those results.'</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Van Nuys Firm Loses Big Award: A jury that ordered General Electric Co. to pay  $70.8 million to a tiny Van Nuys firm was overruled by a Superior Court judge,  who slashed the award to $9.8 million. The firm, American Aviation Industries,  is now effectively in the hole because the jury in July also had ordered AAI to  repay GE about $14 million, and that part of the case was upheld by Judge  Stephen D. Petersen, said Bert Cooper, a lawyer for GE. The companies sued each  other over a failed venture in which they planned to retrofit Lockheed  corporate jets with GE-made engines.  </P></p>

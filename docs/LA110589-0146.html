Hunter completed 27  of 42 passes for 344 yards. Three of his four touchdown passes came in the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Michigan is the first team in Division I-A history to reach the 700-victory  plateau. Yale is the all-time NCAA leader with 753 wins.  </P> <P> Purdue rolled up 389 total yards and Michigan 372.  </P> <P> The victory improved the Wolverines to 7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Big Ten,  setting up a showdown next week when they visit Illinois. Purdue dropped to 1-7  and 0-5.  </P> <P> Purdue played without Abe Hoskins, a second-string receiver from Omaha, Neb.,  who was suspended because of an arrest Friday on battery charges after an  altercation with his former girlfriend.  </P> <P> Illinois 31, Iowa 7 -- Wagner Lester scored two touchdowns and quarterback Jeff  George completed 28 of 44 passes for 302 yards and a touchdown to lead the No.  8 Illini in a Big Ten game at Iowa City.  </P> <P> Illinois, 7-1 overall, goes into its showdown against Michigan next Saturday  with a 5-0 conference record. Iowa fell to 4-4 and 2-3.  </P> <P> Lester scored on a one-yard plunge with 12 seconds left in the first half and  also on a 26-yard burst around right end with four minutes to play.  </P> <P> Ohio State 52, Northwestern 27 -- Jaymes Bryant handled the ball only twice but  scored both times in helping the Buckeyes beat the Wildcats in a Big Ten game  at Evanston, Ill.  </P> <P> Bryant scored two of the Buckeyes' three second-quarter touchdowns, running 63  yards for one and catching a pass on a 46-yard play for the other. He suffered  a collarbone injury on his touchdown catch with 59 seconds left in the first  half.  </P> <P> Dante Lee, who rushed for 157 yards in 24 carries, scored three second-half  touchdowns as Ohio State (6-2 and 4-1) pulled away. The Buckeyes led 45-14  after three quarters. Northwestern is 0-8 and 0-4.  </P> <P> Minnesota 24, Wisconsin 22 -- Ron Goetz returned an interception 73 yards for a  touchdown in the fourth quarter to turn back a Badger rally as the Gophers (5-3  and 3-2) scored a Big Ten victory at Minneapolis. Wisconsin is 2-6 and 1-4.  </P> <P> With 9:02 left to play, the Badgers, trailing only 17-14, drove to the  Minnesota 30, but Goetz stepped in front of a swing pass and sprinted down the  left sideline for the winning score.  </P></p>

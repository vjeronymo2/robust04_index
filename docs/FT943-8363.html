			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs on rate rise of 50 points Wall Street US share prices kept pace with a surging bond market yesterday afternoon, as investors drew reassurance from the Federal Reserve's aggressive move to higher interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.28 ahead at 3,784.57 as volume on the New York SE topped 304.5m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.78 stronger at 465.01. Secondary markets lagged behind, with the American SE composite posting a slim 0.34 gain at 443.66 and the Nasdaq composite up 2.62 at 735.51. Most analysts had expected stocks to respond favourably if the Fed decided to tighten credit conditions during yesterday's policy-making session. Indeed, a sharp downturn was predicted in the unlikely event that the central bank decided to leave rates unchanged. Still, the rally appeared close to fizzling out only minutes after it began. When the Fed announced its decision to lift two key short-term rates by 50 basis points each, the Dow jumped to a 20-point gain, only to retreat into negative territory within a half-hour of the 1.15pm statement. The sharp swing closely paralleled movements in the bond market, where traders seemed to be having second thoughts about the rate increase. But another wave of buying in Treasuries led to a powerful upturn in prices. Equities responded and the Dow closed near the session's high. In the end, Wall Street was relieved that the Fed had signalled the beginning of a period of relative stability for interest rates. Thus, stocks most sensitive to broad economic trends led the late advance. Caterpillar forged ahead Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 108 7/8 , General Motors was Dollars 1 1/8 up at Dollars 51 and International Paper added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 73 1/8 . Earlier in the session a flurry of company news provided a welcome distraction as investors awaited the Fed's decision. Hewlett-Packard, the California-based computer maker, surged Dollars 8 1/2 , or 11 per cent, to Dollars 87 5/8 after producing strong third-quarter results. However, its robust performance failed to trigger broad-based buying in the technology sector. An exceptionally bright spot was Micron Technology, which climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 3/8 on an upgrade from Piper Jaffray. Several leading retailers also released quarterly results, and the reception from investors was generally favourable. Home Depot jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 44 3/8 on news of the do-it-yourself chain's continued growth. Dayton Hudson advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 85 1/4 after revealing details of a strong quarter. Wal-Mart's results lacked surprises, yet the issue put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 24 1/4 . Toys R Us was marked up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 after Ladenbury Thalmann placed the stock on its 'buy' list. JC Penney was marked down Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 47 1/8 even though its second-quarter net income of 41 cents a share was well above its year-earlier result. Pepsico appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 after announcing the resumption of its stock repurchase programme. Coca-Cola also improved, by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 45 5/8 . Canada Toronto rose sharply following interest rate rises in both Canada and the US. Share prices were little changed for most of the day, but jumped in the final few hours of trading. The Bank of Canada's bank rate rose to 5.93 per cent from 5.70 per cent, as was widely expected. The TSE 300 index closed 33.1 up at 4,202.8 but declines led advances by 380 to 349 after volume of 60.9m shares. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo climbed for the third consecutive day as investors, including foreigners, kept pushing up prices with heavy demand. The Bovespa index ended 931, or 2.0 per cent, higher at 47,441. Share prices have risen 6.2 per cent in the past three days. Turnover was a heavy RDollars 334m, following Monday's single-day record of RDollars 2.1bn. Monday's trading was influenced by the expiration of options, while futures expire today, and trading in futures formed a big part of yesterday's volume. Venezuela Share prices in Caracas made sharp gains following Monday's holiday closure, although volume was reported as low. The composite index added 4.92, or 3.6 per cent, at 140.75 as turnover fell to 324m bolivars. Electricidad de Caracas moved ahead 11.60 bolivars to 341.10 bolivars.</p>

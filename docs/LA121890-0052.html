			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FOSTER PARK;  </P> <P> ROADSIDE TREE TURNS FESTIVE EACH YEAR  </P> <P> A December ritual continues along a stretch of California 33 between Ventura  and Casitas Springs.  </P> <P> Motorists stop their cars on the freeway shoulder, walk to a lone pine tree  near the Canada Larga off-ramp and hang a length of tinsel or a handwritten  message in its branches.  </P> <P> Over the weeks, the lower portion of the tree is masked with trimmings, and a  star generally appears near the top about 50 feet above the ground.  </P> <P> Longtime Oak View resident Ruby Blackmon, 80, admits beginning the tradition  about 15 years ago when the tree was just a bush.  </P> <P> She keeps an eye on it each year, going out after windstorms to rehang items  that blow off.  </P> <P> "I usually undecorate it, too, as far as I can reach," she said.  </P> <P> "I sort things out and save them for the next year."  </P> <P> Blackmon said that in 1976 Caltrans felled a tree closer to the pavement that  she had helped trim, and the community was not pleased.  </P> <P> Because of this, she suspects that Caltrans crews put the star on the tree to  make amends.  </P> <P> But her theory was quashed by Bruce Dyer, Caltrans maintenance superintendent.  </P> <P> "We don't do anything about decorating it, and we don't do anything about  taking it off," he said, "It just shows up. It hasn't cost us any money."  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol Officer Jim Utter warns that people who park on the  freeway shoulder or trespass on the right of way where the tree grows risk  citations.  </P> <P> "It's a violation of the Motor Vehicle Code," he said, but "don't make me look  like a bah-humbug-Christmas guy."

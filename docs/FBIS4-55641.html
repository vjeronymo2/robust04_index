			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 16 (CTK) -- "The fact itself that I  am an acquaintance of Zhirinovskiy does not mean that I am his  follower. I disagree with many of his views," Jozef Lauko told  CTK today. Lauko, an entrepreneur who, along with Ladislav  Mojzis, the owner of West-Club restaurant in Bratislava, invited  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia (LDPR) for a private visit to Slovakia. [sentence as  received] Zhirinovskiy, accompanied by six aides, is to arrive  in Slovakia on Saturday, May 21.    "I favour him because of his effort to return respect and  authority to the Russian nation and all Slavs," Lauko said of  Zhirinovskiy. He said he "invited Zhirinovskiy to Slovakia  merely as a private person", and assured that "no Slovak  political party stands behind" his invitation. He added he had  known Zhirinovskiy for more than 15 years. The Russian  politician wanted to visit Slovakia mainly to have a rest, he  added. Lauko himself is not a member of any political party.    "After all, I do not expect any Slovak politician to afford  meeting him now, before elections," Lauko said. The elections  in Slovakia are slated for September 30 and October 1. However,  Lauko pointed to the importance of the opportunity of meeting a  man, who he claimed would most probably be the next Russian  president.    Lauko said that the West perceived the idea of pan-Slavic  mutuality, promoted by Zhirinovskiy, as an element dangerous to  its (Western) interests. The West has beat the economic bloc in  the economic sphere, but now it has come to an understanding  that it has caused great problems to itself at the same time,  Lauko said.    "I am convinced that the time is not far away when the West  will start to raise political and administrative obstacles so  that visits by Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians and Belarussians... be  reduced to the least possible frequency and number," Lauko  stated.    "What is the difference between our suffering under the yoke  of the West and of Russia?" Lauko reacted to the question  whether the idea of "pan-Slavism" would not lead to Central and  Eastern Europe's return under the Russian yoke. He said  Slovakia was now in a worse economic situation than when it was  a part of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and  the Warsaw Pact within the Czechoslovak Federation. However,  Slovakia remains dependent on Russian energy sources, he stated.    "Zhirinovskiy won the Russian elections because he gave hope  to his nation," Lauko said, adding that Zhirinovskiy had built  his electoral victory on the inability of his political rivals.</p>

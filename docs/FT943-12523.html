			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Air freshness A study in the August issue of Consumer Reports magazine found that almost a quarter of commercial flights do not meet a basic standard for air freshness. About 25 per cent of flights tested had carbon dioxide levels higher than 1,000 parts per million parts of air - the 'comfort threshold' for ventilation set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers. Although the magazine tested 44 jet models, it cited only two as veering notably from the average: the Boeing 757, which had comparatively high carbon dioxide levels - 1,552 ppm in one case - and the Boeing 747-400, which had comparatively low levels. The air in most of the planes tested had levels between 500 and 800 ppm. There were no pronounced differences between airlines. The problem, according to airline employee unions and researchers, is that newer model planes recycle as much as half of their ventilation air, instead of providing 100 per cent fresh air, as older models did.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Gerasimov: "Sweet Promises Bear </F> Bitter Fruit"]    [Text] Despite the numerous promises made by reformers  about the imminent onset of a time of plenty, we are very far  from general prosperity. According to the market economy  luminaries' estimates, even if stabilization finally starts in  1994 it will be around 20-30 years before we can start to live  the Western way. However, we should not hope for stabilization  this year. Figures from the Russian State Committee for  Statistics testify to an acceleration in economic decline.    Compared with the unfavorable year of 1992, 1993 looks even  more unfavorable. Indicators on the majority of types of output  are minus numbers. On some of them, the volume of production  has fallen by 50 percent. Thus, the output of large electric  machines, low-capacity electric motors, and trucks made up  slightly less than half of the output from the same period of  the previous year year; overhead cranes, bulldozers, mainline  freightcars -- one-third; forge-and-press machines, automobile  trailers and semitrailers, and tractors -- less than 10-25  percent.    In ferrous metallurgy, the output of cast iron, steel, and  rolled metal fell significantly. In comparison with the same  period the previous year, 54 percent fewer steel pipes were  manufactured. In comparison with the level of December 1992  the daily average manufacture of PVC resin, pipes, parts of  pipelines made of thermoplastics, chemical fibers and threads,  microbiological feed protein, and tires for agricultural  vehicles fell by 40-65 percent.    The daily production of commercial lumber fell by over  one-third against the level of the previous December, lumber by  37 percent, matches and pit props by half, and cardboard by  one-fourth.    The production of woolen fabrics and footwear fell by half,  silk by 42 percent, linen, hemp, and jute fabrics and jersey  products by almost one-third, and hosiery articles by 24  percent. The production of children's shoes fell significantly  -- by 58 percent.    Because of material and financial difficulties, no washing  machines were manufactured at the Nizhnyy Novgorod Automobile  Plant or at the GPZ-4 Production Association (Samara city) from  the beginning of the year; no receiver sets were manufactured at  the Velikolukskiy "Radiopribor" Production Association, or at  the "Sokol" radio equipment plant (Moscow), the Kamensk-Uralsk  radio plant (Sverdlovsk Oblast), and so on.    The paralysis in the economy is being especially keenly felt  in transportation. The volume of freight transportation is  falling from one month to the next, and the country's  transportation arteries are coming to a standstill. Thus, in  comparison with the same period of the previous year the number  of trips actually carried out by overland transportation fell:  In Nizhnyy Novgorod by 67 percent, Saransk and Yakutsk by 22  percent, Pskov by 19 percent, Orenburg by 14 percent,  Krasnoyarsk by 13 percent, and Astrakhan, Krasnodar, and Barnaul  by 12 percent.    The famine with which we were threatened has proved not to  be  a propaganda trick; it is already knocking on our doors. The  production of fruit and vegetable preserves, macaroni, tea, and  mineral water fell (by 33-41 percent) against the corresponding  period of the previous year, and that of whole milk and  margarine products, meat, butter, and canned meat fell by 13-28  percent. The production of food concentrates fell by over  one-half.    On the other hand an increase was recorded in the output of  vacuum cleaners. Evidently the demand for this of equipment has  risen among the population. That is bad luck. What will be the  next thing to create a stir? Meanwhile the leadership is moving  along like a crab. Our economy is moving backward from what was  achieved during the five-year plans, not accumulating wealth but  squandering it.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: A REASON FOR REVENGE?  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- For several months I wooed an attractive young lady. I had  not won her, however (nor had we had one of those annoying, awkward, modern  "little talks"), when I began to sense a distinct chill. After a few  inconclusive weeks, I reluctantly decided to stop calling her. Unfortunately,  but not surprisingly, she stopped calling me as well.  </P> <P> Within a week, both intuition and hard evidence began piling up, revealing that  she was making a serious play for my brand-new roommate. He seems quite  receptive, too.  </P> <P> I run into her about once a week, and I have to live with him. I'm pretending  nothing has happened, but this is unsatisfactory. What would be a more  appropriate response -- a fit of outraged bellowing or some more devious  revenge?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners regrets to inform you that you are responding  correctly. That knowledge should gratify you, but she realizes that it would be  infinitely more satisfactory if she told you to rig paper bags full of water to  fall over them on the sofa, and to write nasty remarks about them on the  neighborhood walls.  </P> <P> The fact is that one does not retain an option on former romantic partners.  Unpleasant as it is to see another more favored than you, and at close hand,  nothing they have done merits your being unpleasant. Pretending you don't care  is the only polite stance.  </P> <P> This does not preclude dignified revenge. Most love affairs come to an end if  you wait long enough, and there may be some satisfaction for you in observing  this.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- What do you say to people who tell you what they want you  to get them for Christmas, when you have no intention of getting them anything?  </P> <P> My sister-in-law has been doing this. My husband and his sister have never  exchanged gifts for any occasion. Suddenly this year she has started telling me  things like, "You could get me this or that for Christmas -- I know y'all can  afford it."  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Your sister-in-law wants to change that policy, but perhaps  you had better make sure she isn't thinking of just changing half of it.  </P> <P> You could say "Oh, do you think we should start exchanging presents?" or "You  know, we've never exchanged presents, so you ought to be telling that to Santa  Claus, not me."  </P></p>

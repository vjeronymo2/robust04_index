			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Victoria Stegic] </F>   [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Special UN envoy  Yasushi Akashi and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic met  Sunday [17 April] in the Serb stronghold of Pale in a bid to end  the fighting around the Moslem enclave of Goradze, SRNA news  agency reported.    The meeting, also attended by Russia's special envoy to  ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin, began at 0830 GMT and was aimed  at looking into a proposal to review the security zone around  the besieged enclave, the Bosnian Serb agency said.    Churkin in recent days has become a critical player in  trying  to resolve the conflict with the United States calling on Russia  to use its influence with the Serbs to put a stop to an  escalating crisis that has put UN personnel at risk.    Commander Guy Vinet, spokesman for the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR), earlier had said that the Serbs were still holding  UN troops in the Sarajevo sector.    Their release by 0800 GMT was one of the conditions set by  UNPROFOR for the resumption of peace talks in Pale. It was  unclear, however, whether they had been released when the talks  began.    UNPROFOR was also waiting for Serb checkpoints around  Sarajevo to be reopened to allow its units to go to Gorazde to  provide a buffer force between Serb and Moslem forces.    SRNA quoted the Serb military leadership as saying that  Moslem units, backed by UN troops stationed in Ugorska, north of  Sarajevo, had shelled Serb position early Sunday. It said the  offensive stopped once the Serbs retaliated.    The agency added that fighting around Gorazde was continuing  Sunday and that the Serbs had taken control of "strategic zones"  north of Gorazde. [passage omitted]    The UN Protection Force has drawn up a plan to demilisarise  the enclave, one of the so-called UN safe areas, which has been  reduced to the town itself by the ongoing Serb offensive.    A multinational force of majority French UN troops with some  Ukrainians would enforce the plan. [passage omitted]</p>

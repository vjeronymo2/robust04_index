			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA / BOB MIESZERSKI;  </P> <P> A PROFITABLE DAY FOR DELAHOUSSAYE  </P> <P> It was a big day for Eddie Delahoussaye -- on and off the track.  </P> <P> After being absolved of blame by the stewards for the disqualification of  Excellent Lady in Friday's third race, Delahoussaye came through with four  consecutive winners Saturday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The quadruple, that put him into a tie with Chris McCarron and Alex Solis atop  the jockey standings, was completed when Stormy But Valid held off Survive's  late rally in the $84,100 Las Flores Breeders' Cup Handicap before a crowd of  27,142.  </P> <P> Seeking his fourth consecutive riding title after leading at Del Mar, Oak Tree  and Hollywood Park, Delahoussaye avoided a five-day suspension after meeting  with the stewards Saturday morning to discuss Excellent Lady's race.  </P> <P> "He (Delahoussaye) did switch sticks (change his whip from one hand to the  other) and did make a reasonable effort to keep the horse straight," steward  Pete Pedersen said. "He only came in a foot or two. It was a very complicated  decision because a lot was happening at the time."  </P> <P> Shocked when the filly's number came down Friday, Delahoussaye was delighted he  wasn't forced to take some time off.  </P> <P> "I was hoping I wouldn't get a suspension because I thought I did all I could,"  he said. "If they had given me days, I would have appealed (to the California  Horse Racing Board). And I've never appealed a suspension before.  </P> <P> "Nobody hollered out there and, looking at the films, I thought (Ying N' Yang,  the runner-up Friday) shied away from my filly. We didn't make any contact. I'm  glad it worked out the way it did as far as them not suspending me."  </P> <P> After failing with his first two mounts, Delahoussaye won the fifth with  Phantom X, who bounced back nicely after finishing last in the Hollywood  Futurity, the sixth on favored Indian Wind, who was fortunate to beat an  unlucky Ltd Edition, the seventh aboard J.T.s Pet, who came from last, and then  finished with Stormy But Valid.  </P> <P> Now perfect in three main track starts at Santa Anita, Stormy But Valid tracked  pace-setters Warning Zone, Solid Eight and Josette early, took the lead inside  the final furlong, then survived Survive's charge to win by a head in a stakes  record 1:08 1/5.  </P> <P> Owned by Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel and trained by Brian Mayberry, the  4-year-old daughter of Valid Appeal has been a model of consistency. She now  has six wins from 14 starts and has only been off the board twice.  </P> <P> "She's a hard-trying little filly," Delahoussaye said. "I could hear (track  announcer) Trevor (Denman) calling the other horse and I said, 'I better get  after her.' I'm glad the wire was there.  </P> <P> "But she was really digging in. She couldn't have gone much faster. Brian's  really done a great job with her."  </P> <P> Like Delahoussaye, Mayberry is off to a quick start at Santa Anita. The Las  Flores was his fifth win in the first 10 days, putting him one up on Neil  Drysdale, Ed Gregson, Jerry Fanning and Danny Velasquez in the trainer's race.  </P> <P> "That's cutting it close," Mayberry said. "She loves this track and I thought  she'd win today, but I didn't know she was going to cause that little  palpitation in my heart. She's a genuine little filly -- always gives her best.  She's kind of diminutive, but all heart.  </P> <P> "She does anything you want her to do. The track's playing kind of fast, so I  told Eddie I wanted her close to the pace."  </P> <P> The team of Siegel and Mayberry has been a potent factor locally for several  years. Stormy But Valid's victory followed an impressive debut by T.V. Lord, a  gelded son of Sir Gaylord, Friday.  </P> <P> "We try hard," Mayberry said. "We've got a program that we follow and it's paid  off. Mr. Siegel let's me have carte blanche. We look for good conformation and  as much pedigree as we can afford.  </P> <P> "It takes a good combination to be successful. The right owner and right  trainer hook up and it can be fun. We've been together about 14 years, so you  know he's a very patient man."  </P> <P> Also partial to the track, Survive, the 5-1 fourth choice, just missed while  being helped by the swift (:21 1/5 and :43 4/5) early fractions.  </P> <P> "One more jump," rider Russell Baze said. "I'd just as soon get beat 100  lengths as a nose. She ran well. She's a hard-trying little critter. She always  tries.  </P> <P> "Too bad they didn't write the race for six furlongs and one jump. Bad luck for  me and good luck for Eddie."  </P> <P> Warning Zone, the 9-5 favorite, was third, 2 1/2 lengths behind Survive, then  came the Wayne Lukas pair of Love And Affection and Solid Eight, Josette and  Polly's Rumor.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Stormy But Valid returned $6.20 as the 2-1 second choice and earned $47,850 for  her owners. . . . Malibu Stakes winner Music Merci worked seven furlongs in  1:25 4/5 Saturday morning for trainer Craig Lewis. The Stop The Music gelding  is readying for a start in the $200,000 San Fernando a week from today. . . .  Also working Saturday were Candi's Gold and Hawkster. Coming back after a year  at stud, Candi's Gold went five furlongs in :58 3/5. He'll run in the $100,000  San Carlos Handicap Saturday. Hawkster, preparing for the Charles H. Strub  Stakes Feb. 4, worked six furlongs in 1:11 1/5.  </P> <P> Quiet American, who was most impressive in an allowance race last week, will  bypass the San Fernando and make his next start in the Strub, trainer Gary  Jones said. . . . Trainer Mike Mollica was fined $400 for a medication  violation last month at Hollywood Park. Mollica's Polysemous, who won the  second race Dec. 23, was found to have been given butazolidin in excess of the  permitted level. . . . Dominant Dancer, who was beaten 20 1/2 lengths in the  Hollywood Futurity, has had a second blister applied to her troublesome shin  and should be back in training late next month.  </P></p>

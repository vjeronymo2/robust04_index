			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Iberians ease rates BOTH the Spanish and Portuguese central banks cut their official short-term interest rates yesterday following the devaluations of both the peseta and escudo on Thursday, writes James Blitz. The Bank of Spain cut its key 10-day repo rate by 150 basis points to 11.5 per cent, while the Bank of Portugal cut its key 'mop up' rate by 200 basis points from 17 per cent to 15 per cent. Both moves led to substantial cut in money market rates. Three-month interest rates in Spanish pesetas were quoted at about 7.64 per cent late yesterday, having been at 12.62 per cent late on Thursday. In Europe, however, there was a more muted reaction, following cuts in interest rates in both France and Germany earlier in the week. Short-dated French franc futures rose yesterday, retracing some of the bullishness about rate cuts that had been seen on Thursday, following the Bank of France's 25 basis point cut in its intervention rate. The June French franc contract closed at 92.64 yesterday, some 7 basis points down on the day. The September French franc contract also closed at 92.34, down 6 basis points on the day. Interest rates in the French franc cash market rose, with 3-month French francs finishing at 7.50 per cent, some 15 basis points up on the day. In Germany, conditions in the cash market were a good deal tighter as the Bundesbank continued to withdraw funds from the money market with currency repurchase operations. Dealers said that call money had been as high as 7.80 per cent, with a few reporting transactions as high as 8.00 per cent. This compared with a rate of 8 per cent on Thursday. The Bundesbank said on Thursday that its draining operations were aimed at correcting exaggerated market expectations about an interest rate cut. In the sterling interbank market, the overnight rate fell to around 4 per cent after the remainder of a Pounds 1bn shortage was removed in afternoon operations. However, 3-month money firmed, to finish the week at around 6 per cent from a previous 5 15/16 per cent. Dealers took the view that the prospect of a reduction in base rates in response to the government's political difficulties had probably diminished.</p>

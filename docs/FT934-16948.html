			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Lloyd's reinsurer may cut payouts NEWCO, the reinsurance company being set up by Lloyd's of London to ring fence old liabilities, may ask some claimants to accept smaller but earlier settlements to cut costs for both sides. Large American pollution claims dating from before 1986 would be the most likely candidates for this type of arrangement, known as commutation. The claimant would be persuaded to accept a lump sum of less than the entire claim before the full payment becomes due, and could then invest it to make up the shortfall. Such deals would be sought 'for the sake of certainty and finality', a Lloyd's spokesman said. They could also save both sides the considerable legal bills incurred in long court disputes. Plans for the reinsurer's operation are now becoming more detailed after the appointment last week of Ms Heidi Hutter as project director for the creation of NewCo, which is expected to be operational from January 1996. Commutation of claims has not been common practice at Lloyd's before now, because the kind of claims for which it is appropriate would usually have been underwritten by a large number of syndicates, which would all need to agree before an approach could be made to the claimant. NewCo will take responsibility for all pre-1986 liabilities, and so will have greater flexibility in such negotiations.</p>

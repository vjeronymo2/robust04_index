			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma Appeal "in </F> Connection with the Situation on the Territory of the Former  Yugoslavia"]    [Text] Moscow, 13 May 1994 -- The Russian Federation  Federal Assembly State Duma believes that in the situation which  has taken shape a real opportunity has appeared for establishing  peace on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.    In this connection the State Duma appeals to all sides  taking  part in the conflict to cease all hostilities immediately and to  embark on talks to establish peace. For its part the State Duma  is prepared to render all-around assistance to set up dialogue  between the sides involved.    The State Duma appeals to all parliaments of the world to  prevent decisions which could destabilize the situation in the  former Yugoslavia and primarily those leading to the violation  of the embargo on arms supplies to any of the warring sides.    The State Duma suggests that the parliaments of states  adjacent to the territory of the former Yugoslavia hold an  international conference with the participation of UN and CSCE  representatives on ways of overcoming the crisis in the Balkans.</p>

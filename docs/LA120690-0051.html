			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> More 'Saigon' Casting Calls: Cameron Mackintosh and Actors' Equity may be in  for another go-round on the casting of "Miss Saigon." Mackintosh, who pledged  to try to find an Asian-American actress to play the title role created in  London by Lea Salonga (a Filipina), told Equity on Tuesday that, after an  extensive search, he had found no one with the proper prerequisites and  requested permission to cast Salonga.  </P> <P> Equity's Dick Moore would say only that the request would go to Equity's Alien  Committee for a recommendation and then be put to a vote by the Equity Council.  Equity and Mackintosh had clashed last summer over the casting of Jonathan  Pryce, a Caucasian, in the Eurasian role of the engineer. Equity at first  denied permission for Pryce to re-create the role on Broadway, then changed its  mind after Mackintosh said he would not bring the show to New York. CLAUDIA  PUIG  </P></p>

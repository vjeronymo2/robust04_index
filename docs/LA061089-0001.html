			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE IN HUNTER CASE SAYS TRIAL MAY LAST INTO OCTOBER  </P> <P> The judge hearing the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud case has told jurors that the  trial will probably last through September and possibly into October.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam made the announcement Thursday to the  jury, which earlier had been told that the trial would probably end in July.  </P> <P> The announcement may mean that the trial could recess for several weeks in the  summer to accommodate jurors' vacations, but that has not been decided yet.  </P> <P> The attorneys could not comment about the announcement because of a gag order  imposed by Gilliam a month ago against talking with the press. But, before the  gag order was issued, Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo told the judge that  Hunter's attorneys were spending an unusually long time in cross-examining  investors.  </P> <P> Jury selection in the lengthy trial involving 234 counts began in late March,  and testimony started in mid-April.  </P> <P> Testimony continued Friday from investors who lost money when the J. David  &amp; Co. investment house collapsed.  </P> <P> Melvin Crain, a former political science professor at San Diego State  University, testified this week that Hunter's role in the firm was "one of the  major influences" causing him to invest $25,000 in J. David Banking.  </P> <P> "She was well known to me as an active member of the Democratic Party . . .  (and as) mayor of Del Mar," Crain said.  </P> <P> Responding to questions from Richard Marmaro, one of Hunter's defense  attorneys, Crain said he thought Hunter was reputable and respected, as well as  a top executive in J. David.  </P> <P> Hunter is facing the 234 counts stemming from her alleged participation in the  giant Ponzi scheme masterminded by J. David (Jerry) Dominelli. When the J.  David firm went bankrupt in February, 1984, 1,500 people had lost $80 million.  </P> <P> Also testifying this week was Bert Wahlen, a major J. David investor who at the  time was a vice president at Group W broadcasting.  </P> <P> Wahlen testified that he had difficulty obtaining information as to why his  account was not faring as well as a friend's, but that Hunter explained to him  there "were cycles in the business." Wahlen said the discussion influenced his  decision to keep his money in the account.  </P> <P> Wahlen said he met with Hunter once because he had the names of some potential  investors. However, she never contacted him to follow up on the tips, he  testified.  </P></p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Motorcycle Mecca Yesterday saw the start of the annual Isle of Man TT races. The event attracts about 30,000 fans, at least 10,000 of whom travel with their bikes, Sue Stuart writes. Residents welcome the races as a boost to the economy, but in recent years the influx to an island with a population of only 70,000 has also brought difficulties. Mr Alan Bell, Manx tourism minister, said: 'Our biggest trouble is logistical - getting to the island and then accommodating the numbers of fans.' Over the past five years, the number of registered tourist beds has halved because of declining tourism outside the TT period. The tourist board has appealed for residents to accommodate race fans. The Isle of Man Steam Packet, the island's only ferry service, has also cut services over the past few years.</p>

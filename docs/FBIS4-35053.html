			<p>CSO     [Text] Eduardo Fernandez, president of the Thought and  Action Foundation, has presented 10 proposals "that may help us  out of the crisis, stabilize the economy, and launch a period of  growth and social prosperity." He revealed the proposals at the  forum "How to Have Confidence in Venezuela," which was organized  by the Metropolitan University Student Council. The forum, which  is taking place at the Consolidated Cultural Center, will  conclude today.    He stated that "at the Thought and Action Foundation, we  have  been studying the country's economic and social crisis. A few  days ago, Harvard University invited me to a seminar to discuss  the economic and social situation in Latin America. Countries  that are achieving success, like Chile, Argentina, Peru,  Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico, were cited as examples there.  Venezuela is not yet on that list of successful countries."    Fernandez asserted that "Venezuela can be just as successful  as other countries, if not more so, if we do things right."    The 10 proposals put forward by Eduardo Fernandez are the  following:    1. Restructure public finances. This includes, of course, a  reform of the tax system to expand the base of taxpayers paying  moderate rates. In other words, a value-added tax throughout the  chain of commercial sales, that is, all the way to the final  consumer. The countries that have achieved success have done it  this way.    2. Pursue a serious privatization policy that will open up  opportunities for new and better investment, both national and  international.    3. Defend workers' wages and middle class income. Because  this is so necessary, the battle against inflation and the high  cost of living must be a top priority. Part and parcel of this  effort is support for the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) in its  defense of the country's foreign reserves and its efforts to  stabilize the bolivar.    Confidence is not the exclusive responsibility of the BCV.  There must be harmony between monetary and exchange policy and  fiscal policy.    4. Work to create jobs and wealth. To deal with  unemployment,  both actual and potential, we need a policy of openness to  domestic and foreign public and private investment.    At this time, Venezuela is not on the list of countries  where  international advisers are recommending investment. Other  countries are making investments that could come to our shores  and help create jobs and generate wealth. I have talked to  people associated with international financial centers, and they  acknowledge that with a coherent economic policy, Venezuela  could once again be an attractive place for investment.    New investment will come in when we have clear and stable  rules of play. We must not forget that new investment  represents new jobs, new job opportunities, and new economic  resources for the country.    5. Continue to be an oil-producing country. The Investment  Plan of Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. (PDVSA) is ready. This  program must be given broad national support. We must also  support the strategic partnerships that have been designed to  contribute to the development of our oil potential.    6. Move ahead decisively to create pension funds and  modernize the reform of social benefits with a view to giving  Venezuelan workers a comprehensive and modern system of social  security. The Thought and Action Foundation organized a seminar  on this issue a few weeks ago, and I have no doubt that the  climate is right for reaching a broad consensus in this regard.    7. Complete the clean-up of the Venezuelan financial system.  To achieve this goal, I propose a policy of openness and  competition. Only in this way will Venezuela's development be  assured of enough solid financing to make it competitive in the  world economy.    By opening up the system and encouraging competition, we  will  help reduce interest rates, which is necessary to stimulate  investment in projects that are of interest for economic growth.    8. Adopt a policy of openness to international trade and  integration in increasingly larger economic spheres. In the long  run, the objective should be for our country to join a  hemispheric free trade pact extending all the way from Alaska to  Patagonia. In the short run, we should strengthen our  subregional accords and our compliance with the obligations we  have undertaken by joining GATT.    9. Negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, the World  Bank, and the Multilateral Agencies to profit from all the  advantages offered by these organizations. In particular, we  should seize the opportunity to strengthen our international  reserves.    10. Make educational reform a national priority. It is  particularly important to emphasize the training of human  resources to ensure that Venezuelan workers will have access to  better jobs and higher pay. The 10 points I have proposed here  could be reduced to three very specific proposals:     -  Produce more foreign exchange.    -  Manage it better.    -  Ensure  that everyone will have a share in our national wealth,  primarily through education.     I contend that "a climate of understanding among all the  players on the national stage will contribute to the development  of this program." "If we do things right, and if we tell the  country the truth right up front, we will win the confidence  battle, and we will put Venezuela on the road to economic  progress and social prosperity," he concluded.</p>

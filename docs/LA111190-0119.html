			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE BEST OF WEST, BUT GET NO RESPECT;  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT'S BASKETBALL TEAM HAS TO PROVE ITSELF AGAIN  DESPITE AN IMPRESSIVE LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  </P> <P> Has it been a mirage, a five-year hallucination?  </P> <P> It is there in print for anyone who wants to bother to check: the Loyola  Marymount basketball team not only led the nation in scoring the past three  seasons and shattered nearly every collegiate scoring record, but over the past  five seasons had the best record among West Coast teams. Better than UCLA,  Oregon State, UC Santa Barbara and Stanford.  </P> <P> In fact, the Lions had a better record in the past three seasons than any team  in the West with the exception of Arizona and Nevada-Las Vegas.  </P> <P> And the Lions return several starters and eight lettermen from last season's  Final Eight team.  </P> <P> None of that seems to have mattered with the national pollsters, who seem to  feel that with Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer gone and Paul Westhead  having moved on to the NBA, Loyola is again in a prove-it situation.  </P> <P> Nobody at Loyola is claiming there is another Gathers or Kimble on this  season's team, but it's a bit disconcerting that so many of the players who  helped dismantle defending champion Michigan -- among other teams -- in the  NCAA tournament in March should get so little respect.  </P> <P> A backcourt of swift point guard Tony Walker, scorer Terrell Lowery and  kamikaze defender Tom Peabody might be considered a fearsome trio in the  Atlantic Coast Conference or Big East, but as Loyola's representatives they  couldn't even manage to make the all-underrated listing in the Sporting News.  </P> <P> But the Lions seem to enjoy the underdog role. Maybe it gives them an edge.  </P> <P> "I like my team," said Jay Hillock, who takes over the team after five seasons  as Westhead's assistant.  </P> <P> Hillock doesn't have -- or covet -- Westhead's aura of nutty professor, but at  the West Coast Conference media day last week he said: "As a coach I'm very  confident. We'll play along the same lines (as Westhead). I have big shoes to  fill, but I think it will be easier to replace the coach than Gathers and  Kimble. Our system with less firepower, our margin of error is not that great.  (But) things are good in Lion country. We have enough maturity to make some  impact."  </P> <P> Lowery, a junior who is expected to assume the bulk of the scoring  responsibilities, said he's not bothered by the apparent lack of respect.  </P> <P> "Hank and Bo were great players, but the system made them great players," he  said. "They didn't score that much (as freshmen) at USC. Anything is possible  in our system.  </P> <P> "Many people thought Hank and Bo were a flash in the pan. We might be capable  of more flashes in the pan. We do have something to prove."  </P> <P> The Lions play what the Sporting News rates as the toughest December schedule  in the nation, with road games against preseason Top 10 teams UCLA, Oklahoma,  Louisiana State and Georgia Tech. So they may start the new year with a  mediocre record.  </P> <P> West Coast Conference Commissioner Michael Gilleran said if people fail to give  the Lions the respect they have earned, "they're not people who understand  college basketball."  </P> <P> "We feel you're better off to show what you have against the best," he said.  "If it results in losses to Top 20 teams on the road, so be it. You like to be  in a nice neighborhood."  </P> <P> After Loyola bid farewell to basketball standouts Bo Kimble, Jeff Fryer and the  late Hank Gathers last season, Hillock said there were qualities about them  that the Lions would miss beyond their scoring.  </P> <P> Gathers and Kimble gained notoriety while leading the nation in scoring in  consecutive seasons, and Fryer set NCAA records for his three-point shooting.  What the public didn't see, according to Hillock, was a toughness that came out  in pressure situations.  </P> <P> "If we needed a big rebound or a big defensive play, Hank or Bo would get it,"  Hillock said. "And Fryer and Per Stumer were tough kids"  </P> <P> Although his practices and scrimmages have been termed "brutal" by the players,  Hillock isn't sure how tough his team will be.  </P> <P> "We're not a really physical team," he said. "The Peabodys and O'Connells are  going to have to be the enforcer types -- and hopefully the Czech (Richard  Petruska). He's a wide-body type but I just haven't seen enough of him to  evaluate his game."  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills placed three players on the 10-man All-California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. soccer first team and had seven players honored  overall.  </P> <P> Seniors Martin Mira, Mark Lincir and Mark Merino all earned first-team honors,  and another senior, Kaveh Razaghi, was named to the second team. Three Toro  underclassmen, junior goalie Steve Bame, freshman Clemente Gonzales and  sophomore Tony Grilli, received honorable mention.  </P> <P> Cal State Bakersfield junior midfielder Leslie O'Connor was named CCAA most  valuable player and Bakersfield's Simon Tobin was the coach of the year.  </P> <P> The Dominguez Hills golf team, coached by John Johnson, is ranked in the  Division II Top 20 for the seventh consecutive year. The Toros are 20th in the  1991 preseason poll.  </P> <P> Johnson, the senior member of the Dominguez Hills athletic department -- his  1968 golf team marked the opening of the athletic department -- said "this  could be one of our best teams" and he has high hopes for adding to the  school's list of All-Americans.  </P> <P> The Toros' best team, in 1985, produced two All-Americans -- Patrick Burke and  Mack Smith -- on its way to a No. 7 ranking. Scott MacDonald earned All-America  honors in 1983 and '84, and Burke also earned academic All-American honors in  1985. Johnson has also produced two pros: Burke is on the PGA Tour and Eugene  Hardy, a 1977 graduate, is the teaching pro at Victoria Golf Course.  </P> <P> This year's top player appears to be Enrico Montano, who has shot rounds of 69  twice in the past two weeks.  </P> <P> "He has a shot at the PGA Tour," Johnson said. "He is a dedicated golfer. He  really works at his game. He's not only a good player physically, but mentally  he's very sharp."  </P> <P> The Toros open the season in February, when Johnson embarks on his 43rd year of  coaching. He started out in the profession as an assistant football coach at  UCLA in 1949.  </P> <P> "I'm a six decade man," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills sophomore Amy Rubin could become the soccer team's career  scoring leader midway through next season. With 19 goals this season, she has  25 in her career, nine short of breaking Kristi White's school record. White  also holds the record for career points with 97. Rubin has 57. . . . The Loyola  Marymount soccer team finished the season with a 3-18 record. Tommy Stevenson  and Eric Hill tied for the team scoring lead with 12 points. Stevenson, a  senior, was the top goal-scorer with six. . . . Loyola basketball co-captain  Tom Peabody, who suffered a detached retina over the summer, will wear goggles  when playing this season. "They wouldn't let me play without them," he said.  </P></p>

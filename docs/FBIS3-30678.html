Von Moltke later told reporters he had come to Budapest to  discuss implementation of the peace-partnership plan and help  draw up a document in which Hungary would outline its  cooperation concepts to Brussels.    His talks with Jeszenszky concerned the delegation of a  Hungarian liaison officer to NATO's Brussels headquarters, and  military-planning cooperation between NATO and Hungary.    Von Moltke described the peace-partnership plan as a process  permitting cooperation on an extensive scale. He said  preparations would soon begin for the first joint military  exercise, to be held before the year is out.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Regions Forecast Rising Health Care </F> Deficits"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- The government continues to  underestimate financial needs for regional health care spending  and the sector's deficit, now at more than eight trillion lire  (five billion dollars), will probably double by the end of this  year, according to a report released Thursday [31 March] at the  State-Regional Conference.    The new government, said the report, will have to face yet  another financial "emergency," that of inaccurate estimates for  regional health care needs and the subsequent overspending. The  regions want the next executive to calculate needs according to  "realistic" data but "without imposing balanced state finances  as a pre-requisite."    They want the government to identify the level of health  care  services that can be provided with existing resources and want  regions to be given greater independence in levying and  collecting health taxes. Among the proposals forwarded by the  conference was to link regional per-capita income averages to  spending standards and to have part of the national health care  funds set aside for the poorer regions.    Figures for 1992 and 1993 show deficits in regional health  care finances of 2.632 and 6.093 trillion lire respectively, for  a total 8.725 trillion lire (5.25 billion dollars). The  shortfall for this year, according to the report, will be some  two trillion lire higher last year's, or 8.290 trillion lire  (4.99 billion dollars), because spending will amount to 90  trillion lire instead of the 81.71 trillion lire forecast by the  government.    The criteria used by the government to make its estimates,  said the report, "are not totally realistic or acceptable," and  will lead to a drop in health care standards.</p>

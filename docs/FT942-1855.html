			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Manweb Manweb shows the virtues of a utility sticking to its knitting. Out of the 12 regional electricity companies, Manweb stands out as the one which has diversified the least since privatisation. It has duly been rewarded with the highest stock market rating, with its yield on a 10 per cent discount to the sector. The most obvious reason is that Manweb has avoided the foolish acquisitions of its peers. It has not wasted money on contracting in the way that East Midlands and, to a lesser extent, Swalec have. Nor has it piled into retailing, a business to which it is hard to see recs adding much value. Nor even has it invested in generation, a move that has so far been profitable for most recs but where again it is not clear they possess any competitive advantages. But the avoidance of foolish investments is only one reason why sticking to the knitting pays off. Even more important is that Manweb's senior management has not been distracted from improving efficiency in its core distribution business. Manweb has done more than other recs, with the possible exception of Eastern, to reduce costs. In theory, that should leave it well placed to survive the tighter price caps due to be unveiled in August by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. The idea is that those which have made the biggest strides to improve efficiency will be rewarded by being allowed to keep a share of the benefits. Those that have done the least will be spurred on with a tougher challenge.</p>

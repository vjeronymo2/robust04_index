			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris bourse collapses in Alcatel aftermath The fragility of yesterday's bourse gains was emphasised by the low level of turnover in Germany, and the rapid downswing on bad news in France, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS collapsed in the afternoon as Alcatel-Alsthom, the energy and telecommunications conglomerate, confirmed that its chairman, Mr Pierre Suard, had been questioned by police in the Paris region. Alcatel, France's second biggest quoted company and with a near 8 per cent weighting in the CAC-40 index, fell FFr49 to FFr541; the CAC 40 index closed 6.68 lower at 1,866.18 after an intraday peak more than 40 points higher. Turnover was thin at FFr2.7bn. There were worries that there could be a knock-on effect from the Alcatel affair, and Generale des Eaux, for example, lost FFr11 at FFr515 after a day's high of FFr551. Elsewhere, AGF, the insurer, dropped FFr29.20, or 6.3 per cent, to FFr437.80, although brokers found nothing severely disappointing in a domestic press report yesterday. FRANKFURT took a day off from immediate worries about American initiatives in the currency, bond and equity markets, and the Dax index, having risen 17.88 to 2,054.40 on the session, extended its gains in the afternoon to end on an Ibis-indicated 2,061.70. However, the upswing was described as fragile. Brokers pointed to turnover, down from DM5.9bn to DM4.4bn, and said the market was waiting for the result of today's Federal Open Market Committee in Washington, and its potential effect on US interest rates. Other potential foreign influences included the visit of Chinese Prime Minster Li Peng, who said that China will agree business deals worth Dollars 3.5bn with German companies this week. However, while Siemens said it had big prospects here, dealers said that a DM7.50 rise to DM662.50 for the stock was not connected with the Chinese visit. Domestic news included a DM10 rise to DM704 for Deutsche Bank, after it said there was no evidence of 'dishonourable conduct' by members of Deutsche's staff in regard to the Schneider affair. MILAN marked time in very thin turnover, the Comit index gaining 3.43 at 686.84. Shares in Cartiere Burgo, the paper maker, recovered from a low of L8,700 to finish L384, or 4.1 per cent, down at L9,080 in reaction to its announcement on Friday of a L230bn capital call to finance future purchases. The stock was suspended temporarily at the start of trade because the sharp price fall made it difficult to match orders. Fiat put on L84 at L6,458 in further response to last week's positive forecasts, although volume was a low 5m shares. ZURICH was higher in low volume, the SMI index adding 47.5, or 1.8 per cent, to finish at a day's high of 2,636.4. Banks were firmer, with some said to be using the low volume to push their own shares higher. CS Holding bearers, up SFr24 at SFr574, led the active list. Among exporters benefiting from expectations of a firm dollar, Roche certificates rose SFr85 to SFr6,415, Brown Boveri SFr28 to SFr1,191 and Nestle SFr14 to SFr1,131. AMSTERDAM found support in a steady dollar and marginally higher bond prices. The AEX index rose 3.48 to 388.00. ABN-Amro firmed 80 cents to Fl 60.40 on the view that it had been oversold during the market's recent fall, while DSM, the chemicals group with cyclical recovery potential, moved up Fl 4 to Fl 133.50. BRUSSELS climbed on selective programme buying from London, the Bel-20 index ending 30.52, or 2.2 per cent, stronger at 1,432.66. Higher bond prices and a firm dollar were also put forward as reasons for the rally, which took the interest rate-sensitive utility Electrabel up 2.9 per cent to BFr5,660 in the day's largest volume. Royale Belge, Belgium's largest insurance group, rose BFr380, or 7.6 per cent, to BFr5,380, but dealers said the stock was illiquid and catching up with the market after lagging behind for three months. MADRID trading was hindered by technical problems but the general index still managed to rise 1.74 to 300.82 in turnover of Pta18.2bn. Telefonica was the most active stock, up Pta35 at Pta1,805 in some 5.4m shares following last week's move into the Unisource European telecoms joint venture with companies from the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden. TEL AVIV extended Sunday's near 4 per cent fall with a further 3 per cent decline, leaving the market at its low for the year. The Mishtanim index lost 4.95 at 159.40, for a 40 per cent drop since the start of the year, in turnover up to Shk162m from Shk135m. The declines prompted Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, to express concern, saying the economic situation was far better than was suggested by the performance of the stock exchange. HELSINKI rose 1.2 per cent, led higher by strong gains for Nokia shares. The Hex index added 20.6 at 1,698.3. Nokia jumped FM24 to FM451 and the preferred FM18 to FM450: the shares found strong demand in New York on Friday after the company announced the pricing for an offering of 5.3m preferred shares.

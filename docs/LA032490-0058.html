			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARKS WORKER WINS HEARING ON PROMOTION  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County hearing officer -- reviewing an employee's complaint that  he lost a promotion to a "crony" of a Parks and Recreation Department official  -- has found that the deparment violated Civil Service rules.  </P> <P> William de la Garza, a 29-year county employee, contended that Henry Roman, a  friend of a department official, was appointed to a regional director's job  that de la Garza said had been promised to him.  </P> <P> The hearing officer will recommend that de la Garza be placed in the position  on a temporary basis.  </P> <P> Rees Lloyd, attorney for de la Garza, contended Roman was hired "under the  guise of a training assignment," and had less experience in parks matters than  de la Garza.  </P> <P> John Huerta, a lawyer for the county, said Roman was a friend of a department  official but denied that was a factor in his appointment.  </P> <P> Roman apparently was interviewed for the job at a French restaurant. Asked  about that, Huerta said, "The county did not pick up the bill."  </P></p>

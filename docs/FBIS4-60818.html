			<p>BFN     [Text] Addressing journalists after the signing of  Russian-Latvian documents in the Kremlin on Saturday, President  Yeltsin apologized to the Latvians for anti-Latvian actions by  Stalin's totalitarian regime.    "We declare that again. We condemn those actions against  independent Latvia and its people," Yeltsin stressed.    Speaking in reply, Latvia's President Guntis Ulmanis voiced  hope that Yeltsin's statement would help many Latvians to get  over the prejudices piled up over the past decades in relations  with Russia.    Asked by an INTERFAX correspondent about the outcome of  bilateral talks, Yeltsin revealed that along with preparation  for the signing ceremony he and Ulmanis had drawn up guidelines  for economic accords with the view to endorse them. According  to Yeltsin, there are 10 such drafts, including documents on  free trade, on the most favoured status in trade, and on  easy-term taxation.    In Yeltsin's words, a mixed working group will elaborate on  these documents so that Russia's Premier Victor Chernomyrdin  could sign them during a visit to Riga. However, it is too  early to say when precisely he will go there, Yeltsin said.</p>

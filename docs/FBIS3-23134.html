The coming days  will witness military operations against this entity in the  occupied territories, not outside.    He said these operations will target the settlers and the  gangs that supervised the execution of these massacres, in  addition to assassinating Israeli officials in the Zionist camps  as happened in the operation of Khalid Akar [PFLP-GC martyr].    He expressed the belief that 'Arafat will go ahead in the  negotiations process, and said: 'Arafat is a man who became  involved in this process and will not retreat, the same thing  happened with [Former Egyptian President Anwar] al-Sadat. We  hope that what is taking place in the occupied territories will  be a lesson to 'Arafat and his clique, and that they will  benefit from this lesson and refrain from wagering on the  Zionist enemy.</p>

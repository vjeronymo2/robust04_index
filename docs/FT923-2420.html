			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Alarm and disbelief in industry LAST NIGHT'S decision to suspend sterling within the ERM was the last straw for the UK's business leaders in a day of pure bewilderment. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'We are disappointed that the government has been blown off course by the currency markets. We think the government should urgently restore some certainty to its financial policies. The absence of clear guidelines will further weaken business confidence and the prospects for economic recovery.' Earlier in the day Mr Paul Coker, managing director of the food group Ranks Hovis MacDougall, said: 'I can't remember experiencing anything like this before. The whole thing seems crazy. It's difficult to make rational decisions.' Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI and chairman of the brewing group Whitbread, said: 'As an industrialist I find it hard to credit what is happening to our currency. We do not need a devaluation of sterling. Perhaps a lot of currency speculators do.' The rise in interest rates to 12 per cent was also greeted with general dismay. Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of the consumer electronics group Amstrad, said the effect on consumer spending would be disastrous. 'This will impact heavily on the high street and companies like Amstrad in the key selling season leading up to Christmas,' he said. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, said: 'People are so terrified, they just aren't spending. This will frighten them even more. It will be full stop and let's get under the bed for a week or two.' Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said: 'If these rates persist, the result can only be a huge increase in company failures. We could soon be contemplating the horrendous prospect of  1/2 m jobless building workers.' Mr Neil Marshall of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing the UK's 7,000 franchised motor dealers, said that, almost irrespective of what happened next, any remaining consumer confidence had been destroyed by yesterday's events. Before the decision to float sterling was announced most industrialists continued to defend the government's policy of maintaining sterling's level. 'We need higher interest rates like we need a hole in the head,' Sir Michael Angus said. 'But if it is a choice between that and devaluation then I suppose it will have to be.' Mr Ken Minton, chief executive of Laporte, the chemical company, said it would be wrong to change course now. The tobacco group BAT said: 'To leave the ERM would be to have suffered in vain'. Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman of Pilkington, the glass group whose profits have sagged as the recession has affected its two main customers, the building and vehicle industries, said he hoped the rate increase might break 'the logjam' of economic policy which had been 'just too rigid'. The decision to float sterling was welcome news for Sir Owen Green, chairman of the industrial conglomerate BTR, who had called for sterling to float earlier in the day. Even the government's supporters acknowledged that higher interest rates would have a punitive effect on their own investment plans. Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman of the engineering group Siebe, said managers were entering uncharted waters. 'The cost of money was already a significant factor in decisions and now it has become even more expensive,' he explained. 'It will put a further damper on levels of investment.' Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, called for government action to stimulate the economy. 'We believe that present circumstances make it even more imperative that the government takes targeted action to stimulate key areas of the economy,' he said. City analysts said the rise in interest rates should not have as bad an effect on UK companies as it did two years ago. The flood of rights issues last year has done much to reduce corporate debt, although it is still at high levels historically. Also, many companies with assets in the US have, like Hanson, moved their debt into dollars in order to take advantage of low US interest rates. But companies whose assets are declining in value will see their gearing rise even if their debt does not. Lower sterling would boost the profits of UK companies, since about half of the profits of quoted companies come from abroad. Andrew Jack writes: Commercial property experts said yesterday it was too soon to judge the effect on the market of the sudden interest-rate rise but suggested there would be little damage in the short term. Mr Gerald Blundell, head of investment strategy at Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyors, said: 'This is more to do with 24-hour money than 24-year property cycles. There will be no immediate impact.' Mr Rod Grant, managing partner of surveyors Hillier Parker, said: 'We can't class this as good news. We are not panic-stricken because we saw it coming, but it is still a bit of a jolt.'</p>

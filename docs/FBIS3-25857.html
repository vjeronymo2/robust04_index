Agriculture must be a priority in economic work.    He said: Rural economic structural adjustment must proceed  on the basis of maintaining a stable increase in grain  production with a focus on the development of township and town  enterprises, animal husbandry, and highly efficient industrial  crops.    Governor Chen Shineng continued: Township and town  enterprises should implement the policy of major development and  major improvement and ensure a 30 percent annual growth rate  while striving for 40 percent. This year, the province will  build 20 small industrial zones for township and town  enterprises' development. In animal husbandry, aquatic  breeding, and crop planting, we should develop pig breeding step  by step, vigorously develop the breeding of cows and sheep, step  up the development of eel breeding, and explore the development  of all kinds of industrial crops. In two years, we should  strive to raise the proportion of the output value of animal  husbandry and aquatic breeding to the gross agricultural output  value to more than 30 percent. In industrial crops, we should  develop flue-cured tobacco, tea oil, tea, and Chinese medical  herbs.    Governor Chen Shineng pointed out: In the course of  improving large and medium state-owned enterprises, we should  boldly develop the nonstate economic sectors and take this as a  strategic point in establishing a market economic structure and  stimulating Guizhou's economic development, so as to gradually  form a pattern for multiple economic sectors, equal competition,  and common development.    Chen Shineng said: Beginning this year, we will put nonstate  economic sectors in the economic and social development program  and will determine a clear development objective and policy.  With the exception of those that have been specifically  stipulated by the state, restrictions will be lifted on  operational scale, methods, and scopes of nonstate-owned  economic sectors. We will support individual industrial and  commercial households in carrying out border trade, as long as  they have the necessary conditions; in building joint-venture or  cooperative enterprises; and in doing business or building  enterprises abroad. Financial departments should allocate funds  for the development of individual and nonstate economic sectors,  which are entitled to equal treatment as state-owned enterprises  and township and town enterprises. We should list the  operational sites of individual industrial and commercial  households in the urban construction program. Wherever  possible, we should build all kinds of professional markets and  small commodities markets and actively assist nonstate  enterprises that have certain potential and good foundations in  expanding their scale of operations, upgrading their facilities,  and raising their standards. We will encourage redundant  personnel as well as scientific and technological personnel in  institutions to engage in civilian-run enterprises. There are  currently more than 300,000 individual industrial and commercial  households in the province, with registered capital of 1 billion  yuan. There are more than 3,000 nonstate enterprises, with  50,000 personnel and registered capital of 400 million yuan, and  there are 685 three-capital enterprises, with registered capital  of $1.1 billion. The output value of these nonstate economic  sectors accounts for 33.5 percent of the gross industrial output  value, and their sales volume accounts for 63.1 percent of the  total market sales volume.</p>

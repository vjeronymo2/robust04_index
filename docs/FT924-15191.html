			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies It was not just sterling which was causing concern in the currency markets yesterday. The weakest members of the ERM - the punt, peseta and escudo - required the prop of intervention. Worse still, the French franc weakened sharply against the D-Mark for the first time since its narrow escape from the speculators last month. The immediate cause may be disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut interest rates on Friday, coupled with expectations that the US Federal Reserve might ease today, thus weakening the dollar. Yet the punt, peseta and escudo are increasingly tipped for devaluation against the D-Mark on calculations of purchasing power parity. The methodology may be open to question, but renewed focus on such measures underlines how far faith in monetary union - the glue which held the ERM together  - has dissolved. In this context, another  1/4 point off the Lombard rate would hardly be the whole solution. That said, governments with pretentions towards membership of the ERM core must now be praying for an unambiguous signal that German rates will fall. The weak franc shows it takes more than a good inflation record to keep pace with the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Man with a finger on Italy's pulse As deputy prime minister and interior minister, Mr Roberto Maroni is the linchpin of the Northern League's presence in the new government. His working relationship with prime minister Silvio Berlusconi will also be central to the smooth functioning of the cabinet. The 39-year-old lawyer from Varese, with a permanent cheeky grin and a grubby beard, has emerged over the past two years as one of the most formidable political talents in the country. He has demonstrated an unusual flare for second-guessing his garrulous and unpredictable leader, Mr Umberto Bossi. His smooth tongue has constantly been needed either to take the sting from Mr Bossi's comments or give them a diplomatic spin. He is genuinely loyal to Mr Bossi with whom he has shared more than a decade in the political wilderness, building up a grassroots movement in Lombardy against all odds, and with virtually no money. He revealed recently that Mr Berlusconi had tried to persuade him to leave the League and join Forza Italia; but he insists his loyalties are with the League and the movement's commitment to write a new federal constitution. He has certainly played his hand well with Mr Bossi to obtain the interior ministry. The League set its sights on this portfolio because it controls the pulse of the nation through the network of prefects and because it oversees local government. Now he will now have to absorb the innate tensions between the League and Mr Berlusconi. These will surface after the European elections since the League risks being submerged by Forza Italia. As an accomplished jazz saxophonist he may well find himself playing the blues on several occasions in coming months.</p>

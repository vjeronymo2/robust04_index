			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Sad about Uncle Sam If you have been a knee-jerk pro-American all your life, the weekend attack on Baghdad may have come as a disappointment. It did to me, and I suspect it has to oth-ers. It has certainly broken the tripartisan consensus that, until this week, prevailed in Britain. The Labour opposition, which rejoiced at President Bill Clinton's victory last November, is in a twist over his policy in Iraq. This may not surprise Conservatives who regard Labour and the Liberal Democrats as inherently anti-American. Yet in yesterday's brief debate one Conservative backbencher warned of adverse Arab reactions, while another noted the contrast between the robust intervention in Iraq and the lack of anything like it in Bosnia. Mr John Major's immediate expression of support for the US strike will be applauded by most Tory MPs. Like Mr David Howell, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, they view state-sponsored terrorism as such an overriding threat that almost anything done in the name of preventing it is justifiable. My guess is that the prime minister's endorsement of US policy will not do him much good outside that circle. I have been a fellow-traveller with the United States ever since I became politically conscious: a supporter of its role in Vietnam at a time when the then young and unheard-of Bill Clinton was declaring his opposition to that tragic venture, an opponent of the ugly anti-Americanism that has marred much post-1945 debate in Europe, an admirer of former president George Bush's skill in assembling a 26-nation coalition to prosecute the Gulf war, a citizen of the developed world who was initially pleased to see the same president dispatch a contingent of his troops to rescue starving Somalis from the grip of thugs and warlords. In short, I have followed the stars and stripes. This has been the traditional stance of those of us who were brought up to value the Atlantic alliance. In this century American blood has been spilled, twice, to rescue Europe from German domination. Yankee treasure was poured into the effort that protected us from the Soviet Union for 45 years. It defeated the odious and threatening Communist empire. If it were not for the United States, we Europeans would not be free today. So why murmur and fidget now? Sunday morning's raid is the proximate cause, not the whole explanation. The unilateral firing of 23 Tomahawk cruise missiles was, in the most moderate language of which I am capable, an inappropriate response to a failed assassination attempt. There was no immediate necessity for the action. There would have been if, say, an Iraqi aircraft had attacked a US warship. That would trigger the self-defence provisions of article 51 of the UN charter. A punitive raid, authorised by the Security Council, may yet be necessary if Iraq is to be forced to comply with the ceasefire agreement by which it is still bound. President Saddam Hussein remains anathema to most of us; legitimate attempts to bring him down can only be applauded. The botched Bush bomb plot was no such thing. It would have been better to await the outcome of the current trial of 11 Iraqis and 3 Kuwaitis in Kuwait. The defendants are charged with conspiring to kill Mr Bush. Prove their guilt, and then go after their masters. Better yet, approach the UN Security Council before, not after, giving the order to launch the missiles. That said, the raid itself could be written down as one incident in the incompleted war against President Saddam. Viewing events from the eastern side of the Atlantic, it is, however, natural to suspect that a weak president was seeking to strengthen his political position at home by showing bravura abroad. The foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, disagrees. Yet the noise from Washington yesterday was of Mr Clinton receiving praise from Congress and the electorate. A common US-based observation was that the president, who has never worn a uniform, has at last won the admiration of his previously sceptical generals. Who knows, he may also have earned the respect of foreign governments in advance of the forthcoming meeting in Tokyo of heads of government of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. This, too, might be dismissed as no more than a jaundiced interpretation of the US political scene. The deeper cause of our unease, of the shifting around in our seats, is that President Clinton, whose understandable desire not to be distracted by international affairs is well known, appears to believe that technical mastery is a foreign policy. The use of missiles and high-flying aircraft is 'surgical'; if there is 'collateral damage' - that is, if civilians are killed - the lives lost are not American. Policies that involve a serious risk to US forces are not contemplated. Three decisions he has taken bear this out. In Somalia, the US contingent sent in by president Bush has handed responsibility to the UN, which has been supported by US air strikes. In Bosnia the Clinton proposal was to attack Serbian supply lines, from the air, and lift the embargo on sales of arms so that the Moslems may defend themselves. This long-distance plan was better than anything the Europeans have come up with, but it was opposed by France and Britain, which have troops on the ground, and Russia, which has historic links with Serbia. President Clinton proved unable, or unwilling, to overcome their objections. He might have done so, had he been forceful enough. The British government was afraid that the Americans would insist on their strategy; had the US been adamant the foreign office would have advised acquiescence. Chancellor Kohl was willing, as he indicated at the recent European Council meeting in Copenhagen. In sum, a strong president with a clear conception of global strategy based on enforceable principles, might have led an alliance that could check Serbian expansionism. President Clinton has the brains for such a task but it is apparent that his reading of history dictates other priorities. He will do what can be done by electronic means, as he has in Iraq. He has yet to demonstrate that he knows of any framework of decision-making that might replace the certainties of the cold-war era. Uncle Sam will continue to look after us, but not everywhere, not every time, not predictably, not at any price.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1982, the FAA amended part 67 in several areas (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). First, any disqualifying condition which previously required a formal petition for exemption was permitted to be considered for certification through special issuance procedures. Second, the prerequisite agency administrative review and decision process leading to eligibility for NTSB review of denial actions was streamlined. Third, authority was delegated to the Federal Air Surgeon to place functional limitations on medical certificates. Fourth,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;67.19 was amended to state that the Federal Air Surgeon, in granting special issuances to applicants for private pilot certificates, considers the freedom of these applicants to accept reasonable risks to their person or property that are not acceptable in the exercise of commercial or airline transport privileges, and at the same time, considers the need to protect the safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground. Fifth, clarifying interim cardiovascular standards were issued. Sixth, the alcoholism standard was revised to conform to the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970. In addition to the amendments to part 67, the preamble to the 1982 final rule announced that in accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulations, the FAA would undertake an overall review of the medical standards in part 67. This total and comprehensive review was described as a major rulemaking effort that would involve obtaining the views of the medical profession and all other interested parties and result in significant revision of part 67.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review of Part 67 of the Federal Air Regulations and the Medical Certification of Civilian Airmen; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Engelberg, A.L., Doege, T.C.; American Medical Association, under contract to DOT (DTFA01&hyph;83&hyph;C&hyph;20066); March 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document is available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Rd., Springfield, VA 22161 (accession numbers AD A166 464, Volume I ($31), and AD A166 465, Volume II ($53).

A synopsis of the 750-page, 2-volume report was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA Vol. 255, No. 12, pp. 1589&hyph;1599) on March 26, 1986, and is available at many libraries and has been placed in Docket No. 23190.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Current Requirements_Medical Certification of Airmen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 67 of the FAR provides for the issuance of three classes of medical certificates. A first-class medical certificate is required to exercise the privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate. Second- and third-class medical certificates are needed to exercise the privileges of commercial and private pilot certificates, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An applicant who is found to meet the appropriate medical standards, based on a medical examination and an evaluation of the applicant's history and condition, is entitled to a medical certificate without restrictions or limitations other than the prescribed limitation as to its duration. These medical standards are currently set forth in &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, and 67.17 (14 CFR part 67).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An applicant for a medical certificate who is unable to meet the standards in &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 may, nevertheless, be issued a medical certificate. Procedures for granting special issuances or exemptions have always been available, and, thus, the standards have never been ``absolutely disqualifying,'' in the sense that certification is permanently denied all who do not meet the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;67.19, ``Special issue of medical certificates,'' at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, acting on behalf of the Administrator under &sect;67.25 of the FAR, a special flight test, practical test, or medical evaluation may be conducted to determine that, notwithstanding the applicant's inability to meet the applicable medical standard, airman duties can be performed, with appropriate limitations or conditions, without endangering public safety. If this determination can be made, a medical certificate may be issued with appropriate limitations to ensure safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

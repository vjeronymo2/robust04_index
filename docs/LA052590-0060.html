			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORM RABBIS URGE NO BAR TO GAYS IN CLERGY  </P> <P> A committee of rabbis in the progressive Reform branch of Judaism recommends  that no restrictions be imposed on qualified gay and lesbian Jews who want to  become rabbis, panel officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Saying that Jewish tradition is squarely against homosexual behavior, the  17-member committee nevertheless unanimously adopted a guarded, but  sympathetic, stance on an issue that has agonized liberal-to-moderate churches  for decades. The recommendation came after a four-year, sometimes contentious,  study of homosexuality and the rabbinate.  </P> <P> If the recommendation is approved by a convention of Reform rabbis next month,  Reform Judaism would become the first large Judeo-Christian religious body to  approve admitting acknowledged homosexuals to their clergy. Until now, the only  approved ordinations have been sanctioned by local units of the Episcopal  Church and the United Church of Christ. Only the small Unitarian Universalist  Assn. and the tiny Reconstructionist Jewish movement have adopted  non-discrimination policies regarding homosexual aspirants to the clergy.  </P> <P> "Considering the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians in  religion, I consider this a tremendous step forward," said committee member  Yoel Kahn, rabbi of Sha'ar Zahav in San Francisco, one of four Reform  synagogues that minister to homosexual communities.  </P> <P> The Reform branch of Judaism, with 1.3 million members nationally, is the  largest and most liberal of the three major wings of American Judaism.  Conservative Judaism, the next largest, steers a more moderate course in  adapting Judaism to modern life. Orthodox synagogues, which strictly observe  Jewish law, embrace about 10% of U.S. Jewry.  </P> <P> Delegates to the 101st annual convention of Reform Judaism's Central Conference  of American Rabbis could alter or reject the recommendations when they meet in  Seattle next month. The initial reaction to the committee's report has been  favorable.  </P> <P> The committee's recommendation follows a critical but little-publicized  decision by the seminary that ordains Reform rabbis to write guidelines saying  homosexual orientation is not enough to deny admission. The Hebrew Union  College-Jewish Institute of Religion, in Cincinnati, has admitted and ordained  gay and lesbian rabbis in the past, but had never spelled out a policy.  </P> <P> The committee report said the seminary now "considers sexual orientation of an  applicant only within the context of a candidate's overall suitability for the  rabbinate." Two rabbis on the committee explained in interviews that a  candidate's sexual preference would not be asked, but the information, if  volunteered by the applicant, would be considered along with other elements of  the person's character.  </P> <P> In issuing its recommendation, the committee conceded that it may be a divisive  issue for many congregations because a rabbi is the spiritual leader and role  model.  </P> <P> "While we acknowledge that there are gay and lesbian rabbis who are serving  their communities effectively, we believe that there is a great need for  education and dialogue in our congregations," the panel said.  </P> <P> Because rabbis are expected to lead exemplary lives, the committee called upon  all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, to conduct their private lives  with discretion.  </P> <P> If delegates at the Seattle convention approve the committee report with little  change, the rabbinical association would be endorsing the guidelines of Hebrew  Union College. Late last year, Reform synagogues -- the Union of American  Hebrew Congregations -- adopted a resolution to "place no limits on (the)  communal and spiritual aspirations" of gay and lesbian Jews in their synagogues  that indicated sympathy on the issue.  </P> <P> Rabbi Samuel Karff of Houston, president of the rabbis conference and a  committee member, said by telephone that the committee's final report was a  good one.  </P> <P> "It was the best we could do with our tradition, and yet show sensitivity to  our own time and experiences," Karff said. "I hope the report will be passed  without substantial changes."  </P> <P> The rabbinical committee, however, declined to endorse wedding-like ceremonies  for same-sex couples, saying that the issue is highly debated. Even so, it  sympathetically addressed the rights and commitments of homosexuals.  </P> <P> "The committee strongly endorses the view that all Jews are religiously equal  regardless of their sexual orientation. We are aware of loving and committed  relationships between people of the same sex," it said.  </P> <P> The committee was divided on the question of whether homosexuals consciously  "choose" their sexual preferences but agreed it "is clear . . . that for many  people sexual orientation is not a matter of conscious choice but (is)  constitutional and therefore not subject to change."  </P> <P> Committee members said their report reflected the rabbis' strong concern over  the possible reactions of other Jewish bodies, but decided in the end that "our  decision should be governed by the principles and practices of Reform Judaism."  </P></p>

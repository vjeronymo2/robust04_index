			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Johnson Matthey wins tax plea JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals company, yesterday won its appeal against the Inland Revenue to receive tax relief on Pounds 50m granted to it for the rescue of Johnson Matthey Bankers, its former subsidiary, seven years ago. The Bank of England rescued the bank, which ran into difficulties on its commercial loans business, by buying its shares for Pounds 1. The rescue was conditional on a Pounds 50m cash injection from Johnson Matthey. Five law lords unanimously upheld the company's argument that the Pounds 50m was a 'revenue payment' and hence deductible for corporation tax purposes. Lord Templeman said the payment was solely to enable Johnson Matthey to continue trading, because its own platinum-trading business would have collapsed if Johnson Matthey Bankers had closed. The Pounds 50m was not paid to persuade the Bank of England to buy worthless shares in the bank, but to persuade it to rescue it and allow Johnson Matthey to survive. A payment to preserve an existing business was attributable to revenue, the lords stated. The Revenue had argued that the Pounds 50m was a 'capital payment' to enable Johnson Matthey to get rid of a capital asset, and liable to tax.</p>

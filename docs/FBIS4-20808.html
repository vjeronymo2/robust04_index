			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Proposal To Sign GATT Opposed"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 7. Opposition members in the Rajya  Sabha today vociferously opposed the Government's proposal to  sign the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and urged  it to be cautious of the U.S. designs to intimidate through  Super 301 developing countries like India for their refusal to  toe the American line.    Raising the issue during zero hour, Mr. Gurudas Das Gupta  (CPI) (Communist Party of India) referred to reports of U.S. arm  twisting with Japan to set right its huge trade imbalance and  wondered if Japan could be meted out such treatment, would a  country like India be spared. Accusing the Government of  maintaining a studied silence on such a serious issue, Mr. Gupta  urged it to give a statement on the present position.  <H5>  Be Alert, Government Urged </H5>   The issue was widely supported by all Opposition members who  wanted the Union Government to be alert against any move by  America to invoke the Super 301 Trade Act. Mr. Gupta wanted to  know the sanctity of the Dunkel draft if the U.S. was allowed to  indulge in armtwisting and asked why India was rushing to sign  the GATT.    Mr. Das Gupta said Japan was one of the U.S.'s biggest trade  partners and the U.S. could take retaliatory action after  identifying what constituted unfair trade practice, although it  could not impose any trade sanctions under the provisions of  Super 301.  <H5>  Debate Sought </H5>   Mr. I.K. Gujral (JD) (Janata Dal) demanded the scrapping of  Super 301 and said the U.S. stand was nothing short of "economic  bullying." He pleaded for an exhaustive debate on the GATT  proposals before India became a signatory to the Treaty.    Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party)  deplored the U.S. attitude of imposing economic sanctions  against Japan. "If India is not careful, the U.S. will corner us  on Kashmir or force us to sign the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty)  and even dictate our missile technology programme," he said.    Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPM) (Communist Party of India-Marxist) and  Mr. Kamal Morarka (SJP) demanded an explanation from the  Commerce Minister as a response to the concern of the House and  demanded that India should not compromise its sovereignty.  <H5>  Using Super 301 as Weapon </H5>   Mr. Jagesh Desai (Cong-I) said that because of India's firm  position on issues like Kashmir, the U.S. could be tempted to  use Super 301 as a weapon and India should be on the guard. He  maintained that the U.S. could be using Super 301 against Japan  inview of the huge trade deficit.    In response to persistent demand from members for a  statement  on the issue, the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs,  Dr. Abrar Ahmed, told the House that a special discussion on  GATT was scheduled on March 9 and 10.</p>

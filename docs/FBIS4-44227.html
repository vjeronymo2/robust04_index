			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Focus" article by Prime Minister Carl Bildt: "Corfu </F> Meeting an Important Link in European Integration"]    [Text] Today when I sign for Sweden the agreement on  membership in the European Union, the EU, alongside the prime  ministers of Finland, Norway, and Austria, history will be being  made for our respective countries, as it will for Europe as a  whole.    European cooperation has not always been something that can  be taken for granted, and in some places it still cannot be. If  we look back on the history of our continent it is easy to see  how it has been dominated by conflicts and wars, and how periods  of cooperation and security have often been torn apart by  confrontations that have sometimes also led to war.    Today's economic cooperation has a firm foundation in the  concept of peace that was born out of the horrors of the two  world wars. This simple statement of fact contains the  explanation of why cooperation has such a strong foothold in  countries like Germany and France, and why countries that have  stood or believed they could stand outside the continent's  conflicts have come to join this cooperation at a later date and  often with much greater hesitation.    The gulf that arose in West European cooperation in the  fifties -- between the EEC with its close economic and political  cooperation and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], which  was only a free trade organization -- is now finally being  bridged. This gulf is now being overcome because everyone has  finally been convinced of the value and necessity of cooperation  that is strong both politically and economically.    The cooperation within the framework of the EEC, the EC, and  the EU since the end of the fifties has certainly not been  without its problems. But the advantages have been much greater  than the difficulties. Cooperation has gradually been  strengthened over the years in order to exploit the strength  that integration has shown that it produces not only in the  EEC/EC/EU but also in individual member countries.    Taking the step into this cooperation has sometimes been  controversial, but it is a fact worth pondering -- in the  Swedish debate too -- that there is not a single member country  where the idea of withdrawing from this cooperation enjoys  popular support.    With the exception of some odd and notorious extremists  there  is no political party in any member country that supports the  call for withdrawal from this cooperation. Its value and  strength can hardly be demonstrated any more clearly. Those who  know what cooperation is do not want to do without it.    When the partnership agreement between the EU and Russia and  the four accession agreements are signed on Corfu today this  will be a clear indication that it is a new Europe we are  entering. West Europe is being united as a result of the fact  that the Nordic area and Austria are now taking their places at  the very heart of European cooperation at the same time that the  work on the reunification of Europe as a whole can now begin in  earnest.    The summit in Corfu is a link in the chain of European  integration. The meeting marks the end of the major task of  enlargement that has dominated so much of the debate and the  work inside the Union in recent years.    But the meeting on Corfu is also the start of a new phase in  which questions of growth and the question of extending  cooperation to Central European and the Baltic states will  become increasingly important.    Sweden is now taking its place as an active observer in the  EU in order to exert an influence on future cooperation through  our perspectives and values, but also to derive benefit from the  possibilities that cooperation offers.    And it is a great strength that we are doing this together  with Norway and Finland. In the last few years the Nordic  dimension has acquired an ever stronger position in our overall  European policy. EU membership offers a possibility of Nordic  reunification that will give new drive to Nordic cooperation.    Three concepts are important in the policy we now have to  pursue as active observers and, after a yes in the referendum on  13 November, as full members of Europe cooperation: growth,  openness, and enlargement.    The economic questions -- how Europe can again create strong  growth and real new jobs that can push down unemployment -- has  become an increasingly important issue since the summit in  Edinburgh at the end of 1992.    The work since then -- not least the so-called white book  from December 1993 -- has gradually led to an ever greater  convergence of view on the nature of the problems that the  European economies are wrestling with and on the policy thrust  that is needed to solve them.    If there still are political differences, there is a  remarkably strong conviction that it is only a policy aiming at  definite structural reforms in the direction of more open and  more dynamic markets that can break long-term unemployment. And  this also applies to politically difficult questions such as  reform of the labor market and its regulations.    In this context Sweden is viewed in the European debate as  something of a pioneer. After being seriously affected by major  structural problems we too have demonstrated in many fields and  under difficult circumstance the policies needed to solve them.    The two important reports that will be discussed on Corfu --  on investment in infrastructure and on investment in information  technologies -- are in line with the policies of the Swedish  Government. In actual fact our policies in both these fields  lie in the forefront of European developments.    One of the 11 major future investments in infrastructure  that  are now being given prominence is the Oresund link. This links  the Scandinavian peninsula's investments in modern railroads --  around 50 billion kronor -- in the period up to the year 2000  with the investments of around 1,000 billion kronor that will be  made in continental railroad communications in the same period.    Through the Oresund link in connection with the link over  the  Fehmarn Belt we will experience a turbo effect for the railroad  investments which are currently being made in Sweden.    Europe is finally waking up to the revolutionary changes  that  the new information technologies represent. And exploiting  these opportunities will only be possible if you are to abandon  the old monopoly thinking in the way we in Sweden have already  done.    Together with Finland and Britain, Sweden is now in the  vanguard of opening up the enormous possibilities of  developments in the field of information technology. Past EU  decisions that deregulation must be completed by 1998 at the  latest already appear out of date. The quicker deregulation  takes place, the greater Europe's chances of asserting itself in  the new global transformation.    In all these fields -- structural changes in the economy,  investment in new infrastructure, and liberalization to liberate  information technology -- Sweden is in the vanguard. And this  front position gives us more scope than others to exploit  membership of the European Union as a tool to create new and  real jobs in the typical companies of the future and  consequently better conditions for growth and prosperity in the  longer term.    Even if economic issues appear to be particularly important  in a period of rapid development, the development of European  cooperation will ultimately be decided by the political  questions surrounding peace and security.    I myself am convinced that the crucial task in the years to  come will be to find the right way to gradually extend  cooperation to the countries of central Europe and the Baltic  states.    We welcomed the decision at the Copenhagen summit a year ago  to open the door to membership for these states, and we have  warmly welcomed Hungary's and Poland's applications for  membership during the course of the spring.    It would, however, be a mistake to underestimate the  challenges with which this continued process of enlargement will  confront cooperation. The calls for changes to agricultural and  regional policy will be considerable, as will the need to change  decisionmaking procedures and other institutions.    Starting now to openly and directly discuss these questions  is the best way to prepare the way for the decisions to admit  new members that must be made in the next few years.    By its nature European cooperation is an ever continuing  dialogue and ever continuing negotiations on problems and issues  that everyone can see are best resolved in cooperation with  others because they are too big for each individual nation to be  able to solve alone.    At the Corfu meeting Sweden is now finally winning a place  in  this dialogue and these negotiations. We are winning an  influence that those on the outside can never give and  therefore, at a time of greater internationalism and  internationalization, a chance to achieve those goals and  ambitions that only cooperation can offer.    Between today's historic meeting on Corfu and the next  summit  in Essen in early December there lies a Riksdag election, in  which the different parties will outline their different visions  of European cooperation, and the referendum that will decide the  membership issue.    For me it goes without saying that Sweden too should take  part in the European cooperation in which all other nations are  striving to take part. The important question really ought not  to be whether or not we should be involved in cooperation, but  in what way we should exploit all the possibilities membership  offers and what vision of the future development of cooperation  should be ours.</p>

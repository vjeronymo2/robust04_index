			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Failed targets bring about fresh problems - The obstacles facing Brent Walker regarding the refinancing of the ring-fenced loan to its William Hill betting shops chain THINGS are hotting up again at Brent Walker. Since the property, pubs and betting group completed its Pounds 1.65bn refinancing in March last year, it has been keeping its head down - barring a management shake up in January when Sir Keith Bright came in as the new chairman. But now the group is having to write a new business plan - having so far failed to meet the targets of the proposal originally agreed with its banks  -and faces the problem of refinancing the Pounds 350m ring-fenced loan to its William Hill betting shops chain by March 1 next year. It has been reorganising the management structure of its Pubmaster, pub estate management subsidiary, and pressing on with the development or sale of its leisure activities such as the Brighton marina, the Cardiff World Trade Centre, and the Puerto Sherry marina in Spain. Meanwhile, Brent Walker is continuing to pursue Grand Metropolitan, the retail and leisure group, from which it bought William Hill and Mecca Bookmakers, for a reduction in the Pounds 685m purchase price. Brent Walker is hoping to reclaim as much as Pounds 200m from GrandMet, and the two parties are locked in arbitration. Even when that is concluded, the matter may revert to the courts. If all this was not enough to be getting on with, merchant bank SG Warburg has thrown the group into the limelight again by slapping in a consortium bid for William Hill, at a price which might be called astute, or more bluntly, cheeky. The mooted offer is of Pounds 360m, just enough to pay off the ring-fenced banks, but leaving virtually nothing over for Brent Walker. Sir Keith's view is clear. Selling to the Warburg group would represent a forced sale at a distress price. Brent Walker does not need to accept it and has a duty not only to pay off William Hill's secured banks but also to take account of its unsecured creditors and to use the asset to repay some of the parent company's creditors too. Since the equity portion for the Warburg bid, of about Pounds 180m, is to come from venture capital funds which require a 30 per cent plus rate of return, it is clear that investors willing to accept a lower return could offer more. So the first conclusion is that another type of buyer would pay more than the Warburg consortium even now. But more than that, there is the hope that as the economy recovers, and betting deregulation gathers pace, William Hill's profits will improve and the chain's value will rise. Yet another factor should also improve William Hill's profits. Currently, virtually all William Hill's cashflow is being used to pay interest charges on its debt, although a sum equal to the depreciation charge, of about Pounds 10m a year, is being reinvested in the business. However, the interest charge is artificially onerous since an interest rate swap, agreed when rates were high, has locked into an 18 per cent interest rate. That swap unwinds next year and the interest charge will fall substantially, boosting profits and producing more cash flow for investment. The William Hill value could be released through a partial flotation, or the introduction of an equity partner. One attraction of that for Brent Walker is that while William Hill is ring-fenced the parent can take no money out of it. But once it is paying dividends, Brent Walker will receive a cash return from William Hill. Brent Walker claims to have had a number of serious approaches for William Hill, at higher prices, since the Warburg offer became known, which could lead to an equity injection. While in theory it is a William Hill board decision whether to accept the Warburg offer, in practice it is up to the William Hill banks. Brent Walker has an obligation to at least investigate that offer, and any others. The William Hill banks, offered a full and early repayment of their loans, something that seemed highly unlikely a couple of years ago, might be tempted to accept. But it is not as simple as that. If more than half vote to accept the offer it will go through. However, of the Pounds 350m debt, 57 per cent is from banks which have also lent to Brent Walker. Those banks want the Brent Walker debt to be repaid as well, and if the best chance of getting that money back is by not selling William Hill for Pounds 360m then they may be inclined to hang on. On the other hand, the certainty of Pounds 360m in cash now compares with the uncertainty of a stock market float later. While the new issue market is strong at present, there is no denying that William Hill would not be the easiest business to float. Brent Walker believes it could even refinance William Hill's debt next year  -possibly bringing in new banks or persuading the Brent Walker banks to take on the William Hill debt - although privately some of its advisers think this unlikely to be achievable. If it follows one of the sale routes, though, it will have to take another hit on its balance sheet. In the 1992 accounts William Hill was valued at Pounds 701.1m, a figure which the directors admit is significantly too high. They can get away with retaining the valuation while William Hill is 100 per cent owned, claiming the fall in values is not 'a permanent diminution'. But a partial sale of William Hill, or a successful resolution - from Brent Walker's viewpoint - of the dispute with GrandMet, would set a new value causing another substantial asset write down in the Brent Walker balance sheet. If Brent Walker thought its problems were over the day the refinancing was signed it was wrong. They were only just beginning.</p>

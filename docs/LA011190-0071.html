			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> POINT GUARD KEY TO LYNWOOD GIRLS TEAM  </P> <P> Things are fine with the Lynwood High School girls basketball team, now that  the star point guard is playing to the coach's satisfaction.  </P> <P> LaShanna Wells, an all-league senior, is averaging 6 points, 4.5 assists and 3  steals a game for the Knights, who are 14-1 and ranked second behind  Morningside in the CIF Southern Section's 5-AA Division.  </P> <P> "When she's on her game and paying attention, we can beat anybody," Coach  Maurice Roberson said.  </P> <P> But Wells, daughter of Lynwood councilwoman and former mayor Evelyn Wells, was  not on her game Dec. 12 when Lynwood suffered its only loss, 62-48, to  Washington High of Los Angeles. Roberson benched her after the first quarter  and for a subsequent game.  </P> <P> "She wasn't moving the ball to the proper players," Roberson said. "She said,  'Well, they don't listen.' I said, 'No, if you do what I tell you, they'll  listen.' I could have kicked her off the team but you've got to take and give  back."  </P> <P> The Lynwood team went to Seattle the week after Christmas and won the Rainier  Beach Magic Shootout, which drew some of the top teams in the Pacific  Northwest. It was the first time most of the players, who raised money for the  trip by holding a fashion show and fish fry, had been out of California. "It  just blew their minds," Roberson said.  </P> <P> The Knights won four games in the tournament, including the championship game,  56-50, against Rainier Beach High, which had not lost in its gym in three  years.  </P> <P> Linda Watson, a 5-foot-10 guard who has signed with USC, is the Knights'  leading scorer, averaging 19 points a game. She has made 32 three-point shots  this season and more than 130 in her career.  </P> <P> Kim Barfield, a 5-foot-10 junior rebounding forward, is averaging 15 points a  game, and senior guard Nicole Sanders is averaging 14. Sanders will be the  first girl to play basketball at Cal Poly Pomona and also be in the engineering  school.  </P> <P> Roberson, 56, is in his second year as Lynwood coach.  </P> <P> How the 49ers Rank: The Cal State Long Beach men's basketball team, with a 9-2  record, is 28th in The Sporting News' Top 40 rankings this week and 51st in USA  Today's computer ratings.  </P> <P> The 49ers play tonight at UC Irvine and Saturday night at UC Santa Barbara.  They play New Mexico State in the campus gym Monday night.  </P> <P> The 49ers women's team, 10-2 and ninth in the Associated Press poll, defeated  Cal State Fullerton, 92-62, Tuesday night.  </P> <P> From Bell Gardens to Big Time: Bell Gardens High School, despite its great  success in football the last decade, has had only one graduate, Dionicio  Monarrez, who has gone on to play at a major college. Monarrez just completed  his senior season as a nose guard at the University of Nebraska.  </P> <P> But this week, offensive tackle Bob Robertson, 23, another Bell Gardens  alumnus, signed to play for Arizona State.  </P> <P> "Dionicio was kind of like ol' Bob's mentor," said Bell Gardens Coach Dave  Newell.  </P> <P> They followed similar paths. After leaving high school in 1979, Monarrez was in  the Army for three years before playing two seasons at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Robertson, who is 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds, graduated from Bell Gardens in 1983  and served three years in the Marine Corps before playing at Cerritos the last  two seasons. At Cerritos he was an honorable mention All-American.  </P> <P> They Couldn't Throw It in the Ocean: Whitney High School of Cerritos made only  six of 44 field-goal attempts (13.6%) in losing to Brethren, 54-20, Monday  night.  </P> <P> Artesia's Big Game: Artesia High School, top-ranked in CIF Division 4-A, will  play one of its biggest games in years Friday night when it meets powerful  Mater Dei, the No. 1 team in 5-A. The game will be at 7 in the Cal State Long  Beach gym and televised on the SportsChannel. "The student body and the  community are really excited about playing them," said Artesia Coach Wayne  Merino.  </P> <P> In anticipation of a large crowd, the game was scheduled for the Long Beach  gym, which seats about 2,000, 700 more than Artesia High's gym.  </P> <P> "We expect it will be packed, Merino said.  </P> <P> Mater Dei, 15-1 this season, defeated the Pioneers last year, 76-48.  </P> <P> Artesia, 11-1 before Wednesday night's game against Glenn, is led by 6-foot-9  All-American Ed O'Bannon, who is averaging 26 points and 9 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> "He's more mature this year," said Merino. "He has improved his vocal  leadership."  </P> <P> O'Bannon is expected to decide in April whether he will play at Arizona State,  Nevada Las Vegas, LSU, Syracuse, UCLA or USC.  </P> <P> Whittier College Names Coach: Don Uyeshima, 40, has received a one-year  appointment as football coach at Whittier College, replacing Hugh Mendez, who  resigned after 10 years with a 53-46 record.  </P> <P> Uyeshima, a linebacker for the Poets in the early 1970s, was an assistant at  Whittier the last eight seasons and has been teaching at La Puente High School.  </P> <P> "I grew into this," Uyeshima said. "When Hugh resigned, I felt there was a lot  of work left undone."  </P> <P> The Poets have had three consecutive 3-6 seasons.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by staff reporter Ming Chi-Liu (2494 0796 3177); </F> "dispatched from Beijing 23 January": "There Will Be No  `Legislative Vacuum' After 1997"]    [Text] Prompted by the British side's unilateral decision  to submit the "partial constitutional reform bill," which  violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and  the agreements and understandings reached previously, to the  Legislative Council, which has resulted in the derailing of the  "through train," some Hong Kong people have alleged recently  that there would be a "legislative vacuum" in Hong Kong after  1997. The legal panel of the Preliminary Working Committee  spent about five hours discussing relevant problems today and  came to the conclusion that judging from the prospective of  legal principles, there would be no such thing as a legislative  vacuum in the future Special Administrative Region [SAR].  <H3>  The British Side's Noncooperation Is at the Root of the  Problem </H3>   Before commenting the panel's opinion, we should first of  all  discuss the legal logic of the so-called "legislative vacuum."  Some people said: If the Chinese and British sides failed to  reach agreement on Hong Kong's elections, which would cause the  "through train" to be derailed, and accordingly the three-tier  councils had to be re-established after 1 July 1997, there would  certainly be a period when there were no legislative bodies, and  when legislation would thus be suspended, before the SAR  legislative council was set up. Again, since the SAR  Legislative Council would not be established on 1 July 1997 and  confirm Hong Kong's existing legal procedures, the SAR  government would not provide sufficient legal basis for its  operations.    We can discover loopholes in the above argument. First, the  argument about a "legislative vacuum" is based on the hypothesis  that there will certainly be no "through train." But this is  unfounded according to legal principles, because the British  side should replace its "three violations" bill with a "three  conformities" one before the electoral law is passed or before  elections are held according to the arrangements agreed.  Therefore, the crux of the problem lies in whether the British  side is willing to sincerely cooperate with the Chinese side,  and not in whether there will be a "legislative vacuum."  <H3>  Failure To Set Up the SAR Legislative Council Immediately  After 1 July 1997 Does Not Mean a "Legislative Vacuum" </H3>   Second, even if the "through train" should finally be  derailed and the final Legislative Council under British rule  were not to become the first SAR Legislative Council, this would  only mean something being wrong with the convergence of the  legislatures. The failure of the SAR Legislative Council to  operate immediately after the 1 July 1997 and a "legislative  vacuum" are issues of different natures, so they should not be  mentioned in the same breath. Judging from the perspective of  legal principles, a "legislative vacuum" means three things: 1)  no legislation; 2) no laws; and 3) no legislative bodies.    According to legal principles in broad sense, a "legislative  vacuum" refers to a legislative power vacuum of a government,  which is exactly what the first content of a "legislative  vacuum" refers to. But Article 2 of the Basic Law stipulates:  "The National People's Congress [NPC] authorizes the Hong Kong  SAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the  provisions of this Law and to enjoy executive, legislative, and  independent judicial power, including that of final  adjudication," therefore so long as the Basic Law still exists  when Hong Kong reverts to China on 1 July 1997 and so long as  the SAR government is established without a hitch and has power  vested in it by the NPC, the SAR will certainly enjoy inviolable  legislative power. So fundamentally speaking, there will be no  "legislative vacuum."    Third, Article 8 of the Basic Law provides: "The laws  previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules  of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation, and customary  law shall be maintained, except for those that contravene this  Law or have been amended by the legislature of the Hong Kong  SAR." Clearly, though the SAR Legislative Council cannot be set  up immediately after 1 July 1997, laws that do not contravene  the Basic Law will remain in force, and this has been guaranteed  by the Chinese Government. Therefore, if it was not considered  that the existing over 500 laws and ordinances all contravened  the Basic Law and thus must be scrapped, there would be no such  problem as a legislative vacuum; and even though many existing  laws and ordinances were found to be against the Basic Law, we  would at most face a problem of insufficient laws and ordinances.    Let us now turn to the problem concerning the SAR  Legislative  Council. We are not now in a position to certify whether there  will be a period when there will be no legislative bodies,  because the method of setting up the first SAR Legislative  Council has not been finalized. Nevertheless, if the SAR  Legislative Council cannot be set up immediately after Hong Kong  returns to Chinese sovereignty, it does not necessarily mean  legislative work will be left undone. After all, the legislative  body and legislative work are separate matters, and an equals  sign should not be drawn between them.    Therefore, with the existing articles and stipulations, a  "legislative vacuum" is unlikely in Hong Kong.  <H3>  Actual Operations Will Eliminate the Likelihood of a  "Legislative Vacuum" </H3>   On the other hand, judging from the perspective of actual  operations, even if the first SAR Legislative Council cannot be  set up immediately after 1 July 1997, there will be only  technicalities, and these technicalities will not develop into  big problems. First, of the 10 functions of the SAR Legislative  Council, only one is a legislative function, that is, "the SAR  Legislative Council shall enact, repeal, or amend laws in  accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law and legal  procedures," while the other nine functions are related to  supervision and appointments and removals. Second, the SAR will  introduce the "executive-led" political system. Under the  system the chief executive enjoys the power and function of  issuing administrative orders, and the SAR government the power  and function of "drafting and introducing bills, motions, and  subsidiary legislation." Therefore, if the SAR Legislative  Council cannot be set up immediately after 1 July 1997, it will  not produce a big substantive impact. Also, the Basic Law  authorizes the SAR Preparatory Committee to make any decisions  to facilitate the establishment of the SAR. Related foreign  experience shows that the preparatory committee for the  establishment of a new government can eliminate the possibility  of a "legislative vacuum."    To sum up, the best way to avoid a "legislative vacuum" is  for the British side to withdraw the "three violations" bill and  return to the course of cooperating with the Chinese side so  that the two sides will jointly handle the problems related to  the hand-over of political power. Even if things fail to turn  out as expected, there will be no such problem as a "legislative  vacuum" so long as the Basic Law exists. The biggest possible  problem will only be that the SAR Legislative Council will not  operate on the day political power changes hands. And  experience in actual operations reveals that it is also not  necessary for the SAR Legislative Council to do so.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EFFORT TO SELECT MEMORIAL TO DR. KING COLLAPSES  </P> <P> An 18-month effort to select a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  ended in failure Tuesday when the San Diego Unified Port District commissioners  rejected the City Council's request to rename the city's bay-front convention  center for the slain civil rights leader.  </P> <P> In a 4-3 decision, Commissioners Daniel Larsen, Raymond Burk, Milford Portwood  and Robert Penner voted to support Burk's motion to retain the name San Diego  Convention Center, established in a 1985 contract between the city and the port  district.  </P> <P> Commissioners Louis Wolfsheimer, William Rick and Delton Reopelle, who  supported the council-backed name, San Diego Martin Luther King Convention  Center, voted against the proposal.  </P> <P> The decision was the second repudiation of a San Diego tribute to King in less  than two years. In a November, 1987, referendum, San Diego voters reversed a  council decision to rename Market Street as Martin Luther King Jr. Way and  returned the downtown thoroughfare's original name.  </P> <P> Leaders of the drive to honor King vowed to pursue the racially and politically  sensitive tribute effort, which has divided the city and dogged public  officials since the council's April, 1986, decision to rename Market Street.  </P> <P> Wes Pratt, the lone black on the council and a leader of the King tribute  effort, said that the city still must find a suitable memorial to King and  promised to press for renewed council action.  </P> <P> "San Diego has to come to grips with its ethnic diversity at some point in  time," Pratt said after the commissioners' decision at a special meeting.  </P> <P> But a weary-sounding Mayor Maureen O'Connor said it was too soon to decide  whether to place the issue before the council again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Consensus  </P> <P> "At this point, I'm not prepared to say which way we'd go," O'Connor said in an  interview. "I mean, really, we've tried this every which way and we seem to be  running into a dead end.  </P> <P> "At this point, it appears to be difficult to find a solution that would  satisfy a majority," O'Connor added.  </P> <P> The Rev. George Stevens, who has led an unsuccessful boycott of the Convention  Center since the port commissioners dodged the name change issue in February,  called a public meeting for Thursday night to plot strategy in the King tribute  campaign.  </P> <P> Pratt, however, said that a boycott clearly would not work. The $160-million  bay-front facility, scheduled to open in November, has already scheduled  conventions through the end of the 1990s. Jim Jacobson, a coordinator of the  Martin Luther King Tribute Coalition, said members of the organization also  will meet to review options. Lacking the money for an initiative campaign, he  called for the council to put the matter on the ballot.  </P> <P> O'Connor virtually ruled out that tactic, saying that a victory in such a  referendum would not be binding on the commissioners.  </P></p>

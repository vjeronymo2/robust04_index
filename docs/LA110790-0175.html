			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW SINKS 44.31 POINTS ON WAR FEARS, OIL PRICE  </P> <P> Stocks fell sharply today, hurt by renewed fears of war in the Middle East that  drove oil prices higher.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 44.31, or 1.8%, to 2,440.84.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 452 up, 1,117 down and 440 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 149.13 million shares, against 141.13 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> Oil prices surged above $35 a barrel today as fears of a war in the Persian  Gulf swept through the market.  </P> <P> Crude oil for December delivery was up a strong $2.77 to $35.40 on the New York  Mercantile Exchange with half an hour left to trade. Refined oil prices were  also sharply higher, with December heating oil up 6.22 cents to 92.60 cents a  gallon.  </P> <P> "There's almost a total consensus we're going into military activity in  November," said Peter Beutel of Pegasus Econometrics. "I think the groundwork  is being laid and the next provocation will be used as a premise for invading."  </P> <P> With the U.S. elections out of the way, many traders view war as increasingly  likely.  </P> <P> "There are intensified rumors the U.S. may go into war really soon now that  elections are over," said Marc Scullion, an analyst with Gerald Commodities  Inc.  </P> <P> This view was intensified by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's warning  that time was running out for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  </P> <P> "The market jumped about 50 cents on Thatcher's statement," one trader said.  </P> <P> Thatcher told Parliament that sanctions against Iraq had been given three  months to work and yet there was no sign Iraq was loosening its grip on Kuwait.  </P> <P> Prices were rising before Thatcher's statement on a rumor, later denied, that  Secretary of State James A. Baker III had passed an ultimatum to Iraq through a  Chinese official.  </P> <P> Oil prices also rose on the market's ability to shrug off a bearish report of a  buildup in crude oil stocks. The American Petroleum Institute reported late  Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks rose 5 million barrels last week to 344.5  million barrels.  </P> <P> Falling bond prices also hurt the stock market. The bond market was nervous  because of the Treasury Department's huge sale of new government debt this  week.  </P> <P> The refunding encompasses a record $34.25 billion in securities with lives  ranging from three years to just under 30 years.  </P> <P> Investor demand for that enormous supply apparently has been bolstered by  expectations of new moves soon by the Federal Reserve toward a relaxation of  its monetary policy.  </P> <P> Talk has spread in the past week or so that the Fed is worrying more about  countering the effects of recession and less about combating inflationary  pressures.  </P> <P> Browning-Ferris Industries fell 2 1/8 to 22 1/8 by midafternoon on top of a  6-point plunge Tuesday, when the company reported a 55% quarterly earnings  decline.  </P> <P> MCA had dropped 1 1/4 to 61 3/4 following a big fire overnight at the company's  Universal Studios. MCA said it believed its loss was fully covered by  insurance.  </P></p>

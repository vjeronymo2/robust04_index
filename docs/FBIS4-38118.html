			<p>BFN     [Text] Sirte, 27 Jun (MENA)-- Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first  Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's  Office for Political Affairs, expressed his belief that a  solution could be reached on the Lockerbie problem between Libya  and the Western countries.    In a statement he made before leaving Sirte with the  delegation accompanying President Husni Mubarak, al-Baz said  that a number of proposals on this issue were discussed during  the meetings held by the Egyptian and Libyan sides. He stressed  that a solution that upholds the two sides' sovereignty can be  reached.    He added that it was agreed to have the higher  Egyptian-Libyan committee chaired by the two countries' prime  ministers meet in Cairo during the first week of August and its  meeting will be preceded by a meeting of the preparatory  committee.</p>

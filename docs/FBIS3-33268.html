			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Nicaraguan Presidency's </F> Information and Press Directorate in Managua on 16 February;  from the "This Morning" newscast -- read by announcer]    [Text] The Information and Press Directorate informs the  public that Vice President Virgilio Godoy's remarks regarding an  alleged Nicaraguan Government contributions to the Costa Rican  electoral campaign are unfounded and false. Presidency Minister  Antonio Lacayo and his wife visited this sister nation in  January because the candidates of the National Liberation and  Social Christian Unity parties invited them to observe the  electoral process.    Mr. Lacayo seized this opportunity to talk with the two  candidates about the good relations that Nicaragua hopes to have  with the new Costa Rican Government that will rule this country  for the next four years. He also spoke to them on behalf of  those Nicaraguans who work or want to work in Costa Rica. He  received from current Government Minister Luis Fishman and from  the two candidates words of support for the Nicaraguan workers  who go there protected within the framework of the agreement  signed by the Labor Ministries of the two countries. The  agreement guarantees such workers the full enjoyment and benefit  of the labor rights in force in Costa Rica.    The current Costa Rican Government believes that those  Nicaraguans who go there unprotected within the framework of the  said agreement are exposing themselves to mistreatment by  unscrupulous people who take advantage of the Nicaraguan  workers' lack of legal documents to avoid paying minimum wages  and other social benefits. This constitutes a crime that Costa  Rican authorities are willing to fight by issuing the pertinent  documents through the mechanism agreed upon by the Labor  Ministries of the two countries.    [Dated] Managua, 16 February 1994    [Signed] Presidency of the Republic, Information and Press  Directorate</p>

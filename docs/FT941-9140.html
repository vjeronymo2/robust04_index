			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Bank seeks control over share settlement system: Crest would be offered to market participants later The Bank of England proposed yesterday that it should own and control the Crest system for UK share settlement for its first few years of operation. Shares in the system, which is estimated to cost Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m, would then be offered to any market participant who used it, subject to certain restrictions. It would be operated by a commercial provider selected by the shareholders. In a discussion document, the Bank appeared to rule out any controlling interest in Crest by the Stock Exchange or any other organisation. However, the exchange, which developed the failed Taurus system for paperless settlements, could bid to become the operator or hold up to a 30 per cent stake in Crest through its marketmaking members. 'Provisions will be needed to prevent undue concentration of power through transfer of shares and voting rights,' the Bank said. 'The wide ownership base is to insure against Crest's pricing policy, operating regime or development plans giving undue advantage to any one commercial interest or to any one community.' Under the proposal, no one company or company group will be allowed to own more than 10 per cent of the shares of Crestco - the system's holding company - and not more than 30 per cent of shares can be held by any sectoral group. Shares will be transferable, subject to the ownership limits. Finance for Crestco will be needed from May and there will have to be arrangements for possibly adding further capital. It may be possible to arrange borrowing facilities, the Bank said. The paper said the Bank preferred to build the central part of the system itself. It would use its existing computer agency staff suppliers with no explicit promise of future work on the system. The Bank added that the Crest project would be able to satisfy the request of institutional fund managers that it should be able to designate share registration in the names of individual clients. Pension funds view designation as critical to the safety of their assets. However, it said there would be difficulties in satisfying the demands of marketmakers to keep their ownership of blocks of shares out of the public domain. Legislation making that possible cannot be achieved in time, although there are administrative measures that will go some way towards satisfying their requests.</p>

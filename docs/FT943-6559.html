			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Probe into agencies at Lloyd's Lloyd's of London is investigating claims that some agencies in the insurance market have been deliberately reducing and disposing of assets in order to avoid potential payments to Names, Tracy Corrigan writes. Many agencies are being sued by Names for negligence. Lloyd's said yesterday that several cases of reported asset-stripping by agencies were under investigation, but added that that no details were being made public. It said: 'If any Names suspected they were subject to such activity and reported it to Lloyd's, we would look into it.' Names are up in arms about the alleged asset-stripping, which they see as under-mining their hopes for compensation.</p>

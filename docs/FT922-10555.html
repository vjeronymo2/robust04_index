			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Higher US incomes fuel rise in spending PERSONAL incomes continued to rise in the US last month, helping to fuel a modest revival in consumer spending. The Department of Commerce said personal income rose in March by 0.6 per cent to an annual rate of Dollars 4,990bn after seasonal adjustments, following February's 1.0 per cent increase. Disposable incomes rose somewhat faster as a result of a reduction in income tax scales ordered by President Bush and applied in March. The department said disposable incomes rose 1.1 per cent, or 0.6 per cent in real terms. Spending on personal consumption rose modestly for the fifth month, gaining 0.3 per cent to an annual rate of Dollars 4,041bn. In real terms, however, personal consumption spending declined by 0.2 per cent. Personal saving increased to an estimated annual rate of Dollars 233bn. Economists said the data announced yesterday by the Commerce Department were consistent with Tuesday's report that GDP grew at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the first quarter. They have been divided, however, over whether the upturn in demand is likely to spill quickly over into the creation of new jobs, so fuelling a stronger recovery.</p>

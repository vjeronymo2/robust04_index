			<p>BFN     [Text] Luanda, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The United States holds  that Luanda's agreement to accommodate the rebel National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in a future cabinet  is "an encouraging initiative."    Speaking to the local press here today, U.S. Ambassador to  Angola Joseph Schreiber said the United States, Russia and  Portugal -- three observer countries of the Angolan peace  process -- believe the initiative benefits the ongoing peace  talks in Lusaka, capital of Zambia.    Luanda has reportedly agreed to give unita the four  portfolios of mineral, health, trade and travel, seven  deputy-minister posts of finance, agriculture, interior,  defense, social rehabilitation, communication and public works,  as well as governors of Kuando-Kubango, Uige and Lunda-Sul  Provinces, deputy governors of several other provinces.    The United States firmly supports U.N. Special Envoy to  Angola Blondin Beye in his efforts to bring lasting peace and  reconciliation to the Angolan people, the ambassador said.    Beye had proposed the government accommodate the UNITA in a  future cabinet.    He said the United States will shoulder 30 percent of U.N.  expenses for peacekeeping missions in the southern African  country.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> BARRACUDA, BONITO AND BASS SHOULD MAKE MEMORABLE CATCH  </P> <P> Anglers planning to go out over the three-day Memorial Day weekend should  prepare for a fish fry.  </P> <P> Name any fish you would like to catch and chances are it can be hooked,  especially the three Bs: barracuda, bonito and bass.  </P> <P> The hottest run continues to be barracuda with the biggest concentration  outside Rocky Point.  </P> <P> Yellowtail and white sea bass have broken wide open at Catalina Island.  </P> <P> The Topgun, sailing from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing with a tank of live squid,  found the hot spot early this week at Catalina.  </P> <P> Anglers used light tackle and the white sea bass, all quality fish, weighed 18  to 35 pounds.  </P> <P> Chuck Brandberry of Long Beach caught the whopper of the week with his  35-pounder. Mark Gotto of West Los Angeles landed a 28-pounder as did Dave Van  Hotten of Long Beach.  </P> <P> With the one-fish limit on white sea bass filled, the Topgun had to leave the  bite early. Capt. Bob Taft moved up the island to where the yellowtail have  been tearing up tackle.  </P> <P> It was the right move as 27 yellows went into the bulging sacks of sea bass.  </P> <P> The King Harbor Marlin Club and Redondo Yacht Club's third annual Sadie Hawkins  fishing tournament was a success as 28 women participated from eight boats.  </P> <P> The top three catches went to Torrance women. The overall winner for the  largest fish was Barbara Haynes with her 20-pound, 11-ounce thresher shark.  Clinda Woodward placed second with a 9-pound, 13-ounce halibut. Dorrie Hensley  finished third with a 6-pound sand bass.  </P> <P> Returning Monday from fishing in the Marlin Gold Tournament in Hawaii, Alex  Gonzales of Wilmington and John Stembridge of Long Beach reported landing big  catches but failed to win prizes.  </P> <P> Gonzales did battle for one hour to land a 559 1/2-pound blue marlin.  Stembridge landed an 800-pound bronze shark in two hours with 80-pound test  line.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Mark Larson of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Topgun at Catalina, used 10-pound  test line and brought an 18 1/2-pound yellowtail out of the kelp.  </P> <P> Leo Sutton of Gardena, on the Hitless Miss at Rocky Point, caught a 17-pound  white sea bass.  </P> <P> Lloyd Auburn of West Los Angeles was at Catalina aboard the Pacifica and caught  a stray salmon that weighed 16 pounds.  </P> <P> John Ozaeth of San Pedro, on the Outerlimits at San Clemente, won the jackpot  with a 15-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Fish Reports:  </P> <P> Barracuda fishing is steady. The best area is from Marineland to Rocky Point.  </P> <P> Catalina yellowtail and sea bass are biting on squid. The exotics' preference  is squid. Bonito and calico bass catches remain steady with anchovies as choice  bait.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Happyman on a half-day trip to the bay  returned with 44 sculpin, 14 sand bass and nine halibut.  </P> <P> The Del Mar, fishing at Sunset Beach, had a variety catch of 160 sculpin, 12  sand bass, nine barracuda and six calico bass.  </P> <P> The Spitfire landed 150 sculpin, 78 sand bass and 22 calico bass.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray's anglers caught 47 sand bass, 26  barracuda, nine calico bass and one halibut at Rocky Point.  </P> <P> Anglers on the Redondo Special half-day trip connected for 130 sand bass and 14  barracuda.  </P> <P> The Blackjack returned from Catalina with 180 bonito, 55 calico bass and 110  blue perch.  </P> <P> The barge Isle of Redondo had a wide-open mackerel bite with 780 sacked, plus  57 rockfish.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String worked the oil rigs and chalked up 351  barracuda and 15 sculpin.  </P> <P> The Monte Carlo fished at Marineland and 183 barracuda went into the sacks.  </P> <P> At L.A.

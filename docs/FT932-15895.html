			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Tough conditions in Europe hit Brammer BRAMMER, the ball bearing distributor and electrical services group, blamed depressed business conditions throughout Europe for a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. Profits declined from Pounds 9.16m to Pounds 8.23m on increased sales of Pounds 122.6m (Pounds 111.5m). Mr Robert Ffoulkes - Jones, chief executive, said: 'While economic activity has got slightly better in the UK the recession is deepening in continental Europe.' The group is predicting another tough year. Mr Ffoulkes - Jones warned against expectations of a significant UK recovery. 'We have seen false dawns before,' he said. Approximately 80 per cent of revenue is generated in the UK. The group is planning to expand on the Continent. The BSL distribution division reported a small fall in profits before exceptional items from Pounds 7.95m to Pounds 7.88m. However, the rental business suffered another big fall from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 832,000. Redundancy costs were responsible for an exceptional charge of Pounds 452,000 (Pounds 382,000). Last year's acquisition of Roulement Service accounted for sales of Pounds 7.1m and an operating profit of Pounds 233,000. Earnings per share fell to 13.4p (14.7p). An unchanged final dividend of 8.5p makes a maintained total of 13p. COMMENT After its fourth consecutive year of declining profits Brammer has to convince the market that it has a strategy for growth. The omens do not look good. The rental business has been reporting a fall in profits ever since it was acquired in 1985. A large part of that is due to the loss in defence work. BSL continues to perform well, if not spectacularly. The decision to acquire the French Roulement Service fits nicely into the group's strategy of becoming a pan-European distributor of industrial products. But given the worsening recession in continental Europe the timing is open to question. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m, giving earnings of 15p, the shares are on on a prospective multiple of 17.5. It is difficult to see how the premium to the market can be justified.</p>

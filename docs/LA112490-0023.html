			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPARING CIGARETTES AND OTHER DRUGS  </P> <P> This is in response to the individuals your paper interviewed during the  smokeout. I became an ex-smoker as of March 27.  </P> <P> Prior to that date, I smoked up to three packs a day for 17 years.  </P> <P> The last months of my smoking cigarettes were the worst time of my life. I  literally lived to smoke. Day after day, I would get up out of bed and light  one up, sometimes as many as two or three in a row. When I would get ready for  work, or even while driving to the job, I would smoke up to half a pack. When I  got to the office, the first thing I would do is light up again. During my  breaks and lunches, I would smoke an entire pack. The cravings were as insane  as my desire to buy up to four cartons of cigarettes a week.  </P> <P> Then, in the last two weeks of this past March, I felt a slight pain on my  lower right side of my chest. I knew that this could only be the beginning of a  respiratory ailment like emphysema, lung cancer or some other disease. I was  later told that I was suffering from loss of circulation.  </P> <P> I made a decision that day; I prayed to God and asked him for help. I haven't  had a smoke nor a desire for one since that day passed. Don't get me wrong; I  suffered withdrawal for almost two months. But I accepted my pains knowing that  in the long run I would live longer and healthier.  </P> <P> MANUEL J. RODRIGUEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

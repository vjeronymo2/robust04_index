			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DECLINE IN QUARTERLY EARNINGS CAUSES COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO CANCEL DIVIDEND  </P> <P> Directors of Comprehensive Care Corp. said Wednesday that they will not pay a  quarterly shareholder dividend in light of a 55% decline in the firm's  third-quarter earnings.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based operator of alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs reported  net earnings of $860,000 for the third quarter ended Feb. 28, compared to $1.9  million in the year-earlier period. The company said the earnings included a  gain of about $500,000 from the sale of the company's CareUnit of DuPage, Ill.,  a treatment center facility.  </P> <P> The company has issued quarterly dividends since 1976. In recent quarters, the  company has issued a 10-cent quarterly dividend for each of its shares, worth  about $1.1 million for all 10.1 million of the firm's shares outstanding.  </P> <P> Company officials, who could not be reached for comment, said in a prepared  statement that "restrictions in loan agreements" were another reason directors  decided against paying a dividend.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Cash on Hand  </P> <P> One industry analyst said Comprehensive Care also might have decided against a  dividend so that more cash would be available within the company to help a  prospective buyer finance an acquisition of the firm.  </P> <P> Last month, Comprehensive Care said it had appointed a special committee of  directors to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a possible financial  restructuring, asset sale or acquisition by another firm.  </P> <P> Comprehensive Care's third-quarter earnings were way down despite a 4% increase  in revenue. The firm posted revenue of $54.5 million, compared to $52.4 million  last year.  </P> <P> The company said pretax operating earnings for the quarter declined about $2.3  million compared to the year-earlier period. Much of the decline was attributed  to higher costs and less than expected occupancy at its facilities in December.  </P> <P> For the first 9 months of fiscal 1989, Comprehensive Care's net earnings  declined by 15% to $5.6 million, compared to $6.6 million in the year-earlier  period. Revenues for the period were up 12% to $171.9 million, compared to  $152.6 million.  </P> <P> A decline in patient count in March will reduce fourth-quarter expectations,  the company said. Patient count had improved in January and February.  </P> <P> The company's stock lost $1.375 per share Wednesday, closing at $9.75, in  unusually heavy trading of 254,600 shares on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

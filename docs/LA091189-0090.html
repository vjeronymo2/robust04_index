			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NETWORKS' NEW SEASON;  </P> <P> RETURNING SERIES HOPE BABIES WILL DELIVER THE RATINGS  </P> <P> Since the memorable night in 1953 when Lucille Ball delivered Little Ricky and  big ratings, networks have come to rely on births as a means of boosting their  prime-time fortunes.  </P> <P> With a new television season officially getting under way next Monday, a  handful of returning series are laboring to provide viewers with blessed events  as part of their new looks for 1989-90.  </P> <P> Five of the 58 established series on NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox will feature  episodes in which prominent characters give birth. Two other old favorites also  will boast new young faces.  </P> <P> That may not amount to a bona-fide baby boom, but you get the idea. Infants are  in this season.  </P> <P> Top-rated NBC emerges as the most fertile network.  </P> <P> In November, a sweeps month when viewership is especially critical to the  networks, Ann and Stuart Markowitz (Jill Eikenberry, Michael Tucker) are likely  to welcome their first child on "L.A. Law," while psychiatrists Frasier and  Lilith (Kelsey Grammer, Bebe Neuwirth) of "Cheers" are expecting a new arrival  as well.  </P> <P> On the Sept. 18 season premiere of "ALF," the unreliable alien's first  adventure in baby-sitting predictably goes awry when he loses the Tanners' son  Eric (who was born at the end of last season). And "The Cosby Show" has a  3-year-old scene stealer joining the Huxtable household Sept. 21.  </P> <P> At ABC, English professor Gary (Peter Horton) and girlfriend Susannah (Patricia  Kalember) will become parents during the fourth or fifth episode of  "thirtysomething."  </P> <P> On CBS, pregnant Charleyne (Jean Smart) and TV husband Doug Barr of "Designing  Women" prepare for the birth of their first child, with a due date in the  middle of the season.  </P> <P> Finally, there are "Newhart" yuppies Michael and Stephanie (Peter Scolari,  Julia Duffy). Wed at the end of last season, they may see their bundle of joy  in January. As the comedy opens its eighth season Sept. 18, the couple will be  returning from a six-month honeymoon.  </P> <P> Speaking of marriages, the Rev. Gregory and Thelma (Clifton Davis, Anna Maria  Horsford) at long last will announce their engagement on the season premiere of  "Amen," with a two-part wedding episode to follow during the November sweeps.  </P> <P> Striking a more somber note, the season debut of "The Golden Girls" on Sept. 23  will center on chronic fatigue syndrome. In a seriocomic two-part story written  by the show's creator, Susan Harris, Dorothy (Bea Arthur) has a consultation  with doctors who cannot find any cause for her pain and exhaustion.  </P> <P> In a subsequent episode, Rose (Betty White) finds a new job as the assistant to  a local TV consumer reporter (Chick Vennera).  </P> <P> A new job, editor and home await Hannah Miller (Jamie Lee Curtis) of "Anything  But Love," an ABC comedy that has the dubious distinction of undergoing the  most extensive overhaul among all returning series.  </P> <P> Promoted from researcher to full-time writer, Hannah and fellow scribe Marty  Gold (Richard Lewis) will report to an aggressive, energetic new boss (Ann  Magnuson) in charge of their Chicago magazine, now a weekly instead of a  monthly. Also joining the cast are Joseph Maher as a stuffy TV critic, Richard  Frank as an executive assistant obsessed with demographics and Holly Fulger as  a childhood friend who rents a room to Hannah.  </P> <P> On Sundays, meanwhile, Angela Lansbury will continue to solve whodunits on  "Murder, She Wrote." She just won't be solving them as often.  </P> <P> In signing Lansbury for the popular mystery show's sixth season, CBS agreed to  lighten her load. Consequently, she will play author Jessica Fletcher in 13  episodes. In nine other shows, she will introduce the story, leaving the  legwork to other characters. Those roles will be portrayed by an assortment of  amateur sleuths such as Ken Howard, June Havoc, Barry Newman and Diana Canova.  </P> <P> Other noteworthy prime-time changes focus on:  </P> <P> New Faces  </P> <P> NBC: When he isn't chasing Lucky the cat, "ALF" will contend with JM. J.  Bullock, the former "Hollywood Square," who will play the brother of Willie  Tanner (Max Wright).  </P> <P> "Cheers": Tony-winning stage actor Roger Rees of "Nicholas Nickleby" fame  portrays billionaire Robin Colcord, a corporate raider who pursues Rebecca  (Kirstie Alley), prompting Sam (Ted Danson) to try to regain ownership of the  bar.  </P> <P> "Matlock": Enter Clarence Gilyard as a deputy sheriff who helps attorney Ben  Matlock (Andy Griffith). Exit Kene Holliday, who had played Matlock's leg man,  Tyler Hudson.  </P> <P> "227": Paul Winfield is the apartment building's new landlord, the pompous  Julian Barlow.  </P> <P> ABC: As "Head of the Class" starts its senior year, students played by Michael  DeLorenzo, Lara Piper and De'Voreaux White replace Tannis Vallely (Janice),  Leslie Bega (Maria) and Jory Hussain (Jawaharlal). Rain Pryor -- Richard's  daughter, who appeared in five episodes last season -- enrolls on a full-time  basis.  </P> <P> "China Beach": Ricki Lake, best known for her role in the John Waters movie  musical "Hairspray," plays a cheerful Red Cross "doughnut dolly," with Ned  Vaughn as a young doctor who befriends Boonie (Brian Wimmer).  </P> <P> CBS: Adam Arkin joins the cul-de-sac dwellers of "Knots Landing," whose third  episode will be the durable serial's 250th. He'll play a "mysterious"  businessman.  </P> <P> "Dallas": TV's longest-running entertainment series adds Kimberly Foster as a  fetching blond who "smells money" as the younger, unwelcome sister of April  Stevens (Sheree J. Wilson); Sasha Mitchell as scheming James Richard Beaumont,  the son of J.R. Ewing's old flame Vanessa Beaumont, and Michael Wilding as an  art gallery owner who takes more than a professional interest in Cally, J.R.'s  nubile young bride.  </P> <P> "Falcon Crest": The network's other melodrama signs up Gregory Harrison as a  wheeler-dealer and adversary to Richard Channing (David Selby); Mark Lindsay  Chapman as a "charming" psychopath, and Andrea Thompson as Frank Agretti's (Rod  Taylor) sexy stepdaughter.  </P> <P> "Tour of Duty": Carl Weathers ("Rocky's" Apollo Creed) is set for six episodes  as a maverick colonel who takes charge of the unit; John Dye comes aboard as a  medic and conscientious objector to the war in Vietnam. (Kim Delaney, who  played reporter Alex Devlin, meets a "tragic" end during the second episode.)  </P> <P> "60 Minutes": Former "West 57th" reporters Meredith Vieira and Steve Kroft join  the veteran staff of prime-time TV's longest-running series, which on Sunday  begins its 22nd year.  </P> <P> New Directions  </P> <P> NBC: Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) is back, and "The Cosby Show" has her, in  addition to her new husband (Joseph C. Phillips) and his 3-year-old daughter  (Raven Symone). While the newlyweds settle in, Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner)  decides to move out. He'll take an apartment with his New York University pals.  </P> <P> "A Different World": Coach Walter Oakes (Sinbad) takes over the Hillman College  dorm, which has gone co-ed, replacing Mary Alice.  </P> <P> "L.A. Law": Buttoned-down attorney Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin) loosens up this  season. He finds a new love interest, gets involved in a major murder case and  takes to the streets on a motorcycle, clad in jacket and jeans.  </P> <P> "The Magical World of Disney": Two fresh series join Disney's wheel of rotating  elements: "Brand New Life," a "Brady Bunch"-type sitcom with Barbara Eden and  Don Murray as the parents of six children, and "Parent Trap," a Hayley  Mills-Barry Bostwick comedy based on the 1961 film.  </P> <P> "My Two Dads": Judge Wilbur (Florence Stanley) turns departed Dick Butkus' old  diner into a chic French restaurant.  </P> <P> ABC: It's the fall of 1969 on "The Wonder Years" as Kevin (Fred Savage) and  Winnie (Danica McKellar) edge toward adolescence, the '70s and the eighth  grade. The sparks will still fly between them as always, but a more mature  Kevin will find time for other girls as well.  </P> <P> "thirtysomething": Something called divorce still hangs over the heads of Eliot  (Timothy Busfield) and Nancy (Patricia Wettig) who, as fans recall, never  signed the requisite papers. That issue will be addressed in the first episode  Sept. 19.  </P> <P> "Growing Pains": Mike Seaver (Kirk Cameron), who proposed to his girlfriend  Julie (Julie McCullough) on last season's final episode, gets his answer on the  season premiere Sept. 20.  </P> <P> "ABC Saturday Mystery": The rotational series gets two new entries featuring  familiar stars (and lollipops). Ex-angel Jaclyn Smith wings her way back to  prime time as "Christine Cromwell," a San Francisco-based attorney and  financial adviser, and Telly Savalas is back on the N.Y.P.D. payroll as  "Kojak."  </P> <P> CBS: Back for a second season, "Murphy Brown" still will be plugged into  topical TV stories. One finds Murphy (Candice Bergen) writing a caustic memo  criticizing her colleagues a la Bryant Gumbel of the "Today" show. In another,  advertisers threaten to yank their commercials from a controversial episode of  "FYI."  </P> <P> "Knots Landing": The character to catch here is put-upon Olivia (Tonya Crowe),  the daughter of "scheme queen" Abby (Donna Mills, who has left the show). It's  hinted that Olivia may assume some of her mom's more conniving qualities.  </P> <P> "Falcon Crest": A new production team hopes to reclaim a sizable audience for  this sagging CBS series embarking on season No. 9. To that end, the show's  writers will focus on younger characters such as Lance and Pilar (Lorenzo  Lamas, Kristian Alfonso). Jane Wyman will appear in the first two episodes as  matriarch Angela Channing, then will resurface at midseason. Richard Channing  (David Selby) deals with single parenthood in the absence of wife Maggie (Susan  Sullivan), who's left Tuscany Valley.  </P> <P> "Saturday Night With Connie Chung": That's the new title for a revamped "West  57th." The producers reportedly are considering a one-story format that would  include actors in the re-creations of events.  </P> <P> And waiting in the network's wings -- to the vexation of its loyal fans -- is  "Beauty and the Beast." The romantic fantasy's two-hour opener will air when an  appropriate time period becomes available. Once "Beast" begins, its beauty  (pregnant Linda Hamilton) will have a "reduced presence," says CBS  Entertainment President Kim LeMasters.  </P></p>

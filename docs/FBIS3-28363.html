			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] France has reportedly provided the Vietnamese  communist puppets' troops and the two-headed government with 30  military trucks and a quantity of war materiel. National and  international opinion maintains that the military aid given by  France in this current situation means that the country  continues openly to inflame the Vietnamese communist aggressors'  war. The Cambodian nation and people vehemently oppose and  resolutely condemn the French Government for its conspiracy with  the Vietnamese communist aggressors, the Vietnamese communist  puppets, and the unscrupulous alliance to further do away with  the Cambodian nation, people, and race.</p>

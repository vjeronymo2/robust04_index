			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Russians quick to learn shadier side of capitalism: Corruption is rife, and the newly independent states lack laws to tackle it ON THE DAY Russia's privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, announced he had sacked his deputy for sanctioning the embezzlement of state property, his two small sons were involved in a car crash. In western Europe, this would have been a coincidence. In Russia, probably not. In a tranquil office overlooking the Kremlin and the Bolshoi ballet, Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the Russian government's new anti-corruption team, keeps a pistol in his drawer. He is convinced the accident was organised to frighten Mr Chubais off his campaign for a clean privatisation process. 'It would cost only Rbs10,000 to hire an assassin to get rid of me,' he says with a grin. Having exposed several crooked deals during his previous career as a journalist, Mr Gurtovoi says his mission is to save his country from 'choking on corruption'. He reports directly to Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister for economic reform, who has made fighting corruption a key priority lest it stifle his bold efforts to switch to a market economy. As any foreign or Russian businessman will confirm, bribe-taking and embezzlement are flourishing as never before. Mr Gurtovoi's 10-man team includes former KGB officers and elite investigating magistrates such as Mr Vladimir Kalinichenko, who made his name uncovering high-level scandals during the communist era. Rather than catch all the corrupt officials in Russia, the role of this elite group is to pinpoint specific malpractices and advise the government on how to legislate and enforce the law. An attempt, uncovered last week, by defence plant managers and former Communist party officials to transfer valuable state assets into a closed joint stock company called KOLO which they owned is just one manifestation of the corruption permeating society, says Mr Gurtovoi. The KOLO deal itself is unlikely to have broken any written laws - the country may have had communist laws against economic sabotage, but to date has no laws against corruption or tax evasion. Although the team will now investigate this deal to shed light on so-called 'nomenklatura' privatisation, whereby officials acquire state assets at well below their value, it claims to have already stopped a major currency swindle involving Rbs300bn and the worldwide narcotics business. Mr Gurtovoi and his colleagues say many of the schemes are destined either to discredit the government or to manipulate exchange rates to keep the rouble weak. This particular swindle, foiled two months ago, apparently went as follows. A group of crooked commercial banks, joint ventures, and former party and KGB officials, approached Russian enterprises and collected Rbs200bn with a promise to reinvest it at favourable rates. To this apparently honest pile of money, they added Rbs100bn in need of laundering because it had been misappropriated by the Communist party or the KGB or simply stolen. The Rbs100bn was set aside to pick up property on the cheap as privatisation gathered pace. This would have been bought on behalf of foreign partners and Russian comrades and would have included the purchase of hotels, factories and narcotic-processing facilities in the former Soviet Union. The spin-off for the Russians was not only the chance to launder illegal funds, but also to obtain access to hard currency abroad. This came in the form of Dollars 1.5bn deposited in accounts for the Russians by their foreign partners, who in turn benefited from a particularly favourable exchange rate to pick up bargains in the former Soviet Union. Help in tracking down similar deals is only one reason Mr Gaidar has hired New York-based Kroll Associates - the corporate investigations firm which took on the hunt for funds sent abroad by the likes of Duvalier and Saddam Hussein. Its other tasks will include tracking down Communist party money, and millions of dollars sent abroad by state enterprises to avoid tax. President Boris Yeltsin will pay a state visit to the US on June 16-17 to review 'the ever-strengthening relationships between the two countries,' President George Bush said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.</p>

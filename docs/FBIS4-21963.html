			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Alberto Fujimori announced today he has  a third letter from Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, and that  he will reveal the letter at the appropriate time. Fujimori  also denied that a letter published in a local magazine is real.  [begin recording]    Fujimori: [Words indistinct] second, I am keeping  the third letter under lock, in a safe, and no one else knows  the combination. I therefore don't see how the letter could  have left my safe. Then [words indistinct] the magazine  published a letter which is not the third letter. I deny it.  [passage omitted]</p>

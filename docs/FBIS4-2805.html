			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Weihai, a port city in  east China's Shandong Province and China's nearest city to the  Republic of Korea (ROK), will have regular trade fair or  discussions with the ROK.    This has been been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and economic cooperation recently.    So far this is the only officially ratified annual  discussion  of its kind in China.    In July last year, Weihai succeeded in holding the '93  Sino-ROK economic and trade discussion. The first of subsequent  discussions this year has been scheduled for in September.    The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and  the local government have pinned high hopes on this year's  discussion, as 2,000 foreign businessmen, including 1,000 from  the ROK, will be invited to the fair. The others will be from  Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Europe and the  United States.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (12): Ease of use becomes a compelling issue - Training / Microsoft Project THE COMPUTER training company, Oxford Computer Training might be expected to be biased about Microsoft's project management system, Project. It describes itself as 'Microsoft's favourite trainer,' having won a training award from the software supplier, writes Claire Gooding. OCT has already trained hundreds of people to use Project, which has created something of a market niche for OCT. From exploring the product to teach it to others, Oxford Computer Training discovered how closely it fitted its own needs, and is now using it both for scheduling courses and for planning the development of courseware. The company, a division of the Oxford Computer Group with a Pounds 1.5m turnover, employs 30 full-time trainers and specialises in Microsoft products, particularly under Windows. It has used Project in conjunction with other Microsoft products such as Excel, Word, Mail, PowerPoint, Visual Basic, Access and SuperBase. To date, it has invested in Project to the tune of Pounds 2,500, and now half a dozen trainers and managers use it on a regular basis. Before discovering Project, the company had been a long-term user of The OpenPlan package from Welcome Software Technology, for which it also runs training courses. (OpenPlan was mentioned by several interviewees in the Software At Work survey. It is about to be re-launched in a Windows version from WST, based in Southbank Technopark, Elephant and Castle, south London.) But OpenPlan was really on too grand a scale for a small company, and other PC-based options proved either light on functions, or not as user-friendly as Project. 'Project has proved ideal for a small company environment, and extremely powerful,' says James Cowling, development manager. Oxford Computer Training's teachers write their own courses, and Project is used in conjunction with a database to schedule staff resources between lecturing and courseware development. Producing the courseware is itself a software development project, and Project is u sed to plan and allocate resources. 'For us, ease-of-use was a compelling issue, but for historical reasons it was extremely important that it was part of the Microsoft family,' says James Cowling. He believes that his company, being experts in testing software to the limits, has taken Project as far as it can go in terms of customising it and 'tweaking' it to in-house use. ***** SOFTWARE DETAILS Microsoft Project The product, Microsoft Project version 3.0 was launched in January 1992, a Windows-based graphical project management package, powerful and easy to use.

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives markets remained preoccupied yesterday with expiry of the December futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, writes Terry Byland. Investors, including both institutions and local traders, continued to roll contracts over from the December position to the March contract, which will take over leadership at mid-morning on Friday. However, in spite of high volumes in both contracts yesterday, dealers warned that many positions still have to be rolled over before the December expiry. For much of the session, December showed a premium of 6 to 10 points over cash - fair value is now zero. This provided good encouragement for underlying equities which was also reflected in a spread of around 21 points, or 7 on fair value, between the December and March contracts. However, the picture darkened abruptly towards the close on reports, later questioned, of threatening comments from the leader of Russia's Liberal Democrats. The premium on December quickly vanished, replaced briefly by a two-point discount. The discount was recovered before the official close and selling pressure abated in later trading. Volume in the December future was nearly 19,000 lots and in March about 8,000. In an active traded options sector, turnover jumped to 35,490 contracts from Monday's 25,608. The Footsie option increased its share sharply, recording 15,626 lots against 9,486. Among the individual options, the Euro FT-SE headed the list with 3,619 lots. Market nervousness towards BTR stock brought 1,613 trades in the option.</p>

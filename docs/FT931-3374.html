			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): Hammer horror story - The man behind the Occidental myth THE DARK SIDE OF POWER: THE REAL ARMAND HAMMER by Carl Blumay with Henry Edwards Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 20, 494 pages 'THE ONLY way to build the future is to build it on lies' was the maxim of Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum, who died in 1990 at the age of 92. According to Carl Blumay's chronicle, Hammer rarely departed from that principle. Blumay should know. Now in his 70s, he was in charge of public relations for Armand Hammer and Occidental for 25 years. He devoted every minute - and his marriage - to constructing the public image that Hammer was a business genius, a philanthropist and humanitarian, with influence over the Kremlin and the White House. The reality, Blumay says, was a backstage drama of bribes, manipulation, huge financial losses, a gun-toting delinquent son and a collection of high-cheekboned mistresses on both sides of the Iron Curtain. When Blumay took his place in the drama in 1955 he reckoned that the American public 'hungered for a business hero who satisfied the requirements of the Faust legend: a capitalist with the fame and charisma of a movie star and a thirst for power and wealth that made him willing even to sell his soul to achieve his dreams, and that's how I decided to sell him.' Selling Hammer meant putting out to the stock markets a stream of press releases which inflated the value of Oxy's oil reserves. It meant helping the company to stonewall the Securities and Exchange Commission's many years of investigations - Oxy's executives were relieved when the SEC found only a fraction of the 'questionable payments' that it suspected. It meant helping hide for years one of Occidental's most damaging secrets - now seen as one of America's worst pollution disasters - that the company's subsidiary Hooker had contaminated land and water tables across the US with thousands of tonnes of poisonous chemical waste. Not all of Blumay's campaign was successful. The stock market rapidly became hostile to Hammer's authoritarian style. On the day that Hammer slipped in the bathtub and cracked three ribs, Occidental's market value rose by Dollars 306m; when he died it rose by nearly 10 per cent. But the only time when Hammer was touched by real fear of reprisals, according to Blumay, was when accused as part of the Watergate prosecutions of illegal payments to Richard Nixon's US presidential re-election campaign. Overnight he exchanged his compulsive travelling between the Soviet Union, Libya, Venezuela and California for the sanctuary of a cardiac ward. Forced eventually to present himself in court, he appeared in a wheelchair, huddled inside an over-large suit, wired up to heart monitoring equipment and surrounded by lawyers who threatened the judge with lawsuits if he collapsed. Let off with a fine, he threw away the chair and danced a victory jig. As he said to Blumay, his body was just another corporation - and he was in control. Although Hammer professed that 'money is my first, last and only love', like many tycoons he was remarkably good at losing it. Blumay catalogues how money was frittered away on attempts at deals with the Soviets that never stood a chance of being successful. 'He worships the Soviet leaders because they have the kind of power he craves', Blumay told Hammer's pet biographer. That unprofitable courtship is just one of the many uncanny echoes of Robert Maxwell's life, despite Hammer's proclamation that 'there has never been anyone like me - and my like will never be seen again'. Like Maxwell, he denied for years that he was Jewish but changed his mind shortly before his death, despite his persistent refusal to put pressure on the Soviets to allow Jews to leave. He left it late, though: the bar mitzvah he had planned had to be rapidly altered to a memorial dinner. People were drawn to work for him, as they were for Maxwell, not just by the money but by the mischievousness of entering a world which ignored normal rules. One executive is reported to have been 'amused by the idea of bugging a call from the President'. According to Blumay, the sacrifices were heavy: one executive was sent to jail, and Hammer's Russian mistress may have been murdered because of the connection. But Blumay is weak on the motives of Hammer's followers beyond describing them as 'moths to a flame'. More important, he says little of his own reasons for helping Hammer mislead the outside world for so long and then for writing this book. He pleads at the start: 'If his were errors of commission, mine were errors of omission'. The question is whether his account can now be believed. The sources throughout the book are few and hard to corroborate: largely Blumay, Hammer himself - referred to familiarly as 'Armand' - and Hammer's brother Victor, now dead. The book's reproduction of entire paragraphs of Hammer's speech over three decades is implausible, and many of the allegations of bribes are unsubstantiated. Nor is Blumay informative on where the money came from to build the empire, despite a smattering of references to stock issues and bank loans. The suspicion is that he never knew the financial details. In spite of insisting that he was 'forced to question the credibility of everything (Hammer) told me', Blumay shows little sign that he did so. He can be astonishingly incurious: one journalist's tip that Hammer had mafia connections is brushed off in the phrase 'no matter what Armand had been up to in 1934'. The book is most convincing not on the details of chicanery, but on recreating the distortions of Hammer's paranoia and arrogance. The SEC, Colonel Gaddafi and Venezuela's President Perez are first magnified as enemies bent solely on Hammer's destruction, and then swatted away as insignificant gadflies. This account, which is exhaustingly chronological, is in the end gripping mainly because of the sense that eventually the truth will out. But that happened just weeks after Hammer's death, long before this book's publication, when financial reality forced Occidental to sell about Dollars 3bn of assets and write off Dollars 2bn against profits. Blumay, who eventually resigned, clearly belongs to the class of 'disgruntled former employees' whose comments Hammer instructed the world to ignore. Blumay says that in his experience these executives normally told the truth. In his case, while the product of his pique is entertaining, it still leaves room for a definitive book telling the whole truth about Armand Hammer.</p>

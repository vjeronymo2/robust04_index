			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / House backs Russian aid THE US House of Representatives has followed the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in backing substantial aid to Russia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. Despite increased public opposition this year to foreign aid, the House followed the Senate late on Thursday in approving by 255 votes to 164 some Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 620m) in bilateral aid and an increase of Dollars 12bn in the US commitment to the IMF. Opponents of the bill, which now goes to a House-Senate conference, insisted that the administration had a greater duty to provide funds to alleviate US problems, in particular unemployment and inner city deprivation. The vote came shortly after a statement of support for Russian economic reform efforts from Mr Michael Camdessus, the IMF managing director. Mr Camdessus said the approval of a Dollars 1bn first-tranche credit on Wednesday was the first step in what should be a full IMF standby agreement with Moscow. The World Bank on Thursday approved a Dollars 600m loan to purchase imports. It will get directly involved in Moscow's fledgling foreign exchange market by distributing some Dollars 250m of its loan via the Russian central bank, the Bank said in Moscow yesterday. Mr Ardy Stoutjesdijk, director of the World Bank's Moscow operations, said he expected the central bank to sell an extra Dollars 25m a week on the inter-bank currency exchange, where commercial banks buy and sell currency for enterprises and other clients. The World Bank will disburse the money to the central bank in return for documents showing that currency has been sold for the purpose of importing goods other than tobacco, jewellery and alcohol. The remaining Dollars 350m of the World Bank loan is intended to finance crucial imports of medicines, agricultural supplies, and spare parts for public transport systems and St Petersburg's port, which handles most humanitarian aid.</p>

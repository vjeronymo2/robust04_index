			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> The situation: A U.S. air base has just been battered by enemy rockets and its  runways are now pockmarked and littered with wreckage. But the runways must be  cleared before American jets can take off to launch retaliatory strikes.  </P> <P> The problem: How do you quickly repair the runway damage without putting  servicemen's lives in danger from another enemy attack?  </P> <P> The solution: Send in the robots.  </P> <P> To test the feasibility of such a situation, the Air Force has granted a  contract to Odetics, an Anaheim technology company, to study how robots could  be used to do the job. The firm is developing a system, dubbed Rapid Runway  Repair, in which remotely controlled robotic vehicles would be used to clear a  runway within two hours after an attack, Odetics officials said.  </P> <P> The Air Force believes robots may offer several advantages over using humans  for the same tasks. Those benefits include "a reduction in manpower for repair  operations, savings of vehicles and facilities maintained for runway repair and  the removal of personnel from the hazards of working in a post-attack  environment."  </P> <P> Odetics said it expects to complete the study early in 1990. The company did  not provide a specific dollar value for the Air Force contract. Compiled by  David Olmos, Times staff writer  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Various news media throughout the world are closely  following the development of the The Nation and Emigre Community  Conference. One of these media is the NBC television network,  which released the following report:    [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] In an interview  with the NBC network yesterday afternoon, [Politburo member]  Abel Prieto referred to the conference:    [Prieto, in progress] ...and I do not think any emigre has  come with that intention. I think they have come with great  respect, and this morning they were listening and discussing the  Cuban political system; in the afternoon we discussed culture. I  believe there are many paths and bridges that can be opened  through cultural activities.    [Reporter] Prieto also explained the administrative  reorganization that is being carried out on the island.    [Prieto] For a long time now we have been making  adjustments.  We are working on some reforms to streamline the country's  finances.    [Reporter] Some people abroad are asking when democratic  elections will be held in the country, but according to Prieto,  this main discussion should focus more on the definition of  democracy.    [Prieto] According to our Constitution, the president is  elected indirectly. He is elected by the parliament, the members  of which are directly elected by the people. I think we must  review the ideas on democracy that have been so often repeated  concerning Cuba. I think the people who have freedom of thought  must study the Cuban experience. It is an interesting  experience, and I think we should go a little more deeply into  it. The problem is that there are many stereotypes on this  matter and democracy is taken as synonymous with a specific  model, which we need to review to see just how democratic it  really is. I think democracy is a dream that is still far  removed from men. This is my personal opinion on this matter.    [Reporter] Prieto also referred to the U.S. blockade against  Cuba meant to force Fidel Castro's departure from the  presidency. Referring to this situation, Prieto used a baseball  analogy.    [Prieto] The pitcher is removed only when the team decides  he  is no longer suitable. In this case there was a Cuban poet, who  has unfortunately already passed away, but when we were asked  from abroad to replace Fidel, this poet used to say that this is  the first time that the opposite team has asked us to remove our  pitcher.    [Reporter] According to Prieto, the embargo against Cuba  violates the human rights of millions of Cubans. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Grant-maintained status seen to improve standards  -Department of Education The spending programme of the Department for Education and the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) in 1994-95 will total Pounds 10,487m, Mr John Patten, education secretary, said in a parliamentary reply, Pounds 670m or 6.8 per cent higher than equivalent expenditure in 1993-94. The total in 1995-96 is planned to be Pounds 11,059m and in 1996-97 Pounds 11,392m. Within these totals the government has given priority to improving standards in schools through the self-governing (grant-maintained) schools programme. The planned growth in further education student numbers announced last year, to take the 16-19-year-old participation rate to record levels, will be sustained. On self-governing schools, he said that over 1,000 schools have voted 'yes' to self-governing status in ballots. The government's expenditure plans provide for continuing growth in the sector in line with the forecast in the White Paper 'Choice and Diversity' that by 1996, most maintained secondary schools, as well as a significant proportion of maintained primary schools, would be self-governing. Central government would increase its recurrent and capital grants substantially over the next three years as their numbers grow. Central government expenditure on self-governing schools is planned to total Pounds 157m in 1993-94 and Pounds 244m, Pounds 446m and Pounds 595m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. The plans also allow for the Funding Agency for Schools, which will be established from l April 1994. Total central government provision for capital expenditure on self-governing, voluntary-aided and LEA-maintained schools is Pounds 600m, Pounds 606m and Pounds 643m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Further details of Annual Capital Guidelines and allocations to voluntary-aided and self-governing schools will be announced later. Total recurrent spending on further education is planned to rise from Pounds 2,549m in 1993-94 to Pounds 2,679m, Pounds 2,872m and Pounds 2,920m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Mr Patten said the government was on target to increase the number of students in further education by 25 per cent between 1992-93 and 1995-96, taking the UK to the top of the international league for participation in education among 16 to 19 year-olds. He said the government must look to the sector for some increase in efficiency. The plans announced allow for the forecast increase in student numbers up to 1995-96 to be met in full, with an additional increase of 3 per cent between 1995-96 and 1996-97 to maintain the 16-18 year-old participation rate. Capital expenditure is planned to be Pounds 157m, Pounds 159m and Pounds 159m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Mr Patten said this would enable the Further Education Funding Council to continue to improve the state of accommodation and the stock of equipment. The number of students in higher education has grown even faster than expected in the Government's spending plans last year, he said. The proportion of young people entering higher education is now around 30 per cent - close to the target of one in three for the year 2000. In order to allow for the rising number of entrants enrolled in recent years, the expenditure plans provide for total full-time equivalent student numbers in higher education in England to rise by 90,000 or 10 per cent between 1993-94 and 1996-97. Mr Patten said the rapid growth in student numbers had imposed a large extra burden on the taxpayer and the government believed a fairer distribution of this burden was needed between the taxpayer and those who benefit from higher education. It had therefore carried out a review of the funding of higher education. The expenditure plans announced would reflect the outcome of that review. On tuition fees Mr Patten said the government would continue to reimburse the fees charged to students up to the maxima specified through the mandatory awards system. In order to stay within the expenditure plans, it is essential that student numbers are now maintained at the planned level, he said. To that end, the maximum tuition fees reimbursed through the mandatory awards system in 1994/95 will be reduced by 45 per cent for each fee band. In addition, he has stressed to the Higher Education Funding Council for England the importance of delivering through its funding methodology for universities and colleges the planned numbers of students. The reduction in tuition fees will have no effect on the planned level of funding per student in higher education. Some Pounds 474m will be transferred in 1994/95 from mandatory awards to Funding Council grant to compensate for the lower yield from tuition fees. He said that if universities and colleges recruit the numbers of students assumed in the government's plans, they will suffer no loss of income as a result of the reduction in fees. Capital grant will be Pounds 322m, Pounds 381m and Pounds 424m in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 respectively. This is a rise in real terms of 20 per cent between 1993-94 and 1996-97. Mr Patten said the increase reflects the need for capital investment to help with the growth of student numbers in recent years and later in the decade. On student support, Mr Patten said that for 1994-95, the government will continue to maintain the real value of the funds offered to students through the main rates of grant and loan and supplementary grants, which together will increase by 4 per cent in cash. Reductions in the main rates of grant of 10 per cent against their 1993-94 levels will be offset by increases in loan entitlements. Similar adjustments will be made over the next two years; on present estimates they will bring the grant and loan into broad balance in 1996-97. This shift from grant to loan represents an acceleration of existing plans. The contribution of parents whose income rises at the same rate as average income will continue to fall in real terms. Loan rates for final year students will increase in proportion to the full year rates of loan. As now, students will not have to begin to repay their loans until they leave their courses and their incomes are higher than 85 per cent of national average earnings: nearly Pounds 14,000 in 1993 prices. The government will keep the level of loan repayments under review. Following a review of the Access Funds which help students who might otherwise have difficulty in completing their courses, Funds have been increased to Pounds 27m in each year.</p>

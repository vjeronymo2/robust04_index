			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Premium bonds repel lottery The launch of the National Lottery has not affected sales of premium bonds, National Savings said yesterday. Gross premium bond sales were Pounds 161m for November - an increase of Pounds 34m from October. Mr Alan McGill, controller of the Premium Bonds office, said: 'This confirms our belief that premium bonds appeal to a different market from that of the National Lottery.' National Savings said people who bought tickets for the lottery did so on impulse, unlike those who bought premium bonds. The minimum lottery ticket purchase is Pounds 1 compared with a more thought-provoking Pounds 100 for premium bonds. Mr McGill said sales of premium bonds this year amounted to more than Pounds 1.7bn, more than combined sales for the previous five years. Sales had been aided by the increase in the jackpot prize to Pounds 1m in April and the reduction in the qualifying period to take part in the draw to one month from three months. National Savings' contribution to government funding in November was Pounds 249m, down from Pounds 287m the previous month. The highest contributions were from premium bonds at Pounds 130m and savings certificates at Pounds 113m. Net sales were Pounds 79m and gross sales Pounds 776m. The total amount invested in National Savings at the end of November was Pounds 51bn. The government is to review the regulations guaranteeing anonymity to winners of the National Lottery, Mr Iain Sproat, the national heritage minister, told the Commons yesterday, Kevin Brown writes. He said during a debate on the lottery: 'We ought to protect anonymity very rigorously and, clearly, it has not worked this week. We must look again at how to make it work.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The restoration of  Sino- French relations has been welcomed by President of the  France-China Committee Francois de Villepin.    He told XINHUA today that the joint communique between the  governments of China and France signaled that their relationship  was over the worst and ushered in a new era.    In an interview with the official Chinese news agency, de  Villepin said that Sino-French friendship, on the basis of the  traditional principles on which the two countries established  diplomatic relations, would provide for fresh advantages  politically for bilateral trade and economic cooperation.    Reviewing the bilateral relationship, he said that China's  pursuit of the reform and opening policy constructed by senior  leader Deng Xiaoping had been a major event of the past 30  years, ever since the two countries had forged diplomatic ties.    From the late 1970s, China has speeded up its international  cooperation in trade and economy and secured one of the fastest  economic growths in the world, the chairman said.    He added that increased bilateral cooperation could now be  enjoyed in the future, alluding to low trade activities in the  past.    During the first nine months of 1993, he told XINHUA,  China's  trade volume with France registered only a 33 percent increase,  much lower than the 90 percent with Germany, 83 percent with  Italy and 154 percent with Denmark.    During that period, France had lost potential trade with  China worth a total of 6 billion francs (35.6 billion U.S.  dollars), the France-China committee estimated.    De Villepin stressed that it is now in the two peoples'  interest to improve their relationship and develop economic  cooperation.    As permanent members of the United Nations, France and China  should make efforts to help build a new world order and advance  world peace and progress, de Villepin added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- NEC Corp. said Wednesday [25  May] it will introduce a new mainframe computer for parallel  processing on the domestic market on July 1.    NEC said the computer, parallel ACOS AX7300, is equipped  with  multiple microprocessor units (MPUS), which make low-cost,  high-performance parallel processing possible.    The mpus are based on complementary metal oxide  semiconductor  (CMOS) technology, which is used in personal computers, NEC said.    Existing mainframes use customized semiconductors.    NEC said eight models of the computer, at the low end of its  mainframe computer line, will be available to companies for  monthly rental charges from 580,000 yen, 40 percent lower than  for existing mainframes.    The company controls 27 percent of Japan's mainframe market.</p>

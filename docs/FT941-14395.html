			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: McDonald's plans Dollars 1bn buy-back McDonald's Corporation, the international hamburger restaurant chain, intends to buy back Dollars 1bn of common stock within the next three years, funded primarily by excess cash flow. Since 1983, the company has bought back stock worth nearly Dollars 2.2bn. Mr Jack Greenberg, chief financial officer, said the repurchases would enhance shareholder returns, but would not dent the equity base needed to support growth worldwide. McDonald's recently announced it would accelerate its global restaurant expansion, building 900 to 1,200 new stores annually, with about two-thirds outside the US. It currently has 14,000 restaurants in 70 countries, with nearly 80 per cent independently owned by local franchisees.</p>

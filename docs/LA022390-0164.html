			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ATLANTIS DELAYED UNTIL SUNDAY  </P> <P> NASA today postponed for a third time the flight of Atlantis on a secret  military mission, saying that its commander had recovered from a cold but that  the threat of storms still prevented the launch.  </P> <P> National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers ordered the delay until  at least Sunday, blaming a weather front that moved into the area this morning,  packing rain and brisk winds and bringing the threat of thunderstorms. The  forecast for Sunday is much better with an 80% chance of favorable conditions.  </P> <P> The postponement came just hours after doctors pronounced Atlantis commander  John O. Creighton fully recovered from a cold that, along with the weather,  forced two earlier postponements.  </P></p>

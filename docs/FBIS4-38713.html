			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- About 1,000 Russian  specialists work in China, well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS  on Wednesday.    However, the sources denied reports published by the U.S.  NEWS AND WORLD REPORT magazine that "thousands" of scientists  and technicians from the former Soviet Union work under  contracts in China and help design and produce modern weapons.    "I do not rule out that there may be contracts under which  our technical specialists go to China. But I doubt it very much  that there are so many of them. All the more so because so  sensitive spheres of cooperation are involved. I think that if  such cases exist, there are only a few of them," a Russian  Foreign Ministry top official said.    "`Thousands' is an absurd figure. Until lately we did not  have facts that someone worked in the sphere of arms  production," an official with the Russian foreign intelligence  service said.    However, other sources said that China has certain interest  in Russian specialists, particularly in the sphere of aircraft  building. Those who go to China are either of no interest for  western countries, or know too much to be allowed to go to the  west. In China they earn about 1,000 U.S. dollars a month on the  average. This is much less than they could make in the west, but  much more than they earned in Russia, the sources said.</p>

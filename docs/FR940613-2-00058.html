			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Should a mutual institution be required, as a threshold issue, to demonstrate a need to convert_or is it sufficient that it provide an adequate business plan for the future? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the absence of legislation, could and should the FDIC adopt guidelines or set standards for the distribution of the existing value of a converting institution, or could or should the matter be left entirely to the trustees? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whether it is legislation or the FDIC or the board of trustees that sets standards, what should they be? Who should get some of the value, how much, and how specific should the rules be? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If depositors (or creditors or borrowers or employees) are to receive some of the value, how should it be allocated among them? Should amount of deposit or tenure of association be accorded more weight? Must depositors and debtholders be treated identically? What practical constraints exist, based on mutuals' information systems and resources? What should the record date be? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If charitable organizations or foundations are to receive a portion of the value, how should the suitability of the recipients be determined? Should there be a presumption that the trustees' selection of recipients is reasonable? Do there need to be rules to prevent abuse of such entities_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , through ``consulting contracts'' with trustees? Should such entities be required to sell at the time of conversion, or should they be permitted to diversify over time, in accordance with existing federal tax and banking laws? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Does ``pressure to convert'' from parties who would receive value if an institution did so represent a legitimate public policy concern? How great might that pressure be? How can trustees of institutions which have not elected to convert be protected from unreasonable litigation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) What potential problems (including tax issues and insider abuses) are there with the proposed new form of transaction, and how can they be avoided or alleviated? On the assumption that the market will gradually improve on any form of transaction, how specific does legislation or regulation need to be in that area? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Should converting institutions (including those doing merger conversions) be required or encouraged to obtain ``fairness opinions'' from independent financial advisors? Should the FDIC attempt to ``police'' the market judgements involved in the process in any way? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Should new mutual holding company creations be permitted? If not, how should existing ones be regulated? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the order of the Board of Directors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Washington, D.C., this 31 day of May, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert E.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Trade News: France keeps up oilseeds pressure FRANCE wants the EC to conclude a renegotiated oilseeds accord with the US, leaving other elements of the controversial transatlantic farm deal to be resolved later in negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). 'We should settle the oilseeds dispute first,' Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's farm minister, said yester-day. France could accept the restriction in the US-EC agreement limiting Community cultivation of oilseeds to 5.128m hectares, but the ceiling on the amount of oilseeds which could be grown, on land set aside from food production, for industrial uses like bio-energy, would have to be raised or removed. The French tactic seems aimed at raising again the option of separating the oilseeds dispute from the wider Gatt farm row by arguing that the issue is not totally part of the Gatt negotiations. Two Gatt panels have demanded the EC change its oilseeds regime. Speaking to foreign journalists in Paris, Mr Soisson suggested that France might try to rally other EC governments - notably that of Germany, which is a big oilseeds producer - for a direct approach to Washington for a rejigged oilseeds deal. But French Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy was said yesterday to favour working through the European Commission according to established EC rules and protocol. Gatt will be one of the more delicate issues at today's Franco-German summit in Bonn. Mr Soisson acknowledged Germany faced a dilemma between 'not wanting to separate itself politically from France, and not wanting to separate itself economically from the US'. An Elysee spokesman suggested that President Francois Mitterrand would not want to push Chancellor Helmut Kohl too hard on the Gatt issue.</p>

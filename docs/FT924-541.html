			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures drive shares to new heights PRE-CHRISTMAS trading on the London stock market reached new heights yesterday, spurred on by a strong rise in stock index futures which prompted heavy arbitrage business between the March contract and the underlying FT-SE stocks. Although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued its advance, gaining a further 1 per cent to 2,845.4, the futures-related activity turned the spotlight back on to the blue chip leaders. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 34.3, or 1.2 per cent, higher on the day at another new peak of 2,842. Yesterday's buyers appeared to be a shade more speculative than over the past week. In addition to the securities houses, busily arbitraging between futures and equities, buying came from across the range of investors, now convinced that economic revival is on the way. Investors, also encouraged by firmness in other European bourses, appeared afraid of missing the turn in the markets; some analysts now predict a Footsie level of 3,500 next year. Equities looked uncertain at first in spite of a heavy load of overnight tax-related deals. But after the Footsie had dipped 2.3 to 2,805.4, the futures market opened and a substantial premium on the March Footsie contract sent the blue chips racing ahead. Later, the market took a favourable view of a modest rise in exports disclosed in the UK trade figures for November. Seaq volume of 815.1m shares compared with 831.4m on Monday when retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.46bn. The March contract on the FT-SE Index traded at a premium of around 46 against the underlying stock market throughout the session as securities houses and traders sought to position themselves for the new year. Business was extremely heavy, with the March total approaching 9,000 lots in late dealings. The final reading showed March at a 45 premium to cash, compared with an estimated 19 fair value premium, the calculation which allows for dividend flows and financing costs. Increased business in traded options lifted total contracts to 42,365 from Monday's 33,811, but turnover in Footsie options dipped to 11,090 lots. National Power (3,034) headed individual stock contracts.</p>

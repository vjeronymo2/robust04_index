			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 16 Apr (INA) -- Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister  of culture and information, has said Iraq has proven to the  Security Council, by concrete evidence, that it has fulfilled  Section C of Security Council Resolution 687. He stressed that  the Security Council should now implement Paragraph 22 of the  resolution by immediately lifting the unjust embargo imposed on  Iraq.    At a news conference in Sanaa today, attended by  correspondents of Arab and foreign press and news agencies in  Yemen, Hammadi said the UN Special Commission has been  monitoring Iraq's weapons of mass destruction for over two  years. Therefore, U.S. and British allegations that Iraq has  not complied with the monitoring regime are baseless.    The minister of culture and information also spoke about  Iraq's calls for a Middle East free of weapons of mass  destruction, the last of which was President Saddam Husayn's  speech on 2 April 1990. He stressed that the presence of weapons  of mass destruction in the region is not in the interest of its  peoples because of what these weapons cause in terms of  terrorism and threats to peace and security in the region.    The minister said Iraq's agreement to implement Section C of  Security Council Resolution 687 is part of the general framework  asserted by Paragraph 14 of the same resolution which calls on  the Security Council to make the Middle East a region free of  those weapons.    Hamid Yusuf Hammadi said this demand reflects Iraq's policy  that had been adopted long before the aggression. On the next  Security Council review of the Iraq embargo, Hamid Yusuf Hammdi  said after Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations, the Security  Council is asked to fulfill its own obligations by lifting the  embargo imposed on Iraq.    He pointed out that Iraq's diplomatic drive is based on  explaining facts objectively. This has convinced some major  nations that Iraq has indeed fulfilled its obligations. He  underlined, in this regard, the objective stance of France,  Russia, and China and other countries during the recent Security  Council session on the Iraq embargo.    The minister of culture and information added that the  position of these countries reflected their conviction that Iraq  has indeed fulfilled its obligations and that the Security  Council should now lift the embargo.    He said the fact that the Security Council has not issued  its  traditional statement in its recent meeting is evidence that  there is a split within the council between the majority, which  supports lifting the embargo, and the U.S. and British minority.    He said a considerable number of countries are now siding  with Iraq and seek lifting the embargo and resuming economic  relations with it. He said the Special Commission's  procrastination by not fixing a date for starting the monitoring  means there will be no specific date for lifting the embargo.    Asked about the aim of his visit to Yemen, Hammadi said he  communicated a message from President Saddam Husayn to his  brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih outlining the Iraqi  leadership's perspective on coordination with Arab and friendly  nations to lift the sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council.    The minister compared the starving and destructive impact of  the sanctions to that of weapons of mass destruction.    On the Kurdish issue, the minister said the U.S.  Administration applies double standards in dealing with the  Iraqi Kurds, citing the plight of Kurds in neighboring countries  who are being killed every day.    Hammadi dismissed as groundless Kuwait's claims that Iraq  detains Kuwaiti prisoners. Iraq is not holding a single  Kuwaiti, the minister emphasized. This issue has now been  referred to the Arab League and Red Cross, said the minister.    He noted that Iraq had proposed that a committee chaired by  a  Moroccan and including deputies from the Kuwaiti National  Assembly and representatives of the Gulf Cooperation Council  visit Iraq to pursue the case of the people Kuwait contends are  missing.    Hammadi said it was a distortion to link the sanctions to  the  issue of Kuwait. Section C of UN Security Council Resolution  687, he explained, shows the two are unrelated. Linkage is  being promoted by the United States to keep the sanctions.    Keeping the sanctions in place, he said, is causing  considerable detriment to the economies of many countries. He  cited the case of Turkey, which has sustained a $20 billion-loss  in income due to its suspended trade with Iraq and the cutoff of  Iraqi oil transiting Turkish territory.    The minister disclosed that Iraq has access to valuable  information related to the World Trade Center bombing in New  York. Iraq stands ready to cooperate with the United States on  the matter, preferably under the auspices of the American  Congress, he indicated.    On Iraq's effort to repair the damage wrought by the  aggression, Hammadi said our success in rebuilding 80 percent of  our facilities within the span of 11 months has thwarted the  plans of the United States and its allies. Numerous countries,  like France, have shown an interest in reestablishing commercial  and diplomatic ties with Iraq, after they became convinced that  Iraq has fulfilled the obligations stipulated by UN Security  Council resolutions, said Hammadi.</p>

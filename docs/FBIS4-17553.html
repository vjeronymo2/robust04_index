			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Amageldy Akhmetalimov </F> and Gennadiy Kulagin]    [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 24 April TASS -- Li Peng, premier  of China's Council of State, begins a four-day visit to  Kazakhstan on Monday, 25 April, on the final leg of his tour of  Central Asia republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    This will be the first visit to sovereign Kazakhstan by one  of top Chinese leaders. Judging by information coming in from  official circles, the visit is associated with hopes for the  revitalisation and development of bilateral relations.    Goods turnover between Kazakhstan and China decreased to  $205  million U.S. dollars last year as against $433 million in 1992.  Only a few out of 150 registered joint ventures are engaged in  production activities while the bulk of them practice trade and  purchasing operations.    A number of direct agreements were concluded recently  between  Kazakhstan and China enterprises on establishing the  co-manufacture of various types of industrial products and  consumer goods. This is a good sign which shows that the basic  document which determines long-term cooperation between the two  neighbouring countries -- the joint declaration on the  principles of friendly relations, which was signed during  President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to China in October last  year -- begins to work in earnest at last.    In all, 15 bilateral agreements have already been concluded.  They concern political, trade, economic, scientific, technical  and cultural contacts between Kazakhstan and China.    Li Peng is to hold talks with Nazarbayev here in a narrow  format and meet with members of the Republic's business  community. There will be also talks between official  delegations.    As a result of the visit, the two sides are to sign an  agreement on the Sino-Kazakhstan state border, which is 1,700 km  long, and agreements on a Chinese commodity credit, which is  expected to amount to about 50 million U.S. dollars, to  Kazakhstan, and on Chinese humanitarian aid to the Republic to  the tune of 1.5 million yuan.</p>

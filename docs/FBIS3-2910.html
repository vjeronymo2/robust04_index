			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters He Ping (0149 1627), Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814), </F> and Wu Yilong (1566 1150 7893)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier  Li Peng this morning joined separate group discussions and  solicited opinions from the Hainan and Jilin delegations to the  second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC].  He emphasized: Our work in all fields of endeavor must  subordinate to and serve the overall interests of seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability, which have a bearing on  the work of the whole party and the whole country. We must  correctly handle the relations among reform, development, and  stability; and must firmly carry out various reform programs.  Meanwhile, we must pay attention to discovering problems and  promptly solving them to ensure the smooth progress of reform  and development.    At the Hainan delegation's group discussion, Ruan Chongwu,  provincial party secretary and governor; Huang Baozhang,  director of the provincial planning department; Wang Faren,  director of the provincial land reclamation bureau; and Du  Bilan, director of the State Oceanography Bureau's Ocean  Strategy Research Institute; spoke successively. In light of  the deliberation of the Government Work Report, the delegates  raised proposals to Premier Li Peng on strengthening Hainan's  infrastructure, developing its rubber production, and exploiting  its marine resources.    Li Peng said: Hainan, as China's largest special economic  zone, has made remarkable progress in implementing reform and  opening up. The province is one of China's most promising areas.  He expressed the hope that Hainan will proceed from its special  feature in concentrating efforts on promoting economic  construction and achieving breakthroughs in key areas to spur  national development. He said: Hainan should further promote  the special economic zone's development by making use of its  advantages in location and resources to serve as the country's  vegetable supply and rice breeding bases and quicken  infrastructure development.    The premier emphasized: The special economic zone is a  showcase for opening up China to the outside world and for  building socialist spiritual civilization. The deeper reform  goes and the wider China opens itself up to the outside world,  the more necessary it is to build spiritual civilization. We  must ensure that the work in both areas is attended to.    At the Jilin delegation's group discussion, the premier  first  listened to speeches by Jilin City Mayor Zhan Yuechang and  Siping City Mayor Zang Shengye. It was almost noon, but  deputies still waited for the premier to speak. Li Peng said  smilingly: "I have stated all my views in the Government Work  Report. It would be better for me to listen to your views."  Then, Geng Zhaojie, Changchun No.1 Automobile Plant director,  and Hunchun City Mayor Jin Minxiong spoke on ways for helping  large and medium state enterprises tide over difficulties,  introducing a share-holding system, and opening border areas.    After listening to the deputies, Li Peng said: Jilin, an old  industrial base and a major grain-producing province, has made  contributions to the state over the years. Since the  implementation of the reform and opening policy, especially  since the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important  speeches made during his southern tour, the provincial economy  has developed rapidly. He said: "I worked in Jilin for more  than a decade. I have feelings for its people and places, and  am very happy about the changes that have occurred in the  province. I believe that through your continued efforts, Jilin  will become more prosperous and more developed with each passing  day."    Li Peng said: The theme of the current NPC session is to  earnestly implement the 20-character principle [seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability] and to correctly handle  the relations among reform, development, and stability. In  developing the economy, we should focus attention on improving  efficiency. On ways for invigorating state enterprises, he  pointed out: The invigoration of state enterprises is a focal  point and knotty task in deepening the reform of the economic  structure. The key to improving the performance of state  enterprises lies in raising their efficiency. This year we must  do everything possible to accomplish this task. The government  should create a favorable external environment for enterprises  to change their operating mechanisms. But, more importantly,  enterprises should rely on themselves. They should tap their  potential, establish a modern enterprise system, improve the  competence of their managers, upgrade technology, strengthen  management, and gear their production to market demands. It is  hoped that governments at all levels and enterprise managers  will seriously study and work out feasible measures to gradually  build up state enterprises' ability to compete in the market.    After attending the discussion with deputies from Jilin,  Comrade Li Peng paid a courtesy call on the Fujian delegation.  He told them: Fujian, a vanguard of reform and opening up, has  made progress in recent years. The provincial economy keeps  developing and the people's mental outlook has also undergone  tremendous changes. We will continue to carry out more  successfully the policy of opening up to the outside world.  Fujian shall score greater successes in opening up to the  outside world.    Noting uneven economic development within Fujian, Li Peng  said: The province should make efforts to narrow the gap between  fast-growing Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou and the backward  northwestern and eastern parts in a bid to achieve common  prosperity. After localities become prosperous, they should  help others cast off poverty and become well off so as to  achieve common prosperity throughout Fujian. It is hoped that  Fujian will make further efforts in this regard.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's  automotive industry Friday [1 April] responded calmly to a U.S.  report which declared Japan guilty of unfair trade practices.  Yutaka Kume, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, said it is not true that Japan has discriminated  against foreign automakers and auto parts makers seeking to  enter the nation's markets and will not do so in the future.    Kume, also chairman of Nissan Motor Co., made the remark  after the U.S. Government released a report Thursday accusing  Japan of maintaining trade barriers against foreign companies in  the automotive sector, among others. He said his industry wants  to try to make the United States understand that Japan's auto  market is open for foreign countries to enter.</p>

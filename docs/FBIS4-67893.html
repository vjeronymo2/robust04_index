			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, head of the  Strategic Affairs Secretariat [SAE], yesterday characterized as  ``foolishly absurd'' allegations that the sale of Brazilian  enriched uranium to the U.S. company Nuexco would endanger the  reloading of the Angra-1 nuclear plant. In its latest edition,  the magazine ISTOE reports that Nuclear Industries of Brazil  (INB) has sold the enriched uranium at a cost of $1.7 million.    Flores said: The transaction will not bring any problems to  the Brazilian nuclear program. He added that he would release  today all the figures concerning Brazilian uranium reserves.    Flores said he learned about the transaction after the  contract had been signed, as INB is empowered to make these  sales on its own. He said this was a good deal for INB, as the  money it has obtained through this sale will make it possible to  reactivate already this year the uranium mine of Pocos de  Caldas, in Minas Gerais State.    Regarding the possibility that the Brazilian uranium could  be  diverted to countries like Iraq, Iran, or India--to make  bombs--Flores was even more emphatic.    He said: It would be paranoid to believe that Canada, one of  the most active verifiers of the use of nuclear energy, could  divert the material. Canada, Flores said, is the ultimate  destination of the Brazilian uranium sold to Nuexco.</p>

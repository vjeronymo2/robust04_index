			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNSOLD RESIDENCES SET RECORD IN JULY  </P> <P> A record number of single-family houses and condominiums went unsold in July,  but sales picked up 5% compared to June, the San Fernando Valley Board of  Realtors said Monday.  </P> <P> The board said 3,332 houses and condominiums were added to the for sale list in  the Valley in July, increasing the total number of active listings to 13,973,  2% more than in June, and 35% more than the previous July.  </P> <P> There were some signs that sellers of single-family houses were willing to  lower their prices to attract buyers in the glutted market.  </P> <P> Indeed, the average resale price of a single-family house in July fell 5% to  $291,800 from $307,800 in June. The average price was 1% lower than a year ago,  when the average single-family house sold for $295,800.  </P> <P> Sales volume rose slightly as prices retreated. A total of 790 single-family  houses were sold in July, 5% more than the 751 sold in June.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the pace of sales was 33% slower than last July's, when 1,171  single-family houses changed hands.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there were no signs that condominium sellers were willing to lower  their expectations. The average resale price of a condominium hit a record high  of $157,200, rising 1% from $155,600 in June. The average condo resale price  marked a 4% increase since July, 1989.  </P> <P> The number of condominiums resold also climbed 4% in July, compared to June --  but condo sales volume was 28% lower than a year before.  </P> <P> The board in a statement said a 22% decline in the number of new single-family  house listings in July as compared to June was "the first clear-cut signal to  date" that homeowners' expectations of high sales prices could be easing.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who weren't serious about selling have changed their minds and  are letting listings expire," said Jim Link, executive vice president of the  board, in a statement.  </P> <P> Signs of moderation were particularly apparent among more expensive houses. The  board said houses in the $500,000 to $750,000 price range sold for an average  of 11% less than the original asking price.  </P> <P> The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and  condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its  statistics do not include most new residences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JULY VALLEY HOUSE SALES  </P> <P> NORTH WEST  </P> <P> Avg.

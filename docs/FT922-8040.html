			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Norris at launch of Countdown Time and motion: Steven Norris, minister for transport for London, yesterday attended the launch of Countdown, a passenger information service being installed by London Buses. From September, passengers at bus stops on the 18 route will be given an Underground-style countdown to the arrival time of the next bus, Richard Tomkins writes. London Buses hopes the Pounds 700,000 system will overcome the uncertainty involved in waiting for buses, often cited by passengers as the main reason for not making more use of them. The progress of buses will be monitored by roadside beacons and by radios in the buses. A central computer will interpret data and transmit the predicted arrival times of the next three buses to dot-matrix screens at stops along the route. Installation of the equipment follows an earlier short-term experiment on the 36 and 36B routes in 1986-87. The new system uses technology developed by Serel, a French electronics company, now in use in several French towns and in Malaga, Spain. The 18 route runs from King's Cross to Sudbury in north-west London. London Buses estimates that increased revenue should pay for the system in less than three years. If it succeeds, the system may be extended to 100 or more London bus routes at a cost of Pounds 35m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev today had a  nearly 40-minute telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of  Defense William Perry. As before, the two officials discussed  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the course of the conversation, Grachev proposed a  contingent of U.S. troops be deployed in areas around Sarajevo  which are predominantly populated by Bosnian Moslems. In his  opinion, this would further improve the situation, after Russia  sent its peacekeepers to the positions of Bosnian Serbs.    However, the U.S. Secretary of Defense said the United  States  did not plan to deploy its troops in these areas.    In turn, Grachev proposed deploying contingents of such West  European states as Great Britain, France and Germany there.  Perry promised to discuss the proposal with the other defense  ministers.    Grachev said Russia insisted on the unacceptability of NATO  air strikes on military installations of any of the warring  sides.    In an interview with journalists after the end of the  conversation, Grachev said Bosnian Serbs had withdrawn the bulk  of their heavy hardware from around Sarajevo. He said he was  confident that the Serbs will accurately fulfil all their  obligations.    Grachev did not rule out the possibility that more Russian  peacekeepers, including the 27th motor rifle division of the  Privolzhskiy district and the 46th motor rifle division of the  Leningrad district, might be deployed in the Sarajevo region, if  necessary.    In an answer to journalists' questions, Grachev said NATO  air  strikes on Serb positions seemed very unlikely at the moment.  He suggested that such strikes may be possible only in case of  provocations, and are the most likely to be dealt on  sporadically populated highland areas as "retaliation or  pressure." He pointed out once again that any air strikes in  the area were unlikely at the moment.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Colombia shifts focus in the drugs battle: Escobar's death frees government to concentrate on other targets After years of obsession with Pablo Escobar as the main source of Colombia's evils, the country is unexpectedly realistic about the significance of his death. An opinion poll after the Medellin drug chief was shot dead last week found that more than half those interviewed thought drug trafficking would continue as before; a third said there would be no change in the violence. President Cesar Gaviria and other political and military leaders were clearly relieved the memory of Escobar's escape from his luxury jail could be rubbed out, but they expressed satisfaction rather than triumph and talked in terms of the long battle ahead. Perhaps one of the most useful results of Escobar's death is that the drug problem can now be seen in greater perspective. The US ambassador to Bogota says the government will now be able to direct its efforts against the more serious Cali trafficking group. For years the Cali groups have represented the more tolerable face of trafficking. While Escobar terrorised the country with car bombs, the Cali people bought banks, funded politicians, founded universities and concentrated on legalising their fortunes. On the whole, the violence did not impinge on the public, but with the appearance of new heroin trafficking groups, this changed: dozens of bodies floated down the River Cauca and Cali's murder rate shot up. The government is trying to draw Cali and other traffickers into the surrender-and-confess programme; they would serve short sentences and then emerge with 'legal' status. But some see the surrender legislation as almost as good as an amnesty. Even if the top people surrender, as it seems they may, there is no reason to suppose their organisations will stop trafficking, and there are plenty of ambitious young criminals waiting. The number of trafficking groups and the size of the business are growing, according to drug experts in Colombia. Only recently has any serious effort been made to tackle money-laundering structures and stem the avalanche of returning dollars, estimated at Dollars 800m-Dollars 5bn a year over the past two years. President Gaviria, the police and armed forces have recovered prestige at home and abroad with the death of Escobar. It also removes one source of violence from the current electoral campaign (three presidential candidates were assassinated in the last one). Business people believe foreign investors will regain confidence in Colombia. As one newspaper columnist wrote: 'The Escobar excuse is over and forces the government to show better results on other fronts.'</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / EMI twelve peruse house ads: The first meeting of EU's 'homeless' bankers Yesterday, on or around the spot on which Charlemagne convened his Imperial Council of spiritual and temporal leaders of the Frankish empire in 794, Europe's monetary monitors gathered to discuss housing, pay and conditions. The 12 governors of the European Union's central banks, under the presidency of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, met formally for the first time under the banner of the European monetary institute, ground-breaker for the proposed European central bank. Under a marquetry representation of the German eagle in the Frankfurt city hall, Mr Lamfalussy disclosed to the press last night that he had short-listed the city's obelisk-like Messeturm building and the nearby Poseidon building as potential homes. Since the Bundesbank already occupies several floors of the Messeturm, pundits favoured Poseidon as the diplomatic choice. Mr Lamfalussy did not expect to move in for some months, however, because there was a lot of 'housekeeping' to be done. He also had to find a director general to report directly to him. Offers were clearly not welcome. He personally, he stressed, would nominate a candidate. Yesterday's meeting had agreed on the organisational base. A total workforce of up to 250 people would be built up gradually to service five department heads: economics and statistics, a general secretariat, administration, reserve management and information systems and communications. The department heads would be paid at around the rates on which European Commission A2-grade directeurs currently subsist. The director-general was worth the Brussels A1 rate, while it had been proposed he be paid a commission vice-president's salary. Yesterday's 'symbolic' appearance in the EMI's future home also elected Mr Maurice Doyle, governor of the Bank of Ireland, as the institute's vice-president. Mr Lamfalussy defended his colleague against press charges of lack of seniority with a hymn of praise for Ireland's remarkable macro-economic record. As a representative of a relatively poor EU member, he added, Mr Doyle would bring to the institute a 'sensitivity' to the needs of poorer countries. As to the EMI's functions, Mr Lamfalussy was less precise. Its role was 'freely interpretable' in some ways, he conceded. He effectively ruled out the possibility of a European central bank emerging from its EMI embryo by 1997, and refused to speculate on the next target date, 1999. But he could not ultimately imagine the EU, already heavily integrated, functioning properly without a common currency. Half-promising the EMI would move to its new home, Frankfurt, in September, he whizzed off to his Basle base, leaving the assembled media without champagne, sandwiches or ceremony.</p>

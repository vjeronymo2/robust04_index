			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "A Trick To Appease Public </F> Opinion"]    [Text] It was recently revealed that Kim Chong-hwi, who was  senior assistant for diplomatic and security affairs in  Chongwadae [presidential offices] during the Sixth Republic era  and who now lives in the United States as a fugitive, has  recently applied for permanent residency in the United States.    Concerning this, the South Korean ruling bunch is kicking  off  a row, such as requesting that the United States not grant his  permanent residency and extend his visa, as well as requesting  that his whereabouts be established.    However, this is no more than a deceitful trick to appease  the heated public opinion.    It is common knowledge that Kim Chong-hwi, who worked as  senior assistant for diplomatic and security affairs at  Chongwadae during the Sixth Republic era, is one of the key  figures involved in irregularities committed in the course of  weapons transactions with the United States under the signboard  of Yulgok Project [ROK weapons procurement program].    Kim Chong-hwi secretly ran away to the United States last  April under the tacit approval of the incumbent ruling bunch  because the public's attention was focused on him and his  irregularities were exposed.    However, the people's voice demanding his summons and that  he  be dealt with according to the law has not been pacified for  nearly a year.    Because his request for permanent residency in the United  States was exposed recently, the Democratic Party--the  opposition party--in a statement urged the puppet authorities to  summon him without fail. Even Korean residents in the United  States launched a signature campaign and struggle to oppose Kim  Chong-hwi's asylum in the United States.    Embarrassed by this, the Kim Yong-sam group kicked off a row  about a so-called request and so forth. However, it has no  intention, even to the slightest degree, to call him to Seoul,  because various Sixth Republic corruption acts and  irregularities, which have been concealed behind the black  curtain, and crimes of the incumbent rulers who are related with  such corruption and irregularities, as well as crimes of the  civilian ruling bunch which helped him flee to the United  States, would be fully exposed to the entire world if Kim  Chong-hwi, who has a lot of intelligence materials because he  was in charge of diplomatic and security affairs during the  Sixth Republic, is summoned to Seoul and is made to stand trial.    The puppets' so-called request to the United States, and so  forth are no more than a poor trick to appease the people's  increasing demand for his summons, by pretending that they are  making efforts to summon him.    This is proven by the fact that although they described Kim  Chong-hwi's request for permanent residency as deplorable and as  an act going against common sense, and so forth, the puppets  recently stood back a step, saying that drastic measures are  difficult, and the like. Moreover, the puppet Foreign Ministry  was aware of his request for permanent residency long before the  press reported it. Nevertheless, instead of preventing his  request the puppet Foreign Ministry kept it secret.    The Kim Yong-sam group is now indeed embarrassed by this  incident. In addition to Kim Chong-hwi, Yi Won-cho, National  Assemblyman from the Democratic Liberal Party; Yi Yong-man,  finance minister during the Sixth Republic; and many other  criminals fled overseas since the so-called civilian government  came to office.    If the Kim Yong-sam group only summons and imprisons Kim  Chong-hwi, the people will raise voices of criticism that his  imprisonment, while leaving others who fled with its help free,  is unfair. And if the Kim Yong-sam group does not arrest him,  the people's protest will increase. Therefore, the puppets are  indeed at a loss.    The Kim Yong-sam group is gravely worried that the crimes of  the Sixth Republic and its own crimes committed in collusion  with the Sixth Republic will be exposed through the mouths of  the fugitives when they are called to Seoul. This is why the  puppets do not want to summon Kim Chong-hwi, although they are  loudly talking about the request and so forth.    All facts show that the incumbent ruling bunch is deeply  involved in various corruption acts and irregularities of the  Sixth Republic and that the reform drive, parting from the Sixth  Republic, eradication of irregularities without sanctuary, and  so on, which the puppets have loudly talked about to date, are  all a deception.    The Kim Yong-sam group is the guard who protects criminals  who committed various irregularities during the Sixth Republic  era. As long as such a group remains in power, corruption and  irregularities will not be eradicated in South Korea.    In fact, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the ringleaders of  various corruption and irregularities during the Fifth and Sixth  Republics, are still active under the protection of the  incumbent authorities. Besides, incidents of various  irregularities, including large-scale financial fraud, have been  exposed one after another.    The fact that society becomes corrupt and irregularities are  rampant under the corrupt politics is a phenomenon that cannot  be prevented. The Kim Yong-sam group, the supporter and  protector of such irregularities, should be removed from power  in order to eradicate corruption and irregularities in South  Korea.</p>

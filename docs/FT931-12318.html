			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: 'Substantial' fall at Robert Bosch ROBERT BOSCH, Germany's leading vehicle components maker, suffered a 'substantial' fall in profits last year, and faces another difficult period in the current financial year, the company said yesterday. Earnings figures, which are expected to be published in June, will therefore show their third consecutive decline. Net profits dropped 10 per cent in 1990 and fell a further 3.5 per cent to DM540m (Dollars 339.6m) last year. Group sales, up just 2.2 per cent to DM34.4bn, compared with DM33.6bn in 1991, had been hit by the effective revaluation of the D-Mark against other currencies during the second half. Adjusted to take account of this factor, turnover rose by 4 per cent. Rationalisations, including cuts in material and capital costs, and the reduction of the workforce by 11,000 to 170,000 worldwide had helped improve productivity, the group added.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Leading Article: The price of costly debt THE UK economy is in trouble, as today's headlines and the Bank of England's gloomy quarterly bulletin confirm. The growing burden of consumer and corporate debts is being compounded by the highest level of real interest rates at this stage of the economic cycle since the 1930s, as the chart on the UK News pages of today's FT shows. The nearer the economy shuffles towards the government's zero inflation target, the higher these real rates will become. Things may well get worse before they get better. The depressing news that Ford UK is to cut the working week at two of its plants, because of sluggish car sales, dims any rays of hope that could be extracted from yesterday's output figures. While gross domestic product fell in the second quarter of this year, non-oil output rose by 0.1 per cent after seven successive quarterly falls. But the rise in manufacturing output that raised non-oil GDP was in anticipation of a post-election recovery in spending. This has failed to materialise, as the fall in retail sales in July confirms. Manufacturers now have little option but to cut production and draw down recently accumulated stocks, with Ford UK leading the way. A further wave of redundancies now looks inevitable. The problem is debt, as the Bank of England bulletin amply shows. Lower nominal interest rates may have slightly cut debt service ratios, but the fall in house values means that outstanding debts are still rising as a proportion of housing wealth. A tenth of all households with mortgages now owe more than the value of their property. If house prices continue falling at their current rate, this number could easily double to 2m by 1994. The Bank is correct in its diagnosis, but typically reticent in its prognosis. The outlook does not remain very uncertain, as the bulletin declares. It looks rather certain. Faced with high interest rate bills and deteriorating balance sheets, consumers have increased their savings. There is no reason to expect a change of heart. If anything, the interest rate screw will tighten over coming months. Real interest rates are already above 6 per cent, compared with 1 per cent in January 1981, the turning point of the last recession. The combination of falling inflation and the Bundesbank's stout defence of its tight money policies, mean that real rates are probably heading higher. A vote for the Maastricht treaty in September's French referendum would reinforce the deflationary status quo. A 'no' vote could force still higher interest rates, as the exchange rate mechanism comes under pressure. Mr John Major is locked in. He wants a recovery, yet his main achievement - and principal boast - is lower inflation. But lower inflation would only raise real interest rates and make the recovery still more sluggish. He is well on course to achieving his inflation target. But that victory looks increasingly costly.</p>

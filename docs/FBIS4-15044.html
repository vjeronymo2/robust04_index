			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev article: "Russia Will Sign Up to NATO </F> Program Anyhow, But It Needs Further Work"]    [Text] There has been no split in the Russian leadership  over the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by NATO,  Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev stated.    Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, as previously assumed,  plans  to visit Brussels in mid-April and perform the formal act of  Russian accession to the partnership program, which has already  been signed by 14 countries of Eastern Europe and the former  USSR.    The subject of the existence of sharp differences in the  Russian leadership arose in connection with contradictory  statements by presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov  and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Kostikov told journalists  that it could take Russia six or seven months to adopt a final  decision on the partnership program. Whereas the defense  minister, answering a question from journalists following his  meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who is in  Moscow, stated that the government's position has not changed.  The Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs have prepared a  joint document which has been supported by the president.    Answering an IZVESTIYA question about the explanation for  such divergent viewpoints expressed within the space of only a  few days, the president's press service answered that at the  famous briefing Kostikov had been "spelling out the president's  position at that moment."    It was suggested in the Defense and Foreign Ministries that  when he mentioned six or seven months Kostikov had in mind the  fact that it could take that long for talks to be held with NATO  on clarifying and amplifying the program's provisions. At the  Foreign Ministry it is not ruled out that this work could take  even longer. The "Partnership for Peace" program is seen in  Moscow as a framework document to which substance must be added.  As for Russia's joining the program, this question has been  decided, as President Yeltsin has repeatedly stated.</p>

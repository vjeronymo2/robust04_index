			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / HK markets shrug off Beijing snub Hong Kong markets yesterday shook off a statement by China that it no longer adhered to the 'through train' concept of Hong Kong politicians serving beyond 1997, when Beijing is to assume sovereignty of the British colony. The stock market's Hang Seng index posted its biggest one-day rise, taking its increase for 1993 beyond 100 per cent. In a statement on Monday, the Beijing government said it had hoped transitional arrangements could have been made on the basis of the principles of convergence with the Hong Kong Basic Law and through negotiations with the British government. 'It is a pity that no agreement has been reached due to deliberate sabotage by the British side,' it said. The 'through-train' idea means legislators and local councillors were to be allowed to serve their full terms, past the change of sovereignty. China said all colonial laws on terms for elected local councillors and legislators would be abolished on July 1 1997, take-over day. The Legislative Council, the municipal councils and district boards should be disbanded and reorganised under the Basic Law, the territory's post-1997 constitution, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said. The statement followed the breakdown in talks over British proposals for an extended democracy in the colony before 1997. Governor Chris Patten pressed ahead and tabled what were called non-controversial elements of the bill on December 15, after 17 largely fruitless rounds of talks. This set off renewed attack from China. However, observers see Beijing as keeping its options open and the statement as China's latest tactical move in its war of words with Britain. The Hong Kong government said the statement appeared to be in breach of joint commitments to maintain stability and prosperity in the colony. When the market reopened yesterday, the Hang Seng Index reached a record high of 11,570.22, up 530.38 points. It was the biggest one-day rise recorded on the exchange in point terms. The previous record, on December 16, was a jump of 394.40 points. Brokers said foreign funds continued to pour into Hong Kong, stimulated by the new highs on other Asian markets, including Singapore and Malaysia, on Monday. The Hong Kong stock market was closed on Monday. They said investors were undeterred by Beijing's statement as it was already expected the legislature could be dismantled after the handover.</p>

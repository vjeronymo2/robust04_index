			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Akzo, Allied-Signal in European carpet venture AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is to transfer a majority stake in its lossmaking nylon carpet fibre business to a joint venture which it will form with Allied-Signal of the US. This will give the US company its first production facility in Europe. The companies gave no financial details but said the joint venture would make investments to modernise Akzo's carpet fibre factory in the Dutch town of Emmen, which will form the heart of the venture. The two partners signed a letter of intent on the deal yesterday and expect to complete it by mid-1993. Allied-Signal, which is building a polyester carpet fibre factory in northern France, exports Dollars 25m in carpet fibres per year to Europe. Akzo's carpet fibre business, which now employs 350 after a bout of job-cutting, is estimated to have annual sales of Dollars 75m. The focus of Akzo's carpet fibre business is commercial - applications in carpets for hospitals, airports and office buildings. Allied-Signal's strength is the residential market. Allied-Signal said because of overcapacity in nylon carpets, it made sense for it to invest in existing capacity rather than adding new capacity. Separately, Mr Aarnout Loudon, Akzo's chairman, said in a new year address to staff that Akzo had met its forecast that 1992 net profit before extraordinary items would show a rise over 1991. But in the first six months of 1993, it would 'be difficult to hold earnings at the 1992 level'.</p>

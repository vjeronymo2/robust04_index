			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Our heritage is in a mess - Architecture Everyone has a moment of temporary madness from time to time but it is worrying when civil servants seem to be afflicted by a state of mind that is permanently impervious to reasonableness and logic. This, sadly, is the case when it comes to matters concerning what we have come to call 'the heritage.' When Mr Michael Heseltine was last secretary of state for the environment (in those halcyon pre-poll tax days), he set about the reorganisation of heritage affairs in order to release another area of activity from government control. His plans, which included the creation of English Heritage - an arm's-length semi-autonomous organisation - simply have not worked. The act of parliament that established English Heritage intended it to be the body that advised the Secretary of State on matters to do with listed buildings. This certainly has not happened. A parallel heritage division within the department of the environment persistently counters the advice of English Heritage: it must be those DOE civil servants who are so anxious to persuade the minister that English Heritage should move to Nottingham, and its brother organisation, The Royal Commission on Historic Monuments, should go to Swindon. It is hard to think of a more effective approach to ensure chaos, failure to communicate and collapse of morale. Mr Heseltine, I presume, wanted to lift the hand of government from heritage activities and bring the castles, abbeys and monuments into the market place so that they could trade and make money. As a marketing organisation English Heritage has performed well enough. Lord Montagu as chairman (he retires in August) understood the need to be more commercial. The tiresome logo is seen widely and there are now 200,000 members of English Heritage. But the National Trust, with some two million members, shows that heritage concerns count very highly with a large slice of the population. What the minister did not seem to understand was the role of heritage advice and the statutory functions of English Heritage. This whole area has become so confused that inefficiency and arrogance seems to be the order of the day over any matter to do with listed buildings and their protection. Leading proponents of conservation and owners of important buildings find it increasingly frustrating to deal with English Heritage. How much more effective will the organisation become when it is in Nottingham and Swindon with a lot of new staff? In many ways it will be almost useless. Take the National Buildings Record, which celebrates its 50th birthday this year with a modest exhibition (at the V&amp;A until May 12) and a book, Fifty Years of the National Buildings Record introduced by Sir John Summerson (Trigon Press hardback Pounds 14.95, RCHM paperback, Pounds 9.95). This outfit, together with the National Archaeological Record and the National Library of Air Photographs, produces the National Monuments Record and is a unique archive of some seven million items. It is something that scholars, architects and planners consult frequently. The National Buildings Record (NBR) was set up in 1941 as something of an emergency measure to attempt a national record of buildings that were under threat of destruction. In the commemorative book Sir John Summerson tells of the poignantly inadequate measures that were taken in the 1940s to photograph and list important buildings. But at least something was done and it is the stalwart work of people such as Summerson and Miss Dorothy Stroud, who toiled single-handedly with her camera and without a car in the outer suburbs of London, that ensured the beginnings of a national architectural archive. All architectural writers and historians tend to spend time in London where they can consult the riches of the NMR at the same time as visiting national libraries and archives. Who will go to Swindon except in direst need? In a faintly ludicrous report prepared by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, Marketing Strategy for the NMR published last year, these highly paid consultants urged all sorts of ways to achieve more 'customers' for the archives. How is this to be achieved when the raw material is isolated in Swindon? Some civil servant has been told to decentralise and save money and no-one seems to have considered the dire effects upon the national capital, which should be the home of all such archives. Mr Heseltine seems to be having a tough time at the moment, but he should realise that the quality of the national environment depends on a re-think of all aspects of 'heritage' affairs. He could do worse that stop the daft plans to decentralise as his first step. It is a pleasure to record that the American architect Robert Venturi has won the Pritzker Prize - the architectural world's equivalent of the Nobel prize. His new wing for London's National Gallery opens in July this year - fortuitously times to coincide with his new recognition as an international laureate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Rayons Instead of Seven"] </F>   [Text] A reorganization of the organs of executive power  is taking place in St. Petersburg. It is aimed at improving the  work of the rayon link and reducing the number of officials in  these structures. The city's administrative division has  changed: Three rayons -- Admiralteyskiy, Kurortnyy, and  Tsentralnyy -- have been organized on the basis of seven rayons.    Work is under way on the formation of the concept of local  self-management. For this a directive from the mayor has formed  a working group consisting of workers from the city hall and  rayon administrations and representatives of the public.</p>

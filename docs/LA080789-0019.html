			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The cost of operating prisons in California is expected to increase, costing $4  billion annually by 1994. That is more than double the current bill, according  to prison officials. In addition, taxpayers can expect to spend $3.5 billion to  build new prisons in the next five years. Corrections Director James Rowland  said that the costs stem from projections that the state will have 136,000  people in prison by 1994, compared to 82,800 locked up now. The state currently  spends about $1.8 billion annually to run its prisons.  </P></p>

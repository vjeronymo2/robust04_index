			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- African National  Congress leader Nelson Mandela said he held talks with President  F W de Klerk on Monday [25 April] morning to discuss tough new  measures to hit back at the people behind the latest upsurge of  bomb blasts.    Mr Mandela said he had also talked to Justice Minister Kobie  Coetsee and Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe. "I was  convinced they want to put an end to the violence."    Speaking at Hillbrow Hospital after visiting some of the  victims of Sunday's Johannesburg blast, Mr Mandela said the  proof of this would be in the implementation. "I am convinced  tough measures if applied can bring these people to book. I  hope what we discussed will be implemented firmly. I hope the  government acts in a way to remove the impression it's a  government of weaklings."    Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's  car bomb explosion in Johannesburg. Twelve explosions in all  have occurred since Saturday, including another massive blast at  a Germiston black taxi rank on Monday morning which killed 10  people and injured 36.    The ANC president said the security forces were doing the  best they could in difficult circumstances and he hoped their  response following his latest talks with the government "will  raise the confidence of the public".    The forces of peace were far stronger than those who wished  to cause violence, he said. "We are one country and one  people... I want you to look to the future with hope and  confidence." People should turn up in large numbers to vote to  show their defiance to those who did not want the elections.    The country's first all-race election begins on Tuesday.    Inside the hospital, Mr Mandela spoke to some of the victims  of the Johannesburg blast including 29-year-old David Maimela,  who told SAPA he was visiting his girlfriend when it occured. "I  think it's very bad. It's not right to try to stop the  elections. This is the first time we are going to vote." Mr  Maimela's one ankle was fractured and his forehead was lacerated  by shrapnel.    Thirty-three-year-old Eric Ngxalose, short-order cook at a  Midtown fast food outlet, was coming to work when the bomb,  estimated to have comprised 70-90kg of explosives, went off. Mr  Ngxalose's leg was injured.    Mr Levy Khumalo, 51, was also hit by shrapnel. A resident of  Jeppe Hostel, he was in town on Sunday morning to visit his  children, who sell clothes in the city centre. Speaking through  a Zulu interpreter, Mr Khumalo told SAPA he was shocked by the  explosion. "I was not expecting that." He told nurses he did  not want to see Mr Mandela, and his bed was curtained off when  the ANC leader arrived.</p>

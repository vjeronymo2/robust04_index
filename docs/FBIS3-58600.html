			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Giorgio Battistini report: "We Against `il Biscione' -- </F> Berlusconi nickname"]    [Text] Rome -- A rectangular table and two concentric  circles. Such are the basic ingredients of the first agreement  that is beginning to take shape among the progressives: A table  to continue the talks which began yesterday in an excellent  climate; two circles -- one of them within the other -- in order  to explain that the aim is to achieve a broad-based political  and electoral majority, as well as a more limited government  majority. Some will be left outside.    Parties, groups, and movements within the progressive camp  are agreed ("Nobody has excluded anybody," an overjoyed  [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta said) on the first  common circle. This will be a majority electoral pact opposed to  the Right and more or less centrist in nature -- including  [Fininvest President Silvio] Berlusconi, just imagine! They  will all be together, therefore -- from AD [Democratic Alliance]  to Communist Renaissance, the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left], the Greens, Rete, and others, too -- on the ballot paper  through which voters will be initially asked to choose the  government political majority only. A single symbol will be  used -- who knows, perhaps a seagull under a logo which, since  it will not be able to refer to "pacts" (Segni) or "forces"  (Berlusconi), may include the term "alliance." Through the  second ballot paper, as is well known, 25 percent of the seats  will be fought for, namely, those that are assigned according to  proportional representation: This is a key test with a view to  assessing and processing residual or emergent party affinities.    Within the abovementioned great electoral circle, a more  restricted area will take shape: that of a center-left  government, including the proposed prime minister, the other  principal ministers, and a united parliamentary group that will  vote together on the basis of the agreed platform. Without  being over-imaginative, we could speak of two separate tables.  However, apart from being something of a stunt, the chosen  formula expresses a real achievement: In order to stem the  advance of the Right and of recycled oldtimers, the entire Left  is gathering under a single electoral umbrella. When it comes  to governing the country, the group of travelers becomes  smaller: In fact, there is no unity among the traditional  left-wing forces; there are huge gaps in the center; and,  predictably, some will say "we cannot follow you," and will  therefore exclude themselves.    A hundred meters away from the Quirinale [president's  palace]  as the crow flies, the European Parliament's Italian offices  (favored by the Greens) witnessed the arrival of 23 people. The  last one to turn up, shortly after 1 PM [1200 GMT], was [PDS  Secretary Achille] Occhetto. "We are right on time and full of  hope, whereas the others are divided, tormented, uncertain, and  cutting each other's throats," he said as he came in. Although  the offices are far from the usual venues for major political  debates, a crowd was gathering, attracted by the presence of  journalists and TV teams. The conclave lasted four hours, with  fitting words being pronounced when the participants finally  emerged. "I will not say this is a historical date, but it  certainly is a great day," Occhetto said on everyone's behalf.  A somewhat inappropriate stage design resulted in the places  being allocated without any sense of electoral hierarchy. Thus  the PDS found itself sitting in front of Cossutta and Magri; the  Greens were at the head of the table, while AD and Gorrieri and  Carniti's Christian-Socialists were far to the right. They had  all skipped lunch, therefore sandwiches and mineral water were  provided; Diego Novelli protested and, as a result, obtained "a  small glass of white wine." In order to give the event  historical significance, [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema passed a  card around, to be signed by participants as proof of their  attendance. Everybody liked the idea. For a few minutes, we  saw a flurry of signing so as to testify: "I was there."    Indeed, the day had some significance. This was apparent  also from the willingness to muffle any differences of opinion  -- which nevertheless do exist -- and from emphasis being  shifted to the upcoming meetings, when [Italian Socialist Party  (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco and the PRI [Italian Republican  Party] will join in (although Socialists and Republicans are  already fairly well represented within AD). Thus an answer has  been given to the agony and uncertainty that, in the form of the  "opposing vetoes," had been dragging on since Christmas. The  progressives have chosen the strategy of two places and two  timescales. "There are forces and political ideas that can be  united in an electoral coalition, but we also have different  political projects which cannot be combined into a government  agreement. We shall see what happens," AD spokesperson  Ferdinando Adornato explained. Cossutta agreed curtly: "Of  course, we shall see." He seemed confident that he could  overcome internal problems. He is aiming for the government,  even though in the end it might possibly be better for him to  opt out of the more restricted political agreement. No doubt,  however, his votes in the north are useful to the progressive  coalition; just like Rete's votes in the south, the Greens'  votes in the great towns; and those of the progressive Catholics  throughout the country. If what we are witnessing is a game  with a lit match, the purpose of which is to see who "dares"  leave the anti-Right front, Cossutta is not one of them. He  informed us that the PDS was joining forces with him, together  with Rete and the Greens. Adornato was claiming instead that  Occhetto proved that AD and the Christian-Socialists were right.  In fact, it was their proposal that was adopted. This is the  correct version, confirmed by Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters].    These are but skirmishes aimed at broadening, through  understandings and affinities, an internal contractual power  which, in the darkness surrounding election forecasts, nobody  can quantify -- skirmishes like those over Del Turco's and the  PRI's expected arrival. [Rete Secretary] Orlando seemed to be  opposed: "We are building a genuinely alternative force to the  old regime. This negotiating table cannot serve the purposes of  anyone's transformism." The Greens are hesitant and divided.  Davide Visani, on the other hand, confirmed the PDS's  "well-reasoned confidence" in Del Turco's attending the next  summit, 10 days from now.</p>

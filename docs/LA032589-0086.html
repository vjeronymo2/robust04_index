			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION BRIEFS: LUTHERAN BISHOP TO BOYCOTT PAPAL MASS  </P> <P> A Norwegian Lutheran bishop has announced that he will not participate in an  ecumenical service to be held in Trondheim's Nidaros Cathedral June 2 during  Pope John Paul II's visit to the country.  </P> <P> Bishop Per Lonning is not boycotting the service because he is opposed to  ecumenism. Quite the opposite, the former member of the Central Committee of  the World Council of Churches says he will stay away to protest what he sees as  the Pope's slowing down of the ecumenism of the 1960s and 1970s.  </P> <P> Lonning is quoted in the Lutheran World Information news service as saying,  "What I do is not a protest against, but together with, my Catholic brothers  and sisters whom I have learned to know and appreciate during my years in  ecumenical work."  </P> <P> The Lutheran bishop added, "I know I have a considerable number of Catholic  friends with me in this."  </P></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Born-again Magma branches out - The US copper producer has bright prospects Only a few years ago Magma Copper, the second-largest US producer, was unloved and unwanted - spun-off to fend for itself by an uncaring parent, Newmont Mining. 'Our future was uncertain,' recalls Mr Burgess Winter, president. 'There were those who doubted whether we could survive.' Magma, however, has joined that happy band known as the Lazarus corporations, brought back from the dead by a new management team. And to confirm it is no zombie, it made two landmark moves in the space of a few days. First, it won the auction for Tintaya, Peru's second-largest copper producer, with a bid worth USDollars 250m. The deal, completed at the end of November, takes Magma outside the US for the first time. It also announced it had final permission for its Dollars 300m Robinson project, and immediately started construction of what is expected to be a world-class, copper-gold mine near Ely, Nevada. 'These two events are of significant strategic importance for Magma,' says Mr Winter. His management team set itself a strategic target of having by the end of 1996 some 10bn lbs of recoverable copper in Magma's reserves, and to be producing 750m lbs of copper from its own mines at a net operating cost of less than 50 cents a lb. With Tintaya and Robinson in the bag, 'these targets are definitely achievable,' he says. 'They also give us a strong start towards our goal for the year 2000: production of 1bn lbs a year.' Magma has come a long way since 1987 when it was spun off by Newmont. At that time, it was the highest-cost copper producer in the US, loaded with debt, and it had only limited ore reserves. Some of its troubles stemmed from an amazingly generous labour contract involving an ill-conceived bonus scheme that linked payments to copper's market price. The scheme generated bonuses of up to Dollars 5.50 an hour, and ate up nearly all Magma's profits - some Dollars 55m  - between 1987 and 1988m. It had to borrow high-interest money to cope. Mr Winter was recruited and, with a new management team, he launched a survival strategy that required a complete change of culture. It demanded a new approach to labour relations, increased productivity, cost cuts and a re-focusing on the core business of producing copper profitably. Those core operations were its three mines in Arizona: San Manuel, Pinto Valley and Superior, plus the San Manuel smelter. San Manuel underwent a Dollars 250m modernisation, completed in 1989, and a subsequent Dollars 100m expansion. It is now said to be the lowest-cost and most environmentally sound smelter in North America. Costs at the Arizona operations have been substantially reduced: net operating cash costs are down from 78 cents a lb to 58 cents, and are forecast to fall to 50 cents by the end of 1996. Productivity at the mines is up 86 per cent since 1988, and copper production has been lifted from 274m lbs to 600m. This has been partly achieved through improved employee relations that culminated in 1991 with an historic 15-year labour contract. The agreement allows costs to be strictly controlled, and eliminates the possibility of strikes or lock-outs for seven years. It also provided the key to the development of a new ore body, called Kalamazoo, at the San Manuel underground mine, where reserves were due to run out in 1997. Kalamazoo will cost Dollars 140m and will extend the mine life at least until 2009. It is expected to start up in late 1996, producing 200m lbs of copper a year. Development of the Robinson ore body in Nevada was supposed to dovetail with the second expansion of the San Manuel smelter, which took its annual capacity to 720m lbs. However, permission problems delayed Robinson. This has not harmed Magma, which has been able to sell all the extra smelting capacity. Magma is the only US producer to do any significant volume of custom smelting on a regular basis. Mr Winter says it is a good business and one the group intends to nurture. On October 11, Magma received the final permit and started construction immediately. Production from Robinson is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 1996 at an annual rate of 135m lbs, with projected net cash operating costs of less than 50 cents a lb. The present mine life is 16 years, but Mr Winter insists 'there is excellent exploration potential that could extend the current mine life'. Although Magma is not short of cash, and gearing is a modest 36 per cent compared with nearly 60 per cent in 1988, it initiated a copper price protection scheme for 1995, when spending peaks. This guarantees a minimum realised price of 84 cents a lb for most of its projected output. The programme consists mostly of put options, which allow the company to get some benefits if the price is above 84 cents. Mr Doug Purdom, chief financial officer, says the cost was 'modest,' and 'the price protection scheme makes sure we can get Robinson into operation whatever happens to the copper price'. Magma first showed its interest in moving outside the US when it bid for 51 per cent of the El Abra copper mine in Chile, in partnership with Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia. However, their bid of Dollars 240m was well below the Dollars 330m eventually paid by US rival Cyprus Amax. Magma bid Dollars 218m for Tintaya at an auction in Peru, where the government is privatising many of its mining assets. This was only Dollars 4m more than the next closest bidder, Metall Mining of Canada, and, to Mr Winter's delight, only Dollars 27m more than RTZ of the UK, which has a reputation for driving hard bargains. The total cost of acquiring Tintaya will be Dollars 250m, as Magma must also provide Dollars 55m of Peruvian debt at face value (but the discounted cost of this debt is Dollars 30m to Dollars 35m.) Tintaya, located at an altitude of 4,100 metres in the mountains near Yauri in southern Peru, has been in operation since 1985 and will generate cashflow for Magma from the outset. At present, it produces 111m lbs of copper a year at a net cash operating cost of 60 cents a lb. By increasing the output to 135m lbs, and introducing new equipment to replace Russian trucks, productivity should improve and Magma expects to cut costs to 55 cents. Magma has guaranteed it will spend Dollars 85m to improve Tintaya, and it should have no difficulty fulfilling this promise, particularly if a scheme to produce copper by the so-called solvent-extraction, electro-winning process, proves viable. Tintaya has reported losses every year since it started up, but Mr Purdom blames this on the debt that the government has burdened it with. In 1993, and so far in 1994, the mine has generated a big flow of cash. Nevertheless, Magma hopes to raise about Dollars 100m of debt in Peru some time next year to reduce its equity risk. 'Also, we need a bit more cash than we can generate from cashflow for things we want to do,' he says. Mr Winter says Magma will work hard on improving productivity at the mine, and that will mean sacking some of the present 780 employees. However, he insists efficiency is low mainly because of the calibre of the mining equipment. Meanwhile, says Mr Winter, Magma is still looking for longer-term projects in Mexico and Chile, as well as Peru.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: No time to jump ship The project for European integration has ground to a halt. That is the sober view we must take of the impasse on the Maastricht treaty. No one regrets this state of affairs more than Daimler-Benz, a German company with up to one-fifth of its turnover in fellow European Community states. We, along with 340m fellow Europeans, were looking forward to the creation of a single, tariff-free European market on January 1 1993. But now, less then three months before that historic date, one of the decisive conditions for a prosperous economic area - the creation of a single European currency - is on the verge of failure. These and other pan-European aims are now in danger of drowning in a sea of Euro-pessimism. For Daimler-Benz, the economic integration of nations in Europe has always been the best guarantor of peace. Yet are the destructive effects of Black Wednesday, when the UK was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, to be allowed to render obsolete long-standing enthusiasm for European integration? Admit-tedly the Danes' rejection of Maastricht and France's grudging support for it are a signal that their ideal of a single Europe is not the one to be found in the Maastricht treaty. Throughout Europe, the treaty's shortcomings, which politicians have ignored for so long, are being brought to the surface. The result is that jumping off the Euro-train is beginning to sound increasingly plausible. But this should be resisted. The only alternative is a futile go-it-alone policy among individual nations. Those who criticise the ERM, for instance, seem to ignore the fact that for 12 years before Black Wednesday the ERM rewarded its members with stable exchange rates, resulting in economic convergence and lower inflation. The fact that the ERM partially foundered on September 16 is not to be laid at the door of the mechanism itself. The onerous financial costs of German unification, for instance, placed enormous strain on the ERM. In any event, co-ordinated exchange rates can only work if they are adapted to economic realities. The temporary withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the ERM has dealt European integration a massive blow. And yet UK Prime Minister John Major's stated intention of installing Britain at the heart of Europe has long since become economic reality; 60 per cent of UK foreign trade takes place within the EC. Daimler-Benz employs about 2,000 people in the UK. Annual turnover totals DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.28bn). Daimler-Benz shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange - the most international of all stock exchanges. Against this backdrop, tension between European partners does not shake our resolve. The way we see it, we have long since become a partner to the British economy. There is no better illustration of this than the co-operation between Daimler-Benz and BAe in the Airbus consortium. But more important for Europe than sterling's re-entry into the ERM is to have Britain as a political ally in the drive towards European unity. Many Britons still regard Europe as uncharted political territory. But with their self-confidence as a former global power, the British are a model for the continent. Many self-appointed Euro-strategists have a lot to learn from the British view that Europe must play its part in international crisis management. British advocacy of the principle of subsidiarity must remain a count-erweight to the centralising magnet of the Brussels bur-eaucracy. The other 11 EC members could have saved themselves several disappointments if they had debated the repercussions of monetary and political convergence with the same vehemence as did the British. Their naive visions of harmony have been rudely shattered. It would be fatal to attempt to overcome momentary weakness by a wait-and-see policy, just as fatal as the sceptics' proposal to use the European crisis as a reason to abandon ship. A 'little Europe on the Rhine', in which half a dozen EC members hare off alone, would be the worst option, for the stability of this inner core would be gained at the expense of those who remain outside. The UK, current holder of the European presidency, faces a task of historic proportions. The irrational flight from shared responsibility has to be stopped by offering constructive reform proposals. Whitehall has shown that faded illusions can only be replaced by concepts of realistic substance. It is in this spirit that the EC partners must work to develop their blueprint. Now is the time to shape the future if we are to win the day. Otherwise we shall have to admit defeat. The author is chairman of Daimler-Benz.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Observer: Fit for action Watch out David Lloyd, the fading tennis star who has built a Pounds 100m leisure centre business: the Beckwith boys are back in business. Old Harrovians Peter and John Beckwith, who made an estimated Pounds 80m by selling their property empire to the Swedes at the top of the market, have decided to reinvest some of their fortune in leisure. They have bought back the upmarket Riverside Racquet Centre (annual fee over Pounds 1,000 and a waiting list of six months) plus a couple of health clubs in the City from the Swedish owners to whom they sold them. They plan to develop a large leisure group to take advantage of the upturn in the economy. No word on the price, but the business is thought to be making Pounds 1.2m a year and seems amazingly recession-proof. Indeed, chief executive David Haslam, who does the talking for the Beckwiths, says one of his members had his house repossessed but refused to give up his Riverside membership. Just the sort of tale one might expect from a property developer.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Business and The Law: Ruling on single shipping action in two courts - The European Court Last week, the European Court of Justice gave a ruling in response to several questions, referred to it by the English Court of Appeal, regarding jurisdiction in shipping cases under the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments where the same action is pending before two different courts. The questions arose in the context of actions concerning a cargo of soya bean oil, which the owners complained was contaminated on the vessel Tatry en route from Brazil to Rotterdam and Hamburg. Actions were brought by the shipowners and cargo owners at different times in UK and Dutch courts. In November 1988 the shipowners brought an action in the Rotterdam district court against two of three groups of cargo owners seeking a declaration that they were not liable. In September 1989 the shipowners initiated separate but similar proceedings against the third group in Rotterdam. Finally, in October 1990 they initiated proceedings in the Netherlands seeking to limit their liability in respect of the entire cargo under the 1957 International Convention on limitation of shipowner liability. Two actions to arrest one of the shipowners' vessels were brought in Liverpool by two of the cargo owner groups, but writs were not issued until September 1989. The shipowners secured release of their vessel by providing a guarantee. The action continued under English law, where doubts exist whether such proceedings continue only against the ship (in rem) or both against the ship and against the shipowners for damages (in personam). The English Admiralty Court acted under the 1981 Supreme Court Act which implements the 1952 Brussels Arrest Convention. Later precautionary actions were brought by the two cargo owner groups in the Netherlands. The third group only brought an action for damages in September 1989 in the Netherlands. The Admiralty Court refused to decline jurisdiction under the rules governing situations where the same action is pending in different courts. It said the previous Dutch proceedings did not involve the same cause of action, since damages were sought in the English proceedings. The earlier Dutch proceedings merely sought a declaration that the cargo owners were not entitled to claim damages from the shipowners. Moreover, one of the cargo owners was not a party to the Dutch proceedings. The Admiralty Court accepted that the two proceedings were related actions, but found it inappropriate to decline jurisdiction. The ECJ ruled first that a specialised convention, such as the 1952 Arrest Convention, precluded the application of the Brussels Jurisdiction Convention only in cases governed by the specialised convention. When it contained no provision as to what should happen when the same cause of action was pending in separate courts, the Brussels Convention applied. The Court said an action seeking to have the defendant held liable for damages had the same cause of action and the same object as earlier proceedings brought by the defendant seeking a decla-ration that he was not liable for damages. Distinctions in English law between actions in rem and in personam were irrelevant to the interpretation of the convention. Where two courts claimed jurisdiction over a similar action, the second national court to consider the case should decline jurisdiction in favour of the first court. When not all the parties are the same, it should decline jurisdiction only to the extent the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the earlier action. The second action could continue between the other parties. However, the ECJ ruled that in this context the two actions will be related actions involving the risk of conflicting decisions. It said the risk of conflicting decisions would arise when two separate groups of actions for damages were brought by different cargo owners in two different national courts against the same shipowner under separate but identical contracts.

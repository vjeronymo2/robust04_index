			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Nazzal, representative of the </F> Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Amman, by correspondent  Sana' al-Imam in Damascus; from the "The Event" program; date  not given--recorded]    [Text] [Nazzal] From the beginning, our strategy took  into consideration our particular circumstances, as well as  objective considerations. We did not build our strategy on  others' positions. Therefore, there has not been any change to  Hamas' strategy of keeping up the struggle and resistance to  occupation.    [Al-Imam] How fair would it be to say that your opposition  to the PLO leadership overrides your opposition to a political  settlement?    [Nazzal] Our objection to the ongoing political process was  not prompted by our opposition to the PLO. Our differences with  the PLO and its leadership are not personal. Our differences  are about the approach. We are against the political  settlement, given that it is not the right option for our people  and that it will lead to the liquidation of our Palestinian case.    [Al-Imam] How do you assess the recent alliance struck  between Hamas and other Palestinian factions that do not share  your negative view of the peace project and the principle of  peace with Israel?    [Nazzal] The meeting points between the constituent factions  of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces may be summed up as  follows: We are opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord, which we  will seek to topple with all possible means. Thus, we have  transcended our political differences and concentrated on our  common denominators.    [Al-Imam] Looking ahead, what do you plan to do next?    [Nazzal] For us, the Gaza-Jericho accord was stillborn, and  carries the seeds of its demise. The agreement will not  survive. We are counting on the political maturity of our  Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic masses. Over time, they will  discover that the PLO leadership has made unrealizable promises  that will turn out to be a mirage which will not satisfy any  thirst. Thirdly, [number as heard] we bet on the resistance  option. Hamas, along with the rest of the decent and dedicated  Palestinians, will carry on resistance to occupation and give it  no security or stability. These are the bets for our cause's  foreseeable future.    [Al-Imam] Brother Muhammad: In the event of a change in the  region's political landscape, and a number of Arab countries  invovled in the peace process concluding deals with Israel, how  will Hamas react?    [Nazzal] We hate to reach the point where other Arab states  will sign agreements with Israel. Assuming this did happen,  Hamas would still stick to its strategic option of resistance to  occupation and dealing it painful blows. This is our strategy  and is not subject to change.</p>

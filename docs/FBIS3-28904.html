President Li Teng-hui left Indonesia for an undisclosed  destination aboard China Airlines Flight No. B-106. It is not  yet known whether he will return home or stop in another ASEAN  country.    Reports from Denpasar say that Li Teng-hui and the members  of  his delegation -- estimated at 35, including a number of  ministers -- stayed at the Bali Clear Resort near the Nusa Dua  tourist resort.    There have been no official statements on the Taiwan  president's activities during his stay in Bali because his visit  was merely a vacation. In addition, Indonesia has no diplomatic  relations with Taiwan; it follows a one-China policy.</p>

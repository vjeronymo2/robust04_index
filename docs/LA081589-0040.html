			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALLENBERG'S KIN INVITED TO MEETING IN MOSCOW  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has invited relatives of the disappeared Swedish diplomat  Raoul Wallenberg to Moscow amid signs it may at last be prepared to clear up  the fate of the man credited with saving tens of thousands of Jews during World  War II.  </P> <P> The invitation was handed to the Raoul Wallenberg Assn. in Stockholm last week  by Soviet Ambassador Boris Pankin, association chairman Per Anger said Monday.  </P> <P> Anger, who was serving with Wallenberg in the Swedish Embassy in Budapest when  he disappeared in 1945, said he would travel to Moscow in October together with  Wallenberg's half-sister, Nina Lagergren, and half-brother, Guy von Dardel, and  association secretary Sonja Sonnenfeld.  </P> <P> Sonnenfeld said it is the first time anybody connected with Wallenberg had been  invited to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "It's a breakthrough. It's clear they want to talk with us, and we were told  the meetings would be at a high level," she said.  </P> <P> Wallenberg was last seen in public on Jan. 17, 1945, being driven to see the  commander of the Soviet troops occupying Budapest after the Nazi retreat.  </P> <P> In 1957, then-Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko said in a  diplomatic note to Sweden that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack in a  Moscow prison 10 years earlier.  </P> <P> But frequent accounts by former inmates of the Soviet Union's vast prison and  labor camp system suggested that he was alive well into the 1970s. He would be  76 if he were still alive today.  </P> <P> Wallenberg has been hailed as one of the great heroes of the struggle to save  Jews from Nazi extermination.  </P> <P> Using his Swedish diplomatic status to move around, he took at least 20,000  Hungarian Jews under his personal protection, commandeering abandoned buildings  and handing out special Swedish passports ensuring immunity from Nazi  deportation.  </P> <P> In the 1957 note, which has served as the basis for all further Soviet  statements on the subject, Gromyko regretted Wallenberg's arrest and  imprisonment and blamed Stalin era officials who were later executed.  </P> <P> Sweden did not accept the Soviet explanation and has kept an open file on  Wallenberg ever since.  </P></p>

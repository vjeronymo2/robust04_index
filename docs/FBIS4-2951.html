			<p>BFN     [Text] Gansu provincial party committee secretary Yan  Haiwang addressed a provincial forum on family planning  yesterday, stressing that it is necessary to view family  planning as a matter concerning the implementation of social and  economic strategy. We must not waver, but be determined and not  slack off in our work, and we must make sure that the set target  for population control is fulfilled, he said.    This forum, called by the provincial party committee and  government during a break amid the provincial people's congress  session, is for the purpose of urging local authorities to take  effective measures to do a good, solid job in family planning  work while concentrating on economic construction. During the  forum, the provincial party committee and government commended  and presented awards to the 14 prefectures, autonomous  prefectures, and cities that comprehensively fulfilled last  year's population control plan. A written pledge on management  by objective regarding population control for the year 1994 was  signed by the 14 prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities.    After the signing ceremony, acting Governor Zhang Wule  addressed the forum, urging all localities to make family  planning work more scientific. To this end they need to focus  attention on five tasks: First, it is necessary to improve the  family planning operational mechanism on a scientific management  basis. Second, it is necessary to intensify working organs at  the township and village levels. In the process of opening up  and reform, family planning organizations must not be abolished  or merged, neither must the size of staff be reduced. Third, it  is necessary to launch a drive in a planned way to select a few  six-good [liu hao] villages. Fourth, it is necessary to  comprehensively implement procedures for performance of family  planning management contracts and rigidly to curb the practice  of bearing extra children in violation of discipline. And  fifth, it is necessary to continue to invest more to increase  the reward for family planning executive personnel, and properly  solve the issue of remuneration for and recruitment of family  planning executive personnel in rural areas.    Having reviewed the situation in population in our province,  provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang said: Each  year our province sees a net population increase of 300,000 or  more, equivalent to the population of a medium-sized county.  However, our province's arable land is decreasing by the area  of a medium-sized county each year. The gap derived from this  increase and decrease makes the contrast still sharper between  excessive population and scarce land. Therefore we must always  treat family planning as one of the tasks of top priority and  devote great efforts to it.    Provincial leaders also present at yesterday's forum were  Sun  Ying, Li Zuling, Song Zhaolong, Pu Junhe, Chen Qiling, Ying  Zhongyi, and Lao Chongzhi. Some comrades from the provincial  family planning sector attended the forum.</p>

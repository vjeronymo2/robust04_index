			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with V.P. Mezhak, chairman of the Popular Party </F> of the Crimea, by V. Danilov; place and date not given:  "`Rossiya' Block Is True to Its Goals"]    [Text] [Danilov] Many readers of our newspaper wonder if  the "Rossiya" [Russia] bloc remains true to its basic principles  proclaimed during the presidential campaign of Yuriy Meshkov?  Did this program undergo any changes?    [Mezhak] Let me put it straight, we are not going to back  out  of a single provision of our program that was adopted at a  meeting of the bloc's Coordinating Council on 25 February.    Our prime goals include the emergence and development of the  Crimean Republic as an independent and law-abiding democratic  state, overcoming the economic crisis, and creating conditions  for a worthy life for Crimean residents, whose interests and  rights we are going to uphold consistently. The "Rossiya" bloc  still considers calling a referendum on the Republic's status a  precondition for establishing the Crimean statehood. Its  favorable outcome would lay firm the political and legal  foundation for our state independence, which will enable us to  conclude political and economic agreements with CIS states.    The bloc's ultimate goal is to reestablish unity with Russia  and other CIS countries and, at the initial stage, form an  economic, political, and military union, with its consequent  transformation into a confederation or federal state.    [Danilov] According to a decision recently adopted by the  Ukrainian Supreme Council, the Crimean Republic has no right to  its own citizenship, its financial and monetary systems, and  other trappings of statehood. Where would you see a way out of  the legal "maze" of Ukrainian-Crimean relations?    [Mezhak] First, the above decision by the Ukrainian Supreme  Council is obviously overdue, since the Crimea already has its  own banking and systems. It also established its own Crimean  bank, and it was a result of the official negotiations with Kiev  on power sharing. The Crimean citizenship issue has as strong a  legal base. So, the Ukrainian Supreme Council's other statement  about unconformity of the Crimean legislation with the Ukrainian  one is largely a propagandist move.    Second, it is no secret today that policy based on  administrative restrictions and forcible measures is doomed to  failure. Processes similar to the Crimean are under way in  other Ukrainian regions. People striving for integration and  unity cannot be repressed by directives from above. In his  recent television appearance in the peninsula, Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov stressed that the following passage of the  question that will be put to a referendum should bear the main  emphasis: "...in a union with other CIS states." Ukraine is  certainly among those states, so it would not be serious to call  us separatists.    [Danilov] What kind of Crimean statehood, which we are just  beginning to build, do you envision?    [Mezhak] One should provide all necessary conditions for the  smooth operation of a multiparty system in the Crimea. The  "Rossiya" bloc stands for the representative democracy allowing  all social forces to actually participate in managing the state.  We want to see the Crimean president as head of the state, and  the executive branch head elected by and accountable to the  Crimean Supreme Soviet. However, the best solution at this  stage of the Crimean independence would be to have the president  serve as head of state, which would guarantee observance of the  Crimean Constitution, and at the same time be the head of the  executive branch. One should ensure representative power for  local governments, too.    Finally, the "Rossiya" bloc considers Sevastopol an  inalienable part of the Crimea and will seek to establish  government bodies in the city based on the Crimean legislation.    [Danilov] At present, all political parties and figures  speak  a lot about human rights. But talking, as everyone knows, does  not necessarily mean doing. What steps does the "Rossiya" bloc  plan to undertake in this sphere?    [Mezhak] Our priority is to provide legislative support for  the right of Crimean residents to dual citizenship; first  citizenship would be Crimean, and the second depending on their  choice.    Another issue playing an important role in our program is  the  judicial reform providing for electiveness and independence of  judges from the power elite, the jury, expansion of legal  powers, the right of local courts to revoke decisions of local  executive institutions.    It is obvious that there can be no talk about human rights  until we smash crime that has spread on an unheard-of scale.  For this purpose, one should improve the material conditions of  the public order forces.    [Danilov] What are the main provisions of the bloc's  economic program?    [Mezhak] Recognition of the open-type economy matched with  certain protectionist policies of the state with regard to  Crimean manufacturers. Privatization of production means,  transfer of property to private manufacturers with the  preservation of a substantial part of the state sector. At the  same time, the state would dominate industries of nationwide  importance or enterprises losing money in the market conditions.  One needs to conduct agricultural reform, demonopolize  production, and pass a law on competition.    Encouraging production should serve as the basic principle  of  the taxation system.    A special place in our economic program was given to the  economic sovereignty of the Crimea, which means its thorough  financial independence (drafting the budget, setting taxes,  managing credits and payments, etc.), independent economic  policies giving the peninsula a free hand in establishing  priorities in foreign economic links. A system of investment  privileges needs to be guaranteed by the state to attract  foreign capital to the Crimea.    According to our concept, a broad social base for  privatization should be ensured by personal accounts [imennoy  shchet] or securities, including those on land, considering the  interests of working teams.    [Danilov] Can we say that the implementation of your bloc's  economic program began after Yuriy Meshkov was elected president?    [Mezhak] Nomination of the prominent Russian economist,  Yevgeniy Saburov, testifies to the fact that the Crimean  president and the "Rossiya" bloc keep the word they gave to  Crimean residents during the presidential campaign. However,  our government must find a firm foundation in the peninsula's  legislative power so it can work undeterred. This is why the  "Rossiya" bloc attaches such great importance to the upcoming  elections to the Crimean legislature.    [Danilov] What would you name as the core of your program's  social policies?    [Mezhak] The main principle of our social policy is  supporting a specific individual instead of whole groups. The  state is supposed to help those who are not in a position to  make a living through their own work, and to create necessary  conditions for those who can achieve good results in working for  the public good. The state must guarantee its citizens free  health care to the previous extent, and finance science and  education.    According to our program, Crimeans will get the chance to  receive an education at Russian higher education institutions as  a result of relevant agreements with the Russian Federation.    In the sphere of ethnic relations, we will seek to  strengthen  a multinational state on the Crimean peninsula, whose citizens  will enjoy equal rights and opportunities regardless of their  nationality and creed.</p>

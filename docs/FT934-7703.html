			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (24): Loss-maker is given a new parent - Anshan rescues Shenyang Steel JUST inside the entrance to the Shenyang Steel Sheet Works, a banner congratulates employees on their becoming members of the Anshan Steel family, which benevolently adopted a company that has consistently lost money for the past decade. Shenyang Steel is typical of northern China's ailing manufacturers, slipping far behind the competition on quality but too poor to overhaul equipment installed in the 1950s and, in this case, unable even to buy raw materials. The factory last year officially lost Yn12.66m, though the actual loss was double that amount, according to one manager. It has about Yn100m in outstanding loans from banks, 4,000 mostly idle workers and a potential output of 100,000 tonnes of steel, though last year it produced only 18,000 tonnes. 'We produced only for 75 days last year because we didn't have enough materials,' explains Mr Lu Zihe, head of Shenyang Steel's business department. 'We had no option but to be taken over by a company like Anshan. We have been trying to find a partner since 1991.' Mergers and takeovers are encouraged as an alternative to bankruptcy, still a touchy issue in Shenyang. In 1987, the city announced that an explosive materials factory had failed, but the resulting controversy surprised local officials and the city has not had another bankruptcy since then. The idea of state-approved takeovers is that the stronger partner, Anshan, the largest steel producer in northern China, will reform the management of the company and replace the outdated equipment. But, in the four months since agreement was reached, Anshan has not changed the senior management and the factory is still working well below capacity. One cause of Shenyang Steel's woes was the government's decision to remove subsidies from material prices, which rose to levels that the company could not afford. As Mr Lu put it, before 1992, 'the state provided materials for us, but from last year the state stopped providing those materials,' speeding its collapse. 'We are determined to learn advanced management skills from Anshan,' Mr Lu says. But the managers at Shenyang do not expect that Anshan will want to control the company, and emphasise that they will be able to trade themselves out of trouble, given a continuing flow of money from Anshan. Another worker at the factory insisted that the 'state still owns the factory,' even though Shenyang Steel has signed a contract making it responsible for profits and losses: 'This is not like the system in the west  -this is a socialist country and the state remains responsible for the assets and the workers.' His comments indicate the difficulty faced by the government in handling workers facing dismissal at loss-making companies. The arrival of Anshan is seen by workers as the state acting, in another form, to ensure that Shenyang Steel continues to operate regardless of its lack of profitability. Mr Lu said his company is trying a few new tactics in the quest for profits. It is attempting to find a market for the waste steel materials rusting outside the main workshop, and is about to open a hotel, a popular but not necessarily profitable diversification by Chinese manufacturers. 'We are doing our best to avoid cutting the staff. We have changed the working system by putting employees into smaller units and we plan to open service businesses,' says Mr Lu. 'In the past, the government assigned people to the factory and we are still responsible for looking after them. We run a kindergarten and perform other government functions, so we should get help.'</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLARK SAYS NO THANKS TO PADRES' LATEST OFFER  </P> <P> First baseman Jack Clark rejected the Padres' latest contract offer Saturday,  and unless there's a radical change in negotiations, it appears highly unlikely  that Clark will return to the Padres for the 1991 season.  </P> <P> The Padres, after being informed that Clark will be one of 16 players eligible  for second-look free agency because of the Collusion III ruling, offered Clark  a one-year guaranteed contract for $2.5 million if he agrees to waive his right  to free agency.  </P> <P> Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, said he is awaiting a response from Clark  and agent Tom Reich. But when reached Saturday night at his home in Danville,  Calif., Clark said the offer won't even be considered.  </P> <P> "They've got no chance at all on that one," Clark said. "Why would I sign that?  I wouldn't give up my right to free agency to sign a one-year deal."  </P> <P> Although the Padres could still enhance their proposal, McIlvaine insisted  Saturday that they will not offer Clark a multi-year contract.  </P> <P> And Clark said that unless the Padres offer him at least a two-year contract,  or considerably raise their one-year offer, he'll likely play elsewhere.  </P> <P> "I'm not expecting every team to knock my door down," said Clark, who earned $2  million in 1990, "but I'm sure I'll get my share of offers."  </P> <P> This is the Padres' second offer to Clark since August. Previously, they  offered him $2.5 million, but according to Clark, the contract was not fully  guaranteed. The original offer, Clark said, was for $2.1 million in base salary  and $400,000 in incentives for games played.  </P> <P> "That one wasn't even an offer," said Clark, who batted .266, with 25 homers  and 62 runs batted in last season. "At least this one showed me something. To  me, this is really their first offer."  </P> <P> When McIlvaine was asked why he wouldn't offer Clark, 35, a multi-year  contract, he said: "After what happened with the team last year, I don't want  to take that risk. I don't know whether he was part of the problem or not, but  I'll survey the situation this year."  </P> <P> If Clark does not return to the Padres, McIlvaine said Jerald Clark likely will  inherit the first-base job. Clark, 27, batted .267 with five homers in 101  at-bats, and went five for 12 with three homers and seven RBIs in the final  three games of the season.  </P> <P> In fact, McIlvaine, who spent this week evaluating the Padres in their  organizational meetings, said the club probably will not dip into the  high-priced free-agent market. Instead, they will attempt to strengthen the  team through trades and the development of their minor league system.  </P> <P> The Padres, in order of need, McIlvaine said, will attempt to acquire a  right-handed bullpen stopper to complement lefty Craig Lefferts; find a fifth  starter; rectify the left side of the infield, and come up with a center  fielder.  </P> <P>  -- Right-handed reliever: "There's really not a whole lot out there on the  free agent market," McIlvaine said, "and I'm not going to pay a guy like Buddy  Black $10 million for four years. We'll probably have to trade a lefty (a group  which includes Derek Lilliquist, Atlee Hammaker and Rich Rodriguez) to get a  veteran righty."  </P> <P>  -- Fifth starter: If the Padres do not acquire a fifth starter, the job will  go to either Lilliquist, Hammaker, Schiraldi or possibly free agent Dennis  Rasmussen.  </P> <P>  -- Shortstop and third base: McIlvaine has abandoned plans to move second  baseman Roberto Alomar to shortstop. He is expected to trade for a shortstop,  with candidates including the Mets' Kevin Elster and the Giants' Jose Uribe.  Roberts likely could be the starter at third, but McIlvaine said Eddie Williams  will be given another shot, and the Padres will continue to look outside for a  possible trade.  </P> <P>  -- Center field: The Padres have decided that Joe Carter will be moved  permanently to left field, and Tony Gwynn will stay in right. McIlvaine said  the Padres will choose a starting center fielder from among Shawn Abner, Darrin  Jackson and Thomas Howard.  </P></p>

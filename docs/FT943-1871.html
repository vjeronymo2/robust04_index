			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Ruling on Fayeds gives comfort to investigators In rejecting the Fayed brothers' contention that the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report into the 1985 takeover of House of Fraser violated their human rights, the Strasbourg Human Rights Court has provided a much needed crumb of comfort to the UK's system of company investigations. Earlier this week, the European Commission of Human Rights cast a shadow over company investigations by ruling that Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman jailed for theft and false accounting after the company's 1986 takeover of Distillers, was denied a fair trial. The commission said the use at his 1989 trial of answers given by Mr Saunders under compulsion to DTI inspectors breached the European Convention on Human Rights. If the full European Court of Human Rights eventually upholds the commission's findings, the UK government may be forced to rethink DTI investigations. But yesterday the Strasbourg judges gave the company investigation procedure a clean bill of health. The Fayed brothers told the court in March there was no doubt that the central conclusion of the DTI inspectors' report was that they were guilty of dishonest misrepresentation. The inspectors said the three brothers had misrepresented their origins, wealth, business interests and resources to the trade and industry secretary, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the House of Fraser board and shareholders and their own advisers prior to the takeover; and that during the investigation they had knowingly submitted false evidence to the inspectors. The Fayeds had always disputed these conclusions. They said that in the eyes of the world, the report, which had been published by the government, had the force of a judgment delivered after a lengthy trial at which they had been convicted - except there had been no trial and criminal charges had never been brought. The government had even decided not to seek to have them disqualified as company directors. They told the court that their right to a good reputation had been drastically interfered with. The procedures governing DTI company investigations afforded no safeguards for the rights of those under investigation and they had no effective remedy against publication of a condemnatory report and the damage it caused. In short, they submitted, the denial of effective access to a domestic court to defend their right to honour and reputation, and the denial of effective domestic remedies to challenge the DTI inspectors' findings, amounted to a breach of the convention. The judges rejected the government's preliminary objection that the Fayeds had failed to exhaust their domestic remedies. But they unanimously decided there had been no violation of the Fayeds' human rights. The court said it was satisfied the functions performed by the inspectors were essentially investigative. The inspectors did not adjudicate. It could not therefore be said the inspectors' inquiry had 'determined' the Fayeds' right to a good reputation or had a decisive bearing on that right. The right of access to a court to protect a civil right, guaranteed by the convention, was not absolute, the judges said. It was subject to implied limitations, which national authorities had a certain 'margin of appreciation' in imposing, provided those limitations did not impair the essence of the right, pursued a legitimate aim and were proportionate to the achievement of that aim. The judges said the underlying aim of the Companies Act investigation system was the furtherance of the public interest in ensuring the proper conduct of the affairs of public companies. The freedom of reporting enjoyed by DTI inspectors as a result of being protected by privilege was also in the public interest. While the freedom to report was broad there were considerable safeguards built into the procedure to ensure it was fair and that its findings were reliable. Had it not been both fair and reliable the Fayeds would have had the remedy of bringing a judicial review against the secretary of state or the inspectors. But it was clear the Fayeds were informed of the information required from them and were given every opportunity to respond to the allegations against them and provide evidence. The limits of acceptable criticism were wider for businessmen actively involved in the affairs of large public companies than for private individuals. The risk of some damage to reputation which could not be compensated was inevitable if independent investigations were to have the necessary freedom to report without fear, not only to the authorities but also, in the final resort, to the public.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Special  Economic Zone (SEZ) in East China's Fujian Province, which is  opposite to Taiwan Island, is expected to become China's second  city to have legislative rights.    In a draft decision, the country's top legislature will  empower the people's congress and its Standing Committee of  Xiamen the rights to formulate laws and regulations, and the  city government to issue government decrees for the zone.    The first city was the Shenzhen SEZ in Guangdong Province,  which borders Hong Kong.    A 4-day session of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress (NPC), which starts on March 2, will  deliberate the draft decision, said Zhou Chengkui, spokesman for  the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee.    Zhou said the move is "necessary for the development of the  Xiamen SEZ."    Xiamen was one of the earliest established special economic  zones and has become one of the country's "vanguards" in  developing economic ties with Taiwan and foreign countries.    The draft decision will be submitted to the second plenary  session of the Eighth NPC, which is due on March 10 for further  deliberation.    The spokesman said the session will continue to deliberate  the draft supplementary regulation on punishing the crimes of  illegal border crossing and emigration, and a draft law on the  protection of investments of Taiwan residents.    They were preliminarily discussed in the previous session.    The legislators will also review the draft labor law. "The  labor law is supposed to protect the legal rights of working  people, to build up and maintain the `harmonious ties' between  employers and employees, and thus is conducive to the reform of  the country's labor system in line with the establishment of the  socialist market economy," Zhou added.    The lawmakers will also make preparations for the Eighth  NPC's second plenary session, such as the deliberating of its  draft agenda and draft name lists of its presidium, secretary  general and nonvoting delegates.</p>

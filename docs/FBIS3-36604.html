Seiran Oganian said Azerbaijan lost a large amount of  weapons  including one aircraft, more than 60 units of armor (36 of them  tanks), 12 artillery pieces and three rocket launchers and a  large amount of other weaponry. He said as many as 36 Azeri  troops were taken prisoner, some of them mercenaries from other  countries.    The official put the Karabakh army's losses over the same  period at some 300 dead. He said that Armenian forces had also  lost 25 units of armor but these were replenished at the cost of  tanks and army vehicles captured from Azerbaijan.    On the relative calm on the front lines, Oganian said this  followed an unprecedented toll of casualties, exhaustion and  frustration by the Azeri army.    He says Azerbaijan's initial successes in the early stages  of  the latest offensive due to its preponderance of troops and  weapons were temporary and had soon been neutralized by Armenian  troops.</p>

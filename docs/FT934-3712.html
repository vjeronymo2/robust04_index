			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Brazil plans to bring in a new currency Brazil yesterday announced a package of measures, including eventual introduction of a new currency, to tackle the country's soaring inflation rate of about 2,000 per cent a year. The package, the seventh stabilisation attempt since 1986, will be introduced gradually and will probably not take full effect until after the government's term runs out next year. It won cautious backing from the government's coalition partners and economists because the measures first tackle Brazil's budget deficit, seen as the main cause of inflation, and do not include 'shock' measures like price freezes which have failed in the past, even if initially successful. But several of the measures still need approval from Congress, which has been paralysed by a corruption scandal tainting many of its members. Proposed cuts in transfers to states and municipalities will also antagonise Brazil's powerful state governors. The government admits approval of the package may be difficult but hopes that by explaining the measures in advance the country will realise the severity of the problems. It fears that, without the package, inflation will accelerate ahead of next year's presidential and congressional elections. 'Economic policy will then have to be either highly recessionary and politically unsustainable, or you will have hyperinflation,' according to Mr Winston Fritsch, economic policy secretary. The first stage of the package, announced in general terms last week, is built into next year's budget and calls for spending cuts and revenue-raising measures to wipe out a projected deficit of Dollars 22.2bn. The cuts include a set-aside of 15 per cent of the transfers made from the central government to states and municipalities, to save Dollars 5.6bn. There is also a 5 per cent increase in all federal taxes, to take the top income tax rate from 25 per cent to 26.25 per cent, to raise Dollars 3.7bn. Congress has to approve the budget and several constitutional amendments to cover areas such as the 15 per cent set-aside, as well as longer-term measures to solve a deficit in the social security system. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, also announced he would support a number of measures designed to 'modernise the economy'. These included the ending of the state monopoly on telecommunications and the cancellation of a ban on the involvement of foreign controlled companies in mineral extraction. These areas are politically sensitive, and can only be approved through a constitutional revision which is under way. Mr Cardoso was less specific about the even more sensitive monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Petrobras. If the first stage of the package is approved, a new index to measure inflation daily will be introduced. Almost all government revenues and many private sector prices are at present adjusted in line with past inflation measures, which often adds to inflationary expectations. The new index could eventually be linked to the US dollar or a basket of currencies and adjusted daily, as happens with the central bank adjusting the exchange rate. The index would then become a new currency unit, backed by Brazil's foreign currency reserves of over Dollars 20bn and the central bank would be given more autonomy over monetary emission. The new index, called the Unidade Real de Valor or unit of real value, is partly designed to erase inflationary expectations which have dogged previous currencies. By shortening the period of price indexation and making index-linked contracts forward-looking, past inflation would no longer contaminate the new currency, the government hopes.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / EC central bank expected to be in Germany THE European Community sum-mit at the end of this month in Brussels is likely to decide to place the future European central bank in Germany, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gonzalez said the expected decision, dashing British hopes of bringing the central bank to London, would help rebuild political momentum towards the goal of economic and monetary union. The site for the European Monetary Institute, to be set up next year as the forerunner of the planned EC central bank, would reflect Germany's prime role in the anti-inflation 'economic philosophy' behind Emu, he said. 'I believe - and everyone else believes the same - that it (the institute) will be in Germany.' He admitted the EC currency crisis had placed 'a tremendous question mark' over whether the EC would accomplish the Maastricht timetable for Emu by 1997 or, at the latest, 1999. After the emergency move in August to wider currency fluctuation bands, he said the EC was unlikely to decide a firm date for returning to the previous narrow bands within the EMS. 'We don't want to be trapped by dates.' But he refused to endorse recent claims by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, that the Maastricht timetable was now unrealistic. Mr Gonzalez spoke against softening the Maastricht 'convergence' targets designed to force EC states to curb budget deficits and government debt as conditions for joining Emu. Although he admitted that EC budget deficits had been swollen by recession to well above the Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product, he said: 'I doubt that anyone would want to give up on this convergence plan . . . the planned convergence targets represent a good path.' Mr Gonzalez's remarks on the EMI are the clearest prediction so far from an EC leader that the summit on October 29 will opt for the central bank to be established in Germany.

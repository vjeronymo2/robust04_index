			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CITY PULLS PLUG ON GOLF COURSE LIGHTS  </P> <P> After months of emotionally charged public hearings and negotiations, the City  Council this week rejected lights for Ridgeline Golf Course -- a decision that  leaves the future of the city's only public links and driving range in  question.  </P> <P> Council members, who were lobbied heavily by citizens on both sides of the  issue, were hesitant to vote on the plan which has divided residents in the  semi-rural area. They finally turned down the proposal by a vote of 3 to 1.  </P> <P> About 200 people packed the council chambers to hear final arguments on whether  to place 40 lights on the nine-hole course and driving range in east Orange.  </P> <P> Mayor Don E. Smith asked twice for a motion before Councilman William G.  Steiner finally proposed that the permit for the lights be denied. Smith cast  the dissenting vote. Councilman Fred L. Barrera was absent.  </P> <P> Steiner said that after visiting the golf course, he agreed with Orange Park  Acres residents who argued that lights would increase evening traffic, an  impact that would be "inconsistent with the integrity of that very unique rural  community."  </P> <P> Residents of Orange Park Acres, who have been fighting the lights since April,  also worried that the plan would cause more commercialization.  </P> <P> But supporters of the lights feared that without them the city might lose  valuable open space and its only public golf and tennis club.  </P> <P> Course owner David Freimann began to install the lights last March because  extended hours were needed to make the course more profitable. Freimann said he  had spent about $60,000 installing the lights when the city ordered him to stop  work and get a conditional-use permit.  </P> <P> Now, Freimann said, he will "have to pursue the possibility of developing the  property. There's no sugar-coating that."  </P> <P> Herbert Bieber, president of the lighting company hired by Freimann, said he  intends to sue the city and recover $100,000 already spent on the project.

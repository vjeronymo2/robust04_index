			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ferranti offshoot files for Chapter 11 FERRANTI Healthcare Systems Corporation, a US subsidiary of the UK electronics group, has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. The step was taken by the Maryland-based company, which is involved in management services for hospitals, to allow it to carry on trading while dealing with certain problem contracts, Ferranti said. Healthcare Systems Corporation was formed when Ferranti acquired the healthcare systems division of Pentamation, a US systems company, for Dollars 16m (Pounds 8.7m) early in 1988. In the last financial year, it incurred an operating loss of Pounds 3.9m on turnover of Pounds 5.4m, consuming about Pounds 2.5m cash over the period. Before its acquisition, the Pentamation division posted turnover of Dollars 18m. The problems centre on one unprofitable contract in the US. Although the healthcare business in the US, which provides computer data centres and individual systems to hospitals and surgeries, has suffered during the recession, Ferranti said it did not intend pulling out of the market, 'When you are in the state that Ferranti is, in funding to the tune of Pounds 2.5m to support a company that is making a loss of Pounds 3.9m, you have to take remedial action,' the group said. The parent company has been through a rocky period following the revelation two years ago of a Pounds 215m fraud in International Signal and Control Group, its US defence subsidiary, during which it has had to reduce substantial bank borrowings. In the six months to September 30 it incurred losses of Pounds 28.8m while assets fell from Pounds 190m to Pounds 98.8m.</p>

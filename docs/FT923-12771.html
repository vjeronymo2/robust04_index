			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers rebuff local-authority cash plans MINISTERS yesterday rejected outright the Pounds 45.5bn estimate from the local-authority associations for local-government spending next year. At the twice-yearly meeting between local-authority associations and ministers from the main departments with related responsibilities, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said the proposed increase in spending was 'out of the question'. The picture for comparing local-government spending this year and next year is complicated by the local authorities' loss of responsibility for further education and their gaining responsibility for community care. Mr Howard said that taking account of those changes, the bid represented an increase of 13 per cent over what the government thought authorities should be spending this year - Pounds 41.8bn. The rise is smaller, however, compared with the Department of the Environment's estimate of what they will actually spend this year - Pounds 43bn. Ministers are anxious that the council tax in April next year is not accompanied by the high increases in local tax bills that greeted the poll tax. They are clear, however, that they will use the stricter regime for limiting or 'capping' council spending which is now in place, to prevent bills rising steeply, rather than simply using central government grant to prevent a sharp increase in the local funding element. Instead, within a tight overall spending limit, they are likely to concentrate on a generous transitional relief scheme for the council tax. Local-authority leaders left the meeting unconvinced by the government's argument. Mr John Chatfield, leader of the Association of County Councils, said he did not believe the associations' bid was 'out of perspective with the government's own plans for an 8.2 per cent rise in public spending next year'. Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, warned that unless the government changed its mind, councils would not be able to maintain services and meet their new, government-imposed demands.</p>

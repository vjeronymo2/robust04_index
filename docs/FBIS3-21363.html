M'Hamed Boucetta, leader of Istiqlal, talks  about political blockages, Driss Basri, Youssoufi, and his own  successor. He also has some things to say, especially about  religion, that will be of interest beyond Morocco's borders....    Since Morocco's political alternation derailed, the country  has been in a bizarre political situation characterized by a  twofold anomaly: an all-powerful opposition cheated of the  chance to govern in the foreseeable future; and a "temporary"  technocratic government that has every prospect of staying on  indefinitely. This situation, although detrimental for an  embryonic democracy, probably is not so very unwelcome to the  champions of a strong state, the eternal "Makhzen." But how are  the major opposition parties coping with it? Are they not  victimized by their own refusal to enter the government last  November?    This question, which was at the heart of the interview with  Mohamed Elyazghi, leader of the USFP [Socialist Union of Popular  Forces] (JA No. 1728), is also of concern to M'Hamed Boucetta,  head of the Istiqlal party. Interesting comparisons can be made  between their respective responses and the different tones they  take. The former carries on his shoulders, for better or for  worse, the ponderous legacy of Abderrahim and Abderrahmane  (Bouabid and Youssoufi) and takes refuge in wooden rhetoric. The  latter radiates the pugnacious serenity of someone whose  political career is all behind him. Jumping ahead of the  question about his retirement, he confirmed his intention to  pass the baton of leadership in April. To whom? To M'Hamed  Diouri. A figure of some public notoriety, the heir apparent is  not to everyone's liking. But what counts, says the secretary  general, is whether he's to his own party's liking!    More important are M'Hamed Boucetta's observations about  Islam and Islamism. If Morocco has been immunized against the  "fundamentalist virus," he never tires of saying, it is because  of the monarchy, which dominates the religious landscape. Of  course. But it is another question whether Istiqlal's writ  extends equally far. The party of Allal el-Fassi has always  taken to heart its hortatory mission, "praising Good and  denouncing Evil." Istiqlal's message, the fruit of half a  century of struggle for freedom, is thought provoking and even  applicable beyond Morocco's borders. It can be summarized as  follows: Islam and democracy are not incompatible, so long as  the citizens are also believers. The corollary, adapted to the  current turbulent winds of change, is that Islam is too serious  to be left to the Islamists.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Three months after the fact, don't you  regret  not participating in the government?    [Boucetta] Absolutely not. Even those in our party and  elsewhere in the country who had misgivings are convinced now  that we were right. Everyone realizes it would have been a major  blunder to accept bad implementation of a constitution that had  only just been revised, especially in a climate of insecurity.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] But now?    [Boucetta] One of the main provisions of the new  constitution  stipulates that the government must obtain its investiture from  parliament before it goes to work. Well, what exactly were we  offered? "Participation" in the government, but without a word  to say about its composition, the king reserving to himself the  right to choose a prime minister from outside the ranks of the  majority. Moreover, participation in the government under these  conditions would have signified our endorsement of the outcome  of the elections, and in particular the 17 September indirect  elections for one-third of the deputies. Unacceptable things  happened on that occasion, things we could not swallow.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] But you realize, at all events, that you  would not have been able to get a ministry as strategic as  Interior.    [Boucetta] But why not? There's nothing preordained about  it.  Every ministry should be put on the table, discussed among the  responsible leaders, and I can very easily imagine it being  headed by one of our people. That said, it is not a question of  individuals or portfolios. The whole question is whether or not  we in Morocco really want to have a government responsible to  parliament.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] If you had formed the government, would  Driss  Basri have kept Interior?    [Boucetta] At this time, I do not think so. Because it is  that very ministry and its head who by their action or inaction  were responsible for the recent elections being tainted with  numerous irregularities. Thus it would have been difficult to  keep the same man in the same position.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is the interior minister only the meticulous  implementer of what he is told to do, or does he have discretion  to act?    [Boucetta] Listen, I am not putting anyone on trial here.  Driss Basri in the past has shown himself to be a very  responsible person; he ably managed and directed his ministry,  and even succeeded in coming to terms with his adversaries. But  it also happened that he took initiatives contrary to the spirit  of democracy and covered up for the unscrupulous actions of  governors at the time of the elections.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are you personally one of those who thinks  there exists in Morocco a "clandestine single party"--to wit,  that of the regime?    [Boucetta] But it is not clandestine at all! It does its  work  in broad daylight. In certain sectors, the apparatus of the  Interior Ministry operates directly, not through intermediaries.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Isn't it too easy to blame all Morocco's  problems on Driss Basri?    [Boucetta] At bottom, we are not challenging the minister  but  rather the government as a whole. At the same time, Driss Basri  has such great influence on his colleagues that in the last  analysis everything starts and ends with him. He is omnipresent  and omnipotent.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Wasn't the Interior Ministry equally  powerful  even back when you were in government?    [Boucetta] Not to this extent. Since 1984, the last year we  were part of the government, Interior has brought under its  control the sectors of housing, infrastructure, and information,  just to name a few. Quite a lot, really.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] One sometimes has the feeling that the  parliamentary opposition is creating a great deal of stir  without getting much in the way of results. After all, the  government is running things, and your criticisms, confined to  the legislative chamber, carry hardly any political weight.  There is something unhealthy in this situation.    [Boucetta] It would have been even more unhealthy if we had  participated in the government and turned parliament into an  echo chamber!    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What are your current objectives?    [Boucetta] We must repair the damage done by the legislative  elections: in other words, start back at square one and hold new  elections. Dissolve the chamber, then proceed to a new vote, but  this time hold transparent and honest elections.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is that realistic?    [Boucetta] Of course. The dissolution could be only partial  and cover, for example, just the seats filled in the 17  September indirect elections. It can be argued that such a  decision would be politically wise... At all events, we have  filed so many appeals for annulment of results that if they were  all granted the entire composition of the chamber would be  changed. Certainly the situation is blocked, unhealthy. But this  can be remedied, if people will just listen to what we are  saying.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] How are your relations with the USFP? Still  idyllic?    [Boucetta] Let us say they are agreeable and cordial.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] To the point of marriage, or just a return  to  living together, as in the past?    [Boucetta] Nothing is ruled out. But before we think about  merger, it would be better to increase our joint endeavors in  every domain.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] How did you feel about the resignation of  Abderrahmane Youssoufi last September?    [Boucetta] I was unhappy about it, if only because I had  become accustomed to working with him on a daily basis for two  years. While visiting France I took the opportunity to visit  him, and I think I can say that he has not totally dropped out  of the political struggle. But it does appear to me that his  decision not to return to his position as first secretary of the  USFP is irreversible.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Beyond what his friends are saying for the  record, what in your opinion led him to resign?    [Boucetta] I think I know Si Abderrahmane pretty well. We  first met back in 1939, when we were attending Marrakech  college. It is in his character: He reached the point where he  could not stand the game and its constraints any longer, and he  disengaged.    I did not expect his resignation, but in retrospect it was  hardly surprising: His reactions in the days just preceding his  decision should have tipped me off. Several times, in the course  of meetings with members of the government in the national  electoral commission, he literally exploded: He found the  behavior of the regime vis-a-vis USFP, Istiqlal, and even the  National Rally of Independents [RNI] inadmissible and  intolerable.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] You are not the sort to quit...    [Boucetta] That is right. It is neither in my character nor  in...my culture. I can resign from a government or from a  football team, but not from Istiqlal. The party is like a second  skin to me. I cannot see myself for one second writing the kind  of letter Si Abderrahmane wrote.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What do you think about the creation of a  human rights affairs ministry?    [Boucetta] It is a good thing. A week before the formation  of  the government, we had asked for establishment of a  parliamentary commission on human rights. The idea was rejected,  on grounds there was no ministry responsible for human rights  policy! Now there is.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the naming of a Jewish cabinet  minister?    [Boucetta] It is not a first. Shortly after independence, I  myself was a member of the government in which Dr. Benzaken also  served. No problem.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about Serge Berdugo in Tourism?    [Boucetta] We know the lad well. We have nothing against  him.  He is serious and competent.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Istiqlal's next congress will be held in  April...    [Boucetta] 21-23 April. Let me jump ahead of your question:  I  am still determined to step down as secretary-general.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And will your friends let you?    [Boucetta] They still refuse to believe it. But I have been  in the job for 20 years now, and sometimes you have to know when  to quit. My decision is unalterable.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Who will succeed you?    [Boucetta] Mohamed Douiri will certainly stand for the  position. More precisely, I will support him.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Will everyone support him?    [Boucetta] I think so.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Even outside the party?    [Boucetta] It's the party militants that matter to us!    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And what about you? What will you do?    [Boucetta] I will continue to be a party militant, of  course.  We have a presidency council composed of Istiqlal veterans such  as Si Boubeker Kadiri and Hachemi Filali. I will sit beside  them, if the militants agree.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Would you say that Istiqlal is an Islamic  party?    [Boucetta] Absolutely. Istiqlal is totally Islamic. Islam is  its primary foundation and inspiration. If you reflect on it,  the question should never even arise in Morocco--and in fact it  does not. No party can contradict me on this, not even the  (communist) PPS [Party of Progress and Socialism].    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What is your opinion of the Islamists?    [Boucetta] I do not understand how they can say that they  are Muslims while others are not--and I do not accept it.  Neither do I accept the idea of them establishing a party to  defend Islam against others. No one has a monopoly on religion.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] So you are against legalization of an  Islamist party in Morocco?    [Boucetta] If Abdesselam Yassine, for example, wants to  establish a party, I will be the first to support him. But on  one condition: that it not claim, in its name or program, any  exclusive monopoly on Islam. The Islamic label belongs to all,  and thus to no one in particular.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the Algerian FIS [Islamic  Salvation Front]?    [Boucetta] Our Algerian brothers have committed the sin of  inconsistency. One day they legalize the FIS, the next they ban  it. Once they had legalized it, they should not have banned it.  But it would have been better to give the party a different  name: Algerian Salvation Front, for example...    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are the Islamists democrats?    [Boucetta] With this type of question, it is best to respond  on the basis of the specific program of the party concerned, not  on assumptions or suspicions. We in Istiqlal know something  about that: For a long time, we were accused of planning to  establish a one-party system in Morocco.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Your newspapers do not disguise their  sympathy for Algeria's FIS.    [Boucetta] We have been in contact for a long time with the  FIS, and with the Tunisian Islamists. We have sent lawyers to  each other's trials, because the most important thing was to  defend human rights. This position of principle does not mean we  agree with everything the Maghrebian Islamists say or do.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] And what if the FIS came to power in  Algiers?    [Boucetta] It would not bother me. It represents the  electoral majority in Algeria. It also defends a return to  certain values.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What about the assassinations of  intellectuals and foreigners?    [Boucetta] We have told our Algerian comrades in the FIS we  are against all violence, from whatever source.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] What is Morocco's position on the events in  Algeria?    [Boucetta] That is very difficult to define. I am not sure I  can tell. Let us just say that we certainly are not taking a  dynamic position.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] With the FIS in power, would Algeria modify  its position on the Sahara?    [Boucetta] Who can say? Some time ago, I put the question to  Madani and Benhadj. Their response was evasive.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Is the coming to power of Liamine Zeroual a  good thing?    [Boucetta] I hope so. But we will have to see how he does  before we can tell.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Will there be a referendum this year in  [Western] Sahara?    [Boucetta] The UN Security Council is wasting enough time  and  money on it, it seems. There is talk of setting the referendum  for the end of June, or even as early as May. Why not? One thing  is sure: As far as Moroccans are concerned, at this point  there's no question of leaving Sahara.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Regardless of the results of the referendum?    [Boucetta] Regardless of anything that may happen.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are Moroccans upset about Bosnia?    [Boucetta] We are very sensitive on the subject. Much more  so  than one might think. The imams speak out about this tragedy on  Fridays in the mosques, and afterwards the faithful are angry  and upset. I could add that many young people are going as  volunteers to Sarajevo.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] As they did during the Gulf war?    [Boucetta] Yes, there is some parallel. But the war against  Iraq also had the character of an intra-Arab conflict; in the  case of Bosnia, there is nothing to offset the powerful feelings  of indignation and rebellion.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Meaning?    [Boucetta] All Moroccans think the reason that the West--of  which they are a part--and Europe in particular--does not come  to the rescue of the Bosnians is because they are Muslims. It is  just as if they were unable to tolerate the existence of this  Muslim enclave in the heart of Europe, as if the war served as a  pretext for annihilating this outpost of Islam.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] It seems you are campaigning for the  prohibition of alcoholic consumption in Morocco.    [Boucetta] That is nothing new. In 1977, we offered a bill  that would accomplish this. Recently we decided to move forward  with this legislation, and we will present it again to  parliament before the end of session. The aim is to prohibit the  production, marketing, and consumption of alcoholic beverages.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] In short, an Islamic state law.    [Boucetta] Exactly. An Islamic law.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Some might consider the debate on such  questions to be sterile, of secondary importance.    [Boucetta] Not at all. It is essential. It is precisely when  one compromises on such social problems that one paves the way  for the most extremist forms of Islamism. In our view,  prohibition of alcohol is as essential as defense of the Arabic  language or respect for the "zakat."    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Do you consider yourselves a bulwark against  Islamism?    [Boucetta] You could say that.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Banning alcohol might hurt tourism...    [Boucetta] Non-Muslims will not be affected by this law:  neither tourists nor our Jewish compatriots. It is just a matter  of how the regulations are drawn up.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] In the eyes of many sub-Saharan Africans,  Istiqlal is still regarded as the party that champions a  "Greater Morocco." Do you still aspire to realize the  cartographic vision of Allal El-Fassi?    [Boucetta] The official maps do not represent historical  Morocco. Our country has been dismembered, carved up by  colonialism. For example, Mauritania was split off from the  kingdom: That is the historical truth, even if the issue has  been more or less resolved by making it an independent state.  More important, vast territories south of Tindouf were torn away  from us and given to Algeria when it was a French department.  The Algerians actually acknowledged this in 1961, when they  officially requested that discussions on the problem be  postponed until after independence. Subsequently they reneged,  and 30 years later the issue is still there.    [JEUNE AFRIQUE] Are you still standing by these claims?    [Boucetta] That is not a problem anymore. It is 1994. Our  task is to build the Maghreb, and in that context, borders will  be of no importance.</p>

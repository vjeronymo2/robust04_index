			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The news media and  publications have developed quickly in the Tibet Autonomous  Region in recent years.    Now there are 15 kinds of newspapers compared with four in  1987. There are also 37 periodicals and 73 professional journals  of various kinds and two audio-video presses.    "There was no modern press industry in Tibet before  liberation," said Lopsong Phuntsog, director of the Press and  Publication Bureau of Tibet. Even in 1987, there were only six  periodicals and one publishing house in the whole region.    According to Lopsong, the regional government has used state  subsidies mainly for publications in Tibet.    All the presses have done well to provide sufficient  textbooks for primary and middle schools. The Tibet education  press is to be established within this year to better support  Tibet's education.    Buddhist scriptures used to be printed only in the  monasteries and only in wood engravings. Now, 26 printers of  various kinds have been set up in the region and all the big  monasteries have their own printing houses. Laser photographic  techniques used in printing have been popularized in Tibet and  offset printing is gradually replacing letterpress printing.    The state has made a series of preferential policies in  support of the development of the Tibetan press.    The XINHUA bookstores in Tibet enjoy a tax-free status. The  state gives Tibet's publications industry a subsidy of four  million yuan annually.</p>

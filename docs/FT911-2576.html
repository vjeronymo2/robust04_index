			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Railways head for second 'summer of discontent' - A combustible mixture of union grievances may give rise to a complicated dispute AS SPRING turns to summer, the temperature of discontent is rising again on the railways. This afternoon, Mr Jimmy Knapp is likely to alarm London Underground passengers by announcing that his union has voted for 24-hour strikes on the network. That is only the start: it decided on Friday to ballot for similar action on British Rail. Threats of simultaneous industrial action on both networks are familiar enough to commuters. The series of one-day strikes in the 'summer of discontent' in 1989 caused extensive disruption before helping to force better terms for the unions. There is a danger that passengers will get caught in the crossfire again this summer. The echo of 1989 comes from more than a coincidence of disputes on the two networks. The complications of the argument are as deep as they were last time, involving changes in working practices as well as pay. The background is also similar: efforts by managers to force uncomfortable change on workers amid financial constraints. The difference between now and two years ago is one of intensity. The financial difficulties of both BR and London Underground have grown to the point where the managers of both are heavily squeezed. Once again, the outcome of a pitched battle will depend heavily on which side engages the public's sympathy. The 1989 dispute taught rail employers not to take for granted the fact that commuters blame rail workers for disruption. Disenchantment with services means passengers are likely to sympathise with union criticism of managers. The BR dispute has so far been a simple wrangle about pay. Because of the board's financial difficulties, it made an initial offer of 6.5 per cent, improving it a little last week to what it said was its final offer of 7 per cent. If extended to cover all 120,000 employees, it would add Pounds 133m to BR's stretched finances. Mr Knapp talks of the February inflation figure of 8.9 per cent being the RMT rail union's 'bottom line', although the board says inflation for the year the settlement covers will probably be about 6 per cent. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, says that to offer more would be 'irresponsible'. As was the case two years ago, there has been a divided response from unions. BR has accepted a call from Aslef, the train drivers' union, to take the dispute to the Railway Staffs National Tribunal, the industry's arbitration machinery. However, the RMT has decided to ballot 60,000 members on industrial action in spite of the arbitration. The RMT distrusts arbitration because it says BR has failed to honour awards in the past. The dispute might become more complicated. BR is in the middle of restructuring working patterns by introducing flexible rostering over seven days a week, which will bring down high overtime rates. In return it is offering improvements in basic wage rates: it will put initial proposals for drivers to Aslef this week. BR has started new rosters for 6,500 signals and telecommunications staff against RMT opposition, and that dispute is to be considered separately by the tribunal arbitration panel. If there is a pay dispute, restructuring may be tangled in it in the way that changes in bargaining arrangements became part of the 1989 dispute. The London Underground dispute has also started over a simple issue: the right of the corporation to make 1,005 job cuts. Mr Roger Straker, London Underground's personnel director, says the cuts are no more than prudent use of staff. London Underground managers, rather than allowing a long campaign of selective strikes, have already drawn up plans to suspend workers who take part in industrial action. That raises the possibility of huge disruption of the network if the RMT implements action over cuts which it says will lead to relatively small savings of Pounds 400,000. Managers are counting on gaining public support for brisk action against the RMT, but they may face difficulties if the RMT plays successfully on passenger disenchantment with services and staff cuts. The most potent element of the job losses would be the removal of 30 workers employed after the King's Cross fire to ensure that dust trays under escalators are cleared daily. London Underground says automatic cleaning equipment makes such work unnecessary, but the employment of such workers was one of the recommendations of the Fennell inquiry into the disaster. Beyond the issue of job cuts, London Underground's annual pay talks, which are traditionally based on BR's settlement, are now due. Its remaining ambition to achieve some of the work flexibilities that formed part of the abortive Action Stations plan of two years ago means that wrangles with unions are unlikely to subside quickly. The combustible mixture of grievances and pressures is already warming as the pay settlement date of April 8 recedes without a pay rise in immediate prospect. It could be settled by a mixture of arbitration and horse-trading over numbers. But there is a danger that the summer of 1989 may become an uncomfortably sharp memory.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: VALUE FLYING HIGH ON INVERTED-PLANE ISSUE  </P> <P> Question: What is the famous air mail invert worth? -- J.C.  </P> <P> Answer: I assume you are referring to the 24-cent U.S. air mail stamp of 1918  (Scott number C3a) with the airplane inverted in the center of the design.  Current catalogue value is $115,000 for a mint copy, and all known specimens  have never been canceled. A pane (sheet) of 100 of these stamps was purchased  by William T. Robey when they were issued, and later these were sold for  ever-increasing prices to wealthy collectors.  </P> <P> Although the stamp is rare and has a lot of romantic demand pushing its market  value up, some copies come on the auction block every year, fetching prices  from $50,000 up, depending on the condition of the stamp.  </P> <P> You might be interested to know that this stamp has been faked by clever  forgers who cut out the airplane engraving from a genuine copy of the normal  "right-side-up" version of this error, then pasted it carefully onto the center  of a shaved-down stamp of this issue. Watermark and ultraviolet analysis would  indicate this fake immediately, but novice collectors could be fooled for a  time.  </P> <P> Of course, any expensive stamp should be guaranteed by the seller, and maybe  come accompanied by expertizing certificates to assure its authenticity.  </P> <P> Q: My post-card collection of old Los Angeles views goes back to about 1910.  There are about 700 cards with their original 1-cent stamps on them. Are these  worth anything? -- M.N.  </P> <P> A: Probably not much. Pre-1910 post cards are more in demand. Even 75 years ago  many picture post cards were being printed and sold to tourists and post card  collectors in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Q: While stationed overseas in 1974, I purchased a stamp in Thailand. The stamp  has not been circulated and is misprinted with the denomination "2 Bath"  instead of "2 Baht." Is there any value to it? If so, where would I find a  buyer?D.D.  </P> <P> A: You have Scott catalogue No. 704 from Thailand, the "2 Bath" error stamp,  first issued Sep. 19, 1974. Its current catalogue value is 35 cents mint, 25  cents used, so you can see that it is not of great value today. Not all stamp  errors are valuable, and yours is a good example of this. The invisible law of  supply and demand rules the stamp market, and the supply of the "2 Bath" Thai  error is quite sufficient to satisfy collector demand the world over, hence its  low catalogue value.  </P> <P> Q: How do U.S. air mails look now for investment purposes? I understand that  they have a good track record in constant price appreciation. -- K.M.  </P> <P> A: In the opinion of most stamp-market experts, many elusive U.S. stamps are  currently underpriced and are set to move up gradually in value over the next  decade. And I must emphasize long-term investment rather than short-term (say,  one year) speculation for the best prospects of profits. For example, there are  Scott catalogue No. C18 at about $100 mint for a choice copy, and No. C13-15  (the expensive Zeppelins) at around $2,000 to $3,000 retail for the set.  Interest on bank accounts is guaranteed, though, so buy stamps with extra funds  for hoped-for profits.  </P> <P> Q: What is the value of a plane out of position on U.S. Scott No. C11, the  5-cent Beacon air mail issue of 1928? I have one copy with the plane about  midway between the beacon and the "AIR" panel. My other copy shows the plane  slightly overlapping the word "AIR." Is this a common error? -- K.E.O.  </P> <P> A: Number C11 was printed in two colors, carmine red and blue. The center  vignette and outside framework of the design are sometimes found to be  misregistered, but of no special extra premium value, in my opinion.  </P> <P> When you consider the press run of C11, more than 100 million copies, then it  seems logical that plenty of them are "off-center" and, therefore, of no  particular error value. As you may know, some air mail philatelists specialize  in collecting this stamp on covers of the time period when it was current, and  they may be interested in obtaining printing varieties of it. But they  shouldn't have any trouble finding them, because the stamp isn't rare today.  </P> <P> Q: Where do you begin to look for rare stamps? It seems like all I can find are  cheap ones. How are those rarities discovered, the stamps that you hear about  being found in somebody's attic or garage and later auctioned off for thousands  of dollars? -- F.McG.  </P> <P> A: First of all, rare stamps are hard to find. Most of the fabulous discoveries  that you read about or heard about from other collectors were found by chance.  </P> <P> Old correspondence, family scrap books, chests and drawers of mementos, old  business files, and even antique cabinets and desks have all yielded their  share of choice stamps.  </P> <P> Modern errors are occasionally noticed by alert collectors at the post office  and are purchased over the counter at face value. It is nice to dream, but  don't expect to discover rare stamps on your own. A better way is to save up  your money until you can buy them.  </P> <P> Q: While traveling through Sweden in the late 1960s, I picked up a quantity of  souvenir sheets with stamps showing paintings by Ivan Agueli. What are these  things worth today, and are they scarce items? -- T.D.  </P> <P> A: Issued June 6, 1969, this souvenir sheet is listed at $2.75 mint, $5  canceled. This is an example of stamps that are worth more used than unused. Of  course, the cancel should be genuine and of the time period when the stamps  were issued, to justify the hefty discrepancy between cheaper mint and more  expensive canceled prices.  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Card game with much to play for - Banks may be victims of their own rules on issuing plastic On the basis that there is no such thing as a free lunch, the credit card car discounts offered by Ford and General Motors in the UK must seem to many people too good to be true. But consumers who choose their credit card well and use it wisely can come out ahead of the game because of the peculiar features of the credit card market. Even after playing one dealer off against another in negotiations, GM and Ford card holders can get a further healthy discount on the purchase of a new car. This win-win situation has arisen because of the way the banks have structured the credit card industry and organised its economics, possibly to their own eventual detriment. The structure of the industry is built around the two leading worldwide credit card associations, Visa and MasterCard. They are 'owned' by the banks that helped to establish them or subsequently joined them when they realised the potential profitability of the market. Membership of the card associations was originally restricted to banks but competitive pressures led MasterCard in particular to relax its membership criteria. It is still the case that only banks can become full members. The card associations determine the procedures by which credit card transactions are reconciled between card issuers, facilitate the transmission of transaction information and set the fallback position on pricing arrangements between card issuers, in the event of them being unable to reach bilateral agreements. The crucial element in this calculation is the so-called issuer reimbursement fee (or interchange). This is an ad valorem amount paid on every transaction by the bank that acquires these from the merchant, to the bank that issued the card. The interchange rate on credit card transactions varies between 1 per cent and 1.3 per cent, so that for a purchase of Pounds 100, between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.30 is paid by the merchant where the transaction took place to the acquirer bank, to be then passed on to the issuing bank - where this is a different institution. The acquiring bank requires recompense for the activities it undertakes; the total cost to the merchant of a credit card transaction (including the interchange rate) is called the merchant service charge and this is now an average of around 1.7 per cent of the value of the card transaction. The card association rules currently decree that only association members - for which read banks - can be card transaction acquirers. The rewards are particularly juicy for the banks that are large issuers and acquirers for they handle many 'on-us' payments, where the acquired transaction is on their issued card: here the merchant service charge can be allocated between the acquirer and issuer sides of the bank, according to internal policies. The four main clearing banks are believed to have more than 80 per cent of the total combined issuing and acquiring market. It is, however, the high level of interchange that has attracted the new non-bank entrants to the credit card market, while dissuading a prominent merchant, Marks and Spencer, from accepting Visa or MasterCard transactions. For new entrants such as GM and Ford who can persuade their credit cardholders to maximise spending on their credit cards, as indeed they must to build up their car purchase rebate value, then as card issuers but not acquirers they stand to receive a substantial and ongoing income stream through the interchange arrangement. The income stream is activated as soon as their credit cards are used by holders, whereas the rebates they offer may well be cashed in some years into the future. Added to this will be income paid to them under their agreement with their issuing banks, HFC and Barclays respectively, as a proportion of interest paid on cardholders' outstanding debt and on other card-related income-generating activities, such as cash advances, credit card loss protection, payment protection, fees for late payment and so on. While such income does not entirely cover the rebate value accumulated by their credit cardholders, it goes some considerable way towards offsetting it. Who knows just how many rebates may not be cashed. No wonder then that non-banks have sought to enter the credit card market and that they can afford to offer cards with low APRs, no annual fees and added-value features. No wonder also that Marks and Spencer will continue not to accept Visa or MasterCard credit cards or Amex or Diners charge cards and that other big multiple retailers are thought to have been reconsidering their options on this matter. In an era of shrinking retail margins, but increasing spending through credit cards, the proportion of the 1 to 1.3 per cent interchange not taken by the card issuer can look very attractive. Why are the card associations so reluctant to allow non-banks to become members and why has the interchange rate been increased in recent years? The answers lie in the banks' dual desires to protect their equity in the card associations, while simultaneously milking that investment for cash, through the interchange system. The equity value of the card associations is unknown, but potentially enormous, given their dominance of card-based payment systems worldwide. The admission of non-banks as members would both dilute that equity and throw into doubt the sustainability of the interchange charge, certainly at its present rate. Unfortunately for the banks, the consequences of not allowing non-banks to join the card associations are potentially even more dangerous. The car manufacturers and retailers have learnt that having a credit card relationship with a customer is a key to wider and deeper relationships, perhaps even to provide other financial services. The GM and Ford credit cards offer those car manufacturers a regular, justifiable and personal way to communicate with their cardholders via the monthly statement. By also using information from the cardholders' application form and by monitoring their spending patterns, a great deal can be learnt about those customers and their product and service needs. Marks and Spencer's own credit card base has been the starting point for its other incursions into financial services, Peps, personal loans and now insurance and pensions. Because of their narrow view of the profitability of credit cards and failure to see the potential for wider relationship building, the banks have often left their credit cards as standalone operations. By either encouraging or allowing the interchange rate to be increased disproportionately to the total amount of the merchant service charge, the banks have made the issue of credit cards so economically attractive that non-banks have seen how they can make money on the operation of a credit card and build a card base that can be cross-sold with other products and services. Truly the banks are in great danger of being hoist by their own petard. The author is a professor at Staffordshire University Business School.</p>

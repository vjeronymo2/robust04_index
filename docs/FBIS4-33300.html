			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Port-au-Prince, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) --  Constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval today changed his  position and expressed support for the almost total embargo  imposed against Haiti because he believes it is the only way to  make the coupists relinquish power.    Measures similar to the almost total trade embargo were  rejected by Malval last year when they had the support of  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was deposed in September  1991 in a coup d'etat led by General Raoul Cedras. [passage  omitted]    Last December, Malval distanced himself from Aristide due to  conflicting opinions concerning negotiations with the coupist  military, which in September 1991 forced the constitutional  president into exile. [passage omitted]    During an interview on Radio Metropole, Malval said Cedras,  chief of the Armed Forces, is responsible for the crisis in  Haiti, a country subject to an almost total embargo imposed by  the United Nations on 21 May. [passage omitted]    Legislators, who support the coupists, appointed Judge Emile  Jonassaint as the "provisional president" on 11 May, despite a  UN warning to the military to restore institutional order or  face an embargo.</p>

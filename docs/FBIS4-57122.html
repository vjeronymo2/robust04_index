			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 11 May (EFE) -- Official sources reported  here today that the Brazilian Government will ask Mexico for  compensation for possible losses our country may sustain as a  result of the tariff benefits Mexico will be granting to its  NAFTA partners, the United States and Canada.    The Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) has  decided that Mexico should compensate any of its 10 ALADI  partners whose exports may be hurt by NAFTA. By compensating  them, Mexico will be exempted from the ALADI requirement of  sharing the benefits it may obtain through NAFTA with the other  ALADI members.    To obtain a waiver for this requirement, Mexico will have to  negotiate compensations with those ALADI members whose exports  to Mexico may be hurt by NAFTA.    Arthur Denot Medeiros is the Brazilian Foreign Ministry  under  secretary for integration, economic affairs, and foreign trade.  He said: "Waivers will be conditioned to compensatory  negotiations." Denot added that this solution will contribute  to preserving ALADI, "which has been institutionally weakened"  since Mexico joined NAFTA.</p>

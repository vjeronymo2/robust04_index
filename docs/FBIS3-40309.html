			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mirka Velinovska: "Shadow Diplomacy: What Kind </F> of Foreign Policy Would We Have if the Most Nationalistic Party  Came to Power?"]    [Text] A day or so ago, listening to a Macedonian radio  conversation with VMRO-DPMNE's [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian  National Unity] shadow foreign minister, it became somehow  clearer to me what would have happened in Macedonia had that  party, which calls itself the most nationalistic, won a complete  victory in the last election. To be more precise, the extent to  which the policy, which Vranislav Sinadinovski interpreted for  us in an original manner, would have been carried out. And  considering that the VMRO-DPMNE, or its shadow minister, in his  media debut is already predicting a victory in the forthcoming  election, I think that it is essential for us to analyze its  positions and priorities with respect to the foreign policy that  Macedonia will conduct if the most nationalistic and populist  opposition wins.    First of all, Sinadinovski said that "his party is the only  one that has a platform about the conduct of foreign policy,"  and he personally had offered to rent an auditorium to read his  book, which was not written by chance. Of course, the gentleman  continued, "the government did not want to make good use of that  platform," nor, by analogy, of his book. And just what is it  that should be "made good use of" if not what he intended to  read, which appears to be the following: When it was ascertained  (by the untried minister or the VMRO-DPMNE) that "the current  foreign policy is not scientifically planned," mainly because of  "the lack of preparations by the government to organize a  hearing for a critical analysis of foreign policy," and it is  still "pro-Yugoslav," "in fact, it is not pro-Yugoslav, but has  long been its slave," and "Yugoslavia is, for practical  purposes, dead, and there is no chance for its revival"; the  shadow minister also promoted his scientifically based foreign  policy, saying: "The VMRO-DPMNE has prescribed the pursuit of an  independent foreign policy." Immediately after that came a  public acknowledgment that he is a realist and pragmatist, and  then he suggested that "Macedonia should make itself into a true  friend of the only remaining world superpower and some European  superpowers" (?!). Afterwards, in a scientifically based way, he  said that, "the VMRO-DPMNE clearly and firmly strives for a  reconciliation with neighboring countries," and, to avoid  ambiguity, he criticized the current government for being  "insufficiently active with respect to strengthening relation  with Greece and Serbia," and indeed, the government does not  make good use of the opportunities to provide good services to  those who recognize us, such as, for example, Bulgaria. What [he  refers to here] corresponds well to the affronted feelings on  the part of official Bulgaria (implied at the Bulgarian minister  of defense's appearance at the assembly of the European Union's  military alliance, where he said that, "Macedonia conducts a  policy that is not exactly well-disposed toward Bulgaria"), but  it [his criticism] is not [in keeping] with our policy, which  has been endorsed in the Assembly, of [keeping] all four  neighbors at an equal distance, a policy that guarantees life  for us.    The following is an analysis of the policy that a VMRO-DPMNE  government would conduct with respect to international  recognition and the definition of the status and the role of our  country in the Balkans and in the world, beginning by  establishing that "the government lied to the people when it  said that Macedonia was a recognized state," when, in fact, he  [probably President Gligorov], as a career diplomat, "knows that  the establishment of relations at the level of consulates is not  recognition," as was at first cited concerning the twelve  European countries. Now, I am a little uncertain, perhaps  because I am not privy to diplomatic secrets, but according to  my own logic, that could also mean that Bulgaria and Russia did  not recognize us because they have not opened any missions here  as embassies, but that does not stop any criticism directed at  the current government because it did not exploit possibilities  to support itself more firmly through friendship with those  countries in the representation of Macedonia's interests  globally. In fact, the finding mentioned previously dovetails in  no way with the preliminary disclosure by the same gentleman  that: "Macedonia is recognized by many countries, and that fact  should be exploited in the strengthening of the weak  international position of our country." But my logic is  obviously not scientifically based, and perhaps because of that,  I did not succeed in understanding the following statement:  namely, since it was already established that, "the government  lied to the people about the external [situation]," what could  be said about the domestic one? Sinadinovski reveals yet another  ruse: "I beg you, to whom is the government lying when it says  over and over again that Macedonia will get $230 million in  financial aid?" Indeed, to whom is the government lying? Again,  I think that it concerns the possible IMF credit, which is  dependent upon Macedonia having its macroeconomic program for  the coming year. The conditions in order for the money to be  obtained are the introduction of certain laws for which the  Assembly is responsible. And in the Assembly, the VMRO-DPMNE is  also sitting, and God knows, independent, nationalist, and  scientifically based. And Mr. Sinadinovski, as a man in the  shadow [government], who says what he says in connection with  that (he unveils the government's falsehood to the people),  really should anticipate that that deceitfulness will be cruelly  repudiated. Well, let it cost what it may, I mean "by the  people, that is, the citizens who live in Macedonia," as defined  by the new constitution according to Sinadinovski.    However, on that occasion, the minister in the corpulent  opposition shadow [government] brought in his "scientifically  based opinions" with which he and his party would solve the  problems with the immediate neighborhood and would raise [the  level] of goodneighborly relations as soon as it wins the  election. At the same time, it is said that they would penetrate  the Balkans, or since, as they put it, "Macedonia's place and  status in the new European construction should be defined." I  must admit that I concentrated a little more here to listen to  the alternative recipe for success, when it appeared that: "The  goodneighborly relations with Greece and the greater initiative  of the future Macedonian foreign policy, for example, will be  raised in a way in which there will be no discussions about the  name, the flag, and so forth." As if neither he nor his party  knew that the problem with Greece is precisely the current  foreign and domestic policy of Macedonia, which considers  everything, but does not accept changing. As to Greece, Mr.  Sinadinovski is getting ready "to present Greece with the  problem of the Macedonian minority which lives in Greece." Thus,  a nice shortcut. The Greeks could hardly wait for us to turn to  them, but everything was already decided, and Greece was almost  ready to sit down with the Macedonians to talk about the  Macedonian minority, when it does not admit that it has a  minority, and still less does it recognize that there is a  Republic of Macedonia on its northern border.    Actually, Sinadinovski, as a "real" politician, and above  all, a "pragmatist," understood that the current Greek policy  should be to respond by doing the same thing in Macedonia. What  guarantee will lead to improving neighborly relations and to  stabilizing the Balkans and exactly define the place of  Macedonia in the future European structure? However, I live in  hope that Mr. Sinadinovski will re-examine this theory, this  time bearing in mind the fact that such a "scientifically based  foreign policy" in the Greek, Serbian, and other Balkan cases,  produces lethal results. Unless the world's information  [sources] are lying ....    Finally, in the name of the shadow government, its minister  for relations with foreign countries convinced us that Macedonia  did not have to enter the United Nations under the conditions it  did. To the question from the journalist -- "What would have  happened to Macedonia if it had stayed outside the mainstream of  the world organizations" -- came the following answer: "And what  did it gain by entering?" Well, you see, if it is not clear to a  potential minister even after several months what all Macedonia  gained with its admission to the UN (it was entirely clear to  Greece) and with a thesis that "Macedonia must act more  aggressively in the world," then shouldn't I come to the  conclusion that the motherland requires that the gentleman in  question be in foreign policy and on the political scene in  general? With one reservation: that perhaps the foreign policy  of this party can be understood as a street event, a meeting, a  flag, and a song, and in this case, the above-mentioned  [position] would be entirely logical.</p>

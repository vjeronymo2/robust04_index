			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (4): Cautious hopes for big economic rewards - Alain Cass examines Hong Kong's growing integration with China's economy. Uncertainties are many and the stakes are high CHINA calls Hong Kong's transition to 1997 the 'through-train.' There are few illusions in the colony about this journey into the unknown. Some freedoms will go, if not overnight, then gradually. The hope to which Hong Kong's workaholic business community clings is that its no-holds-barred freedom to trade will not be among them. This could be wishful thinking. The argument that, to sustain an open economy in the long run you need a free flow of information, if not free speech, is powerful and seductive, not least because of the poignancy of Hong Kong's situation. But things may not be as bleak as they seem on the surface - for two reasons. The first is that a number of economies in the region have flourished without democracy - Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea to name but three. In the case of the last two, economic prosperity has smoothed the way for a gradual change from martial law to a semblance of free elections. The second reason for cautious optimism is that the Chinese are embracing capitalism with evangelical fervour. Money is softening up the communist party and Hong Kong is thriving on the back of this get-rich-quick culture. It is one the great ironies of history that refugees who fled Mao Zedong's prison camps after the communist take-over in 1949 now ebb and flow across the border in their thousands, cutting deals with his successors. In his inaugural address, Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, spoke of an economic revolution, not seen since the industrialisation of Europe and America, sweeping the region and carrying Hong Kong with it. Mr Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, refers to growth in southern China's ultra-liberated provinces as 'astonishing.' Granted, these are worried men with a vested interest in talking up the region's economic prospects. But the figures, even allowing for a healthy margin of error, suggest the dreaded take-over may not be all bad or all one-way: Hong Kong-based businesses and their mainland partners now employ three million people in over 25,000 factories in southern China. This vast off-shore force of cheap labour is bigger than the colony's own working population which is increasingly employed in the services sector. In a recent survey, 70 per cent of the colony's electronics manufacturers said they had invested in China. An estimated 30 per cent of Hong Kong's total note and coin issue circulates in southern China - about twice the amount of 18 months ago. Taxi drivers in Shenzen, just across the border, accept Hong Kong dollars. Gold shops in the colony will take Chinese currency. China's economy grew by 12 per cent in real terms in 1992 and is forecast to grow by at least 7 and 8 per cent this year, and possibly more. Southern China will almost certainly vastly outpace the national average. This growth has had a dramatic effect on Hong Kong. It is now the mainland's biggest trading partner. China, in turn, is Hong Kong's best overseas customer, pushing even the mighty US into second place. Total contracted foreign investment in China by September 1992 was USDollars 78.6bn of which just over USDollars 25bn had been realised. Hong Kong accounts for around two-thirds of that total, more in the south of the country. Hong Kong has become a significant market for capital flowing in and out of mainland China. By the end of the decade, by some estimates, China-related listings in the Hong Kong market will account for 45 per cent of its capitalisation or as much as USDollars 900bn, up from USDollars 175bn in 1992. For the sceptics who doubt these figures, there is the evidence of their own eyes. The Pearl river delta is like a giagantic game of Monopoly, sprouting factories, apartments and office towers. More than 18,000 trucks a day leave Hong Kong's container port - the world's biggest - for China. Seven years ago less than 12 per cent of the port's trade was with China. Last year it reached 65 per cent and the proportion is still growing. As one analyst put it, '1997 has already happened - it's just that the politicians haven't noticed.' Hong Kong's growing integration with the Chinese economy offers the prospect of huge rewards. If the 'China Express' powers ahead, Hong Kong will continue to ride high. But growing dependence on China also carries some risks. Runaway inflation and rampant corruption could drive the Chinese economy off the rails, triggering social unrest, as happened in 1989, in which case Hong Kong would be in for a rough ride. CHINA is now in its third go-stop cycle since 1979, when Deng Xiaoping abandoned the command economy. Inflation is running well into double-digit figures - some say running away altogether. The widely-used unofficial rate for the renminbi has fallen sharply. Rivalry between the centre and the richer provinces could grow as these become economically more powerful and demand greater autonomy. Inequalities of wealth could - almost certainly will - lead to renewed social unrest sometime in the future. There is already talk of the leadership tightening monetary policy again to slow the rate of growth. A credit crunch in China would hit the colony hard. Property developers hoping to cash in on China's chronic shortage of urban housing, now that 1980's construction boom in Hong Kong is effectively over, would suffer. So would its manufacturers of consumer goods. Failure by the President Bill Clinton's administration to renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status in June would slash growth in Hong Kong, which is why Mr Patten will argue unconditionally for its renewal when he goes to Washington. The colony's worst nightmare is a faltering US recovery, a credit crunch in China and a suspension of Peking's MFN status. The government hopes that at least two of these will not materialise. It forecasts real GDP growth of 5.5 per cent this year, incidentally, overtaking the UK in per capita terms. Despite objections from Beijing, or perhaps because of them, the government is rushing to put in place as much of the planned infrastructure as possible before 1997, using its substantial reserves instead of resorting to tax increases. Domestic inflation is a worry. This has fallen from its peak of nearly 14 per cent in 1991, but it remains over 10 per cent which, the government concedes, is uncomfortable high. The Hong Kong dollar's fixed link with its US counterpart may anchor the economy and keep it externally competitive, but it also hobbles the fight against inflation by limiting the government's use of the interest rate weapon. For the past 10 years the currency's rate has been fixed at HKDollars 7.8 to the USDollars . The territory's interest rates track US rates. These have been low to boost America's anaemic economy. The effect on Hong Kong of low interest rates has been to fuel stock and property market speculation, boosting asset prices and inflation. The expansionary budget, introduced by Mr Patten in February, has been criticised for promoting inflation. Some economists, notably Mr John Greenwood, chairman of GT Management, who fathered the link with the US dollar, says high growth and the fixed exchange rate will save Hong Kong from conventional inflation-sickness. Nevertheless, soaring land and labour costs and the difficulty of recruiting skilled labour to Hong Kong is driving some back-office services not just across the border into China but elsewhere in the region. Cathay Pacific, the colony's flagship airline, plans to set up an accountancy centre in Guangzhou and a database in Australia to capitalise on cheap labour and land. The relentless migration of Hong Kong's young, middle-class professionals ahead of 1997 chips away at its competitive edge. They are leaving at the rate of 60,000 a year or nearly one per cent of a population which is barely growing and getting older. Unless Hong Kong can find a way of replacing them and developing its 'intelligent' core, it could find itself with a manufacturing base largely in China and its high-value services dribbling away to up-and-coming regional hubs. In the long-run there is always the possibility of a sudden and unpredictable lurch back to Mao's economics in China by a communist party fearing loss of power and a Soviet-style break-up of the country. But the risk of that happening decreases as the power of the Chinese consumer grows. Ultimately the best - the only - guarantee of Hong Kong's economic survival is for China's stake in the colony to become so big and the number of officials who might wish to slam shut the open-door so outnumbered by those who want to make money, that nothing else makes sense.</p>

Mr  Fismer was pelted with stones and he and security men had to  leave a rally intended for NP [National Party] leader and State  President F W de Klerk.    According to security officers accompanying the president,  shots were fired in a crowd of opposing African National  Congress [ANC] and National Party supporters. No further  details were immediately available.    Mr Fismer had gone to address the meeting to explain why  President de Klerk had canceled his appearance there, a police  spokesman said. It was then that stones were thrown at the  stage. There were strong ANC and NP support groups present at  the rally. Mr de Klerk was earlier advised not to attend the  rally as all access roads were being blocked by ANC  stonethrowers.</p>

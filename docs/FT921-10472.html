			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Save the PSBR MR CLIVE SOLEY, the shadow housing spokesman, let slip on Tuesday that Labour was considering changes to the definition of the public sector borrowing requirement. This would allow Pounds 8bn of local authority capital receipts to be released for housing without increasing the PSBR. The Conservative chairman, Mr Chris Patten, immediately accused Labour of employing 'the Arthur Daley approach to accounting'. The shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith, categorically denied that Labour would change the definition to increase public expenditure. The hapless Mr Soley had little choice but to recant. But he is not the only member of the shadow cabinet to have expressed an interest in finding a 'cost-free' way of increasing public expenditure. The attractions of off-balance-sheet financing are manifest for a party which wishes to spend more on housing, transport and local services while proclaiming its fiscal responsibility to the markets. Mr Smith is right to resist any attempt to find a quick fix which would allow a Labour government to give an early boost to public spending before economic growth provides the resources. Without Mr Smith's backing as chancellor, there would in any case be little chance of the Treasury's agreement to such creative accountancy. But there are merits in regularly reviewing the definitions of the statistics which are so central to economic management. The failure to distinguish between current and capital expenditure in the national accounts, for example, is more than mere semantics. And since economic performance indicators will be used to judge EC member states' fitness for monetary union, there is a case for ensuring that definitions used in the UK are harmonised with those used elsewhere in Europe. The best way to address issues such as these would be through an independent review conducted by economists and statisticians without the benefit of political interference. The Central Statistical Office would be the appropriate body to carry out such a review. However, no amount of redefining the figures can create new resources for politicians to spend. The Pounds 8bn of capital receipts which local authorities hold following the sale of council houses has been long regarded in local government as a pot of gold, withheld only by the perversity of the Treasury. Nothing could be further from the truth: to release more than the 25 per cent which is now permitted to be spent on housing would add to the PSBR in just the same way as any other addition to government spending. If more is to be spent from the public purse on housing or any other sort of public service, it requires a spending decision which is subject to control and public scrutiny. In the current British context that control can only be exercised by the Treasury. If he has reminded his colleagues of that basic truth, Mr Soley is to be congratulated, whatever his lack of prudence in speaking out of turn.</p>

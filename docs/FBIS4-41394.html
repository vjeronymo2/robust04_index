			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko  supports the presidential decree on urgent measures to protect  the population from banditry and organized crime.    Now that armed and organized criminals are brazenly trying  to  establish their rules in the country and unleash terror, curbing  organized crime is becoming a task of the greatest importance,  he told the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's Office on  Thursday.    "In fact, we are faced with the question of who will bring  down whom to their knees: the state the mafia, or the mafia the  state," he said. He demanded that the task of combating crime  and coordinating the work of the law- enforcement bodies be  given priority attention.    He said the emergency measures, set forth in the decree, did  not at all imply the neglect of the constitution or the law. On  the basis of the available opportunities the state must curb the  criminals and apply the new laws to them in all their  strictness, he said.    "We are well aware of the real possibilities of criminal  reprisals and do not consider them a panacea in our struggle  against crime. However, in the current setting, the punitive  power of the law must be used fully and without hesitation,"  said Ilyushenko.    He said he could understand society's concern about possible  malpractices during the implementation of the decree and  admitted that the law-enforcement bodies had violated the laws  in many instances lately, acting in an arbitrary way.    He said that the measures proposed in the decree were aimed  at attaining a real breakthrough in the struggle against crime,  not at violating human rights, and that the main gaol of the  decree was to protect the citizens from organized terror.    He proposed ensuring strict control over the observance of  laws during the implementation of the presidential decree.    According to his sources, compared to 1989 the crime rate  has  more than doubled in Russia. A total of 2.8 million crimes,  including 500,000 serious ones, were committed in 1993. Among  them were 30,000 premeditated murders, 67,000 serious injuries  and more than 220,000 robberies. Over the first five months of  1994, 1.94 million crimes were committed, including 216,000  serious crimes, said Ilyushenko.</p>

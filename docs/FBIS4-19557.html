			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Furio Colombo commentary: "America Stands Watching"] </F>   [Text] America's outlook is a benevolent one and imagines a  benevolent world. Bloodthirsty conflicts are breaking out  around the world, but America seems not to see them. This is  how future historians will describe American foreign policy in  recent years. On the one hand, fraternal words, perhaps the most  encouraging words, displaying the most solidarity and the most  human sentiments since the Kennedy era. And, on the other hand,  an almost complete absence of action, which renders the world's  sole major power immobile in the face of transformations that  are both tragic and radical. Transformations that certainly  also entail a political cost, which extends beyond the cost in  terms of bloodshed that is being paid now.    The list is a long one. It is enough to cite the collapse of  Africa, the destructive fury of South Africa, the distant and  daily massacres in Bosnia, and the nearer, terrible, and  entirely unobstructed massacres on the hopeless island of Haiti.    Anyone wanting to defend the virtual absence of American  foreign policy could cite the many diplomatic initiatives taken  by the Clinton Administration in almost all the tragedies  shaking the world. If it were me, I would not choose that  approach. This, because it embodies frightening  inconsistencies, always followed by inaction and silence.    The public worldwide has lost count of the warnings,  threats,  and ultimatums issued to Serbia. Apart from the brief  intervention by NATO aircraft around Sarajevo, which suspended  that city's suffering after two years, there is no trace of  American thinking on the former Yugoslavia. Or, rather, there  are occasional, confused traces. They are characterized by good  intentions, are inconsistent, and immediately come to nothing.    The President, who is a man of common sense, is patient and  does not remain silent. But any explanation (either by him or  by his secretary of state, his secretary of defense, or his  national security adviser) does not negate the lack. Clinton is  an honest man. He says that this time it was impossible and  that something else will be tried. Often attention is diverted  away from Washington toward the failures of the United Nations.  The United Nations now seems like a rickety bureaucracy  entirely unequal to the enormous task that this "post-Cold War  period" has set on its shoulders, already overburdened by  bureaucracy and lacking in political vitality.    With regard to the United Nations, we should recall  instances  of personal heroism, isolated and stubborn commanders who  persist in performing a task that nobody supports. The  exception are the staff of UNICEF who, whatever happens, will  not abandon the children with whom they manage to deal. But  this is the strength of certain individuals, not the actual  political fiber of the organization itself, which is bowed under  the excessive burden of too many crises, each of them too heavy.    But, apart from the organizational and logistical disasters  that have hindered it, the United Nations is unable to choose a  policy line, to form an autonomous world view. No more than can  the drivers of the few ambulances summoned to the site of too  many tragedies. However, this line of defense cannot apply to  the United States. The world's major power, we imagine, cannot  escape the need to occupy a position on the world's troubled  stage. This position should indicate its degree of involvement,  its timetable of commitments, its will to intervene, and the  need to abstain, in accordance with the principles that  presidents sometimes refer to as a "doctrine." This need is not  based on an inexorable ideological impetus (which of course  sometimes colors decisions, as in the case of Roosevelt's pledge  to intervene against Nazism and fascism).    It is based on an awareness of the fact that every tragic  and  uncontrolled event in world politics entails a cost. And that  this cost is bound to increase with the passage of time, the  increase of the tragedy, and the growth in the number of  victims. It is a cost that inevitably is laid on the table of  the American Government. I just mentioned Roosevelt, the great  leader of world antifascism. It is difficult not to consider (a  debate in this regard has recently begun in the United States)  how much more limited, in terms of destruction and lost lives,  World War II would have been if America, long misled by bad  advisers, had perceived the danger immediately.    However, the real problem is not reluctance to intervene,  but  the absence of a policy with its own design, a world view, and a  scale of responses capable of providing guidance,  clarifications, and explanations. And also [a policy] capable  of enabling the other actors on the world stage (for instance,  the Serbs with their field guns or the Arab governments that pay  the Hamas murderers working against Rabin and 'Arafat) to  foresee the danger to which they are exposing themselves.    This, in fact, the confused combination of the reluctance to  intervene and the virtually complete lack of a political vision,  is the essence of the tragedy entitled, "America's absence from  the world stage."    Doubtless the youthful President Clinton was elected  because of the dislike for the interventionism of the aging  George Bush, who grew up in the trenches of the Cold War, in  which every enemy move had to be countered immediately.    People saw the Iron Curtain collapse and tasted victory.  And, like after every victory, they wanted to return home.  Unfortunately, that which has been created around this "return  home," which Clinton has led, is not a reasonable practice of  limitation and cautions, but a redefinition of the "national  interest." While at the time of the Iron Curtain this interest  embraced virtually everything -- from a rising in Malaysia to a  government crisis in Italy -- now the new definition leaves the  page blank. Nothing, it has been theorized, must concern  America unless it affects its people, its territory, and its  economy.    This theory, some will point out, was formulated on the  Right  of the American political system. Its preacher in the latest  presidential campaign was Pat Buchanan, the Republican candidate  that challenged George Bush. That theory, though defeated in  the elections, has silently invaded American culture, occupying  its center, excluding only a humanitarian Left that continues  (in vain) to represent the cries of anguish.    This is how the great mistake occurred. The reasonable  tendency to intervene less in world affairs became entangled  with the questionable but peremptory definition of the "American  national interest." And it has led not to a policy of prudence  but to a nonpolicy.    The sensitive heart of the system, which is its efficient  and  communicative President, gives a voice to those who communicate  to him the suffering and tragedies of the world. But his hands  do nothing, his cabinet does not ponder, his people do not act.  Not even in order to say how they intend to limit their action.  There is no action. The result is a vast emptiness. In a  world without trustworthy governments that looks increasingly  like the engravings of Piranesi, the Milosevices run free and  the Zhirinovskiys act in the certainty that they can do so with  impunity. I am not talking about physical threats. I am  talking about the certainty of not violating any rules, because  the world's greatest power has set no rules to define what is  tolerable and what is intolerable.    It does not take a great political analyst to see that this  vacuum not only enlarges the extent of the tragedy and the  anguish that disturbs the world, but also betrays any definition  of the American national interest that is not abstract or  artificial. Sooner or later the cost of what is happening in  Gorazde and Rwanda, in Haiti, and among the terrorists, the new  torturers, and the new Nazis of the world will be laid at  Washington's table. And the cost will be very high. Not to  mention the dead.</p>

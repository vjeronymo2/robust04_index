			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "kmm": "Temelin-Type Nuclear Power Plant </F> Instead of Chernobyl"]    [Text] The Chernobyl conference convened at short notice  in Vienna will discuss until Friday [22 April] specific  possibilities concerning a shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear  power plant. As reported, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] had identified factors that seriously affect the safety  of the two rector blocks that are currently operating as well as  a deterioration of the shelter enclosing the reactor destroyed  in 1986.    "If Chernobyl is shut down, there are two alternatives to  ensure Ukraine's energy supply," IAEA Deputy Director Forrest  Remick, who is participating in the meeting, told KURIER.  "First, a more efficient use of energy, and second, the startup  of other power plants."    An agreement on the second alternative is possible. A total  of six nuclear power plants are under construction in Ukraine,  three of which might be completed within six months with  international help involving the equivalent of 2.4 billion  schillings, Remick pointed out. Important people are  participating in the Vienna conference, including the Ukrainian  deputy prime minister and representatives of the European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development.    The three reactors that are to be installed in Chernobyl are  WWER-1000 [water-cooled water-moderated] type. Reactors of this  kind have been used in the Temelin nuclear power plant in the  Czech Republic, which is to be completed with U.S. aid. This  issue is also being discussed by Chancellor Vranitzky during his  visit to the United States. On Tuesday [19 April] Prague's  Environment Minister did not rule out that an environmental  inspection might be carried out at Temelin.</p>

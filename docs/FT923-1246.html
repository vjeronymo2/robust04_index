			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: Tableaux vivants in search of a story - Cinema PATRIOT GAMES (15) Empire SWOON (18) Metro JUST LIKE A WOMAN (15) Odeon West End SECRET FRIENDS (15) MGM Tottenham Ct Rd CALIFORNIA MAN (PG) MGMs West End With Patriot Games and Swoon opening in one week, we have a definitive Yin and Yang of modern American cinema. On my right the latest large-screen, all-colour, exploding action thriller starring Harrison Ford and based on a Tom Clancy novel. On my left the strange, delicate and monochrome Swoon. This stars two actors we have never heard of before and is based, with many a deconstructionist trope and modernist gay inflection, on the Leopold-Loeb murder case of the 1920s. While Patriot Games will pack them in at every Odeon, Swoon will probably fill one and a half arthouses. And while Patriot Games gallops along using as narrative whip the tried-and-true question 'What next?', Swoon stands moodily in one place turning different facets of itself to the grainy light. Thanks to the riddling, fragmented structure of this film, written and directed by Tom Kalin, the question 'What next?' is replaced by 'What just happened?' History already knows the what-nexts in the Leopold-Loeb story and so do most moviegoers: they were fictionalised in Hitchcock's Rope and dramatised semi-factually in Richard Fleischer's Compulsion. Swoon makes us turn away from the known culmination points - murder, trial, life imprisonment - to search for earlier formative truths about the culprits and their society. Leopold and Loeb were two young gay lovers who murdered, seemingly without motive, a neighbour's child in Chicago in 1923. Theories grew like jungle weeds around the subsequent trial, where Clarence Darrow, no less, took the defence brief. Were L and L self-styled superman who had overdosed on Nietzsche readings? Were they common-or-garden sadists? Or were they affectless artists of life, seeking to sculpt the perfect crime? Writer-director Kalin gives us less an answer than a deepening conundrum. His film is series of tableaux vivants in search of a 'story.' Nathan Leopold (Craig Chester) and Richard Loeb (Daniel Schlachet) are young, spoilt and narcissistic; they are also grave, introspective and mysteriously resistant to the probings of police, lawyers and even film-maker. Swoon's power comes from its ability to provide a searing photogravure recreation of period and character - from Prohibition speakeasies to Gatsbyish tea parties, from grainy gay love scenes to shadow-strewn police interrogations  -and still to haunt us by leaving more questions than answers. In a mainstream Hollywood genre film this would be a fault. Why are the ends not tied up, the audience would cry in unison? Take Patriot Games. Here every loose end is painstakingly knotted by the close, as if by some demented Norn doing punishment time. I once opened Tom Clancy's novel with a view to reading it, but closed it again on realising its extreme dottiness. In the book CIA hero Jack Ryan heads off an IRA conspiracy against our royal family and has much badinage en route with the likes of Charles, Di, Philip and HM. In the film these persons are thrown out and replaced by an all-purpose fictive toff: James Fox as 'Lord Holmes.' Perhaps as well. What could the IRA do to the Windsor family that the Windsors are not doing to themselves already? So we have Provo thug Sean Bean attempting to assassinate Lord H outside Buck House; the happily on-hand Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) saving his nobship in the nick of time; and then Mr F spending the remaining 100 minutes eluding the deranged attentions of the pursuing Bean. It all ends on Cape Cod or somewhere, as the British Lord descends on the American Ford for dinner to hand him his honorary knighthood; whereupon, guess what, the lights go out and the mad Bean is revealed to be in the garden. This is one of those films where one cannot spoil the plot even by telling it. In the screen's last Clancy adventure, The Hunt For Red October, we had a red-hot story, about a defecting Soviet submarine captain, plus some clever casting: one newcomer (Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan) blended with one grizzled veteran (Sean Connery as the Russky). In Patriot Games the plot is threadbare and Harrison Ford's prolific serial-hero career to date (formerly Han Solo and Indy Jones) now lends a sense of deja vu to this latest parade of winks, nods and startled reaction shots. To these demerits we must add auto-pilot direction by Philip Noyce (Dead Calm) and an array of the usual wondrous Hollywood-goes-to-Britain topographical oddities. I was particularly struck by the chase scene which debouched from Piccadilly's Burlington Arcade into Aldwych tube station; though I must award a runner-up prize to the reference to Lymington the well-known port in 'Kent.' The list of Americans lost in Britain is large and growing larger. Gerald (Adrian Pasdar) in Just Like A Woman is an international banker living in London with his family; at least until he is thrown onto the streets by his wife when she discovers enough silk lingerie in his wardrobe to costume an entire Rainer Werner Fassbinder film. But Gerald is no adulterer. No; forced to answer the question 'Who was that lady we saw you with last night?' he would have to reply 'That was no lady, that was myself.' He is, in short, a transvestite. Shock for audience; nervous giggles from his new landlady Julie Walters; and then the sweet unfolding of a twin-track plot about passion en travestie, Pasdar bedding Miss W, and bewilderment in the boardroom. For our hero ends up outfacing his bigoted boss (Paul Freeman) and proving that a man can broker multi-million-dollar business deals even while wearing lipstick and high heels. Scripted by Nick Evans from Monica Jay's true-life story Geraldine - Miss Jay being the model for Walters's role - the film is endearing even when it sails close to that perilous concept, British comedy. There is many a telegraphic reaction shot and many a ho-ho supporting character. But whenever he is left alone with his two stars, both superb, director Chris Monger fashions a touching tale of love's ability to ride out stupefaction. Other new London openings are less auspicious. After Blackeyes Dennis Potter is still being allowed to operate a movie camera: result, Secret Friends. Alan Bates plays the walking, or sitting, identity crisis whose past life flashes before him during a British Rail journey. Attacked by flashbacks as if by violent indigestion, he is asked by the waiter in one scene if his sole was satisfactory. 'Soul?' jumps Bates - it is that kind of film - and after a brief nervous crisis he settles back into the mental jigsaw-work that occupies most of the film. His memories include two sexy women (Gina Bellman, Frances Barber), a bloody garden fork, a series of plant drawings, a mad vicar father and heaven knows what else. When twinned with a well-trained craftsman-director, Potter's stylistic paroxysms as a writer are usually welded and streamlined into art. See The Singing Detective or Dreamchild. When twinned with a fellow dervish in the director's chair - Nicolas Roeg in Track 29, himself here - confusion is confounded beyond all recall. Still, it beats California Man, scripted by Shawn Schepps and directed by Les Mayfield: a jokeless youth comedy from the same industry and mind-set that brought us Wayne's World. Here two high school boys (Sean Astin, Paul Shore) accidentally revive a deep-frozen caveman (Brendan Fraser). That the latter proves more intelligent and resourceful than most of the population of Los Angeles is supposed to be a surprise.</p>

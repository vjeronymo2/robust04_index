			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: A conservatory without historical pastiche STATISTICS tell us that adding a conservatory is top of the home-improvement popularity pole - but you have only to look in most decorating magazines to see that the prevailing taste seems to run to Victorian or Gothic-style reproductions. Form Design, with a fascinating project carried out on a listed house in Montpelier Row, Twickenham, not only has provided a successful solution for a particular house, but may perhaps provide inspiration for those who have always felt that there ought to be more to conservatory life than historical pastiche. Montpelier Row dates from 1720 and the lower ground floor area constituted about a quarter of the house area, but it was dark, dingy and unattractive. Form Design's brief was to liberate the space, to create a family kitchen and dining area as well as the conservatory, and to respect the original fabric and architecture of the house. Form Design aimed to make any new addition as neutral as possible and as contemporary as possible. As Malcolm Crayton, the architect in charge of the project puts it: 'We wanted to design in the spirit of the original building but did not want to create a pastiche.' The result is a clean, simple solution, which depends on a light touch, a respect for proportion, for simple planes and shapes. The company achieved this by building a frameless glass structure which allows the light to flow in from the south-facing garden. The company reversed the positions of the dining and kitchen areas. The low ceiling, is scarcely noticeable. All the finishes are light, from the steel and maple kitchen island, echoing the large, traditional kitchen table, to the honey-coloured limestone floor and colour-washed walls. Total cost of the project was Pounds 47,500. Form Design, 67 - 69 Chancery Lane, London, WC2A 1AF. Tel. 071.831.3850.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> THE HIGH PRICE OF OVERTIME;  </P> <P> AMERICA HAS A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTRA HOURS. THE PAY'S GOOD, BUT IT  COSTS WORKERS PLENTY.  </P> <P> Facing furious deadlines, Margaret Nix worked 34 out of every 35 days on the  Boeing Co.'s aircraft assembly line. Mandatory overtime, 12-hour days. She  gained a pile of money. She lost a disgruntled husband. Then her teen-age  daughter suffered an unrelated psychological breakdown.  </P> <P> One day Nix, who asked that her real name not be used, tried to coax the  withdrawn girl to recall some of the family's good times.  </P> <P> "Mom," her daughter said, "you were never home."  </P> <P> Such stories, drenched in guilt and anger, contributed to a 48-day strike last  fall by 57,000 Boeing machinists. Some of the strikers carried picket signs  demanding stricter limits on overtime with slogans such as, "Do your children  know what you look like?"  </P> <P> Life at Boeing -- where the company now promises to limit overtime to a mere  144 hours every three months -- is an extreme example of the pressure overtime  work can generate. Yet late in the afternoon each day in many offices and  factories, the same kind of tension gurgles in the stomachs of hundreds of  thousands of employees who pray that they won't be asked or ordered to work  overtime -- and those who are equally hopeful that they will.  </P> <P> America's work force has a love-hate relationship with overtime. On one side  are people desperate for more money. On the other are people desperate for more  personal time.  </P> <P> For every Margaret Nix at Boeing there is a co-worker like Charles Anderson, a  generation younger, who came to the Everett plant last year badly in debt and  volunteered to work far beyond maximum mandatory overtime to pull his bank  balance up. Figure it. If you work 20 hours a week overtime on a $14-an-hour  machinist job -- and Anderson has worked as many as 40 extra hours some weeks  -- your pay shoots from $560 to $980.  </P> <P> Some Boeing workers are relieved that the company is cutting back on OT in the  wake of the strike. But Anderson, who is married and the father of a 2-year-old  daughter he barely knew until the strike, is going crazy. He was planning on  buying a house this spring. Now he's uncertain if he'll make enough money to do  it.  </P> <P> More than 10 million Americans who work for hourly wages supplement their  paychecks by $40 billion to $50 billion a year by working an average of nine  extra hours a week at time-and-a-half. The money pays for things as  discretionary as vacations and as crucial as mortgages and cars.  </P> <P> Overtime can mean limitless potential for some workers, such as the Los Angeles  County fireman who worked so many consecutive 24-hour shifts a few years ago  that he made $98,000 -- more than the county fire chief. It can mean countless  headaches for others, such as the working mothers who make frantic telephone  calls to day-care centers to say they'll be late. It generates arguments with  supervisors over uncomfortable questions -- who should get first dibs on OT,  who should volunteer, or who should be volunteered on days when nobody wants to  work the extra hours.  </P> <P> Overtime is the grease that allows many companies to pare their work forces in  this era of so-called "lean-and-mean" business. It is the friction that drives  many of today's demands for flexible schedules and child-care facilities at  businesses for the convenience of working parents.  </P> <P> Mandatory overtime, particularly when assigned with little notice, "is one of  the last holdouts" in the debate over balancing work and family concerns, said  Dr. Susan Ginsberg, editor of a work and family life newspaper at Bank Street  College in New York.  </P> <P> "Flex time, child care, changing maternity benefits -- they're all being  discussed, but there's not much awareness of the overtime issue" as the cause  of personal chaos, Ginsberg said.  </P> <P> All told, 34 million people -- nearly one-third of the nation's work force --  work more than 40 hours a week. Most do not get paid for their extra hours  because they are either self-employed or are salaried supervisors or  "professionals" exempt from the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which  requires time-and-a-half for work beyond eight hours a day or 40 hours a week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comp Time  </P> <P> Some uncompensated overtime workers take off extra days or weeks of "comp time"  each year. However, three-quarters of the nation's employers do not permit comp  time, according to preliminary results of a survey of 197 companies by the  Bureau of National Affairs Inc.  </P> <P> The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has not separately surveyed paid  overtime workers since 1985. Its current surveys, which lump together those who  labor with and without overtime pay, show that 12.6 million Americans work 49  to 59 hours a week and another 9.3 million work 60 or more hours.  </P> <P> These numbers are climbing twice as fast as the size of the work force.  </P> <P> While the total number of employed persons rose 19% in the past decade, the  number working 49 to 59 hours rose 46%. The number working 60 or more hours  rose 38%.  </P> <P> These increases have contributed to today's portrait of a sometimes strained  American family life.  </P> <P> Median weekly hours worked by Americans increased 20% between 1973 and 1985,  from 40.6 a week to 48.8, while the leisure time plummeted 32%, from 26.2 hours  to 17.7 hours, according to polls taken by Louis Harris &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> Americans are working harder because earnings by hourly workers have lagged 15%  behind consumer price increases since the late 1970s, labor economists say. Not  only does the number of two-income households continue to rise, but more than 7  million people now work two jobs -- the highest level in more than 30 years.  </P> <P> The notion that there may be something fundamentally harmful about longer  working hours is scarcely audible. Yet it was not always this way.  </P> <P> One of the earliest contributions of the American organized labor movement  since its inception in the early 19th Century was to lobby for reduced working  hours. In the early 20th Century, with the average workweek still above 50  hours, there was considerable Utopian debate about how leisure -- not work --  might one day become man's prime concern as technology freed him from long,  backbreaking days.  </P> <P> During the Depression, the notion of shorter hours gained political support as  a way to spread a severely limited number of jobs. Legislation to create a  30-hour workweek passed the U.S. Senate in the early 1930s and appeared to have  strong momentum. But President Franklin D. Roosevelt eventually refused to  support it, countering with a series of public works programs to create more  jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Course Is Set  </P> <P> It was this change of philosophy -- trading shorter hours for the right to work  -- that set the nation on its present course, said Benjamin K. Hunnicutt, a  professor of leisure studies at the University of Iowa who wrote "Work Without  End." Most Americans have now come to define themselves by their jobs, not  their beliefs, and shorter hours are regarded as a negative economic indicator,  he said.  </P> <P> Most West European nations, by contrast, have significantly shortened work  hours since World War II. The European workweek is now generally shorter than  the American week, and vacations are significantly longer. Many European  countries have national limits on overtime.  </P> <P> In this country, the overtime premium created by the Fair Labor Standards Act,  passed in 1938, was intended as a penalty to coerce employers into hiring more  people rather than using longer shifts. But it lost most of its force long ago.  </P> <P> Because of the soaring costs of company-paid health insurance and other  benefits, which now make up 25% to 35% of the cost of compensation, employers  find it far cheaper to scale back the number of permanent employees and get the  job done by paying overtime.  </P> <P> For example, while the manufacturing sector of the economy saw significant  layoffs during the 1980s, the average weekly overtime of individual  manufacturing workers increased 40% from 1980 to 1988.  </P> <P> Dan Trammell, a Los Angeles attorney who represents mostly salaried employees  in worker's compensation cases, says he sees an increasing number of cases in  which excessive hours contribute to health problems.  </P> <P> "Employers are shrinking their staffs, and when they do that they cut muscle,  bone and everything else as well as fat, and those who are left are absolutely  going over the edge . . . they feel overwhelmed," he said.  </P> <P> John Zalusky, an AFL-CIO economist, said that in order to force employers to  use more hourly workers instead of relying on overtime, the labor standards act  would have to be amended to require triple pay for overtime.  </P> <P> Delegates to the AFL-CIO's biannual constitutional convention last fall  advocated such a change, but the issue is not a high priority to organized  labor because a significant number of its members, particularly younger  workers, want all the overtime they can get.  </P> <P> "What's difficult for organized labor is that they have two constituencies,"  said Richard Belous, an economist with the National Planning Assn. who  specializes in work-related issues.  </P> <P> With many workers feeling stretched by low wage growth and insecure about the  future because of corporate restructuring that has laid off millions of  employees, the idea of limiting overtime sounds quixotic or plain threatening.  </P> <P> There was no better illustration of this addiction to overtime than what  happened a couple months ago in a Chrysler mini-van plant in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Chrysler wanted to cut a deal with Local 110 of the United Auto Workers. It  wanted to change the plant, where workers average 54 hours a week, to a  four-day week with a standard 10-hour shift. Chrysler would boost production by  20%, absorbing 1,000 to 1,300 workers who were about to be laid off at a nearby  plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Workers Say No  </P> <P> The proposal sounded attractive, for it would preserve jobs in a beleaguered  industry. However, Local 110's rank-and-file objected because they would no  longer receive overtime for working 10-hour days. In addition, Chrysler wanted  to cut Saturday overtime from time-and-a-half to time-and-a-quarter.  </P> <P> The union, whose approval was needed to modify an existing contract, voted  2,340 to 300 against the expansion plan, triggering an onslaught of publicity  branding them as selfish.  </P> <P> "They wanted us to work the same amount of hours for less pay," said Charlie  Sides, the local's recording secretary. "You need the money because you never  know when it's (the plant) going to shut down again."  </P> <P> When the International Assn. of Machinists' contract with Boeing expired last  fall, the aerospace company offered to drop its maximum overtime limit of 200  hours per quarter -- about 15 hours a week -- to 160. But because the union  wanted a larger hourly wage increase and less mandatory OT, a strike was  called.  </P> <P> In settling the strike, Boeing resisted demands for further hourly wage  increases, but increased the size of year-end bonuses. In addition to cutting  mandatory overtime to 144 hours per quarter, it cut mandatory weekend overtime  from three consecutive weekends to two and said that working either a Saturday  or Sunday -- not both days, as before -- would constitute overtime weekend  work. In addition, for the first time, all overtime work over 160 hours per  quarter will earn double time.  </P> <P> For all the value an employer can squeeze out of a work force by using  overtime, smart bosses recognize the hazards of burn-out that come with too  much mandatory OT, said Norman Handshear, an aerospace executive who is  president of the American Compensation Assn.  </P> <P> Conrad J. Conway, administrative manager of GE Plastics in Oxnard, confronts  this choice often. Conway runs a 24-hour factory and spends 8% to 10% of his  payroll on overtime, but has chosen on occasion to shut down some of his  machinery when he can't find enough volunteers to work overtime.  </P> <P> "We don't have mandatory overtime here," he said. "We do at times talk to  people about the need to share the overtime burden, ask non-participants to  pick up some, but I don't think there's any merit in mandatory overtime. It  spreads out the effort but it probably leads to hard feelings."  </P> <P> The effort was spread as broadly as possible -- and with considerable hard  feelings -- at Vons market distribution center in El Monte last year.  </P> <P> Vons spent much of 1989 trying to integrate its stores with the newly acquired  Safeway chain, an effort that put particular pressures on the distribution  center's warehouses. Mandatory overtime resulted in months of 12-hour to  16-hour days for many of the 250 warehouse workers.  </P> <P> "I had nine, maybe a dozen wives call me during that time to chew my butt off  about how much the guys were working," said Tony Perez, a business agent for  the United Food and Commercial Workers local that represents the workers.  </P> <P> Because the union contract calls for double-time pay after 10 hours, warehouse  workers, who make between $5 and $13 an hour, saw huge checks.  </P> <P> Gary Anderson, a 25-year employee from Rialto, paid off all his bills and  bought a new Thunderbird, but there is no sparkle in his eye when he talks  about it.  </P> <P> For five months, Anderson said, his wife moved out of the house because she  couldn't put up with his constant irritability, due mostly to a lack of sleep.  </P> <P> "I was working 36 to 45 hours OT a week but the money didn't mean too much to  me," Anderson said. "Sometimes there wouldn't be eight hours between going home  and coming back. I'd be sleeping four, five hours a day. A lot of times I'd  doze off driving home."  </P> <P> Desperate, the union had its attorney send Vons a letter warning that unless  overtime was reduced, Vons could be legally liable for any traffic accidents  its workers were involved in when they commuted.  </P> <P> After six months, the worst of the overtime ended as the Safeway acquisition  work smoothed out.  </P> <P> A week ago something strange happened to Anderson.  </P> <P> "I saw my first eight-hour day in I don't know how long," he said. "I snuck out  the (warehouse) door."  </P> <P> His wife, who had moved back, was shocked.  </P> <P> "She said she thought someone was trying to break into the house," Anderson  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHO GETS OVERTIME  </P> <P> Chart shows percentage of U.S. companies that pay these selected categories of  workers for overtime work.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> CATEGORY  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PERCENTAGE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Office/clerical  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 98  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Production/service  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 96  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Professional/technical  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 57  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> First-level supervisors  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 29  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Middle management  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT OVERTIME PAYS  </P> <P> Chart shows what kind of compensation companies pay for overtime.  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.08IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> COMPENSATION  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PERCENTAGE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Straight time  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Time-and-a-half  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 97  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Double time  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Straight compensatory time  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Compensatory time at time-and-a-half  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Other  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> NOTE: Percentage add up to more than 100% because many companies use more than  one method.  </P> <P> SOURCE: Bureau of National Affairs Inc.  </P></p>

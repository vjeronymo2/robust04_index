			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESEARCH USING FETAL TISSUE  </P> <P> Thank you for bringing up the subject of fetal tissue transplants.  Unfortunately, it was little more than another example of media bias against  unborn children.  </P> <P> Out of 61 inches of print, a mere 1 inch is given to the pro-life side, a token  comment by Dr. John Wilke, president of the National Right to Life Committee.  </P> <P> While I sympathize with those who suffer from Parkinson's, I also grieve for  the lives of the unborn who die from abortion. I am diminished by their  wrongful deaths. You don't anticipate the murder of a child and then say, "Hey,  get that body over here so we can help somebody!"  </P> <P> Without debating whether dead babies can help people, we must remember that  fetal brain tissue grows quite well in the baby who remains in the womb where  God intended him or her to stay until birth.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS GWINN  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

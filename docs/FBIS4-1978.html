			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, April 2 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Guizhou Province is introducing foreign funds to develop its  agriculture.    According to the provincial government, since 1985 the  province has undertaken 15 foreign-aided programs including  those introducing talents, technology and funds.    The total investment in the programs amounts to 250 million  yuan.    A Japanese-aided grain program started in 1990 and is being  carried out in about 30 poverty-stricken townships mainly  inhabited by ethnic minority people.    The program has benefited 78,000 households and about  350,000  people.    The grain program aims to increase yields to cover 20,000  hectares of farmland and produce 154.5 million kilograms of  grain by the end of 1993, an increase of 67.75 percent over the  original yield of the farmland.    The grain output per capita in the program target townships  has increased from 253 kilograms to 439 kilograms and the income  per capita from 184 yuan to 311.5 yuan, respectively increasing  by 68 and 69 percent.    A land-transformation program supported by the New Zealand  Government and started in July 1992 has fulfilled its targets in  grass cultivation and animal husbandry.    A survey of 128 households in the program target areas  showed  that the grain output in the areas has grown by 34 percent.    Investigation in Longli County showed that the grain output  per capita already reached 336.8 kilograms last year, increasing  by 15.5 percent over the previous year.    The income from livestock farming per household was 1,325  yuan.    The World Food Program's 3,146 project is the largest  agricultural project in Guizhou Province.    The project, which was started in 1988, is to help five  cities and counties where Miao and Buyi nationalities live to  transform low-yield farmland in order to raise grain output.    The project aims to construct 3,600 hectares of irrigatable  farmland and provide drinking water for 13,000 people and 7,000  cattle.    Recently an expert group sent to Guizhou by the World Food  Program pronounced its satisfaction with the ongoing program  after completing its investigation.</p>

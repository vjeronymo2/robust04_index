			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / France admits defeat on reactor France said yesterday it was abandoning its long and costly bid to run the accident-prone Superphenix fast-breeder nuclear reactor as the world's first commercial-scale breeder reactor and use it for research only. The reactor would be used primarily for research into eliminating the plutonium byproduct and other radioactive waste from ordinary French reactors, the government said. Superphenix was built at a cost of FFr29bn (Dollars 4.84bn) to produce up to 1,200MW of electricity, but it has run at full power for only 174 days since it was commissioned in 1986. Last month, the French nuclear safety directorate said Superphenix could be restarted, but at less than full power and only if current work to improve the safety of its sodium cooling system was finished. The reactor has been shut down since a liquid sodium fire in July 1990. Yesterday, the government said its decision not to restart the reactor at full power was also because it wanted to limit the quantity of plutonium it produced. A breeder reactor can in theory, as its name implies, produce more fuel than it consumes. This feature was considered an advantage when Superphenix was conceived in the 1970s but has since been undermined by the fall in uranium prices.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Inner city initiatives have failed says report GOVERNMENT policies aimed at reversing inner city decline have largely failed, a report from the independent Policy Studies Institute concludes today. The report's overall finding - that 15 years of urban-aid programmes have left the gap between deprived areas and the rest of the country as wide as it was or worse - comes at an embarrassing time for the government. On Thursday ministers will announce successful bidders in City Challenge, the latest in a long series of initiatives aimed at reviving the inner cities. The report acknowledges that City Challenge - under which local authorities bid competitively for government funds for specific urban projects - and the government's proposal for an Urban Regeneration Agency have not had time to prove themselves. It says, however, that 'given the record so far, it is difficult to have much confidence in more of the same'. The report uses official statistics to examine employment, education, training, poverty, health and housing in deprived areas. 'Under most headings, the gap between conditions in deprived areas and other kinds of place remains as wide as it was a decade and a half ago. In some respects the gap is wider,' it concludes. Ministers hope City Challenge, by making local authorities think competitively about priorities and work with the private sector, will be more successful than previous initiatives. They are keen that the announcement of the City Challenge winners should not mean that projects which fail to gain funding through the scheme are inevitably shelved. Particular importance is attached to maintaining private sector interest in the proposals. Another possibility might be for some City Challenge 'runners-up' to be considered by the Urban Regeneration Agency to be set up through legislation in the autumn.

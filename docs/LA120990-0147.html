			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DOMINGUEZ HILLS FALLS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE  </P> <P> When the buzzer sounded ending regulation play Saturday night at Southern  California College, the Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team thought  it had won its third game of the season.  </P> <P> But referee Dave Maddux, who was near midcourt, made a delayed call that  allowed a desperation layup by Vanguard Jeff Bickmore to count although it  appeared the clock had run out. The shot tied the score of non-conference game,  60-60, and the Vanguards went on to defeat Dominguez Hills, 67-64, in overtime.  </P> <P> It was the third overtime loss for Dominguez Hills (2-4) this season.  </P> <P> The controversy surrounding the final seconds of regulation play was only a  small portion of a wild and sometimes out-of-control game.  </P> <P> "It was pretty obvious that that shot was after the buzzer," Toro Coach Dave  Yanai said. "But we had plenty of opportunities to nail down a victory for  ourselves and we didn't knock them down."  </P> <P> Yanai was talking about free throws. The Toros missed six foul shots in the  final minutes of regulation and the overtime period.  </P> <P> "When you put yourself in that kind of situation by not taking care of  opportunities earlier in the game, you set yourself up for a call like that to  make a difference," Yanai said.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills trailed by as many as nine points, but rallied to tie the  score, 54-54, on a basket by guard Robert Barksdale with 6:07 to go in  regulation.  </P> <P> In the final 1:50, center Michael Moore and guard John Brown missed a pair of  free throws.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills took the lead with four seconds left on a rebound basket by  center Albert Kiilehua.  </P> <P> On the inbounds pass, the Vanguards' Jason Quinn brought the ball along the  right side of the court, and once across the midcourt, flung a desperation shot  that hit the bottom of the rim.  </P> <P> But under the basket stood Bickmore, who scored on a reverse lay-in as  Dominguez Hills players celebrated.  </P> <P> It was a physical final five minutes. Barksdale missed one of two free throws  and so did Vincent Washington.  </P> <P> Bickmore gave SCC the lead for good, 64-63, when he made one of two free throws  with 1:07 remaining.  </P> <P> Brown's three-point shot from the left corner bounced off the rim as the buzzer  sounded.  </P></p>

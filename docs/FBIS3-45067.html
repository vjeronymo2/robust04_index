			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Peasant Brothers, Do Not Be </F> Reluctant To Sell Your Grain"]    [Text] Recently grain prices have risen sharply in some  parts of southern China, and this is not a normal phenomenon.  China's grain harvest this year is larger than that of last  year, there are sufficient grain reserves, and there is no  problem with the balance of supply and demand. Due to the  unusually low grain prices in the past, appropriate rises in  grain prices under market regulation are inevitable. However,  the drastic rises we are now seeing are totally propelled by  certain temporary and psychological factors.    What needs to be pointed out is that some of our peasant  brothers are reluctant to sell grain in the face of abnormally  sharp price rises. Believing that "it is better to sell when  prices are going down, not up," they intend to store more grain  and wait for a better price. Is their belief correct? The  answer is no.    It is no cause for criticism that farmers intend to sell  their products at higher prices for more profit. Past sales of  grain at unduly low prices have already been noticed by both the  central and local governments. After the decontrol of grain  prices, a considerable rise has been registered in grain prices,  thus enabling the price to keep up with the value. The decision  of the central authorities to raise the price of grain next year  is a measure to equalize grain prices and value. As a special  commodity with great bearing on the state as a whole and on the  everyday life of the people, grain is subject to market rules,  and restricted by the risk-enduring capacity of urban grain  consumers. When grain prices rise drastically, it is necessary  for the state to adopt economic control and regulation measures,  or other measures. That is why the State Council has decided to  draw upon grain stocks to ease prices. Therefore, we have every  reason to say that people who intend to store up grain and wait  for a higher price will fail to attain their hope, and it is  possible that they will not be able to sell their grain at  today's prices.    Peasants in China have always had a strong sense of the  state  and the whole situation. Starting next year, China will take  major steps in reforming the systems of finance, taxation,  monetary industry, and investment. This set of positive and  stable programs follows the common rules of the market economy,  uses the successful experience of advanced countries for  reference, gives full consideration to China's national  conditions and today's realities, and tries to take care of the  interests of all sides in every possible way. Implementation of  this set of well-coordinated reform programs will enable China  to take a big step forward in its cause of reform and opening  up, and in its economic development. However, to put into  practice all these major reforms, we need to have a sound  environment, and a stable market remains an important factor.  The reluctance of peasant brothers to sell grain is exacerbating  the abnormally sharp price rises, and as a result, the stability  of the entire market will be weakened, and this situation is  unfavorable for the state to start its major reforms next year.  On the contrary, if peasant brothers continue selling their  grain as they should, they help soothe grain prices and  stabilize the market. This will help the state to implement its  major reform measures next year.    Peasant brothers, gain a farther and broader vision, do not  be reluctant to sell grain, and try to carry out production and  operation in a normal manner.</p>

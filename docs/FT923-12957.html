			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Marriott buys Hungarian hotel stake MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotels group, has topped bids by rival hotel groups Intercontinental and Ramada to win control of the Duna Intercontinental, one of Hungary's leading hotels. Marriott will pay more than Dollars 20m for the state shareholding in the hotel, a price which was influenced by the shortage of hotel space and prime sites for development in Budapest. The Duna Intercontinental went to Marriott after three rounds of bidding described by the State Property Agency, the Hungarian privatisation authority, as a close battle. The SPA admitted it would have been easier to sell the hotel to the Intercontinental group, whose bid was a close second. It already held a franchise agreement with Hungarhotels, the Hungarian state hotel chain which operated the Duna Intercontinental. But the agency said it had not managed to come to terms with Intercontinental on a valuation of the franchise contract. Moreover, the SPA feels that its decision dispels scepticism about its commitment to competitive bidding in substance as well as form. The transaction is the first belated result of Hungary's two-year drive to privatise Hungarhotels, Danubius and Pannonia, the three state-owned hotel chains. With the revenues from the disposals of individual hotels, the authorities are trying to reduce the hotel groups' debts and make the pared-down chains more attractive candidates for privatisation. The government plans this autumn to float Danubius and Pick Szeged, the meat and salami producer. These will be sold off through the stock market, reviving this form of privatisation. Preference will be given to small domestic investors in both privatisation issues, whose planned structure bears strong parallels to the British model. Under consideration, at least for the Pick public offering, are price discounts of about 10 per cent, deferred payment or bonus shares. Nevertheless, the agency said there would be plenty of shares left for international investors. James Capel, the UK investment bank advising on both transactions, said that Danubius would seek a listing on SEAQ International in London. The advisers said they would try to place privately about 40 per cent of Pick, mainly in the US. Danubius and Pick will be among the largest privatisation issues so far in eastern Europe. James Capel executives said that the Danubius issue, for about 50 per cent of the company, would be worth more than Dollars 100m. The advisers hope that the Pick offering, for about 70 per cent, would raise about half that. Pick is one of Hungary's largest food producers, with sales of Ft10.5bn (Dollars 135m) last year, on which the company made Ft640m profits pretax. The announcement marks a change of emphasis for Hungary after two years in which foreign, mainly multinational investors have dominated privatisation and the process has lost some public support.</p>

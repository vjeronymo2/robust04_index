			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Marshal  Kim Chong-il received a congratulatory message on Sunday from  the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on the 30th anniversary of  the start of work by him at the Central Committee of the  Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    The message says:    "You, respected general, took the first step of your great  leadership at the WPK Central Committee on June 19, 1964. This  was a historical event which definitely guaranteed the  inheritance and accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of  chuche.    "You have glorified the immortal chuche idea as the great  guiding idea of our era and strengthened and developed the WPK  to see that miracles and changes for the century were effected  in the revolution and construction with the might of the  singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.    "You, respected comrade supreme commander with unexcelled  grit, iron will, brilliant resources and commanding art of a  famous general who descended from the heaven, have reared the  People's Army into a matchless army each man of which `can match  a hundred foes' and made Korea of chuche rise up imposingly as  an impregnable military power.    "Your astonishing revolutionary feats in leading the  worldwide movement for rebuilding socialism along a straight  road to victory, displaying the invincibility of anthropocentric  Korean-style socialism under the grim situation in which the  imperialists and reactionaries are getting hysteric in the moves  to stifle the DPRK on all sides are throwing brilliant rays on  human history."    The message states that Chongnyon will successfully  discharge  its noble duty in the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause  of chuche, trusting and following only the respected general in  the future, too.    It wishes the respected Supreme Commander General Kim  Chong-il a long life in good health.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Swiss turn Polly Peck papers over to SFO SWISS authorities have turned over more than 20,000 bank documents to the Serious Fraud Office in connection with its investigation of Polly Peck International. The move demonstrates the Swiss desire to shed its reputation for shielding financial criminals, especially since Britain has refused up to now to sign mutual assistance treaties on criminal matters with Switzerland. 'What is interesting about this story is that the documents are going to Britain. I had not heard that the British were willing to co-operate with us,' Mr Andreas Hubschmid, first secretary of the Swiss Bankers Association, said yesterday. Mr Peter Cosandey, the Zurich district attorney, said that the documents concerned bank transactions worth more than SFr100m (Pounds 39.5m) adding that no bank accounts had been blocked as there was now no money in them. He said that the records were transferred to the SFO in connection with charges of theft, fraud and false accounting laid against Mr Asil Nadir, the group's former chairman.</p>

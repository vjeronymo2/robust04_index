			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, April 25 (AFP) -- Saudi police arrested  five political rights activists in the northern town of Ha'il at  the weekend, a London-based Saudi human rights group said Monday  [25 April].    The Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights said the  five teachers and Muslim clerics supported its calls for  political reforms in the kingdom, which has no parties and is  governed according to Islamic principles.    A statement from the committee sent to AFP said police also  arrested the son of Muhammad al-Massari, one of the group's  founders, on Saturday.    Anwar Muhammad al-Massari, 19, was arrested "to put pressure  on his father," who left Saudi Arabia to relaunch the committee  in London, the committee said.    His father, a physics professor at Riyadh University, was  arrested in May 1993 with a group of other Saudi intellectuals  only days after the group was set up.    He was held for five months without charge, said the group,  which is banned in Saudi Arabia and is pressing for freedom of  speech and association.    On Saturday, Arab diplomats in Riyadh said Gulf Arab states  had reservations about a US document calling on them to  encourage pluralism and democracy as the basis of future  relations in the Middle East.    The document, presented to the Gulf Cooperation Council  (GCC)  in February, said Washington wanted to see participants in the  multilateral Middle East peace talks "encourage individual and  collective freedoms and pursue democracy and pluralism."    Foreign Ministry officials from GCC members Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman met  in Riyadh on Saturday to discuss the document.    Of the six GCC states, only Kuwait has a freely elected  parliament with various political groups represented. The other  five have specially-appointed consultative assemblies.    US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to visit Riyadh  as part of a Middle East tour starting Tuesday [26 April].</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Busines and the Environment: Survival in scrap metal suburb / A look at Hanoi's complex recycling network Despite its low level of economic development, the Vietnamese capital Hanoi has a sophisticated network for waste re-use and recycling. From individual rubbish collectors to large industrial plants, more than one third of the hundreds of tonnes of waste produced in Hanoi every day is re-cycled. In more prosperous western countries, recycled paper and glass products are popular and fashionable. In poorer countries like Vietnam, where thousands of people make their living by collecting and selling paper, plastic, glass and metal, recycling is a necessity and a part of daily life. At a junk yard on the outskirts of Hanoi, workers dismantle old trucks and sort through heaps of scrap metal. Different grades are sold on to be melted down and re-used as pipes and reinforcement bars. The scrap metal trade is at the more lucrative end of Vietnam's recycling industry. Throughout the country, people collect discarded metal objects and bring them to places like the suburb of O Cho Dua to sell to the dealers' yards. Collecting scrap metal is a risky business in a country devastated by 20 years of war. In a village outside Hanoi, a pair of bomb casings has been turned into gateposts, but every year dozens of people are injured and a few killed when they try to move unexploded bombs for sale as scrap metal. In O Cho Dua, the recycled scrap is turned into building materials. Old reinforcement bars are beaten back into shape and newly-delivered tubes made from recycled waste are welded together, covered in plastic, assembled and sold as shelving in the city's roadside furniture shops. Along the streets of the capital, there is a well-organised system for collecting rubbish. Dozens of small, three-wheeled carts do their rounds throughout the day, clearing up waste. When the carts are full, they are emptied into large piles where scavengers pick out anything with a resale value. Elsewhere in Hanoi, old women go from door to door buying old bottles, jars, plastic and paper for a few cents. When one of them has a full load, they head for one of the hundreds of junk shops. These traders are the next link in the recycling chain. They buy piles of cardboard, baskets of bottles or bags full of scrap metal, which they keep until they have enough to sell on to a bigger dealer or factory. All this waste will then be either sold for re-use or melted down and turned into something new. As well as the scrap metal suburb, there are other areas around Hanoi that specialise in waste recycling. One is known as 'plastic village' because almost all of its inhabitants make their living from collecting and selling plastic waste. Outside one house is a foul heap of rotting plastic. The owner of the house says he makes good money by storing old plastic and then selling it on to a recycling plant. One of these small factories will make the plastic into soles for plastic sandals or melt it down to produce roofing sheets for the city's booming construction industry. Some of the better quality waste is simply sold for re-use. Plastic bottles and glass jars are sold for a couple of cents for domestic use or are taken back to the factory and refilled. There is even some cross-border recycling. Empty bottles of Chinese beer are collected and taken north across the border to be refilled. Through a combination of poverty and enterprise, not much goes to waste in Hanoi and instead of being burned or dumped at an expensive land-fill site, much of the city's rubbish is put back to work.</p>

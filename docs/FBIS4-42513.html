			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Bofinger, professor of economics at the </F> University of Wuerzburg: "The Bundesbank Is Chasing an Illusion;  Its Money Supply Policy Concept Is Not Convincing; M3 Is of  Unreliable Quality as an Indicator"]    [Text] German monetary policy has rarely been as  contradictory as in these months. The M3 money supply is  expanding at a double-digit annual rate, and during the rest of  the year will hardly achieve the target of 4 to 6 percent which  is to make possible an inflation-free economic growth. In spite  of that, key interest rates have been further lowered to this  day, while the Bundesbank announces at every turn that, in  principle, it will hold onto its money supply concept.    One can find an attempt to resolve this contradiction in the  bank's latest business report. Although it admits "inconstancies  in the shorter-term money supply development," it stresses at  the same time that the longer-term links between the growth of  the money supply and price development have "not been decisively  touched" by it. The M3 money supply remains "a suitable nominal  anchor for a stability-oriented monetary policy."    But probably it is not quite that simple. First, the  question  arises how the Bundesbank actually knows that the money demand  function, which statistically depicts the dependency  relationship between money supply and price level, has remained  stable since the German currency union. With the data for the  expanded currency area of the German mark, available only since  1990/91, it is very difficult to estimate precisely these  longer-term links. If the Bundesbank, however, is in possession  of such computations, it should not withhold them from the  public.    Furthermore, one must take into consideration that the  monetary development of recent years was not only characterized  by "inconstancies" due to temporary shocks, but above all by an  unusually high growth trend: The M3 money supply from January  1992 to today shows an annual growth trend of 8.2 percent; the  "expanded M3 money supply" even grew at a rate of about 10  percent per year. If one prefers this latter figure, since it  also takes into account the shifts to the Euromarket due to  minimum reserves, one must note that the monetary expansion for  over three years has been almost twice as high as the  Bundesbank's target figure. If one were to trust in the  stability of the medium-term connection between money supply and  inflation--as the Bundesbank does--one would have to arrive at  the conclusion that German monetary policy is clearly on an  inflationary course. But since there are no signs whatsoever of  this, one cannot avoid putting into question, in principle, the  quality of the M3 money supply as an indicator. That may seem  more radical than it is. After all, even the Central Bank  Council--despite all official declarations--has never held to  this self-chosen compass in the 11 rounds of interest rate  lowerings it initiated since the fall of 1992.    Hence it would be time for the Bundesbank to also officially  part from its illusion of a money supply policy. The central  banks of other large countries, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve  and the Bank of England, took this step years ago. The  Bundesbank is probably shying away from this, above all, because  it fears negative effects on its credibility. That can hardly be  expected, however, since the money supply targets were handled  rather liberally in the past also. Of the 20 target settings  announced since 1975, only 10 were actually achieved. With such  a "hit score," it can hardly be because of the money supply  concept that the Bundesbank managed to achieve such a high  degree of reputation. One cannot convince markets with mere  declarations of intent. Rather, the decisive fact was that the  Bundesbank, when in doubt, has always used its maneuvering room  in decisionmaking in favor of the goal of price stability. In  this light, German monetary policy has succeeded not because of,  but despite, the money supply concept to preserve its  credibility. Yet one should not overtax the patience of the  markets. A renunciation of the money supply concept is probably  difficult for the Bundesbank because thereby it would have to  express within the Central Bank Council, and also in public,  that the current monetary policy can no longer be oriented along  a--practically objective--medium-term target line. Thus it would  become clear how complex the business of monetary policy has  become: The interest rate level on the money market must  continually be controlled so that a stable price level can be  achieved, even in the medium term. Since monetary impulses  affect the value of money only in a delayed fashion, the  Bundesbank cannot be guided solely by the present inflation  rate, but must also take into account and cope with a great  number of indicators. This decisionmaking process would have to  become more transparent by breaking with the money supply  concept, and also imbue public discussion with a new quality.  Instead of a futile debate on ever new interference factors in  M3, there could be a comprehensive discussion of how one can  conduct a stability-oriented monetary policy even without a  money supply target. Not least of all, such a conceptual  clarification would be fitting in order to provide clear  leadership on the part of Germany in the upcoming debate on the  monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank. The  European partners can hardly be won over to a money supply  concept to which the Bundesbank itself does not adhere.    So there are good reasons for the Bundesbank to separate  myth  from reality better than in the past. If it wants to stick to  the money supply concept at any price, it must prove  convincingly that a stable link between money supply and  inflation is still valid, and must also express this in its  policy. If it wants to continue proceeding "pragmatically," it  should refrain from constantly reiterating its money supply  strategy, and rather should clarify on the basis of which  criteria it actually makes its decisions. Anything else is not  very compatible with the claim to credibility.</p>

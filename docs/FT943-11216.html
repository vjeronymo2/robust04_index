			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Lords hit at EC over visa list plan A House of Lords report published today accuses the European Commission of exceeding its powers by seeking to impose visa requirements that narrow the drawbridge to 'fortress Europe'. Citizens of Commonwealth countries now entitled to make 'short-stay' visits to the UK would be affected by a proposed regulation establishing a list of countries whose nationals would require visas to visit any state of the European Union. The European communities committee calls for a 'significant pruning' of the proposed list. This call is aimed particularly at removing Commonwealth countries, whose citizens are more likely to go to the UK than to other member states. The report also advocates stronger safeguards to accompany the introduction of a blanket ban on undesirable immigrants throughout the European Union. Under an external frontiers convention proposed by the European Commission all those named on a computerised joint list would be barred from all 12 member states. The new regime would help to ensure, for example, that a person deported from France would not be able to travel back to Frankfurt or Brussels and then to French territory. The committee also says that specific arrangements for airports in the proposed convention do not take adequate account of the special position of London as an international airport handling a great number of transit passengers who are kept 'airside' and do not undergo passport checks. In a recommendation which disagrees with government policy the committee says the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice should be extended to settle disputes and questions arising from the proposed convention referred to it by national tribunals.</p>

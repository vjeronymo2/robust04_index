			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Canadian inflation 'at 2%' CANADA'S inflation rate is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent this year from 5.6 per cent in 1991, the Conference Board of Canada said in its quarterly forecast yesterday, writes Bernard Simon. The board, a business information group, said it was scaling down its earlier forecast of a 3.8 per cent inflation rate because of the unexpectedly severe recession, especially in the retail sector. A steep drop in inflation, to one of the lowest rates among industrial countries, has prompted a surge of investment in Canadian securities over the past six months. The board expects a further marked decline in interest rates. The prime rate, now at 8 per cent, is forecast to drop close to 7 per cent this spring. Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 3.2 per cent in 1992 and the same next year, after shrinking by 1 per cent in 1991.</p>

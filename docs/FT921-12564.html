			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: Novelist turned critic ODD JOBS by John Updike Andre Deutsch Pounds 20, 920 pages UPDIKE'S achievements as an essayist and critic have always complemented his closely observed fictions. Discussing Updike's Rabbit novels, Martin Amis once observed that 'there is no stopping him commenting on things', and the irrepressible critic who lurks beneath the surface of all of his stories emerges into the full light of day in the wealth of journalism that has supplemented and shored it up. Odd Jobs is the third massive selection of Updike's occasional pieces. They span the period from 1982 to the middle of 1990, and range from the truly occasional - a reminiscence of Harvard student days, a response to a magazine request for the 'Book that changed me' (Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling surprisingly enough), an answer to 'Why are we Here?' for a book on the meaning of life - through one-off film reviews of The Name of the Rose, reflections upon and tributes to the great and good of American literature, to densely argued essays and lectures upon the nature of writing itself. At the heart of this collection and of all Updike's journalism, however, are his book reviews, which have been supplied regularly to the New Yorker for much of his working life. They are conceived in what one recognises instantly as the genteel, supple prose that characterises a certain generation of that great magazine's contributors, and emphasise how much as a jobbing journalist Updike pares down his style; the overripe imagery and oozing descriptions of his novels are replaced with something that is sharper and more elegant, though just as lively, inventive and perceptive. Novels of all conditions and nationalities are naturally Updike's main preoccupation. His taste is catholic and immensely tolerant: he can find admirable qualities in Margaret Drabble as much as in Vargas Llosa, confront the nouveaux romans of Tournier, Pinget and Queneau as comfortably as a piece of resuscitated Hemingway. The novels are grouped by subject: there are sections on his American contemporaries (though Philip Roth has one all to himself); 'Britishers'; the French, and the 'Evil Empire'; on post-modernism in its Calvino and Eco brands; and on magic realism in its assorted South American forms. Almost always he finds something to praise, if only faintly, so that the odd critical blades cut that much deeper. The absence of an authorial personality in Julian Barnes's Flaubert's Parrot and Staring at the Sun would predictably trouble a practitioner whose own fiction flirts with the confessional; one wonders how Updike responded to the conscious piece of self-confession in Barnes's History of the World, which sadly he seems not to have reviewed. And the sloppy and underpowered regularly strike raw nerves - the fiercest notice in the book is reserved for Carlos Fuentes' Ambrose-Bierce-inspired The Old Gringo - 'Latin-American surrealism has enchanted the globe, but its freedoms cannot be claimed as a matter of course. Mere mannerism results.' Yet other important non-fiction titles were sent his way too, and what in reviewing fiction is generally a kindly approach tends to develop sharper teeth and claws when moving into the wider literary world. Of Marion Meade's biography of Dorothy Parker he describes the writing as 'shoddy, the mood sour and the subject resolutely unsympathetic', though that does not prevent him delving into the squalid intricacies of the Algonquin world. He lambasts the flatness of Peter Ackroyd's prose in his biography of TS Eliot and launches his discussion of a biography of Bernard Berenson with the observation that 'It is always a pleasure to see a reverenced reputation besmirched'. Yet alongside those is a lucid appreciation of Stephen Jay Gould, admiration for Ryszard Kapuscinski's artless portrait of Haile Selassie, horror-struck wonder at the letters and drawings of Bruno Schulz. In surveying what amounts to much of the significant literature to have been published over the eight years covered by Odd Jobs Updike is never concerned with prescriptions, or with offering a map through the styles and ideas of his contemporaries. Instead he holds up a mirror to the world of letters, one that is truthful and compassionate, in just the same way that his fiction has always reflected the hopes, aspirations and disappointments of his other world, that of middle America.</p>

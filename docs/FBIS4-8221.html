			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Totka Ninova] </F>   [Text] The two Hungarian tugs Vac and Egzsenek have just  set sail from the Vidin bank of the Danube. The two vessels  were detained by representatives of the Western European Union,  the Bulgarian State Navigation Inspectorate, and Vidin customs.  The vessels had to stay there for four days so that they could  be provided with the necessary UN permits allowing them to sail  to Hungary. The two vessels are towing five barges loaded with  991 tonnes of phosphate.</p>

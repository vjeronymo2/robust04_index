			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Millwall makes Pounds 3.2m rights to ensure stadium completion MILLWALL Holdings, the USM-quoted football company, has launched a Pounds 3.2m rights issue to rescue its fortunes by ensuring the completion of a new stadium, writes Jane Fuller. The 3-for-2 issue, at 2p a share, represents a fresh start for the loss-making club, which will become only one of the attractions at the new 20,000-seat arena. The New London Stadium, which replaces The Den this summer, will be managed by Ogden Entertainment Services, one of the US's largest venue operators. Mr Reg Burr, Millwall's chairman, said the issue proceeds would bridge a gap between the Pounds 11m already spent on the Senegal Fields development and the Pounds 4m needed to complete it. 'Should the stadium not be completed, the group would face serious financial difficulties.' The bulk of the cash has come from selling The Den and in grants from Lewisham Council and the Football Trust, leaving the company without debt. It does, however, continue to lose money - Pounds 740,000 (Pounds 1.1m) in the six months to November 30 on sales of Pounds 1m. This was offset by Pounds 780,000 from player sales. Millwall Holdings will change its name to New London Stadium to reflect the fact that the club's 25 games will make up only a third of the programme. Mr Frank E Russo Jnr, vice president of international operations for Ogden Entertainment, said pop concerts, boxing, food festivals and religious events would also take place. Plentiful food, drink and other shopping opportunities were planned to reverse the pattern of British sports stadia being 'focused on the pitch instead of the customer. There should be value in going to the venue regardless of the event.' Ogden has also become involved with the new Manchester Victoria Station arena. Millwall plans to restore the potential for dividend payments by a capital reduction exercise that will eliminate the deficit in its profit and loss account. Its share price slipped from 5p to 3 3/4 p yesterday. The rights issue is underwritten by the brokers Townsley &amp; Co.</p>

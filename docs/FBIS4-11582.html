			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The  Constitutionality Court (CC) reported today that the country's  new Congress will be elected on 14 August, just as had been  established by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE).    The CC turned down the temporary amparo granted by the  Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ) to Deputy Carlos Arroyave against  the TSE, whom he accused of violating his rights by calling  parliamentary elections for 14 August. According to the  resolution issued today, the CC turned down the amparo granted  by the CSJ on 22 April because it considers the situation  presented by Solidarity Action Movement Deputy Arroyave as  "nonexistent."</p>

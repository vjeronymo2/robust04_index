			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Now the Big </F> Metalworkers' Strike Is Imminent"]    [Text] Cologne -- Yesterday the wage negotiations on a  pilot agreement for the entire west German metal and electrical  industry failed in North Rhine-Westphalia in their very first  day. About five hours after the beginning of the negotiations  in Cologne, employers and representatives of the IG-Metall trade  union separated.    They agreed that there would be no sense in holding further  negotiations, Norbert Wrobel, the head of the IG-Metall  negotiation team, stated. He said that there was no  rapprochement in the talks at all: "At the end we were where we  had started in the morning. This also makes us angry." Wrobel  blamed the employers for the failure of the talks. They had  insisted on abolishing the vacation bonus, something that is not  acceptable to IG-Metall.    Asked whether a strike could still be avoided, the IG-Metall  chief negotiator stated: "The signs are very bad." In the  evening the IG-Metall Executive Committee planned to discuss  further action. Deputy IG-Metall Chairman Walter Riester said  that a regular strike must also be discussed.    Hans-Friedel Schuhe, the leader of the employers'  negotiators, also said that strikes must now be expected. He  said that he is very angry about the suspension of the  negotiations. IG-Metall refused to discuss many of the issues.  Therefore, the important topic of the vacation bonus was not  discussed at all. Since IG-Metall refuses to discuss any  reduction of the vacation bonus, there is no basis for  deliberations. IG-Metall continued to "refuse the necessary  measures to reduce costs."    IG-Metall demanded wage and salary increases of 5.5 percent.  The employers, on the other hand, wanted to enforce a zero  round for wages and salaries and, at the same time, reduce  personnel costs by 10 percent by abolishing the vacation bonus  and collectively agreed vacation regulations.</p>

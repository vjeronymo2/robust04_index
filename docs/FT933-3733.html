			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / How to Spend it: Barneys moves up-town ONE OF the most seductive places to shop in New York is Barneys, the sole surviving downtown department store on the cross between 7th Avenue and 17th Street. Barneys is a bastion of contemporary classic fashion in Manhattan with its compelling combination of understated elegance and downtown street chic. Its only snag has been a lonely location in Chelsea, away from other stores, turning a trip to Barneys into a special trek. But this week Barneys moved to a more accessible address in the heart of the uptown shopping scene, opening a new store at 660 Madison Avenue  - a stone's throw away from its old rivals, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Henri Bendel and Bloomingdales. The new Barneys, which cost Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) to build with its eight floors and three restaurants, is the first store built from scratch in Manhattan for 65 years. It is the biggest gamble taken by the Pressmans, the family behind Barneys, since 1923 when the original store was founded. Barney Pressman raised Dollars 500 pawning his wife's engagement ring and put the money into opening the down-town store. Barneys began in the bargain business. 'We buy Bankrupt, Auction Stocks, Showroom Samples of Standard Makes] No Junk]' was an early advertising slogan. But when Fred Pressman, Barneys' son, took over after the second world war he dropped the discount trade and established Barneys as the New York store for mens' suits. It was not until the late 1970s that Barneys ventured into women's wear when Gene Pressman - Fred's son who now runs the business with his brother, Bob - pestered his father into letting him open a small women's shop. Barneys still offers the biggest and, probably, the best selection of men's suits, shirts and socks in Manhattan, but it has become the staple source of clothes for the city's hipper career women with labels such as Jil Sander, Prada and Giorgio Armani. Women's wear was the catalyst for the move uptown. The Pressmans, who have forged a financial partnership with Isetan, the Japanese retail group, realised that if Barneys was to become a serious player in women's fashion it had to have a prime site. Barneys' new neighbours are not amused. A three-year struggle to build the new store was coloured by a behind-the-scenes battle as the Pressmans' uptown rivals tried to 'persuade' their big designers not to sell to the new store. So what have the Pressmans put in their new store? Jil Sander, Prada and Armani are on the 'classic' third floor with Comme des Garcons and Dolce &amp; Gabbana on the 'avant garde' fourth. There is also lots of Barneys' own- label merchandise, a hair salon, a spa and, a sop to the latest New York female fitness craze, a boxing ring. The store opened to the public on Wednesday. But the war is not over. The Pressmans next battleground will be Beverly Hills, where another Barneys is scheduled to open next spring.</p>

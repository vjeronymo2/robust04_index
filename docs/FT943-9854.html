			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): New lease on life - The growing popularity of asset-based financing When Ian Dyson wanted to start a Sheffield bus company in 1990, he was faced with a problem. He and his three partners, all former senior depot managers for the nationalised bus company, had little money and less collateral. To achieve critical mass they needed at least 15 double-decker buses. The solution was to buy 12-year-old vehicles - but who would finance such aged assets? After exploring a number of cul-de-sacs, including bank loans, Dyson found Close Asset Finance, a specialist leasing company. Whereas banks were not interested in his collateral, Close Asset Finance took a view on the residual value of the assets in the event of default, entered a hire-purchase arrangement and Sheffield Omnibus was born. Four years later, the company has 85 buses, employs 220 people full-time and is still using leasing for its asset financing. 'We would not have had a business without hire purchase when we started,' says Dyson. 'As a new company we were aware we would not get the best deal but as they (Close) have got to know us the deals have got better.' This form of asset-based financing has had some heavy-weight support in the past few months. Recognising that UK companies are too dependent on overdraft, the governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the exchequer have suggested that they consider other sources. Factoring was one option for financing working capital; leasing another route for financing the assets. During 1993, some Pounds 13.5bn was provided by members of the Finance and Leasing Association, a significant proportion to smaller companies. While this is an impressive figure, there would appear to be scope for significantly more. According to Michael Maberly, managing director of Lombard Business Finance, part of Lombard, the UK's largest financing group, British industry has yet to translate its short-term optimism into higher levels of investment. Those businesses that are investing, however, are changing the way they like deals to be financed. Driven by lower interest rates, more companies are opting for hire purchase - which allows them to take control of the asset - rather than the straight finance lease. Companies such as VIP Colour Ltd, a management buy-out from East Midlands Electricity early this year, are discovering that hire purchase is barely more expensive than finance leasing where the asset reverts to the lessor company at the end of the lease. As a result, hire purchase contracts grew by 38 per cent to Pounds 6.06bn in the year to June 1994 while leasing grew by only one per cent to Pounds 5.22bn, according to the association. Some parts of the industry also hope to offer more operating leases. These allow the lessor to factor in the residual value of the assets which it will reclaim at the end of the contract so it can offer the lessee lower rental payments. Leasing companies are developing reputations for financing certain classes of assets. Close Asset Finance has ties with Heidelberg, the German printing equipment manufacturer, and is known for its familiarity with the second-hand printing machinery market. Lombard Business Finance, on the other hand, has chosen to enter a joint venture with GATX, the San Francisco-based leasing company. The US group will bring expertise in assessing asset values and, in some cases, will provide Lombard with guarantees of residual values on assets it might otherwise feel unable to finance. 'If you are going to run operating leases you have to understand what you do when you get the assets back and what after-markets there are,' says Maberly. Certain assets are likely to remain off-limits even to specialised financing companies. The residual value of hi-tech investments such as computers is probably something only the manufacturer will be fully equipped to assess. Such deals will remain the preserve of financing companies that support equipment suppliers. A decision by finance houses to specialise more, and therefore better understand after-markets for second-hand assets, should open up a new source of finance for companies, particularly start-ups. Businessmen who have used financing companies also suggest it is a more flexible option than a bank loan. Take Sheffield Omnibus which is again expanding its bus fleet. 'I would not dream of going to the bank and asking them to lend me money,' says Dyson. In five years, he says, his finance house will allow him to trade in his old buses and lease new vehicles on the same day so his service will barely be disrupted. A bank, on the other hand, would demand that he repay the loan before granting a new one to replace the buses, he says. 'That is where the finance houses are head and shoulders above the banks. But the bank will lend me money for the depot - it's horses for courses.'</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bombardier sees loss on Channel project Bombardier, the diversified Canadian transport group which is making the Channel tunnel shuttle, expects to make a loss on its contract to supply railcars, but hopes that the technical prestige of the contract will bring future compensation and orders. Mr Michel Lord, a vice-president of Bombardier, said that his company would not have signed its CDollars 820m (USDollars 621.2m) contract in 1989 to supply 254 railcars if it had known there was going to be an eventual CDollars 450m cost over-run. Bombardier said the over-run was almost entirely due to design changes imposed on contractors by French and British government safety inspectors, such as a 10cm widening of some doors, and demanded compensation. In a deal reached earlier this month with Eurotunnel, the operator of the undersea rail link, Bombardier settled for CDollars 157m in cash and up to 25m shares in Eurotunnel. Bombardier, which in accepting the shares has become Eurotunnel's largest single shareholder, hopes that in other contracts it would be able to recoup losses it had made on the Channel tunnel project and find a use for the technical lessons it had learnt.</p>

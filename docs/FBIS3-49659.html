Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke at this session on the current  political situation and the work and tasks of the party. Senada  Cumurovic reports:    [Cumurovic] At the beginning of the festive part of the  founding session of the City Committee of the Party of  Democratic Action, Memhmet Alija Hadzic spoke about the previous  work and activities of the party, such as, for instance, the  work on the territorial organization of the town aimed at  improving a better functioning of the organs of authority, the  setting up of the Patriotic League, the provision of food,  acquisition of arms, work on the creation and strengthening of  the Army, and so forth.    Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke at the founding session of the City  Committee of the Party of Democratic Action on the party and the  general political situation. He first spoke about staff issues  in terms of the opening of the party for all those who want to  fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The criterion for this, as  Izetbegovic said, is support of the people.    [Izetbegovic] There are 20 months of difficult trials behind  us. During these trials, some people have passed the test, some  have not. Please remove those who have not passed the test from  the (?party); do them a big favor. Therefore, the (?gradual)  opening of the party [words indistinct]. There is another term  -- that is, cleansing of the party of those who do not belong to  it.    Regarding cleansing, all parties, and not only our party but  all parties, (?are faced) with the constant problem of [having  to choose] between the honest but unable and very able but  extremely dishonest people. They are often in a dilemma as to  what to do. In this dilemma concerning the honest but less  able, and very able but almost certainly dishonest, deceitful,  people, I would recommend you opt for the honest.    [Cumurovic] This meeting presented an opportunity for  President Izetbegovic to comment on the remarks often addressed  to him that he is striving for an Islamic republic in this  region.    [Izetbegovic] I (?will) tell you clearly that I do not want  an Islamic republic. However, I want Islam to be preserved in  this region, [words indistinct]. I do not know why we should do  that. We are illustrating here a European, a modern [words  indistinct]. After all, we can go in that direction [words  indistinct] we will not do that; this is not our policy,  although I could say that [words indistinct] we should not do  that. We will win, because we will not, because we will respect  other people's religion, other nations, different political  convictions, because we will try to be democrats in this grave  situation. [sentence as heard]    [Cumurovic] Izetbegovic also spoke about his recent talks  with Tudjman, saying the Croatian proposal could have been  acceptable last year, before the crimes took place. Also, in  the meantime, our army was founded and developed. President  Izetbegovic told its leadership a few days ago the same things  that he spoke about today.    [Izetbegovic] I ended that meeting with a recommendation to  the soldiers and the officers. The recommendation was very  short and amounted to the following: Be like the people you are  (?protecting).    [Cumurovic] Izetbegovic ended his speech at the founding  session of the City Committee of the Party of Democratic Action  by commenting on the future organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There is no integral Bosnia-Herzegovina without the Croats and  the Serbs. The integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is desired by all  Muslims, most Croats, and some Serbs. Here is what Izetbegovic  said about the ways of arriving at the integral Bosnia.    [Izetbegovic] There are, in my view, two stages of the  struggle. One stage is military, and the other is the stage of  a political struggle for integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  What then? We should then create a democratic country in that  part of Bosnia.    [Cumurovic] After the speech of Alija Izetbegovic, president  of the Presidency, names of 85 members of the City Committee and  the Executive Committee of the Party of Democratic Action were  read out. Safet Halilovic was elected president of the City  Committee. [passage omitted]</p>

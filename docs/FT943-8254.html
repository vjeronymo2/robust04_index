			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Risks of freedom - As computer systems become more accessible so they become more vulnerable Heads of information technology departments are being offered a new weapon in their continuing battle against breaches of security. This is highly sophisticated software which gives precise control over which parts of an IT network users can access. Two types of problem arise when individuals are free to roam around sprawling computer networks. First, there is the danger of unauthorised access to confidential information. Second, and even more worrying, is the possibility of havoc caused by a disgruntled employee - a growing breed in organisations which are 'downsizing'. Yet as security is tightened throughout an organisation, the process starts to conflict with the underlying purpose of IT - to make information available to users as widely, easily and quickly as possible. This is the aim of rapidly expanding technologies such as Electronic Document Management (EDM) in which letters from clients are scanned and put into electronic files, together with replies written on a word processor or any other information in electronic form. When M&amp;G, the UK investment management company, began looking at EDM, quality of service to the customer came top of its list of priorities. 'With EDM,' explains Adrian Sharp, manager of management services at M&amp;G, 'any individual can take a call from a client and immediately have the right file in front of him or her.' The problem faced by developers of new security software such as Wang's Enhanced System Access Controls or ICL's AccessManager is to maintain that freedom while providing a high level of security. 'The key,' says Roger Ashbrook, general manager of ICL Secure Systems, 'is to think about the function of each employee and the information he or she needs from the computer network.' Using this approach, AccessManager offers users single password access to all parts of an IT system for which they are authorised, no matter how complex the computer network may be. In addition, it can be set up to work with other authentication devices such as badge readers and cards. In the battle to prevent security breaches, hardware and software developments represent only one element. A recent Department of Trade and Industry survey, carried out in conjunction with ICL and the National Computing Centre and covering 800 respondents from a wide cross-section of UK industries, showed what else was needed by IT departments as they struggled with problems ranging from fraud and sabotage to power failure and operator errors. One obvious step towards improving security is proper contingency planning, but the survey suggests that of all breaches reported by respondents, only about half were covered by such a plan. However, where a plan did exist, almost all the respondents believed it had been at least moderately effective in minimising the problem and had helped them recover from it. In this area, many financial organisations have no excuse for failure because the Bank of England and regulatory authorities insist that they must have contingency plans and sites and that these are regularly tested. 'Before recent terrorist bombings,' says Mike Nicholls, IT manager at the Bank of Ireland, 'people didn't appreciate that access to a building may be impossible for a long time, preventing access to such things as vital data held in a fire-proof safe.' Another obvious step is to ensure that an individual is directly responsible for security. Here the survey presents a depressing picture, warning that the proportion of organisations with specialist security personnel may be as low as 15 per cent, although this rises to one-third in the financial sector. These are figures which surprised and disturbed Nicholls. 'Within the financial community,' he says, 'ignoring IT security is like having unprotected sex - sooner or later the consequences will catch up with you'. The survey is the second in two years and so gives some indication of trends. For example, a quarter of respondents reported thefts of equipment, a sharp increase on the 14 per cent two years ago. Over one-third suffered computer virus attacks, double the figure recorded in the previous survey. The cost of a failure, including investigation and repairing the damage to data or equipment, works out on average at a little under Pounds 10,000. But when things do go wrong, particularly in the financial sector, they can go very wrong - as one insurance company discovered when a fraud cost it Pounds 1.2m, the most financially damaging breach reported in the survey. An encouraging aspect is that after manufacturing, the largest number of respondents came from the financial and services sectors, where companies have often been reluctant to discuss IT security openly. There have been exceptions such as National Westminster Bank, which after experiencing multiple debiting on some cardholder accounts, acknowledged the problem, apologised to customers and arranged compensation. This is in stark contrast to the hostility which has grown around the issue of phantom withdrawals from automatic teller machines. Initially the companies tried to put the blame on the customers. While this was correct in many cases, the eventual removal of the full account number from receipts showed that there was scope for improvement in the security of the system. With a widely established network and more than 3m transactions a day, ATMs are a natural target. Having tried frontal assaults with mechanical diggers, criminals are adopting more ingenious approaches to breaching security; in one recent case, a 'dummy' ATM was set up to collect customers' account numbers and personal identification numbers. As ICL's Ashbrook points out, the use of computer systems is expanding rapidly, particularly in the financial sector. The use of teleworking is also growing, meaning that systems have to be more accessible and thus more vulnerable. He expects the consequences of these developments to show up in the next survey.

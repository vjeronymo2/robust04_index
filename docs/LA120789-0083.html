			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> CONCERNS ABOUT TAXICABS  </P> <P> Mayor Max Salter said he is proud of his city's stringent new guidelines for  taxicab operators but is concerned about cabs licensed elsewhere that give  visitors a bad impression of Southern California.  </P> <P> "London has immaculate cabs. In Tokyo they have white doilies in the taxis," he  said at the City Council's informal session Tuesday. "I've gotten into cabs  here that are a disgrace. And Los Angeles is the biggest city on the Pacific  Rim."  </P> <P> He urged Councilman Bernard Hecht and Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds, who serve as  Beverly Hills' liaison committee to neighboring cities, to press for area-wide  standards that would improve the appearance, cleanliness and manners of cabs  and drivers.  </P></p>

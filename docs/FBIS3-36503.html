Addressing journalists in Moscow on Saturday, he said: To  preserve Georgia's territorial integrity, as a condition for  stability in the region, and ensure the status of autonomy for  Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ajaria, would answer to Russia's  strategic interests.    "In my view, the ideal model for Georgia would be federal  system," Shakhray said. "There is no other way to preserve  Georgia's territorial integrity and stop the civil war and  ethnic conflicts there."    According to him, there should have been a preliminary  condition for signing the bilateral treaty: the understanding  that Russia will act as the guarantor of the autonomous status  of republics within Georgia, without interfering in Georgia's  internal affairs.    Since this has not been stipulated, the treaty may become a  pretext for destabilizing the situation even before its  ratification, Shakhray said.</p>

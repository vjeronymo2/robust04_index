			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Sergeyev, chairman of Russia's </F> Independent Trade Union of Miners, by Tatyana Skorobogatko,  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI columnist; date and place not given:  "Aleksandr Sergeyev: Tatyana Skorobogatko, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI  Columnist, Talks With Aleksandr Sergeyev, Chairman of Russia's  Independent Trade Union of Miners"]    [Text] The "left" and "right" are forecasting that "popular  unrest" will sweep away Chernomyrdin's cabinet. They are  assigning the detonator role for the social explosion to miners  who have been combat-ready for a long time. In September, the  Independent Trade Union of Coal Industry Workers conducted a  strike; in November-December -- the Independent Trade Union of  Miners. The miners' main demands are immutable. However,  Aleksandr Sergeyev is convinced that a "nomenklatura-managerial  trade union" of coal miners provokes inflation and that a "free  trade union" of miners protects the course of the reforms.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Can one and the same demand be  pro-market and anti-market depending on who proposes it?    [Sergeyev] The demands are different. The coal miners' trade  union is insisting that the debts owed to the miners be repaid  at any cost. One demand is preferential extension of credit to  enterprises using coal. Supposedly, they will then pay off the  mines. This means throwing tens of trillions more of "empty"  rubles into the economy.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you think that it is better not to  pay debts, generally speaking?    [Sergeyev] No, the state should pay the subsidies pledged in  the 1993 budget. However, it is not obligatory that money should  be printed for this purpose. The mines are now paying taxes into  the budget and then receiving subsidies. Let the mines be  "excused" from taxes and deductions for the employment and  pension funds in the amount which they have not been paid in the  form of subsidies.    However, subsidies are approximately a third of what the  miners are "short;" the remainder are the debts of the user. It  is necessary to seek a declaration of bankruptcy through the  courts for enterprises that cannot pay for the coal. In June of  last year prior to the introduction of unregulated prices for  coal, these prices were 30 percent of world ones. Metallurgy  moved to the world price of metal using cheap coal. That means  that they set the production cost of its products too high and  that they raised wages for themselves at the expense of our  coal's cheap price.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Are you not afraid that workers in  other branches will accuse you of trying to worsen their  condition with your demands?    [Sergeyev] We have conflicts with all trade unions. They say  that we are "pro-government" and are being supported by state  money. Only one thing cannot be understood: Why are we living in  such "luxury" -- a headquarters consisting of one room?    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] The leaders of the "miners"  constantly emphasize that its trade union rival, which is  "genetically linked with the VTsSPS [All-Union Central Council  of Trade Unions]," is not a genuine one since representatives of  the administration are included in it. They are convinced that a  "managerial trade union" is not capable of truly defending  worker interests. In turn, the "coal miners" accuse the NPG  [Independent Trade Union of Miners] of splitting the worker  movement. They assume that the disintegration of a single  miners' trade union is a matter in the hands of the government,  which is skillfully taking advantage of the trade union leaders'  excessive ambitions.    The "coal miners" have approximately a million members --  practically all are workers in the branch. "Miners" represent  only part of the underground workers -- approximately 80,000  people. True, they have political capital earned during the  initial period of the struggle for democracy. However, this  capital is completely counterbalanced today by the authority of  the "defenders of worker interests," who acquired the "old"  trade union during the transition to a market. Miners are living  in an atmosphere of fear bordering on panic. There are chronic  pay delays, prospects of massive unemployment, a lack of  solutions for social and living problems. In this situation, the  main mass of the miners will most likely come out in favor of a  trade union which is able to achieve the largest concessions  from the government.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] When the leaders of the "traditional"  trade unions said that the government is acting without  considering worker interests, you branded them "enemies of the  reforms." Why have you always defended the government so  vehemently?    [Sergeyev] We have not defended the government but the  policy  of reform. The "managerial" trade union was demanding money to  preserve the old order; we -- to bring the coal industry into  the market carefully and not "throw it into it."    What do we have? First of all, they adopted an edict about  issuing joint stock for the branch's enterprises although it is  clear that the shares of stock are blank paper: They will close  the mines. It was necessary to begin with a program for  structurally reorganizing the branch and providing measures for  miners let go.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Why did the reform government not  listen to your completely reformist demands?    [Sergeyev] There never was any reform government. It was a  coalition where lobbying interests fought. Each fall, miners,  oil workers and then others "stood up." All were demanding money  and it was given to everyone. During the two years, the  government did not develop a strategy or tactics for  reorganizing the economy. The directorate and the Moscow  bureaucrats adapted and built a market for themselves.    I do not know whether an auditing firm capable of inspecting  Rosugol and other large corporations will be found in Russia.  When World Bank experts were studying Rosugol's activity, it  refused to give them part of the information, citing commercial  secrets. Almost all coal associations are bankrupt but Rosugol  is a highly profitable company. It not only distributes state  subsidies between associations but also provides them paid  services for equipment purchases, marketing, etc. The  bureaucrats in Moscow are living better than the miners. The  directors of the associations do not protest. Certain units are  trying to break away from the guardianship of the corporation.  However, they often ask to return because it begins to choke  them deliberately -- with high taxes and through the  distribution of subsidies.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] One cannot say that the  authorities have ignored the Independent Trade Union of Miners.  Its leaders have been well received in many high offices and  have rubbed shoulders with State Secretary Burbulis and many  vice premiers without ceremony. However, the fate of the  proposals proposed by them differed little from the fate of the  demands by the "VTsSPS successors:" The majority of the  government's promises have remained on paper. The protocol,  which Yegor Gaydar himself signed in December under the threat  of a Russia-wide miners' strike, is not being implemented.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Perhaps, the government completely  fulfilled a miners' demand only once: It raised their wages  threefold in January 1992.    [Sergeyev] That decision was provoked by the miners' trade  union and the branch ministry. It was they who achieved an  increase in wages for all branch workers, including nurses in  the departments' kindergartens. A surge in inflation occurred --  they shifted the blame to the miners. I do not want the miners  to be the "extreme" ones again and that is why I am criticizing  the "coal miners" for issuing money. One only had to raise the  pay of the underground group of workers in 1992. Gaydar later  explained to me why they increased it for everyone: "We thought  that `they' were you," that is, they thought that this trade  union is also a workers' movement and that its leaders are  capable of organizing strikes. I think that the government  demonstrated incompetency at that time -- although some say that  Yeltsin paid off the miners this way or that he was thanking  them for bringing him to power.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you intend to engage actively in  politics as before or is this not a trade union matter?    [Sergeyev] It is a trade union one -- until the NPG program  adopted at the founding congress is changed. It is written in it  that the trade union of hired workers must engage in politics  during the transitional period. Since last spring, we have eased  our political activity because the lads in the local areas have  shouted: Enough politics; busy yourselves with the economy! Here  is the result: They have quite ceased to consider us. Of course,  not all of us have acted correctly. The demands to remove  someone from the government or to keep some figure or other in  it were wrong. However, if the government sharply changes  course, we should intervene.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] By participating in politics, the  miners have often become a toy in somebody else's hands. Is this  not annoying?    [Sergeyev] It is annoying, it is not annoying.... All is  natural: As long as the worker movement is uncoordinated,  politicians easily use the ambitions of local leaders for their  own purposes. I think that we have now overcome the sickness of  growth. It is more complicated to toy with us.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Do you consider the situation to be an  extremely explosive one?    [Sergeyev] A spontaneous "creeping" strike is taking place:  one mine stops, then another. The transfer of state subsidies to  some mines has been stopped although nothing officially has been  declared about their closing. The people are scattering. The  government is hoping that if it "forces out" people in small  doses, there will be no massive explosion.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Therefore, has the time for a  Russia-wide miners' strike passed? Who will risk going on strike  if there is massive unemployment?    [Sergeyev] Many are already afraid now. Moreover, the  regional differences in the miners' situation are too great.  They will intensify with the market's development. That is why I  think that the time for Russia-wide strikes, if it has not  passed, is coming to an end.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI comment] The leaders of the miners have  always called the ability to organize a strike one of the  criteria for the trade union's "truth" -- however, not a  "managerial" strike with the agreement of the enterprise  director. In Sergeyev's opinion, the miners' trade union is  acting this way. The NPG has become accustomed to taking pride  in the fact that it can "organize" the miners of an entire  region and then halt a strike in an organized manner. This is  more difficult than starting one. They also can wreck a strike  by the competing trade union.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] Are you still capable of influencing  the course of strikes? They began spontaneously in January and  could not be stopped in an organized manner.    [Sergeyev] We really were forced in November to follow  events. Workers and their wives came to the miners' leaders in  Vorkuta: "We have not been paid for two months -- there is  nothing to feed our children with. Either do something or we  will destroy the administration." They went on a hunger-strike  and called me. We immediately called a council of  representatives. They decided to give the government a month.  Incidentally, it was very easy at the time to "organize" the  Kuzbass also. I immediately ran for deputy to the State Duma  from the Prokopyevskiy Territorial Okrug. Speaking on  television, I could have called for a strike. I did not do this.  However, I spoke with Gaydar by telephone in advance and  demanded that he sign the protocol.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] In September, you criticized "that"  trade union for the "inopportuneness" of the strike, saying that  it was playing into the opposition's hands. However, they  themselves went on strike on the eve of the elections. One  democratic newspaper even accused you of engaging in blackmail  of the government, implementing a social directive of the  anti-reform forces.    [Sergeyev] Every day, a mine now stops. This means that we  correctly warned the government about the danger. Why does no  one want to admit guilt but looks for scapegoats?    Does this mean that we already do not need the democrats who  were brought to power? Incidentally, Russia's Choice waged a  propaganda campaign against me during the election campaign.  Everyone played the "miners' card." However, who was thinking  about our interests? We were compelled to make the government  think about the miners' fate by force.    [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI] And if it refuses to implement the  December protocol?    [Sergeyev] We will begin to unleash collective actions. We  will possibly even make up a train from Vorkuta and will drive  here. We will picket even the Kremlin. There are enough forces.

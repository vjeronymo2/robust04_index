			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> WOMAN RESTORES NEGLECTED DOLLS  </P> <P> Rose Carl Edelen remembers a childhood of Texas poverty in which her mother  handcrafted her family's clothing.  </P> <P> Edelen, 80, of Thousand Oaks believes it was the example of her mother's labor  that led her to a magical world of dolls and dollhouses.  </P> <P> It began more than a decade ago, when Edelen was searching for a doll to give  her granddaughter as a gift.  </P> <P> Instead of a new doll, Edelen found an obviously neglected one and set about  restoring it.  </P> <P> The enterprise become her singular dedication and creative passion -- sewing  with her own hands the dresses of lace adorned with buttons, bows and  embroidery that fit each of the more than 500 dolls she has rescued from garage  sales and swap meets.  </P> <P> They fill every room in her house, lending an atmosphere of elegance and  reverence for things old, forgotten, abandoned and perhaps abused, but  nevertheless appreciated anew.  </P> <P> Edelen has been an artist, teacher and writer most of her adult life.  </P> <P> She taught music during the Depression and experimented with constructing  theater sets cut from corrugated boxes.  </P> <P> Her passion for collecting and restoring has another side.  </P> <P> Edelen said it represents a very personal inward journey "to find the little  girl who was lost in me."

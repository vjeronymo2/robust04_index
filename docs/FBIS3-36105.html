"Experts of European  structures believe that, though without juridical effect, such  poll would not allow Tiraspol leaders invoke the reason of  `eventual unification,'" Buruiana asserted. The Moldovan  delegation met with Catherine Lalumiere, Secretary General of  Council of Europe and discussed the Ilascu group problem,  working out future steps for releasing the political prisoners.  At meetings with top European dignitaries between January 19th  and 29th, questions regarding Moldova's adherence to the Council  of Europe were examined. Recommendations were issued, also  regarding the enhancement of Moldova legislation in accordance  with European standards, separation of state powers.

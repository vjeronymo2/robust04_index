			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by All India Radio correspondent M. Rama Rao] </F>   [Text] If Davos had set the stage three years ago for  projecting India as a new destination for investment, Houston,  the number two city for business in the United States, has taken  the campaign into the drawing rooms of the multinational chief  executives. This is evident from the response at the round  table session organized in honor of the prime minister, Mr.  Narasimha Rao, by the Greater Houston Partnership, an umbrella  trade body of over 2,600 U.S. companies.    The other indicators of improving India's (?option) are  numerous requests for a meeting with Mr. Narasimha Rao soon  after he landed in New York. The questions to him and the  finance minister reflect the upbeat mood among the U.S. business  and financial companies which are trying to diversify into the  Asia-Pacific and the Southeast Asia region. They find the  Indian Government's liberalization program and incentives quite  attractive for investment. They now consider India as number  one for new investments. The Indian side once again tried to  project the infrastructural sector as a priority area.    Houston is called the energy capital of the world with  industries dealing with power, hydrocarbons, electronics,  computers, medicines, and food processing. One power and oil  major has already entered the Indian scene and some others are  on the way. The power company's chief executive, Mr. Kenneth  Lay, says his Indian experience proves to the world the old  maxim that investments are also a matter of good faith. The  statement made apparently in good faith as his company was the  first to enter the untested waters when the power sector was  thrown open. Computer-related materials, aluminum production,  technology transfer projects relating to rail transportation,  information and health are among the areas that may be resulting  in a lot of investment activities in the wake of the prime  minister's visit to Houston. For a change, the business  community also seems to be equally concerned about the poor and  is anxious to join our efforts in poverty alleviation programs.</p>

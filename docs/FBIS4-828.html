			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 17 SAPA -- The South African  Police [SAP] on Sunday [17 March] welcomed the Inkatha Freedom  Party's decision to postpone its planned march on Monday through  Johannesburg. "The South African Police appreciates the  responsible decision taken by the IFP Youth Brigade not to  conduct their demonstration on Monday.    "In view of the IFP's decision to postpone the  demonstration,  it must be stated that any intention to conduct the  demonstration on any other day should be negotiated and any  application will be considered according to its merits and the  prevailing circumstances at the time," police liaison officer  Col Dave Bruce said.    The postponement of Monday's planned IFP Youth Brigade march  through Johannesburg was announced on Sunday by Brigade  Executive Committee Chairman Sipho Mathobela.    He said however rolling mass action would continue at a  later  date, possibly Tuesday. The issue was being discussed at the  brigade's Executive Committee and the IFP National Executive  Committee.    Col Bruce said: "In the light of events on March 28 (when 53  Zulu marchers were killed in Johannesburg), there remains a  distinct possibility that any demonstration in the CBD [central  business district] could be disrupted. "This poses a definite  danger to public order and saftey," he said.    The police would consider any application by the IFP to hold  another march, but "the possibility of police allowing thousands  of demonstrators (into Johannesburg) was minimal".    A demonstration was not bannned because it was organised by  a  particular political party. Considering the events of March 28,  other elements were present during a march in the city centre.    An IFP march through benoni on the East Rand was allowed to  go ahead on Saturday because the IFP there had a history of  non-violence and police did not expect any trouble there, he  said.    In the run up to the election, Col Bruce continued, police  regional commissioner Lt Gen Koos Kalitz decided police would  maintain high visibility.    Police would conduct crime prevention operations despite the  demonstration's postponement.</p>

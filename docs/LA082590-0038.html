"Hull High" is the first major result of the television networks'  recent commitment to improve the quality of U.S. public education by  encouraging teen-agers to take learning more seriously, right? I am sure that  with this stimulus and these role models, American students will have no  trouble affirming their lofty status on the world educational scale --  somewhere below Bangladesh.  </P> <P> HENRY KRAMER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

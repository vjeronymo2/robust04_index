			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Written questions cost Pounds 900,000 THE 30 MPs who ask the most parliamentary 'written questions' to extract information from ministers are costing the taxpayer nearly Pounds 1m a year, official figures show. More than 10,000 questions for written answer were laid by the top 30 MPs from all parties during the 1990-91 parliamentary year, according to figures from Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons. The most prolific, Mr Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, asked 928. Written questions are a means by which backbench MPs can exercise some power over the executive to get access to official information. Latest Treasury estimates put the average cost incurred by the Civil Service in answering a written question at Pounds 87. The cost of the 10,326 questions asked by the top 30 therefore works out at about Pounds 900,000.</p>

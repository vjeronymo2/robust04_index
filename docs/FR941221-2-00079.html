Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated 10 million workers involved in the delivery of health services in the U.S. are experiencing unprecedented displacement as the industry tries to reconfigure its operation in response to intense pressure to reduce costs. With a total annual payroll estimated to be over $270 billion nationwide, health care work force changes are bound to have significant effect on many local economies as well as on workers themselves. Current hospital inpatient occupancy rates are believed to be around 60 percent, down from 65 percent just five years ago. Projections are that at least 800 community hospitals_out of some 4500 total_are likely to close over the next few years and that of the 30 percent of all inpatient hospital beds currently not in use, many will be eliminated. A recent survey found that 51 percent of all hospitals of 500 beds or more are planning to reduce their work forces in the near future. With this notice, DOL is announcing a solicitation aimed at assisting health care workers who will be affected by current or projected restructuring in the health care industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authorities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 324 of the Job Training Partnership Act authorizes the use of funds reserved under Part B of Title III for demonstration programs of up to three years in length. Under Section 324, the Secretary is required to conduct or provide for an evaluation of the success of each demonstration program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department relies on applicants for grants to comply with all Federal and State laws in setting up their programs. For example, we expect that grantees shall comply with requirements for licensing and that they shall obtain necessary union concurrence when working within a labor agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Rabin Is Being Flexible"] </F>   [Text] Addressing the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee on 19 April, the prime minister and defense minister  disclosed that the withdrawal recommended by the General Staff  in the event of a peace agreement with Syria is less extensive  than the withdrawal he finds acceptable. The IDF's [Israel  Defense Forces] recommendation has not been made public, but the  fact the Yitzhaq Rabin does not see eye to eye with the present  General Staff and that he is prepared to say as much to the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee is curious and  noteworthy. To what point and what line does Rabin believe the  IDF can withdraw from the Golan Heights without harming Israel's  security?    It should be remembered that the prime minister promised  U.S.  President Bill Clinton last month that Israel would provide  Secretary of State Warren Christopher with "a peace package," to  be conveyed to Hafiz al-Asad during Christopher's upcoming visit  to Damascus. Ever since Israel deviated from the Madrid format  at the Oslo talks, official Washington has been painstakingly  avoiding interfering too much in the negotiations between Israel  and the PLO leadership. Although Clinton welcomed the  Declaration of Principles, the handling of its implementation  was entrusted to lower ranks. Conversely, the President and the  secretary of state have shown great interest in promoting the  Israel-Syria peace process; Rabin cannot help taking this U.S.  trend into consideration.    Therefore, he tasked Major General Ilan Biran with  organizing  the preparatory work for a peace package that will be addressed  to Syria. The Foreign Ministry, which the prime minister  avoided in this context, has also lent a hand to the task. Yet  on 19 April, the prime minister described all these papers as  materiel ("data") for discussion; he was referring both to the  papers prepared by the Foreign Ministry and to the document  produced by Gen. Biran and his advisers. Rabin stressed that  the final decision will be made by the political echelons; he  made it clear that as a military man, he would have preferred a  status quo on the Golan Heights, but, he said, "there is a  political reality which binds us." In other words: Israel  cannot evade making a commitment in principle to effect some  withdrawal.    Rabin still speaks of withdrawal "on the Golan," not "from  the Golan." He did not discard this stand at the Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee. Yet he must have sensed that  with regard to the extent of withdrawal, the Israeli fist should  not remain as close as it has been to date. The prime minister  is aware of the weight of the precedent of the peace accord with  Egypt, and he would like that weight to be reduced, because he  is not eager to give up conquered land, because he would like to  avoid confrontation with the settlers, and because he wants to  demonstrate adherence to the Labor platform advocating  territorial compromise. Yet he seems to be readier than in the  past to meet Syria halfway, and his remarks of 19 April seem to  be sending a signal in al-Asad's direction.    Two questions arise in the wake of the revelation that Rabin  is more flexible than the IDF General Staff: Will Clinton and  Christopher perceive his attitude as an appropriate recourse to  persuade al-Asad to meet Israel halfway? And, if the Americans  are pleased, will the Syrian president be prepared to heed the  secretary of state's coaxing -- if the latter indeed makes such  an effort -- and withdraw his demand to receive back the entire  Golan?    Yitzhaq Rabin has marched a step forward. In a sense, he has  passed the ball over to the Damascus court.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Pools With Three or More Years Operating History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Current Rule 4.21(a)(4) requires disclosure of the performance of the pool offered and of its CTAs and their principals for all pools. If the pool offered has less than a twelve-month track record, the performance of the CPO and of each of its principals must also be disclosed. Under the proposed rules, past performance disclosure requirements would differ based on whether the pool had a three-year, rather than twelve-month, track record. Generally, where a pool has at least a three-year track record, the only performance required to be disclosed would be that of the pool offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that, generally, where a pool has an extensive operational history, presentation of the pool's own past performance record should fulfill the objectives of past performance disclosure. If, however, the pool's historical track record occurred under materially different conditions, the track record of the pool alone may not be sufficient. For example, if the pool was essentially a proprietary trading vehicle investing a relatively small amount of funds contributed by third party sources, the track record generated may have little or no relevance to a publicly offered pool. To assure that a pool's three-year history was not acquired under circumstances in which the pool was essentially a proprietary trading vehicle, proposed Rule 4.25(b) would provide for past performance disclosure to be limited to that of the pool offered for pools that have traded commodity futures and option contracts for at least three years with no fewer than fifteen participants who are unaffiliated with the pool's CPO and in which no more than ten percent of the assets were contributed by the CPO. The pool's performance would be required to be disclosed for five full calendar years and year-to-date (or, if the pool had less than a five-year history, for the pool's entire operating history), in the specified capsule format with monthly rates of return. The CPO would be free to include additional performance records in compliance with the provision relating to voluntary information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission requests comment as to whether the performance record of a pool with a three-year operating history is generally sufficient without supplementary performance data concerning the pool's CTAs or other pools operated by the CPO. The Commission also requests comment as to whether the offered pool's operating history should be considered for purposes of the three-year minimum if such history was acquired when the pool differed in some material respect from the pool as offered, for example, in cases in which the pool's CTA, types of interests traded or the trading program have been significantly modified or the pool was initially privately offered but is now offered to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Pools With Less Than Three Years History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As noted above, current Rule 4.21(a)(4) requires a pool disclosure document to disclose the performance of the pool offered, of each of the pool's CTAs and of each principal of the CTAs, and, if the pool offered has traded commodity interests for less than twelve months, the performance of the CPO and each of its principals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the preceding section, the Commission is proposing to limit required performance disclosures to the performance of the pool offered if the pool has at least a three-year performance history. With respect to pools that have less than a three-year history, proposed Rule 4.25(c) would require presentation of the performance records of the pool offered, the CPO (or trading manager), the CPO's (or trading manager's) trading principals if the CPO (or trading manager) has less than a three-year history, and the performance of each ``major'' CTA and investee pool, i.e., CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of the pool offered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's assets, the sole requirement would be to indicate any ``adverse'' performance as defined in the rule. No disclosure would be required for CTAs allocated less than ten percent of the pool's futures margins and option premiums or investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the pool's assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The lack of prior trading history of the specified persons would be indicated by legends set forth in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

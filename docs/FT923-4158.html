			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The TUC At Blackpool: Lack of a national skills strategy TRAINING and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and Wales, are compromised by the lack of a national skills strategy according to the first independent study of the Tecs, Catherine Milton writes. The study by the charitably funded Centre for Local Economic Strategy, argues that Tecs do not need more money or management changes. It says the problems for the employer-led bodies are related to their market structure, which it says promotes short-termism and the marginalisation of disadvantaged groups. Reforming the Tecs.

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Kuwaitis concede serious damage from KIO row THE KUWAITI authorities have for the first time conceded that the row surrounding investments by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in Spain is seriously damaging the emirate's standing in international credit markets. Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, the head of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA, the KIO's controlling body), told a group of Spanish journalists in Kuwait that Kuwait had been forced to postpone a borrowing in the international capitals planned for December. 'The loss of image provoked by the KIO case and the way it has been treated makes it difficult to obtain credits and those that are available would be very expensive,' Mr al-Gabandi was quoted as saying. The KIA negotiated a Dollars 5.5bn loan for Kuwait soon after the war that ended the Iraqi invasion in 1991. But after new managers took over the KIO last May they quickly became involved in a vitriolic and public row over what they allege was Dollars 5bn lost by their predecessors in risky investments in Spain. Bankers in London said yesterday the row had 'inevitably' undermined the emirate's position in debt markets. There are few signs of the row subsiding although two attempts to bring criminal charges against former managers of the KIO and its Spanish operations have been rebuffed this year by the Spanish courts for lack of evidence. The new KIO management says it is determined to continue pursuing Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the former KIO chairman, Mr Fouad Jaffar, its former general manager, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, the former manager of their Spanish operations, for alleged fraud. While this effort will keep the affair public, it appears increasingly to have Kuwaiti political rather than legal objectives. Mr al-Gabandi, who said Kuwaitis were 'furious' about what had happened in Spain, pointedly did not accuse the former KIO management of illegalities. Instead, he said the KIA's investment guidelines had been ignored. The KIO should have contracted an institution and not Mr de la Rosa to run its affairs in Spain, he said. These remarks reflect the marked differences of opinion now emerging from Kuwait on just how the KIO's Spanish debacle should be concluded. The new KIO management currently reports directly to the finance minister and is being encouraged to keep up public pressure on the former KIO management. In contrast, Mr al-Gabandi appears to favour an internal, less public, settlement which would in effect shift Kuwait's sensitive finances away from public scrutiny. The desirability of the KIA taking control of all of the KIO's direct investments overseas has been canvassed inside Kuwait in recent weeks.</p>

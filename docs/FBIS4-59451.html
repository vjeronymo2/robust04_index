			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F> Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa, Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus, and  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureau in Aden: "Socialist Party Deputies  Hold Session in Aden"]    [Excerpts] Sanaa and Aden yesterday intensified their Arab  contacts in an attempt to explain their positions in the war in  Yemen, in a race with the actual fighting in which armor,  aircraft, and missiles are being used to create a fait accompli  on the ground that would help either of the two sides to settle  the conflict in its favor by political or military means while  keeping Arab channels of contact open.    Meanwhile, the deputies of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  in the House of Representatives and a number of independent  figures have decided to hold a meeting in Aden today. [passage  omitted]    All this is taking place while each side is accusing the  other of enlisting the help of foreign powers. Sanaa sources  have stated that "an Arab state that is not a neighboring state  has provided facilities at its airports for the southern air  forces." Aden, on the other hand, has accused Eritrea of  placing its airports at the disposal of the northern command and  claimed that two ships have arrived at al-Hudaydah port loaded  with Iraqi arms from Port Sudan.    According to YSP sources, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Akwa', President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's brother-in-law, or Ahmad al-Hajari may  have arrived in Baghdad via Jordan in the company of someone by  the name of al-Khawlani, to request additional arms (missiles  and planes) which are now in Sudan having been taken there  during the Gulf war.

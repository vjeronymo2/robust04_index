Moreover, forces opposing  Rabbani's government have reiterated their demand for the  president's resignation. They have, furthermore, formed a new  political-military organization, called the Coordination Council  [Shoray-e Hamahangi] of Afghanistan's Islamic Revolution  [CCAIR]. Our correspondent in Kabul reports on the latest  developments in Afghanistan:    Since this morning, battles between the warring factions in  Kabul have intensified. Haji Farid, a spokesmen for Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], said that extensive  offensives by the forces opposing Rabbani's government began at  10.00 today, Kabul time. The offensives were waged from five  different fronts in the south and southeast of the Afghan  capital, and the attacking forces attempted to infiltrate the  defense lines set up by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's forces.    Battles in Kabul intensified after the government opposition  groups issued a statement announcing the formation of a new  political-military organization called the CCAIR. The  statement, which was issued yesterday, states that without the  resignation of Borhanoddin Rabbani from the presidency, the  battles in Kabul will continue. In response to the statement, a  spokesman for Afghan President Rabbani announced yesterday that  Rabbani's government is prepared to tender its resignation only  after general elections are held in 6 months' time.    In an interview today, the Hezb-e Eslami spokesman said: The  precondition set by the opposition forces calling for Rabbani's  resignation still stands, and Afghan Prime Minister Hekmatyar  has promised that he will resign after Rabbani does so.    Meanwhile, reports indicate that last night and this  morning,  General Dostam's war planes repeatedly bombed the positions of  Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's forces, situated in the heights around  Kabul's television station, the presidential palace and Bagram  airport in northeast Kabul. In retaliation, Rabbani's war  planes bombed the positions held by Hezb-e Eslami and General  Dostam in the south and southeast of the capital.</p>

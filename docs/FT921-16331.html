			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity Yesterday's attack by the Labour party on the regional electricity companies' interim profit increases was crudely political. It was also ineffective in the narrow sense that the market ignored it. If the RECs' profits are rising sharply now, it is partly because the companies are making good a previous under-estimation of inflation which meant customers were charged less than they might have been in 1990. Equally, mild weather a year ago means the comparison is misleading. All the same, the RECs will not escape the underlying issue of the appropriate rate of return for regulated utilities, and Labour's intervention was a reminder that a change of government could transform the industry's operating environment. At some stage before the scheduled 1995 review of the RECs' price formula, the regulator will have to take a view on returns. Unlike his counterpart in the water industry,there is nothing in his licence to require him to initiate wider discussions now, even though the National Grid is under review this year.</p>

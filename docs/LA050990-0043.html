			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOHL REJECTS SOVIET IDEA  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday rejected a Soviet suggestion that  Germany could be united before the tricky problem of its military allegiance is  resolved.  </P> <P> Kohl said Bonn wants the external aspects of unification -- such as a united  Germany's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- settled by  the autumn in talks among East and West Germany and the four victorious World  War II allies.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Saturday that solutions to  unity problems could be delayed for a few years while the two Germanys merged.  Until then, Moscow had insisted that Germany's military status be clarified  first.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Federal mediators said they would begin a 30-day "cooling off" between Eastern  Airlines Inc. and its largest union today, a move that could lead to a strike  early next month. Miami-based Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., on Tuesday  rejected an offer from the National Mediation Board for binding arbitration to  settle a 15-month-old contract dispute with its 9,000 machinists. That  rejection allowed mediators to begin the cooling off period. If no settlement  is reached by midnight EST on March 3, the union will be free to strike and  Eastern will be allowed to impose the $144 million in wage cuts it says it  needs to survive.  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Whitecroft in the black with better-than-expected Pounds 4.3m Whitecroft, the lighting, medical cotton fibre, industrial textiles and building products group, returned to profits and the dividend list in the 12 months to March 31. A pre-tax outcome of Pounds 4.3m compared with losses last time of Pounds 41.8m - a result well ahead of analyst's expectations; the shares rose 11p to 120p. The recovery was achieved despite flat turnover of Pounds 124.9m - a decline of Pounds 23,000. The previous loss included substantial provision for previously overvalued property - a sector which almost brought Whitecroft down in the recession and from which it has since exited. The improvement is better judged by operating profits which quadrupled to nearly Pounds 5.95m (Pounds 1.36m). The dividend is restored at 2p, payable from earnings per share of 8.8p compared with losses of 94.5p. Year-end borrowings were halved to Pounds 18m (Pounds 36.4m) and gearing fell from 153 per cent to 67 per cent. Mr Mike Derbyshire, chief executive, said the performance vindicated the board's decision a year ago not to launch a rights issue to reduce debt, even though some institutional investors would have backed one. This leaves a cash call available for expansion, although Mr Derbyshire stressed the company had no takeover target in sight - or any other plans that could not be financed from existing resources. Lighting increased sales by Pounds 4m to Pounds 49.7m and improved profits to Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 3.95m). Medical cotton fibre - tampons - lifted sales by 11 per cent to Pounds 15.6m, with profits of Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.79m). Building products - mainly fire-resistant doors - and textiles - a principal product is book cloth and fabrics for passports and bankbooks  - incurred small losses. Mr Derbyshire expects both sectors to recover. An easing of property markets was behind the improvement in the balance sheet. The Pounds 14.4m of written-down property awaiting disposal last year was down to Pounds 6.31m by the year-end. Since then, the company has sold an option to buy back a retail property in Stockport that it disposed of in 1991. Profit of nearly Pounds 6m has reduced current borrowings to about Pounds 12m and gearing to 34 per cent.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 9 February carries a documentary  presented by Sergey Dorenko giving the background on the current  dispute between the government and communications workers in  Russia. Dorenko says that the communications sector does not  get money directly from the government but from the television  companies it services, but bills have not been paid since  December 1992.    He says that Moscow is not suffering the consequences of the  cash crisis in the communications sector as much as other  regions of Russia. But as a result of satellites deteriorating  from orbit, television broadcasts to the Far East are likely to  stop this spring. Satellites servicing western Siberia and the  Urals will go down a bit later, he says.    In addition, the state broadcasting sector is not getting  the  state funds it needs. "At the moment the government refuses to  allow state channels to become share-holding companies, but it  does not finance them itself," he says.    Dorenko then talks about corruption in the various editorial  departments of state television when advertizing airtime is  being sold. Many ad agencies resell air time bought cheaply at  a profit, and the editorial departments compete with them.    There is no shortage of independent companies ready to help  state broadcasting out of its cash crisis, Dorenko adds, using  Ostankino's Channel 1 as an example, where this is already  happening.    Next, Irena Lesnevskaya, president of REN TV [a private  company that began broadcasting via Ostankino in 1992], is  interviewed. She says: "Any talk about state television is mere  bluff, because 78 percent of programs on Channel 1 are made by  independent television companies, and each of Ostankino's  state-funded studios has its own financial structure." She  continues: "Today, they cannot make one program on state  financing."</p>

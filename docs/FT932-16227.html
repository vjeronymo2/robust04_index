			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton 'will seek' Gatt deal authority THE Clinton Administration will ask Congress for an extension of its 'fast-track' negotiating authority until December 15 to reach a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said yesterday. Mr Rexrodt made his prediction before meeting Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, in Washington. A spokesman for Mr Kantor said a recomendation from President Clinton's advisers to ask for an extension of the 'fast-track' was 'still on the president's desk.' Officials are believed to be recommending a final extension - this would be the second - until the end of this year. They are reluctant to allow too much time to elapse, since trade negotiators invariably use all the time they are given before producing last minute compromises. The Uruguay Round is already three years past its scheduled completion date. Mr Rexrodt said he would prefer concluding the Round in time for the July summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo. However, most US officials believe there is too much work still to be done to meet such a deadline. The German minister said differences still must be resolved over intellectual property rights and dumping and countervailing duty laws.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Differing visions that divide a family - Tim Coone on why an injunction has been granted to the ousted chairman of Dunnes A SIX-MONTH boardroom struggle over the control of Dunnes Stores, the largest supermarket and retailing chain in the Irish Republic, intensified this week following a temporary High Court injunction being granted to Mr Ben Dunne, the ousted chief executive and chairman, against his other partners in the family-run company. Control of the family empire, one of the largest in Ireland and estimated to be worth some IPounds 700m (Pounds 670m), has for many Irish people taken on the semblance of a real-life soap opera, complete with family scandal and public disgrace. Mr Dunne's legal action followed the dismissal last Friday of two senior managers, including Mr Michael Irwin, the chief accountant, and the resignation of four other senior managers. The injunction restrains Dunnes from making any further dismissals of senior management or from making any investments involving sums exceeding IPounds 500,000 without approval of the full board. Mr Dunne was ousted as chairman and chief executive of the group in February after a boardroom coup by three siblings, who with him comprise the board of directors. No reasons were given for his removal, but it occurred several months after Mr Dunne resumed his duties following a conviction in a Florida court last year on a charge of cocaine possession. He paid a Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,000) fine, was ordered to attend a drug addiction clinic in London, and has been barred from entering the US. The incident caused deep embarrassment to his family, but was the opportunity his three sibling-directors had been looking for to resolve a simmering dispute over the future direction of the chain. Mr Dunne's retailing philosophy followed that of his father, also called Ben, who founded the company 50 years ago to provide quality products but at prices which made them available to a mass market and working class pockets. The group has engaged regularly in price wars with its competitors and is renowned for negotiating tough terms with suppliers. Its retail margins are very tight, but an important source of its profits is thought to be derived through supplier credit. This allows the supermarket to accumulate large sums of cash which are then invested in the short-term money market. As a private unlimited company, Dunnes is not required to disclose financial details. It is believed, however, to generate profits of about IPounds 50m on turnover of about IPounds 900m. It has 75 supermarket and drapery outlets in Ireland, with 6,000 employees. The company also has 23 stores in Northern Ireland and a further 5 in northern Britain. Mr Dunne fell out with his elder sister, Mrs Margaret Heffernan, who reportedly wanted the group to go more up-market and who won the backing of two of the other directors, Mr Frank Dunne and Ms Therese Dunne. Executive control is exercised jointly by Margaret and Frank. Mr Ben Dunne's autocratic style of management apparently helped alienate him from his siblings, as did his wish to keep the group a private concern rather than seek an eventual flotation. The one sister who supported him, Mrs Elizabeth McMahon, died of a heart attack in July. A fourth sister is not involved with the family business. Although ousted from any executive position, Mr Dunne as a director has maintained contact with senior managers to obtain financial information on the group. In an affidavit to the High Court this week, he claimed that group profits had slipped by IPounds 11m, market share had suffered 'a significant decline', and that the group was committed to a IPounds 30m capital expenditure programme which he described as 'questionable and foolhardy' and which had not received approval by the full board. Mr Irwin, the ousted chief accountant, told the High Court this week, that he believed his dismissal was due to his unwillingness to become involved in the family feud which, he said, was aimed at excluding Mr Ben Dunne. In March Mr Dunne took over Dunloe, a quoted property company, which he subsequently said he wishes to see develop into a fruit and vegetable distribution business. It is thought that he now wishes to cash in his shares, believed to represent a Dunnes stake of 20 per cent and worth about IPounds 140m, to develop the Dunloe business, but which his fellow directors in Dunnes fear he may use to set up a rival supermarket chain. The complex shareholding arrangement in Dunnes, established as a trust by its founder, makes it extremely difficult for any director to dispose of shares without the approval of the other directors. Mr Dunne has said publicly that he is unable to proceed with his plans for Dunloe because of the ongoing board disputes at Dunnes.</p>

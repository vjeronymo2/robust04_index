			<p>BFN     [Text] South African defense firms are looking for partners  to help them compete on the world arms market after decades of  apartheid. The managing director of Denel, Mr. Johan Alberts,  said in London where he is attending an air show that South  African producers of defense equipment wanted to supplement  their skills, stabilize manufacturing, strengthen their market  base, and enter into agreements on components and subcomponents.  Denel produces the Rooikat armored fighting vehicle, Rooivalk  attack helicopter, and self-propelled artillery. A division of  Denel's aerospace group is a partner with Rolls Royce in  producing gear boxes for aircraft engines.</p>

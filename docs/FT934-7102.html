			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Burgundy prices fall again Burgundy wine prices yesterday fell for a record fourth consecutive year at France's most renowned annual auction, reflecting a lacklustre world economy and overflowing supplies, writes Edmund Penning-Rowsell from Beaune. Total bidding at the Hospices de Beaune auction of 1993 wines raised FFr10.6m (Pounds 1.2m) for 759 casks compared with FFr11.85m for 663 barrels last year. Red wine prices fell by 25 per cent, and white wine by an average of 7 per cent. The Cuve Clos de la Roche fetched the highest price of FFr32,000 per barrel of 300 bottles. The drop in prices reflected lack of interest in the more expensive Burgundies. Significant, however, was the prominence of buyers on behalf of supermarkets, a recent development for high-class Burgundies.</p>

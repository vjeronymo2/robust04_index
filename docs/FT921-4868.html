			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Minister finds that sex and politics don't mix THE LAUNCH of a government booklet on sexual harassment backfired yesterday as Mr Robert Jackson, employment minister, incurred the wrath of the Equal Opportunities Commission by claiming that wolf whistles and pin-up calendars were 'acceptable in certain circumstances'. The timing of Mr Jackson's comments is unfortunate, given the government's current efforts to strengthen its appeal to female voters. New policies on after-school care for children and extra help for families under stress were launched last weekend. On Tuesday Mr Jackson lectured business on 'morally wrong' discrimination as he publicised a new government equal opportunities guide. At yesterday's launch of the sexual harassment booklet, Mr Jackson said it was impossible to provide a checklist of actions that would constitute harassment because that could 'lead down the road of political correctness'. Wolf whistles and pin-ups might be acceptable in a 'totally all-male environment where no woman will stray', he said. Following Mr Jackson's comments, the EOC said: 'We can't think of any circumstances where it would be acceptable.' A resolution from the European Community, to which Britain had been a signatory, specifically mentioned pin-ups and wolf whistles as things that were likely to be offensive to women, the EOC said. Ms Clare Short, Labour MP and campaigner against pin-ups, said Mr Jackson's words 'exposed the government's complete hypocrisy'. The launch of the booklet had been 'in order to buy women's votes', she said. Pornography in the workplace gave women the message they should not be there, she added. Mr Jackson confessed it was not until last summer, when he had sat next to the chief executive of a large company at a function, that he had taken the issue of sexual harassment seriously. The chief executive had told him of his own company's experiences of dealing with a case. According to Mr Jackson, there was no detailed information on the incidence of sexual harassment at work although 'anecdotally' it appeared to be quite a significant problem. The EOC said there was no need to rely on anecdotal evidence: surveys already showed the extent of the problem. Mr Jackson is no stranger to the gaff: his most famous faux pas was in 1990 when he told security staff at Heathrow airport that the case he was carrying was 'full of bombs'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ANPRM noted that some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include, admission to the event. We solicited comment on whether the new rule should ban this practice, or whether it should specify a form of required disclosure. Most of the comments favored requiring disclosure of the fact that an event ticket is not included. However, we have tentatively decided not to include such a requirement in the proposed rule. Consumers solicited for these tours are able to determine from the advertising material that an event ticket is not held out as included; this is distinguishable from the situation of a tour participant who paid for an event ticket and then did not receive it. Should any particular tour deceptively imply that event tickets are included when in reality they are not, the Department has authority to take enforcement action against deceptive practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANPRM sought comment on whether the rule would be impractical for events where the participants are known only a week in advance, such as the NCAA Final Four. All of the parties that commented on this issue thought that this should not be a problem, and that the rule should apply. As noted in the Comments section above, several commenters pointed out that the Final Four sells out months in advance even though the participating teams are not determined until the week before. Also, as FBA noted, the contestants in the Super Bowl have been determined only the week before on several occasions, and that does not appear to have either harmed the marketability of Super Bowl tours or resulted in additional consumer problems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the period for comment on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is normally 60 days, the Department is requesting comment on this notice within 30 days after it has been published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The rule proposed in this notice has changed little from the tentative proposal that the Department discussed in detail in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (59 FR 4614, February 1, 1994). The Comments on the ANPRM were largely supportive of the proposal, and we do not anticipate controversy over this NPRM. The proposed rules are drawn from existing regulations on charters and Super Bowl tours, and the industry is familiar with the procedures in those rules. If the volume or nature of the NPRM comments should warrant, the Department can extend the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analyses and Notices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This NPRM is considered to be a non-significant rulemaking under DOT regulatory policies and procedures, 44 FR 11034. The proposal would have minimal economic impact, and accordingly no regulatory evaluation has been prepared. The NPRM was not subject to review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I certify that the proposal, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department proposes the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. To amend title 14, chapter II, subchapter D by adding a new part 381, to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 381_SPECIAL EVENT TOURS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 381.1&blank;Purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 381.3&blank;Applicability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 381.5&blank;Definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 381.7&blank;Advertising. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 381.9&blank;Sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 381.11&blank;Refunds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 381.13&blank;Price increases. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 40113(a) and 41712 (formerly sections 204(a) and 411 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;381.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this part is ensure that air travelers who have purchased tours to special events will receive the promised admission to the event.

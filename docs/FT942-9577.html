			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The true costs of investing - Where your money goes . . . unit trusts The government is taking the lead in forcing financial companies to disclose their true costs. High charges nibble away your profits and they are not always easy to spot unaided. Low charges will never make up for a bad investment performance, but high charges can seriously damage even a good investment performance. Our new series shows you how to check out the costs before you have tied up your money. We explain: What all the different costs are. What the standard charges are for different types of investment. Where to find the figures you need. And we provide a cost check-list for your own use. We will be covering all the major types of investment: unit trusts, investment trusts, personal equity plans, shares, life insurance and pensions. The series begins this week with unit trusts. Next week, we cover investment trusts.                          *      *      * Unit trusts can be a cheap way to buy investment expertise and spread risk across a range of shares, especially where small sums of money are concerned. Investing directly in shares can be expensive, not least because of high minimum dealing costs. But unit trusts should cost less than direct share investment because of the economies of scale which fund managers have. The basic charges When the money is not working for you, here is where it goes. The annual management charge is the easiest to spot. It can be as low as 0.5 per cent (for some indexed funds and bond funds) or a more typical 1 to 1.5 per cent  -and, occasionally, more than 1.5 per cent. With a 1.5 per cent charge, Pounds 15 will be deducted for every Pounds 1,000 of the value of your units once a year. In practice, a lower charge could be deducted more often - for example, half the annual charge twice a year, or one-12th every month. The initial charge is more complicated. It is, typically, 5 to 6 per cent of the money you put into the trust. On an investment of Pounds 1,000, therefore, the charge would be Pounds 50 to Pounds 60. Around three percentage points (ie, Pounds 30 of that Pounds 50 or Pounds 60) might be used to pay commission to the intermediaries who sell the trust. For this reason, the initial charge is the one cost you might be able to reduce. If you buy units through a commission-based adviser, you can try to negotiate a cut in the commission he takes - which would leave more money to buy units. Similarly, you might be able to negotiate a reduction if you buy direct from the management company. The more you have to invest, the more chance of success in negotiating a reduction. The bid/offer spread is a better way of measuring the initial costs of investing than the quoted initial charge. You buy units at the offer price and sell them at the bid price. The difference between the two is the spread, which can vary greatly from one type of trust to the other. The spread includes the initial charge. But while that might be 5 per cent, the spread can be higher - perhaps nearer 6 per cent, or more. This is because, on top of the initial charge, the fund manager adds the dealing costs which he incurs when buying and selling shares, including the spread on the underlying shares. And the unit trust spread can get slightly wider or narrower, depending on market conditions. There is another complication. Bid/offer spreads are allowed to move within a broader range of, for example, 8 per cent: in other words, the maximum permitted offer price could be 8 per cent higher than the minimum permitted bid price. So, the buying price could be at the top of the overall 8 per cent range, with the selling price 6 per cent lower; or the selling price could be at the bottom of the overall range of 8 per cent, with the buying price 6 per cent higher. Fund managers will move to the lower end of the range if lots of investors are selling, but go higher if there are lots of buyers. New charging structures Unit trusts are restricted in how they can charge investors. But the rules are under review, and it is possible that a single pricing structure could be introduced soon. So-called single pricing might not save investors any money, but it could make it easier to spot the charges. Meanwhile, some management companies have found ways round the unit trust rules by experimenting with Pep charges. The main innovation, first brought in by Fidelity, is to reduce the initial charge to around 2 per cent but to add an exit charge if you cash in early. Fidelity charges 3 per cent in year one, reducing to 0 per cent in year four - so loyalty is rewarded. How to find the charges You should be able to find details of charges in sales leaflets. Sometimes, though, they may be buried right at the back of a leaflet among the small print. Bid/offer spreads also are more likely to be found there. It is probably wise to ask an adviser or the management company what the usual spread has been. Find out, also, the extent to which the spread has moved within the broader permissible range. The prices' pages in the Financial Times give bid and offer prices as well as cancellation prices. These are the lowest bid price allowed taking account of the trust's assets. If cancellation and bid prices are the same, the spread is at the bottom end of the broader range. Sellers will be getting the lowest possible cash-in price for their units, but buyers will get relatively cheap units. The effect of charges Take two funds, Gartmore British Growth and Gartmore UK Equity Income, in which Pounds 10,000 was invested five years ago. The annual charge is 1.5 per cent each. Assuming all dividends have been re-invested, the value when we did our test was: Five years zero charges: British Growth Pounds 24,270;UK Equity Income Pounds 18,862. Annual charges, but no bid/offer spread (offer to offer basis): British Growth Pounds 22,590; UK Equity Income Pounds 17,330. Actual returns (offer to bid basis): British Growth Pounds 21,100; UK Equity Income Pounds 16,200. The managers of these funds would need to increase the value of investments by around 6.5 per cent for the investors simply to get back the money they invest. How long it would take to reach that stand-still point depends very much on how fast markets are rising. Do costs matter? Some people argue that costs are irrelevant. What counts is performance. Choose fund managers who put more money consistently into the hands of their unit-holders. It does not matter that they may also be making more for themselves along the way. In practice, though, charges cannot be ignored completely. The higher the charges, the greater the skill a manager needs to turn in a decent profit. And if you end up holding the same fund for five to 10 years or more, initial charges may have less impact on the overall return than the annual charge. Certainly, if you choose an income fund because you want income (and do not want to re-invest dividends), think twice before choosing one with a high annual charge. Consider, too, that even if a fund rises in value, investors get the same amount of money in their hands whether 3 per cent is taken off at the beginning or the end.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               COST CHECK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If you cannot choose between different funds, charges could be the deciding factor.

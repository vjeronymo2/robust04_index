			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONISTON PARTNERS TO SEEK CONTROL OF UAL CORP.'S BOARD  </P> <P> The New York buyout firm Coniston Partners, which two years ago forced a  restructuring of the parent of United Airlines, said today it plans to seek  control of UAL Corp.'s board.  </P> <P> Coniston partner Paul Tierney said the group, through a vehicle called Condor  Partners LP, has made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  stating that it has spent roughly $333 million in recent months amassing 2.1  million UAL common shares, representing 9.7% of the total outstanding.  </P> <P> "We intend to seek control of the board," Tierney told a reporter.  </P> <P> With control of the board, Coniston would be able to steer the company toward a  sale, restructuring or recapitalization.  </P> <P> The statement followed rumors on Wall Street this week that an investor might  try to force the company's board to boost the price of UAL shares. The stock  has dropped sharply since the pilots and management failed last month in a  $6.75-billion takeover bid for the parent of the nation's second-largest  airline.  </P> <P> UAL declined to comment on the Coniston statement.  </P> <P> UAL stock rose sharply on the news and traded at $183.50 at midday, up $10.50 a  share on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The stock had traded as high as $294 in September after the company's board  agreed to the employee-management group's $300-a-share bid, but skidded to  around $145 after the effort fell apart last month.  </P> <P> Coniston said it would seek to remove all current UAL directors except Frank  Olson, chairman of Hertz, and UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf. It said its nominees  to the board are Keith Gollust, Augustus Oliver and Tierney, the principal  partners of the New York investment firm.  </P> <P> It said that if elected, its board members would seek to push up the value of  UAL stock. This is normally done through a sale of all or part of a company or  a restructuring.  </P> <P> "If elected, Condor's nominees will seek to execute a transaction that  maximizes value for stockholders, provides job security and, if desired, an  opportunity for equity ownership for unionized and non-unionized employees, and  provides the company with a stable base for long-term growth," the group said  in a statement.  </P> <P> Wall Street traders said the disclosure puts tremendous pressure on the UAL  board. "If the vote were held today, Coniston would be a landslide winner," one  trader said. He added, "there is no chance of the board's beating Coniston  without some alternative."  </P> <P> "The board has to respond fast. All Coniston needs is signatures for 51% of the  shareholders and it's over," said another trader.  </P> <P> Coniston is believed to have held a stake in the company since 1987, when the  partnership was instrumental in forcing a restructuring of Allegis Corp., the  former parent of United that also owned hotels and Hertz, the rental car  company.  </P></p>

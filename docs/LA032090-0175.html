			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY JUST WANTS TO PLAY BALL  </P> <P> Darryl Strawberry was one of the first New York Mets to show up for work after  word came that the lockout had ended.  </P> <P> He says he isn't going to cause controversy anymore.  </P> <P> Strawberry is coming off nearly a month of alcohol rehabilitation. That  followed an incident in which he threatened his wife, Lisa, with a gun in their  Encino home.  </P> <P> The off-season was filled with troubled times for the 28-year-old outfielder.  </P> <P> Strawberry had the worst year of his career in 1989 and said on more than one  occasion that he wanted to leave the club.  </P> <P> "I look back at last year, and I really didn't have much motivation,"  Strawberry said. "I couldn't handle the pressure."  </P> <P> Strawberry hit .225 last season with 29 homers and 77 RBIs. Certainly not bad  numbers, but not what the Mets expect from their cleanup man.  </P> <P> "I locked myself in a corner and let my life get out of control. Never let  anyone get close to me," he said. "But I've accepted what's happened. Now I'm  prepared to help the Mets win a championship."  </P> <P> Strawberry was one of a few Mets who took batting practice on a damp Monday at  the Mets' spring training complex.  </P> <P> He doesn't want to talk about his time in rehabilitation or about his marital  problems.  </P> <P> "I'm not a controversial person anymore," Strawberry said.  </P> <P> At the start of spring training last year, Strawberry told the Mets that he  wanted to renegotiate his contract. The Mets said no, and he walked out of camp  for a couple of days.  </P> <P> Before that, Strawberry took a swing at teammate Keith Hernandez just before  the team picture was taken.  </P> <P> Strawberry's contract expires at the end of the 1990 season and he is eligible  to become a free agent.  </P> <P> Mets General Manager Frank Cashen said that in order for Strawberry to join the  $3-million club, he has to prove he deserves it.  </P> <P> "I'm just going to play the 1990 season and see what happens," Strawberry said.  "I just want baseball to be fun again."  </P> <P> Strawberry isn't promising a monster year, just a good one.  </P> <P> "One thing I can say," Strawberry said, "is that the guys who wrote me off last  year, the guys who said I would be traded, they'll be in for a big surprise.  I'm not going to say anything else. But they'll be surprised."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS SEIZED IN ALLEGED TRIAL SABOTAGE PLOT  </P> <P> A Canadian nanny whose testimony helped convict the adopted son of a  millionaire tobacco executive on a sex charge involving a 3-year-old girl has  been arrested as she allegedly tried to collect $200,000 not to show up at a  retrial, the FBI said Thursday.  </P> <P> Isabel Anderson, who testified that she saw Luis Gillespie raping the child in  his adoptive father's Hancock Park mansion in June, 1985, was taken into  custody in Seattle on Wednesday as she collected the money from someone she  thought was sent by a defense attorney, authorities said.  </P> <P> The unidentified person was an FBI agent.  </P> <P> As it turned out, there will be no retrial. The U.S. attorney's office, seeing  its primary witness against Gillespie apparently discredited, filed for  dismissal of the charges against him.  </P> <P> "It would have made a retrial extremely difficult," Assistant U.S. Atty. Julie  Blackshaw said.  </P> <P> Arrested with Anderson, the FBI said, was Vancouver, Canada, resident Kelley  Peter Wiebe, 29, who was accused of being Anderson's lookout for the meeting.  </P> <P> Gillespie was convicted in Los Angeles federal court in 1987 of transporting  his godchild from his native Ecuador for immoral purposes. He was sentenced to  10 years in prison.  </P> <P> Last July, however, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal reversed the  conviction, ruling that U.S. District Judge David Kenyon erred by allowing  prejudicial and irrelevant testimony that the defendant and his adoptive  father, David Gillespie, had a homosexual relationship.  </P> <P> The appellate court ordered a new trial.  </P> <P> In the meantime, however, Gillespie served two years in prison, because he was  not allowed to remain free on bail pending appeal.  </P> <P> According to the joint announcement by Steven L. Pomerantz and Lawrence G.  Lawler, special agents in charge of the Seattle and Los Angeles FBI offices,  respectively, Anderson initially demanded $500,000 not to testify at a retrial.  </P> <P> The FBI would say only that she made her offer to a "defense attorney" and that  the amount "was later reduced" to $200,000. It was not made clear whether the  lower amount was her suggestion or that of the agent.  </P> <P> Gillespie's current attorney, Robert Perry, was not available to discuss the  case.  </P> <P> At the time Anderson and her companion were arrested, the FBI said, Wiebe was  carrying "a large bag to accommodate the monies." Like Anderson, he was  reportedly a Canadian citizen. He was charged with conspiracy.  </P> <P> Both were taken before a U.S. magistrate in Seattle and held pending further  hearings.  </P></p>

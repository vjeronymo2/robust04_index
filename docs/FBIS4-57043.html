			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Renata Verissimo in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Army military police troops early this morning  occupied the Federal Police [PF] superintendency buildings in  Brasilia and Sao Paulo. Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa  stated that the action coordinated by the Army is designed to  stop the abuses being committed during the 52-day strike by PF  policemen.    President Itamar Franco stated that the Army's occupation  will not end until PF policemen return to work. He said the  government is only seeking to guarantee basic services, such as  the issuance of passports and the guarding of airports and  border areas.    Franco said the government will not permit acts of  disrespect  against citizens, and emphasized that everything is being done  in accordance with the Constitution. He said:    [Begin Franco recording] I can tell you that this is a  government that upholds dialogue, a democratic government that  only called out the Armed Forces to preserve order. It is  unacceptable for them to have used fireworks and to have  prevented the PF director from entering the building. Those who  are willing to strike may do so, but they have to do it in an  orderly fashion, in accordance with the Constitution and the  laws. All the executive branch has done is to enforce the  Constitution and the laws, and it will continue to do so. [end  recording]    Franco made it clear that this is not an act of  intervention,  but an action taken by the government to guarantee the people's  right to travel freely. He does not believe the government will  lose face as a result of its decision to intervene in the PF.  He said:    [Begin Franco recording] I believe the government will not  lose face for taking side with the people, whose right to travel  freely is being curtailed. Thus I believe the government is, in  this case, defending the people. [end recording]    The decision to intervene in the PF was made last night  during a meeting held by Franco with the military ministers, the  justice minister, the federal administration minister, and the  PF director.    Costa reported that the operation began in Brasilia at 0140,  and that President Franco was kept abreast of developments by  General Fernando Cardoso, chief of the military household.</p>

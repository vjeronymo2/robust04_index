			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Probe into Dan-Air's BA merger THE European Commission has begun a one-month inquiry into the impact of the merger between British Airways and Dan-Air, the ailing UK airline, on services between Belgium and Britain, writes Andrew Hill. Belgium complained about the possible anti-competitive effects of the deal at the end of November. The Commission explained yesterday that it did not begin its formal investigation until January 19, because Belgium did not initially provide enough information about its complaint. It announced in November that it would not investigate the Dan-Air takeover because it was too small to fall under Brussels' jurisdiction, but Belgium activated a previously unused clause in the EC's merger rules which allows a separate inquiry into the implications for a national market.</p>

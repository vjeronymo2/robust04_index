EMI CDC7 54577-2 AS THE rouble plummets, any musical organisation in Russia that has forged Western links must be humming a happy tune. The country's industry may be out-of-date, unable to compete, but when it comes to selling the arts abroad, the old-style Russianness of what is on offer counts as tradition and that is very marketable. Probably the most prestigious, certainly the most successful at wooing Western interest, has been the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg. In a wide-ranging interview in next month's Opera magazine the Kirov's Artistic Director, Valery Gergiev, outlines the full extent of his business plan, including regular visits to the West and joint productions with Western opera-houses. In particular, a record contract with Philips has produced a series of recordings of opera and ballet, one of each new this month. To opera-lovers in Britain the Kirov production of Prokofiev's War and Peace (by the British producer Graham Vick) will already be familiar from a live BBC broadcast. The intention was to bring it to Covent Garden, but that is now on hold - ironically because of financial constraints at the British end, not the Russian. The CDs must suffice, at least for a while. And a fine substitute they make. There is only one serious reservation, which must be mentioned at the outset. The recording was taken live at the Maryinsky Theatre, a handsome building and with an acceptable acoustic, as far as I recall; but that is not how it comes across here. There is no life to the sound at all. Everything is deadened, as though heavy velvet curtains have been hung around to soak up the top and bottom frequencies. Fortunately, Gergiev is not aiming for a showy performance. He is not given to melodramatic gestures; he does not milk the score for emotion as Rostropovich did in his recording. Instead, the opera acquires a tenderness and a depth of feeling that do not necessarily come easily to it. I found that the shortcomings of the sound quality ceased to matter as the opera began to work its spell. The cast includes some of the best Russian singers who have yet to make an impact on the international stage. Alexander Gergalov and Yelena Prokina make a youngish-sounding and touching couple as Andrey and Natasha. Gegam Gregoriam, a singer with a good chance of making his mark in the West as a Verdi or Puccini tenor, gives a vivid portrayal as Pierre. Kutuzov's big patriotic hymn to the Russian people asks for the grandest of Russian basses. Nikolai Okhotnikov is unfortunately not that, but he brings some spirit to the piece. I was surprised to find this important solo sliced in half in one rival recording. Gergiev performs the score without cuts and the whole opera is fitted economically on to three CDs. The booklet, in four languages, is splendid. A better sonic advertisement for Gergiev and his orchestra comes with the set of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Strangely enough, this was also recorded at the Maryinsky Theatre, but not (one imagines) with an audience present or with the orchestra in the pit. The sound is richer and more suave this time. Appropriately so, for now it is clear how cultured are the Kirov players - no piercing brass or straining violins in the familiar Russian style here - and Gergiev himself, as conductor. The whole performance presents the ballet as an aristocratic divertissement, with upper-class playing to match. A pair of new discs from Vladimir Ashkenazy features another conductor of Russian music who does not easily give in to hysteria. The Stravinsky is an appealing programme, conducted with a spring in the step that makes the rhythms dance, but the playing of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra is not sharp enough. The wind chording, for example, is never quite together. Perhaps it was untimely that I received this disc shortly after hearing the orchestra's Berlin Philharmonic compatriots in Stravinsky's Rite of Spring at the Royal Albert Hall. The Shostakovich is a more interesting prospect. This disc couples the composer's two final works for the voice, written in the mid-1970s as death beckoned. Previous recordings of the Michelangelo Suite have been by growling Russian basses, all dark, implacable, unrelieved gloom. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, in what must be one of his last recordings, comes from a very different background and turns the music round to look out on a world of tenderness and half-remembered sensuality, a mellower vision of old age. He shouts too much in the sarcastic Captain Lebyadkin songs, but those are only a brief, pithy addendum to the disc. The two EMI recordings are both of big symphonic showpieces. At least, that is how Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra deal with Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony. To judge from this proud display, the strength and richness of the Philadelphia strings are as remarkable as ever. Even without a conductor as bold, as wholehearted as Muti, one suspects they would dominate the performance. As it is, Muti plays the game and makes his points with magniloquent gestures, even when keeping up the momentum might have been preferable. This is Shostakovich with panache and a high gloss finish. In the Fifth Symphony of Prokofiev, Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra do not have that route available to them, for better or worse. There are times, especially in the slower music, when one wishes that the ensemble might be tighter, the rhythms more decisively pointed, but the overall view of the symphony works well. Rattle never overplays his hand and has the good sense to tap the Adagio's bitter-sweet appeal without excessive indulgence. How many recordings there must be of these symphonies by now] - a bountiful source of export earnings, if only the Russian orchestras can get their hands on it.</p>

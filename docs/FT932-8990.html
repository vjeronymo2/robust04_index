			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Sport: Bright and dull - Cricket AS WE neared the Northampton cricket ground last Sunday, we came upon a road-race. Officials pointed the way for men in coloured shorts and vests who sweated and panted, grimaced and tried to re-attach their flapping numbers as they ran. It was a bad omen but I comforted myself with the thought that they were probably doing it for charity. That is more than can be said for what the programme published for Sunday League matches calls 'the bright new world of Sunday cricket', sponsored by AXA Equity and Law. The Test and County Cricket Board agreed with AXA to make that world one of coloured clothes, white cricket balls and black sight-screens, because of what the programme's editor, Ralph Dellor, calls 'many benefits for cricket.' He mentions two, the first money, the second youth appeal. Northampton Cricket Club has new bars and cafes and a knot of shops and stalls. On Sunday there was a jazz quartet tootling away - more a foyer of the bright new world than a cricket pavilion. The much vaunted 'replica kit market' relies on such shops and stalls selling county shirts for Pounds 25.99 each, which is a lot, even for a Northampton shirt in all its faded maroon and sour yellow glory. 'The manufacturers claim they're very good quality,' said the county's chief executive, Stephen Coverdale, smiling like anything. Gloucestershire were the first to show off their full array of new 'county colours' last Sunday. They took the field in dark blue shell-suits and baseball caps, with big red and white stripes round the neck and clashing blue jerseys to pull over the t-shirts, in some cases over the jackets as well. Everyone looked ghastly. No-one gave off the faintest whiff of quality or glamour, not even Chris Broad, stroking his curly hair languidly. Someone at AXA thought of pointing out that coloured cricket clothes are not new. The back of the programme has a picture of W G Grace and fellow cricketers in 1880, posing in coloured neck-scarves, caps, buckles and belts. Some wear striped, a few wear coloured shirts and Grace sports an orange and yellow striped MCC blazer. I should not think he played in his blazer. The picture is an advert for white trousers, cool cotton shirts and splashes of colour, not garish nylon from head to foot. But then I am not a track-suit type. Several players thought it was time I changed. Gloucestershire's bowler, Martin Gerrard, sang the praises of cricket's new style: 'I'd say it's going to be a success. It's different. It makes a change.' Being different seems to be at a premium and to keep the bright new world distinctive, even its strongest supporters thought it should be restricted to Sundays, so there would be two styles of cricket on offer. Umpires are a conservative breed and looked less happy with their place in all this. Bad weather at Northampton forced them to make repeated excursions to inspect conditions. Jackie Hampshire, looking like a superior lavatory attendant in his bright blue jacket, also looked painfully embarrassed. 'Seeing is believing,' announced the public address system cryptically, when Hampshire and John Holder walked out in their jackets to re-start play. The white ball did not make the fielding look more auspicious, though sharp fielding is one of the blessings of limited over cricket. To help everyone see clearly, the new cricket is played in front of sight-screens covered in black cloths that billow in the wind, at once absurd and dreary. It was hard luck for the organisers at Northampton that rain reduced the opening game to low spirits and less than 40 overs a side, removing any chance to show what 50 overs a side has to offer. If anything, this reduction lessened the pain of the awkward new timetable. Play is supposed to start at noon which is neither a morning start nor an after-lunch start. The bright-new-world Sunday lunch is at the surrealist time of 3.10pm. 'You could always bring a bacon roll in a flask,' offered one of a small gang of Gloucestershire supporters. They did not want to comment on the bright new world. Their Northamptonshire counterparts were less reticent. A doleful and well-lubricated local had no doubt that it was all a load of rubbish. I spoke to some boys between about 10 and 14. They were not interested in cricket clothes or trappings, new or old. They were there to watch Allan Lamb hit big sixes. It is the uninitiated that this new world hopes to attract. A market research expert on television the other night explained: 'The young like everything bright. We know that. All we have to do is work out how best to relate that to cricket.' I am inclined to think that it is the cricket, not the decor, that must appeal to people. The Sunday game needs gusto and panache to survive. Watching Gloucestershire expire limply for 123 last Sunday, I could not imagine even flashing lights giving the bright new world of Sunday cricket some sparkle.</p>

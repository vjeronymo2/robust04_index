			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren today expressed the hope that more business people  from U.S. securities circles will become involved in China's  infrastructure construction and invest in more fields.    Meeting here today with John Chalsty, president of the  Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation, Rong said  China has a huge market and its investment environment is  improving, adding that from both present and long-term points of  view, the prospect of trade and cooperation in economy and  technology between the two countries is promising.    The Chinese vice-president considered it wise that President  Clinton recently declared the extension of China's MFN  [most-favored nation] status and the termination of linking the  MFN issue to human rights, saying that this decision is in line  with fundamental interests of the two peoples and is beneficial  to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving the two countries'  relations.    Rong expressed his thanks for the work that Chalsty's firm  had done in extending China's MFN status.    He told Chalsty that the measures China has adopted this  year  in the reform of finance, taxes, planning, investments and  foreign trade are going smoothly. The state revenue has  increased and foreign exchange rate is stable, he said.    Although prices have risen, Rong said, the Chinese  Government  has taken effective measures to control the prices.    Rong pointed out that the current work of the government is  focusing on handling well the relations between reform,  development and stability.    Chalsty said he had held successful talks with relevant  Chinese departments.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK Christmas tree buyers go up-market - Customers want bushier varieties that do not drop their needles Hormone therapy for Christmas trees might sound a bit far-fetched. But the novel technique is being tested for the first time in the UK as part of a drive by growers to respond to the demands of an increasingly discerning public. For decades British customers have been content to buy a traditional Norway spruce at Christmas and sweep up the needles as they drop off in centrally heated living rooms. But now the market - which takes over 5m trees worth at least Pounds 50m a year - is demanding varieties with no 'needle drop' and developing a taste for bushier or more scented types, with less spiky needles. Hormone therapy, already used in Denmark, involves spraying the central leader, or main spike, of the Christmas tree to inhibit its growth and allow the side branches to become more bushy. Mr Joseph Noblett, a dealer based near Preston in Lancashire, plans to try it out on top-priced Noble firs on several plots in Scotland next year. He sells about 30,000 trees a year, most of which are Lodgepole pines from Scotland - similar to Scots pines but with darker, straighter needles. Bushy growth on these trees can be encouraged through seed selection without the need for expensive hormone treatment. 'We believe there's been a significant growth in the market for Lodgepole pines in the last couple of years, particularly in the north of England and the Midlands,' he says. Enthusiasm for the Lodgepole is a bonus for woodland owners, who have used the trees for the past two decades as a 'nurse species' to force the growth of Sitka spruce, the main timber tree. Lodgepoles are good at taking up nutrients from deep, peaty soil, which they then transfer to the Sitkas as their roots inter-link. Normally they wither and die after 25 to 30 years as the Sitkas shade them out, says Mr Bruce Taylor, forestry manager with Bell Ingram, a firm of chartered surveyors, which manages 25,000 acres of commercial woodland on estates in northern Scotland. However, the more recently introduced Alaskan variety of Lodgepole is proving suitable for the Christmas tree market and can provide landowners with a net return of up to Pounds 3 a tree when harvested after seven to 10 years, once its 'nursing' role is over. 'The Lodgepole's main asset is that it holds its needles,' Mr Taylor explains. 'It can be cut in October and still have its needles in mid-January. The Norway spruce has to be cut in December, otherwise the needles will fall off.' The cost of Lodgepole or Scots pines is the same as or slightly more than that of Norway spruces. Yet despite the recession, the biggest growth in the market has been in the more elegant and expensive Nordmann and Noble firs, according to the British Christmas Tree Growers' Association. These have softer needles, stronger branches and a more pronounced scent and they command a retail price of about Pounds 5 a foot, compared with Pounds 2 a foot for a Norway spruce. 'People are keen to have real trees, and there's quite a lot of money about,' says Mr Tony Richardson, the association's secretary. The market share of the Nordmann fir has grown from 5 per cent to 15 per cent in the past five years, while that of the Norway spruce has dropped from 75 per cent to 60-65 per cent. As growers have learnt to shape Lodgepole and Scots pines for the Christmas market, their share has risen to about 10 per cent. Less than a fifth of the trees on sale in Britain this year are imported - mainly from Denmark and Belgium. This is partly because expert Danes have begun to grow Christmas trees in the UK and partly because British producers are improving their methods. Woodland managers like Bell Ingram are urging landowners to take advantage of the Christmas market and increase production. Otherwise, they believe, UK supplies of pines like the Lodgepole could become scarce because of the decline in new timber plantings that followed the abolition of tax concessions in 1988. 'The market is being built up just now, but it might disappear again,' says Mr Taylor.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: French compounding exchange rate problem Sir, Samuel Brittan sets out concisely the balance of opposing forces on the French Franc/D-Mark exchange rate ('Modest repairs to ERM 'fault lines'', February 15). Rather than a European Monetary Institute, or council of so-called 'wise men' though, a mechanism already exists for spotting currency misalignments and making necessary adjustments. It is the Dollars 300bn a day foreign exchange market. No EC country can be immune from the dramatic economic slowdown in Germany but France's rigid adherence to the ERM and the interest rates necessary to prevent speculation in the foreign exchange market are making a bad situation worse in the short term. The interest rates set by the Bundesbank may or may not be appropriate for Germany but it is hard to imagine they are appropriate for France at the moment. What have the authorities to fear from a floating franc? If they believe their own rhetoric about fundamentals, the currency may even appreciate on interest rate cuts designed to stimulate economic growth. The way to find out is to float openly or to set such wide fluctuation bands that the exchange rate is not a policy constraint. Mr Brittan suggests that the searching for correct exchange rates 'is like looking in a dark room for a black cat which is not there'. The French view of European monetary union compounds this problem by keeping the cat to guard against a German mouse which is not there either.

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei presses on to new high for the year BUYING by individuals, foreigners and investment trusts lifted a wide range of equities and the Nikkei average gained 3 per cent, closing at a new high for the year in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei was finally ahead 554.53 at 18,727.90 after opening at the day's low of 18,234.37 and soaring to a high of 18,788.30 in the morning session. Volume swelled to 650m shares from 357m. Life insurers were also seen participating in active buying. Advances overwhelmed declines by 933 to 144, with 77 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks jumped 42.61 to 1,408.26. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index moved forward 7.42 to 1,131.07. Yesterday's advance took most market participants by surprise. 'Nobody thought that it would recover this far,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life. He added that most tokkin funds, or specified money trusts, held by corporations faced book closing for the financial year today, and suggested that the rise could have been the result of manipulation by some investors. Mr Alan Livesy at Kleinwort Benson said: 'I thought the bear market was over, but I was not expecting this'. However, he warned that shares looked overbought. Mr Yuichi Kohashi, analyst at Daiwa Securities, argued that a rise in money supply was the force behind the strength in share prices. 'The monetary base for money supply increased 3.3 per cent in January and 4.7 per cent in February,' he maintained. According to chartists, the nearest resistance line for the Nikkei index is 18,908.47, reached last September, followed by 19,345.95, the closing for the previous fiscal year-end last March. Securities houses continued to rise on hopes that the recent market advance would help their sagging earnings. Nomura Securities climbed Y100 to Y1,840 and Nikko Securities Y55 to Y845. Trading houses were in demand on interest from investors looking to buy oversold shares, following recommendations by a UK house. Marubeni was the second most active issue of the day, appreciating Y66 to Y466, followed by Itochu, Y34 ahead at Y466. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which sparked off the recent rally, added Y18,000 at Y834,000, while NEC, holder of some 8,000 NTT shares, gained Y14 at Y770. In Osaka, the OSE average surged 475.25 to 19,595.08 in volume of 69.6m shares. Roundup A NUMBER of the Pacific Rim markets displayed resilience. HONG KONG made headway, encouraged that China's criticism on Wednesday of Governor Chris Patten's reform plans was milder than might have been expected. The Hang Seng index closed 92.93 higher at 6,051.26, although down from the day's peak of 6,102.72, in HKDollars 3.6bn turnover. Cheung Kong and its Hutchison affiliate each rose 20 cents to HKDollars 22 and HKDollars 15.90 respectively. They announced higher 1992 profits after the market closed. SINGAPORE moved forward for the third consecutive day and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.16 to 1,668.79 in volume of 112.8m shares. Listed brokerage companies saw renewed interest after Monday's announcement which allowed workers to use more money from mandatory retirement savings for personal investment. TAIWAN saw strong speculative buying of financial issues which helped the weighted index rise 152.84, or 3.4 per cent, to 4,664.46 in active turnover of TDollars 64.8bn. Leading banks, which led last month's rally, were in demand, as were construction issues on expectations of better profits and dividends this year. SEOUL was boosted by late buying of large capitalisation shares in continued response to the easing of tension between South and North Korea. The composite index put on 3.34 at 666.39 in turnover of Won645.79bn. Construction issues were strong on news that Hyundai Engineering and Construction had received a letter of intent from Libya for a Dollars 1.6bn contract to build four electrical power generators. Hyundai Construction shares advanced Won400 to Won18,600. MANILA lost ground, unnerved by a government warning that power cuts could reach 12 hours a day as ageing plants become less reliable. The composite index weakened 20.46 to 1,435.58. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed to easier in thin trading and the composite index lost 0.15 at 640.24. Hong Leong Industries, which reported strong half-year results, moved ahead 35 cents to MDollars 9.15, while Genting rose a further 20 cents to MDollars 15.50 after its better than expected 1992 results. NEW ZEALAND retreated after the strong run of the last two weeks. The NZSE-40 index shed 9.95 to 1,580.53.</p>

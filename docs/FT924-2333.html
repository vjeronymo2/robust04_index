			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Held together by syrup - The revival of 'Carousel' at the National THE FIRST night of Carousel at the Royal National Theatre ended with a standing ovation, and there is much in Nicholas Hytner's new production of the old Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that is worthy of applause. I prefer to walk alone in expressing reservations, but first will acknowledge the accomplishments. The production is, of course, terrific. The RNT pulls out all the stops using all its resources, now supplemented by Cameron Mackintosh, on what is already a pretty good score. Carousel does not contain very many songs, but they include the irrepressible 'June is Bustin' Out All Over', which is here given a magnificent rendering by Patricia Routledge, as well as 'When the Children Are Asleep'. It was not the first modern musical to use ballet. Rodgers and Hammerstein had already done that in Oklahoma] This must be the first revival, however, which has commissioned a new ballet by a major choreographer - the late Kenneth MacMillan. The main dance scene, performed by Bonnie Moore and the Russian, Stanislav Tchassov, is breathtaking, and it is gratifying to see ballet on the stage of the RNT. The orchestra, led by Rolf Wilson, is first rate throughout. There are also marvellous opportunities for sets. The designer Bob Crowley knows by now how to use them to the full. Apart from the early appearance of the real carousel, note the scene at the end of the first act where everyone gets into small boats. Carousel has a plot of a kind, as well as effects, so there is room for some acting, notably by Michael Hayden as the central character Billy Bigelow - called Billy, one assumes, because he is meant to be a good guy at heart, and Bigelow because while his heart is big, some of his actions are low. Hayden covers the range. There is a musical climax in the number that has become the theme song of the Liverpool football supporters: 'You'll Never Walk Alone'. Sung first by Ms Routledge, and reprised by the entire cast at the end, it is undoubtedly powerful. Not least, Carousel has an interesting background. A series of informative programme notes reveals that the piece is closely based on a play by the Hungarian Ferenc Molnar, first performed in Budapest in 1909. Puccini, who was chasing Molnar's divorced wife, wanted to make an opera of it, but abandoned it in favour of Turandot. Rodgers and Hammerstein picked up the English translation and added a happy ending. Molnar saw Carousel in rehearsal in New York in 1945 and thoroughly approved. Central European sentimentality had passed to New England and gained an evangelical fervour. So why do I damn with faint praise and persist in thinking that the recently revived and contemporaneous Annie Get Your Gun is much to be preferred? The answer is that Annie is rougher and tougher and has infinitely greater variety. Annie is a wild figure, a brilliant shot who lays down her gun for her man. The cast of Carousel looks like a bunch of boy scouts and girl guides doing The Gang Show, and the only song that approaches Annie in zest is 'June is Bustin' Out All Over'. For the rest, Carousel is a musical moral crusade. Any excuse for sentimentality is seized upon, like singing songs about the joys of having breakfast in the kitchen. It is also irrational for a character (Bigelow) who has spent most of his life as a heel and has failed to commit murder only because the man he was attempting to knife turned out to have a gun should be sent to the backyard of heaven. I found these scenes ridiculous. As for 'You'll Never Walk Alone', it is clear that evangelists and football supporters have a great deal in common. True, it is all done with great style and technical excellence, but Carousel is held together by syrup. The production is sponsored by Oracle UK.</p>

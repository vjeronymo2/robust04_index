			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Korean Peninsula Needs Peace and Stability"]    [Text] The visit of ROK President Kim Yong-sam to China is  an important event in the relations between the two countries.  Both countries are ancient countries, and traditional relations  go back several thousands years. After the war, for various  reasons, the two countries discontinued exchanges for a long  period and official diplomatic relations were only established  recently. In recent years, with the common efforts of both  sides, PRC-ROK relations have developed rapidly and the scope of  exchanges and cooperation has become more and more extensive.  China has become the third biggest trading partner of the ROK,  and the ROK is also the sixth biggest trading partner for China.  Last year, the volume of trade between the two countries  amounted to $11 billion. ROK investment in China is nearly $1  billion. China is one of the countries in which the ROK has  made the greatest investment. All this has laid a very good  foundation for further developing friendly relations and  mutually beneficial economic cooperation between the two  countries. Friendship and cooperation between China and the ROK  are conducive to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region and to  world peace.  <H5>  Crisis Can Only Be Resolved Through Talks </H5>   President Kim Yong-sam has come to China at a time when the  situation on the Korean peninsula is extremely tense, and the  stances of the two countries on resolving the crisis on the  Korean peninsula has naturally attracted the world's attention.  Chinese leaders have clearly pointed out that the Chinese  Government sincerely hopes that the Korean peninsula can  maintain long-term peace and stability and that they support the  idea of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. China  does not favor the deployment, production, or research of any  nuclear weapons either on the northern or southern side of the  Korean peninsula. China holds that without peace and stability  on the Korean peninsula, there cannot be real peace and  stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The controversial nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula at present should be appropriately  resolved through dialogue between the DPRK, the ROK, the United  States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In  addition, this kind of dialogue requires patience.    For some time, many countries have issued appeals hoping  that  China can play a part in resolving the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula. President Kim Yong-sam has expressed the same  hope. This is understandable because China and the DPRK are  close neighbors and the two countries have maintained friendly  relations of cooperation. China has indeed made energetic  efforts to do what she can in this respect. However, China and  the DPRK are two independent sovereign countries after all.  China does not have any nuclear cooperation with the DPRK. How  to deal with and handle the nuclear issue can only be analyzed,  assessed, and decided by the DPRK herself. Therefore, China's  role is limited.  <H5>  Threats Are Futile </H5>   For the sake of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula  and to create a favorable atmosphere for dialogue and talks,  China is opposed to displays of force and the use of threats.  People are aware that the sudden emergence of a tense situation  on the Korean peninsula is entirely the result of some  countries' vain attempts to exert pressure. The United States  has announced the dispatch of "Patriot" missiles to the ROK,  Japan wanted to draw up "economic sanctions" against the DPRK,  and the ROK announced a "special state of alert" for the three  armed services of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Under  such circumstances, threatening words from both sides have also  gradually escalated. The DPRK side has said that if war breaks  out, Seoul will become "a sea of fire," and the ROK side  asserted that it would "take advantage of the opportunity of the  north's provocation to reunify the entire peninsula." This can  only aggravate confrontation between the two sides.    What is gratifying is that during recent talks with Chinese  leaders, President Kim Yong-sam said that "the ROK also hopes to  settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and talks and does not  wish to exert pressure." At the same time, according to  information from the DPRK side, "the DPRK is ready to accept a  new round of investigations by people from abroad of her nuclear  facilities." These are undoubtedly positive developments in the  state of affairs and a step in the right direction.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL TO SURVEY PARENTS ABOUT EDUCATION ISSUES  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Unified School District will poll 2,700 households in the city  within 2 weeks to find out how parents stand on topics related to the education  of their children, school officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Vergil Hettick the district's director of research and evaluation, said letters  informing residents of the survey will be mailed within a week to 3,500  randomly selected households.  </P> <P> Later, more than 100 paid, trained bilingual assistants will telephone 2,700  households and record answers to 38 questions on issues ranging from the  quality of education -- and ways to improve it -- to campus safety and  cleanliness.  </P> <P> The survey is one of six that will soon be distributed at a total cost of  $20,000. Each of the surveys asks different questions, based on the respondents  targeted -- administrators, students, teachers, parents, district staff and  members of the business community.  </P> <P> Hettick said that 80% of those polled will be Latinos because "the proportion  of the people we're polling is directly related to the percentage of that  ethnic group in the school community, he said."  </P> <P> Richard Serpe, director of the Social Science Research Center at Cal State  Fullerton, designed the questions and will analyze the answers under a  consulting contract with the school district, Hettick said.  </P> <P> Survey results will be presented to the school board at its April 11 meeting.  </P></p>

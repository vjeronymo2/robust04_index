			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN TO BE QUERIED IN MURDER KILLS SELF;  </P> <P> SHOOTING: THE LAKEWOOD RESIDENT TAKES HIS OWN LIFE WHEN POLICE SHOW UP AT HIS  HOME TO QUESTION HIM IN THE STRANGULATION OF A LAGUNA HILLS WOMAN, OFFICIALS  SAY.  </P> <P> A Lakewood man shot and killed himself early Thursday as officers appeared at  his front door to question him about a woman who was strangled and dumped in  Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old man, whose identity had not been released late Thursday pending  notification of relatives, was to be questioned because investigators had  discovered that he was either renting or in the process of renting a room in  his home to the woman, said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson.  </P> <P> Olson said sheriff's investigators were following up on their homicide  investigation and had not classified the Lakewood man as a suspect.  </P> <P> "The guys just knocked on the door and 'bang' -- that was it," Olson said.  "We're just as surprised as everyone else."  </P> <P> The body of the woman, whose identity was not revealed Thursday, was discovered  about 3 a.m Wednesday by Leisure World security officers behind the Laguna  Hills Commercial Center in the 23000 block of Ridge Route Drive. The woman,  fully clothed, apparently had been killed elsewhere and her body dumped, Olson  said.  </P> <P> An autopsy performed Wednesday determined that she had been strangled.  </P> <P> Investigators have tentatively identified the woman through her fingerprints,  but Olson added that her relatives have not yet been notified of her death.  </P> <P> Olson said two detectives assigned the murder investigation went to the 11700  block of East 215th Street in Lakewood at about 3:30 a.m. Thursday to question  a man living at a rental house there. When they knocked on the door and  received no answer, Olson said, the investigators returned to their car and  called the man on their cellular telephone. They told him they wished to speak  with him about the woman.  </P> <P> The investigators then returned to the front door and, as they were knocking,  heard a single gunshot from within, Olson said. The investigators called the  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which determined that the man died of  a gunshot wound to the head.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Birl Adams said his department was  investigating only the man's death.  </P> <P> Neighbors in Lakewood were perplexed about what had happened. Those interviewed  said they knew little about the man or anyone else who had been living at the  40-year-old stucco house he apparently rented.  </P> <P> At the scene late Thursday morning, a Los Angeles County coroner's van remained  parked in the driveway as Orange County sheriff's investigators sifted through  the property for clues. As part of their investigation, a van and a junked car  parked on the property were towed to a police impound yard.  </P></p>

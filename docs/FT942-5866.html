			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tapping into a seam of experience - The south Wales coal interests of Powell Duffryn and Wimpey It is almost impossible to consider the south Wales coal industry operating without Powell Duffryn or George Wimpey. The two companies between them have more than 150 years experience of digging, washing, grading and transporting coal from the region. It seems perfectly natural, therefore, that Powell Duffryn, now a diversified engineering and distribution company, should seek to join forces with Wimpey, a large construction, housebuilding and opencast mining group, to bid for British Coal's south Wales operations. For Powell Duffryn it would maintain a 130-year link with the region. The company, founded in 1864 by a south Wales family, claimed to be the world's largest independent coal mining company before the British coal industry was nationalised in 1947. Wimpey, which currently operates three of the region's nine opencast mines, has operated in the area for more than 40 years. The companies' experience may prove invaluable given the extreme geological complexity of the region: 'God put the coal in, then he trod on it. Seams double back on themselves making even opencast mining difficult,' said one coal board official. The joint venture will include all of the two companies' British coal operations which last year had a combined turnover of about Pounds 80m, generating pre-tax profits of about Pounds 4m. Turnover is expected to rise to more than Pounds 200m if the joint venture acquires all of British Coal's south Wales interests. The companies have not ruled out taking a stake in other regional coal companies and are also seeking to pre-qualify as a bidder in north-east England. Their greatest interest, however, is in south Wales. The companies, in addition to the nine opencast sites on offer, could also acquire one remaining deep mine, Tower colliery, placed on care and maintenance, and which is being sold separately. The three sites operated by Wimpey produced about half of the region's opencast output of more than 2m tonnes during the 12 months to the end of March, accounting for about a sixth of British coal production. Tower's production added another 900,000 tonnes. About half the region's coal production is anthracite, a natural smokeless fuel which commands a premium price and is sold mainly for burning in homes and, according to Wimpey, has a strong export potential including to Germany. Powell Duffryn operates three of the region's five coal distribution sites where it also washes and grades coal ready for sale to customers. Its British coal operations, which have shrunk in recent years, accounted for about 6 per cent of the company's Pounds 28.6m pre-tax profit in the year to March 31 1993. It sells about 500,000 tonnes of coal nationally on its own behalf as well as providing processing and distribution services to British Coal. Three years ago it sought to sell its British coal interests to concentrate on its other engineering and distribution activities, including transport and storage of bulk liquid chemicals. It subsequently withdrew the coal businesses from the market because the offers it had received were too low. Wimpey, by comparison, has remained steadfastly committed to its opencast mining operations started in Britain during the second world war as a means of increasing coal production by using machines rather than valuable manpower. It was one of the first private sector contractors to move into this market. The company regards mining as an important diversification away from its cyclical construction and housebuilding business. It remains one of the country's biggest opencast contractors, producing 2.5m tonnes of coal last year. The two companies employ about 600 people in various coal operations in south Wales, including 200 at Ffos Las, the region's biggest opencast site. South Wales sells about 1m tonnes of coal a year to Aberthaw power station. The region's opencast mines have proven reserves of 7.9m tonnes and fully and partly proven reserves at prospective opencast sites of 45m tonnes, says British Coal.

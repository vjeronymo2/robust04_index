			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NORTH TESTIFIES BEFORE NEW IRAN-CONTRA GRAND JURY  </P> <P> Oliver L. North testified Friday before a newly impaneled federal grand jury  that is continuing the investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> The former White House aide was accompanied into the grand jury room by a  prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.  </P> <P> North repeatedly left the secret proceedings during the day of testimony to  confer with his attorneys in a courthouse hallway.  </P> <P> Periodic exits from grand jury proceedings enable witnesses to receive legal  advice and to keep their lawyers informed about what the government is asking  them.  </P> <P> During one break, North lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. began shouting at  Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen.  </P> <P> "You don't intimidate me and I don't intimidate you," replied Gillen, who then  returned to the grand jury room. North followed a few minutes later.  </P> <P> Walsh's office is trying to determine the precise roles that then-President  Ronald Reagan, then-Vice President George Bush and others played in the affair,  sources familiar with the investigation said in April.  </P> <P> The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said North and former national  security adviser John M. Poindexter were likely to be subpoenaed and granted  immunity from prosecution in exchange for their grand jury testimony.  </P> <P> North, 46, was convicted May 4, 1989, of aiding and abetting an obstruction of  Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council documents and  receiving an illegal gratuity.  </P> <P> An appeal is pending.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Pacific Symphony to Name New Conductor: The Pacific Symphony is expected to  announce its new conductor and music director in a press conference this  morning. Carl St. Clair, one of two assistant conductors of the Boston  Symphony, has been a leading contender for the position, but officials would  not confirm over the weekend that he would be named. St. Clair emerged as a top  contender after leading a pair of critically and publicly well-received  subscription concerts Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. The previous front-runner, Lawrence  Foster, revealed earlier this month that the orchestra had offered him the  music director job in December but later withdrew the offer after talks broke  down. St. Clair has said he would consider moving to Orange County if offered  the job. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act. Section 1108(c) of Public Law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 99&hyph;272 provides that the determinations made in this rule are not subject to the provisions for public participation in rulemaking contained in 5 U.S.C. 553 or in any directive of the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 1, 1994, the Secretary announced the national marketing quota and price support level for the 1994 crop of burley tobacco.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing Quota  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 319(c)(3)(A)(B) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketing quota for a marketing year for burley tobacco is the quantity of such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percent of the total of: (1) The amount of burley tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase on U.S. auction markets or from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the three marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, and (3) the quantity, if any, that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve stock level. However, any downward adjustment in such loan inventories may not exceed the greater of 35 million pounds or 50 percent of the amount which the loan inventories exceed the reserve stock level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 319(c)(3)(C) further provides that, with respect to the 1990 through 1994 marketing years, any reduction in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceed 10 percent of the previous year's national marketing quota. The reserve stock level is defined in section 301(b)(14)(D) of the 1938 Act as the greater of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 million pounds or 15 percent of the national marketing quota for burley tobacco for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which the level is being determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S. cigarette production and sales shall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the 1994 crop of burley tobacco by January 15, 1994. Six such manufacturers were required to submit such a statement for the 1994 crop and the total of their intended purchases for the 1994 crop is 324.0 million pounds. The three-year average of exports is 183.8 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The national marketing quota for the 1993 crop year was 603.0 million pounds (58 FR 36857). Thus, in accordance with section 301(b)(14)(D), the reserve stock level for use in determining the 1994 marketing quota for burley tobacco is 90.5 million pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 21, 1994, USDA projected that the loan coops would have in their inventories 420.5 million pounds of burley tobacco (excluding pre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and covered by deferred sales). Accordingly, the adjustment to maintain loan stocks at the reserve supply level is a decrease of 165.0 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year is 342.8 million pounds. However, the 1994 national marketing quota cannot be less than 90 percent of 1993's quota. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the marketing year beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994, for burley tobacco is 542.7 million pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent to not more than 1 percent of the national poundage quota for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments, adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1994 crop of burley tobacco of 1,862,367 pounds is adequate for these purposes. In setting farm quotas for the 1994 burley crop, it was also determined based on past practice that a factor of 0.90 would be used to adjust preliminary farm quotas to reach the national poundage quota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

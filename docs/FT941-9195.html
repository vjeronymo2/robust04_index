			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Overseas holiday sales to increase 'up to 20%' Sales of overseas summer holidays are set to increase by between 14 per cent and 20 per cent this year, the travel agency chain Lunn Poly said yesterday. The travel industry had previously been forecasting an increase of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. Lunn Poly, which is the largest UK travel retailer, said the number of summer 1994 holidays sold through agents was likely to be between 9m and 9.5m, compared with 7.9m last year. This year's figure is expected to break the previous record of 8m, set in 1987. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly's marketing director, said about 3.5m holidays had been sold by travel agents by the end of January - 40 per cent more than by the same time last year. Mr Bowden-Doyle said Spain had captured 51 per cent of the UK summer holiday market, compared with 36 per cent last year. Greece was in second place with 14 per cent, compared with 16 per cent last year. The big loser had been the US, which had won 5 per cent of the market compared with 10 per cent last year. Lunn Poly said the fall was the result of extensive media coverage of attacks on tourists in Florida and the strength of the dollar against the pound. Bookings to Florida had fallen 20 per cent. But other US destinations, including California, were still popular. Spain's popularity and the fall in Florida bookings have changed the balance between long-haul and short-haul holidays. Only 9 per cent of summer 1994 holidays booked so far have been for long-haul destinations, compared with 13 per cent by this stage last year. The US remains the most popular long-haul destination, although its market share has fallen to 52 per cent from 73 per cent. The Caribbean now accounts for 30 per cent of long-haul holidays, compared with 15 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Rivers could run orange with pollution: A hazardous side-effect of mine closures is rising water tables GEOLOGISTS, engineers and planners met in Durham yesterday to discuss a potentially dangerous side-effect of pit closures - the threat of water rising through abandoned mines to pollute rivers, killing wildlife and contaminating drinking water. Britain's recent wave of coal-mine closures and the proposed privatisation of remaining British Coal assets is focusing attention on what is to happen to its costly pumping activities. The implications are serious for many coalfield areas of England and Wales, but have struck first in County Durham which, after centuries of intensive mining, has suddenly found itself without a single deep pit. At present, a network of 11 pumping stations pumps 25m gallons of water every day into the River Wear from below the warren of mineworkings. British Coal has until now met the costs of up to Pounds 6m a year to keep dry its remaining Durham coastal pits. But it now has no operational interest in continuing the Durham pumping, as the coalfield's only surviving pit, Wearmouth, in Tyne and Wear, does not depend on it. British Coal and the National Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog, have been in negotiation for the past year over the issue. British Coal is obliged to give the watchdog 14 days notice if it intends to cease pumping. But the watchdog is considering legal action against British Coal. It is unclear whether legal action - possibly an injunction - could succeed. Under the 1989 Water Act, permitting water to flow from abandoned mines is not an offence, although causing it to do so is. If the County Durham pumping ceased, the water table would rise into the old mineworkings, and could become contaminated with sulphuric acid, iron, manganese, aluminium and sulphates, which could then be discharged into rivers. The reality was demonstrated last year when 80m gallons of water from the abandoned Cornish tin mine Wheal Jane polluted the River Carnon. A recent study by the watchdog's consultants Wardell Armstrong concluded that discharges of polluted minewater into the River Wear, initially around Bishop Auckland, would begin three months after pumping stopped. Stretches of the Wear could be affected by ochrous depots of iron compounds. This could damage fish and river life and turn the water a vivid orange. 'Imagine an orange necklace around the peninsula of Durham Cathedral,' says deputy county council leader Mr Bob Pendlebury, who chaired yesterday's seminar. The council also fears landslides and subsidence, due to waterlogging of soils as the water table rises. The delegates at yesterday's seminar agreed that action is required: To ensure pumping continues until a solution to minewater pollution is found. To press for a national working party, including government departments, British Coal and the watchdog. To provide the resources needed to assess environmental damage and potential pollution and subsidence. To seek legislation on environmental safeguards on abandoned mine workings. North East Water, which supplies 150,000 customers from its Lumley works near the Wear in Chester-le-Street has warned that, if pumping ends, minewater pollution could force it to develop new treatment facilities on the Tyne, costing Pounds 25m. Government proposals on British Coal's pumping activities are not due until November, when the privatisation bill is made public.</p>

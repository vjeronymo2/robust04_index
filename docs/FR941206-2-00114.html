Anchor National is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of California. The Separate Account was established by Anchor National on May 24, 1994, to fund variable annuity contracts. SCS, a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, is the distributor for the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Contracts provide for accumulation of contract values and payment of annuity benefits on a fixed and variable basis. They will be initially funded through five portfolios of the Separate Account. Each portfolio invests its assets in the shares of one of five available series of Westcore Variable Trust (``Trust''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Contracts are available for retirement plans which do not qualify for the special federal tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code and for retirement plans which do qualify for the federal tax advantages available under the Internal Revenue Code. Purchase payments under the Contracts may be made to the general account of Anchor National under the Contracts' fixed account option (``Fixed Account''), the Separate Account or allocated between them. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Contract is $5,000 for non-qualified contracts ($2,000 for qualified contracts). Additional purchase payments may be made in amounts of at least $250 ($100 if made in connection with an automatic payment plan). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If the Contract owner dies during the accumulation period, a death benefit will be payable to the beneficiary upon receipt by Anchor National of due proof of death. The death benefit is reduced by premium tax incurred by Anchor National, if any. The death benefit is equal to the greatest of: (1) The total dollar amount of purchase payments made prior to the death of the Contract owners, reduced by any partial withdrawals and partial annuitizations; or (2) the contract value at the end of the valuation period during which due proof of death (and an election of the type of payment to the beneficiary) is received by Anchor National; or, where permitted by state law, (3) in the case of a Contract owner who was less then age 70 at the date of Contract issue and after the seventh Contract anniversary, the contract value at the seventh Contract anniversary, increased by any purchase payments made and reduced by any partial withdrawals and partial annuitizations since that anniversary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. An annual contract administration charge of $30 is charged against each Contract. The amount of this charge is guaranteed and cannot be increased. This charge reimburses Anchor National for expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining records relating to a Contract. The contract administration charge will be assessed on each anniversary of the Contract date that occurs on or prior to the annuity date. In the event that a total surrender of contract value is made, the charge will be assessed as of the date of surrender without proration. This charge is not assessed during the annuity period. The contract administration charge is at cost with no margin included for profit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

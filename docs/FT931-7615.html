			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (8): Green with controversy - 'Reduce, re-use, recycle' are the watchwords WORKERS AT the Ontario environment ministry in Toronto are required to sort their litter into four separate containers. Three are for recyclable materials: newspapers, other kinds of paper and aluminium soft-drink cans. Whatever is left goes into the 'normal' rubbish bin. There is a snag. In the ministry's zeal to cut down disposable waste, the bin issued to each office is only the size of an indoor flower pot. The 'three R's' - reduce, re-use, recycle - are the driving forces of Ontario's environmental policies. The province has gained a reputation as one of the world's 'greenest' jurisdictions. The environment ministry makes the educated guess that more than four in every five households in the province take part in a 'blue box' programme in which newspapers, cans, plastic and other recyclable materials are separated from other garbage. What is more, about 20 per cent of homes have composters in their backyards for organic waste. The ministry claims that the province now recycles more than half its newsprint and wood wastes, 40 per cent of corrugated cardboard and a third of container glass. The volume of garbage shipped to landfill sites is estimated to be between 20-25 per cent per person lower now than it was in 1987 (although it is not clear how much is caused by environmental awareness, how much by recession). Many programmes are voluntary and enforcement is still spotty, but the variety of carrots and sticks used to raise standards and tighten enforcement against polluters is steadily growing. Penalties for environmental crimes are being stiffened. The head of an Ontario chemicals company was sentenced to an eight-month jail term last year. A fine of CDollars 364,000 was levied on a man found guilty of illegally stockpiling scrap tyres. Any company or government agency involved in an environmental assessment must pay the costs of outside 'intervenors' who want to testify at a public hearing, including those opposing its application. Less formally, a group of private pilots volunteer, as part of their flying practice, to report obvious signs of pollution around the province - such as an unfamiliar plume of smoke or a dirty slick in a river. But being in the vanguard of environmental policy inevitably brings controversy. Toronto municipal leaders are furious at the NDP government's decision to veto the city's plans to transport its garbage by rail to a disused mine in a remote part of northern Ontario. Although the northern community enthusiastically supported the scheme, the province has decreed that municipalities must seek solutions to their garbage problems closer to home. A ban on solid-waste incineration by municipalities - the first of its kind in North America - has by no means found universal favour, either. The government has so far been more successful in forging a consensus for a pioneering Environmental Bill of Rights, which would greatly increase public participation in the review and enforcement of clean-up regulations. According to Mr Peter Victor, a senior environment ministry official, the bill is designed to increase political accountability in environmental policy, with less emphasis on action through the courts. It will allow members of the public, including businesses, to request a review of government policies and regulations through an Environmental Commissioner, accountable to the provincial legislature. The public could also ask the commissioner to order an investigation of an alleged polluter. The Bill of Rights would require the creation of a registry, probably accessible through a computer terminal, to notify the public of all significant environmental decisions, such as government permits and regulations. In addition, the bill would protect 'whistle-blowing' employees who report environmental abuses within their companies or public agencies. Three private-sector representatives have endorsed a task force report on the Bill of Rights. But the business community is withholding final judgment until it sees the details of empowering legislation, expected to be tabled this spring. Mr Joe Couto, policy adviser to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, says that the governing New Democrats have watered down some of the positions they advocated in opposition. 'They have realised that the environment doesn't only belong to the environmentalists,' Mr Couto says. A cornerstone of the effort to reduce liquid-waste pollution is the Municipal and Industrial Strategy for Abatement (MISA). The first set of guidelines, whose chief aim is to reduce the toxic content of effluents, was put in force last year for the petroleum industry. Rules are now being drawn up for another eight industries. Among other initiatives is a compulsory environmental self-audit by large companies and government agencies, including such places as hospitals and shopping malls. Regulations, which are expected to come into force within the next year or so, will require a biennial update of plans and targets to reduce pollution. A ministry official says that ways to enforce the audits have not yet been determined. But participants will be required to keep their audits continuously displayed for employees - and on file for spot checks by government officials. In general, Mr Victor says, the ministry tries 'to encourage voluntary activity.'</p>

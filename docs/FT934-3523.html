			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / CS Holding improves 65% CS Holding, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, said its business performance continued to be extremely satisfactory in the second half of the year. However, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, warned that provisions for bad debts would remain high because of the continuing business recession, especially in Switzerland. CS reported consolidated net income of SFr882m (Dollars 588m) in the first half, up 65 per cent. Net income in the full year 1992 was SFr1.03bn. Mr Gut was speaking at a special shareholders' meeting in Zurich to approve the creation of shares to finance the purchase of the shares of Leu Holding that it does not own. Last month, CS bought a 15 per cent block in Leu, Switzerland's fourth largest banking group, for SFr416m in shares and cash, raising its holding in Leu to 70 per cent. It has since offered the same terms - one CS bearer share and SFr720 in cash for every six Leu shares - to the remaining minority shareholders. Resolutions to create new shares and to split the existing bearer and registered shares 5-1 were approved. Mr Gut gave no indication of CS's plans for Leu once the takeover was completed, but said that it was having a good year. 'The turnround at Bank Leu and successful operations at Bank Hofmann and Clariden Bank allow Leu Holding to reckon with a result that will be markedly higher than in the previous year,' he said. Leu's net income was SFr104m last year. Mr Gut said CS Holding's total assets at the end of the third quarter were practically unchanged from the SFr343.3bn reported at the end of June.</p>

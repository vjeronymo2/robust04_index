			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED CROSS DELIVERS SUPPLIES TO EMBATTLED EAST BEIRUT;  </P> <P> LEBANON: OVERCROWDED AND BLOODIED HOSPITAL CORRIDORS DISPLAY SUFFERING IN  CHRISTIAN SECTOR. A RELATIVE LULL MARKS MILITIA WARFARE.  </P> <P> A Red Cross relief convoy crossed into embattled East Beirut on Wednesday,  delivering medical supplies to Christian hospitals and retrieving a handful of  wounded.  </P> <P> As the battle for supremacy between Christian forces continued in its second  week, overcrowded and bloodied hospital corridors and emergency rooms testified  to the suffering.  </P> <P> Supplies of oxygen, plasma and drugs were drained or gone, according to press  reports, and hospital authorities have announced that they will bury the dead  in mass graves. Continuing shellfire kept most civilians pinned in their  underground shelters, unable to pick up bodies of relatives for proper burial.  Hospital morgues, like the rest of the Christian sector of the Lebanese  capital, have been without power for days.  </P> <P> On the battlefronts, a relative lull marked the fighting between the troops of  Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia. On Tuesday, Aoun's men  had cut through to the Mediterranean coast at the town of Dbaiye, separating  the militia's headquarters in the port-side Karantina district and its  strongholds in urban East Beirut from militia forces farther north at the  harbor towns of Juniyah and Jubayl.  </P> <P> Press estimates place the number of wounded in a week of fighting at more than  1,700, with at least 350 killed, a staggering toll that reflects the ferocity  of the shelling and street battles. Reporters who made their way into Dbaiye on  Wednesday morning said the town was devastated by the three-day battle there.  No building appeared untouched, and scores of burned-out tanks and military  vehicles filled the streets, they reported.  </P> <P> With his outnumbered militia hard-pressed by the loss of Dbaiye, Lebanese  Forces commander Samir Geagea called late Tuesday on French President Francois  Mitterrand "to act swiftly to arrange an immediate halt to the hysteric  killing." France once administered Lebanon and is a strong supporter of the  country's now-divided Christian community.  </P> <P> The Red Cross column of 10 ambulances was escorted across the so-called Green  Line separating the Muslim western sector of the capital from the Christian  east by French Embassy cars, an operation supervised by French envoy Bernard  Kouchner.  </P> <P> Kouchner organized a similar relief mission last spring when all of Beirut was  paralyzed by an artillery war between Aoun's forces and Syrian gunners in the  west.  </P> <P> After delivering the medical supplies, the ambulances returned to West Beirut  with 15 critically wounded patients, according to the press reports. They were  placed aboard a French hospital plane at the Beirut airport for evacuation from  the besieged capital.  </P> <P> With the collapse of eight cease-fires in the past week, the Lebanese Red Cross  has managed only four missions into the eastern sector. At times, some of the  eight Red Cross centers in East Beirut have gone unstaffed because of the  fighting. One Red Cross team of 25 volunteers was trapped in its center for  several days with 70 wounded civilians -- and no way to evacuate or feed them.  </P> <P> The Lebanese civil war has exacted a steep price from the Red Cross. Since the  conflict began in 1975, 11 volunteers have been killed and 30 wounded.  </P> <P> On Monday, when efforts failed to secure a truce so the Red Cross could pass,  volunteers Marwan Tayyara and Ghaleb Sleem packed medical supplies in their  small car and took their chances.  </P> <P> Relying on the good relations the Lebanese Red Cross has with all combatant  forces in the country, the volunteers were able to reach two hospitals. Then  Tayyara and Sleem made a second mission carrying bread, cheese, olives and  water for Red Cross volunteers besieged in one center. Asked why he and Sleem  had taken such a chance, Tayyara answered that his colleagues "couldn't  continue any longer. And they would do the same for us."  </P> <P> The International Red Cross has 1,400 volunteers in its Lebanese contingent,  many of them students. The current stage of the Lebanese conflict began last  week when Aoun, who had been sacked as commander of the Lebanese army by  President Elias Hrawi, demanded that the militia disarm or accede to his  control. Geagea recognizes the Hrawi presidency, while Aoun has repudiated it  as a Syrian puppet regime.  </P> <P> Early this week, several Arab newspapers suggested that the militia invited the  break with the support of United States and Syria, both of which had demanded  that Aoun step down in favor of a national reconciliation government headed by  Hrawi. A report by the Paris correspondent of the Kuwaiti daily Al Qabas said  Geagea had met with unidentified American officials in East Beirut and held  secret contacts with Syrian authorities.  </P> <P> The aim, according to the Al Qabas report and others in the Saudi daily Ash  Sharq al Awsat and the London-based Lebanese newspaper El Hayat, was to topple  Aoun and bring his loyal troops under the authority of Hrawi.  </P> <P> There was no public confirmation of the accounts, which would put Syria and  Washington in league with a militia whose reputation has been sullied in the  past with charges of corruption.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the fighting continued Wednesday with the failure of yet another  truce.  </P> <P> "There's only one cease-fire that lasts in Lebanon," a local Red Cross official  said, "and that's the one declared for Mrs. Alexandra Issa Khoury, our  president."  </P> <P> The 80-year-old Red Cross administrator, a Maronite Catholic, lives in East  Beirut. On weekday mornings at 6 a.m., she is picked up by her driver, Ali  Haidar, a Shiite Muslim who lives in the southern suburbs of West Beirut. They  drive across the Green Line to Red Cross headquarters, located in the western  sector.  </P> <P> Her 20-year-old Buick bears Red Cross markings and a license plate that reads  "Number 1."  </P> <P> "When they see Number 1 coming, they hold their fire," said the official.  </P> <P> Raschka reported from Beirut and Times staff writer Williams from Nicosia,  Cyprus.  </P></p>

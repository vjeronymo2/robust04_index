			<p>BFN     [Text] LONDON -- Several Kashmiri groups here have taken up  cudgels against Pakistan following Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto's reported statement that Islamabad will oppose any  independence for Kashmir.    "The struggle against India could become a struggle now  against Pakistan," said Mr Arzal Tahir, President of the Jammu  and Kashmir People's National Party.    There are signs of that already. Four members of Pakistan's  National Assembly were hooted down at meetings in Birmingham and  Bradford. The Pakistani embassy had to mobilize strong support  to prevent this from recurring in Luton, north of London. Luton  has a large population from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir [POK].    At a recent meeting at the School of Oriental and African  Studies, where the Indian case was argued by former Foreign  Secretary J N Dixit, several Pakistani speakers were strongly  challenged as the Pakistanis presented their arguments about UN  resolutions and human rights.    Among those who challenged the Pakistanis was Mr Anwar Khan,  who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Peace Committee. "There are so  many flaws in their arguments, but people have been too scared  before to challenge them publicly," Mr Khan said.    He has been challenglng Pakistan's claims to Kashmir openly  at meetings now. The mood is beginning to change, he said,  adding: "There is a realistic element coming in now, a  realisation that Kashmir will never go to Pakistan."    The Pakistani strategy, he said, had been at first to  encourage groups that sought independence. "Once the whole thing  seemed to be gathering momentum, they put forward Tehriq  E-Kashmir which wants Kashmir for Pakistan," he said. "Now many  in the pro-independence groups are feeling betrayed."    Most pro-Pakistan groups in Britain have membership from the  Mirpur and Kotli districts of POK. They have Pakistani  passports, which give the Pakistani High Commission a hold over  them.    "But even among them they are beginning to realize that  Pakistan has its own agenda, and that they are being used," Mr  Khan said. "This will not be a question of India or Pakistan but  of democratic rule versus theocratic rule."    A visible change is that groups opposed to Pakistan's claims  have begun to come into the open. Dr S Durrani set up the  Indo-European Kashmir forum two years ago primarily to speak for  the plight of Kashmiri pandits [Bhramins]. Its members have now  begun to campaign aggressively against Pakistan.    "People were a little afraid at first because of the murder  of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre," Dr Durrani said. "But we  have now put that behind us." Mr Khan's group and Afzal Tahir's  group have also begun to speak critically of Pakistan's claims  at public meetings.    Mr Ifthikar Malik and Mr Mohammed Arif, two well known  academics who oppose human rights violations in Kashmir, also  oppose Pakistan's claims. The Pakistani lobby has also  indirectly lost the support of British MPs.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Eurotunnel seeks Pounds 1bn and sees squeeze on revenues EUROTUNNEL said yesterday it was on target to begin phased commercial operations of the Channel tunnel next March, but confirmed it would need to raise at least another Pounds 1bn by mid-May 1994, from its banks and shareholders. The group has also been forced to reduce its initial revenue estimates because of service start-up delays and fierce price competition and surplus capacity on the Dover-Calais ferry routes. Eurotunnel's prices are due to be announced in January. Shareholders will be asked to support a rights issue for at least half the additional funds, probably early next year after negotiations with Eurotunnel's 220 banks are completed. Eurotunnel's share price fell by 6p to close at 488p. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, said the new funding was mainly required to pay interest costs on the group's existing Pounds 7.28bn of debt. Although he said projected revenues are expected to cover operating costs by next August, it will be 1998 before the tunnel breaks even on a cash basis. By that stage Eurotunnel estimates the total cash requirement for the project will have reached Pounds 10bn - Pounds 965m more than existing resources including the anticipated exercise in 1995 of warrants which will generate Pounds 220m. Eurotunnel acknowledged the shortfall could be even higher 'depending on a number of continuing uncertainties', including claims by contractors and talks with the banks which have been insisting on additional contingent requirements of almost Pounds 400m. Sir Alastair said he was confident this would be reduced. Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial officer, said Eurotunnel's total cash requirement, from establishment in 1986 to the start of commercial services in March, will be Pounds 8.75bn compared with Pounds 8.4bn estimated in June. He said the bulk of the increase reflected the signing of the 'Protocol' agreement in late July with Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French contractors building the tunnel. Under the agreement, Eurotunnel agreed to advance the contractors Pounds 235m pending settlement of the claims. Sir Alastair said that following that agreement there had been a 'significant improvement' in the relationship between Eurotunnel and TML and that work was on schedule for the start of heavy goods vehicle freight shuttle services on March 7. These will be followed by rail freight and tourist shuttle services ahead of the state opening on May 6, and the start of Eurostar train services between London and Paris at the end of June. Because of the advanced payments to TML, partly offset by a new Pounds 120m standby bank loan agreement, Eurotunnel's projection of when it would exhaust its existing resources has been brought forward to mid-May. The additional funding requirement also reflects the reduction in projected revenues in the tunnel's early years - due in part to initial capacity constraints, the late introduction of some services and lower anticipated fare yields pending 'the inevitable rationalisation of ferry capacity'. Eurotunnel is now projecting total revenues in 1994 of Pounds 224.1m, some Pounds 44.5m lower than indicated in April. Revenue forecasts for 1995 and 1996 have been reduced by Pounds 32m and Pounds 18m respectively to Pounds 554m and Pounds 690.7m. Editorial Comment, Page 17 Lex, Page 18</p>

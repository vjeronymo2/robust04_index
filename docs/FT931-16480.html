			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trapped in narrow range before jobs data Wall Street US SHARE prices remained trapped in a narrow range yesterday as investors cautiously awaited Friday's key December jobs report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 1.35 at 3,307.87. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.04 easier at 434.34. The Nasdaq composite, however, rebounded from recent losses to add 2.54 at 674.34. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 241m shares, while overall rises held a modest advantage over declines by 1,071 to 799. For the second day, the market traded without a clear direction as investors struggled to find an incentive to buy stocks. Although underlying sentiment remained positive - economic growth and corporate earnings are both forecast to improve this year - market participants were nervous that expectations of a new year rally had become overblown, and that disappointment about the failure of the market to post a strong advance could trigger a sell-off in coming days. The absence of fresh economic data was also a factor, as was investors' wariness about committing large sums of money ahead of Friday's important employment report for December. Analysts are expecting the report to show a rise of about 80,000 in non-farm payrolls, and for the national unemployment rate to have held at 7.2 per cent. Philip Morris dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 73 1/2 in volume of 5.1m shares and American Brands lost Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39 following reports that Governor Mario Cuomo of New York was considering doubling the state tax on cigarettes. IBM once again came under selling pressure, weakening Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 7/8 in volume of 3.5m shares, as the share price continued to reflect concern that the dividend payment may be under threat because of the computer group's financial difficulties. The ADRs in News Corporation fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 37 7/8 in busy trading on news that Mr Jamie Kellner, the president of the company's Fox Broadcasting unit, had resigned. Mr Kellner is the fourth member of Fox's senior management to leave the company in recent months. Chubb retreated Dollars 2 to Dollars 86 after Mr Ronald Frank, an analyst at broking house Smith Barney, downgraded the stock and issued a general warning about property and casualty shares, which he believed have probably peaked in the short term. Other stocks affected were AIG, down Dollars 3 3/8 at Dollars 112 3/4 , General Re, Dollars 2 7/8 lower at Dollars 112 7/8 , and Continental Corp, off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 26 1/2 . On the Nasdaq market, Monday's declining technology stocks rallied strongly. Intel appreciated Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 91, Oracle Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 3/8 and Sun Microsystems Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 36 3/8 . Canada THE TORONTO market finished modestly firmer, bolstered by a rally in Canada's heavily weighted gold shares after bullion prices staged a recovery from Monday's slide to a seven-year low. The TSE 300 index improved 2.4 points to 3,353.4 as the gold shares index picked up 8.8 to 5,162. Advances led falls by 294 to 288 after heavy volume of 41m shares, up from Monday's 30.9m. Turnover value rose to CDollars 342.6m from CDollars 233.2m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, January 26 (XINHUA) -- China has increased  state investment in the five northwestern provinces and  autonomous regions mainly inhabited by minority nationalities in  order to step up development of rich local natural resources and  promote economic prosperity.    Remarkable increases have been seen in both the amount and  the number of projects involving state investment in the  northwestern provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi and the  Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions.    So far, half of the fund for economic development of these  regions has come from state investment, which focuses on the  exploration and exploitation of coal and oil resources,  establishment of large state-owned enterprises and  infrastructure construction.    The five interior provinces and autonomous regions in  northwest China occupy one-third of the country's total  landspace. Among the 160 kinds of minerals found in China, 120  have been sited there.    Two out of the three newly-discovered large-scale natural  gas  fields are located in northwest China with the one in the basin  on the borders of Gansu, Shaanxi and Ningxia the country's  largest gas field ever found.    The plentiful natural gas of Shaanxi, the oil reserves of  Xinjiang, coal resources in Ningxia and the rich water power  resources of the Yellow River that winds through the region are  all of vital significance to the country's economic development.    Despite the area's rich natural resources, northwest China's  economic development has long lagged behind that of other parts  of the country for geographical and historical reasons.    Promotion of the local economy and exploitation of natural  resources has become an urgent need for the country. In China's  eighth five-year-plan, priority has been given to the  development of the transportation and electrical power  industries and the tapping of resources in northwest China.    Increased state investment has been rewarded with extensive  growth seen in electricity supplies, transporting capacity and  output of petroleum in the northwest region, which is expected  to become the country's number one energy supplier in the near  future.</p>

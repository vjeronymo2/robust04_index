			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, and Vitaliy Trubetskoy]    [Text] Meditkan Sherinkulov, head of the CIS Karabakh peace  group and chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Soviet who had met with  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev Wednesday, told Interfax  that the next meeting of parliamentarians representing the  warring parties would be held in Bishkek.    He also said that he would go on a tour of Baku, Yerevan and  Stepanakert Thursday to secure an agreement on the date to hold  the meeting.    Sherinkulov expressed the hope that a candid exchange of  views would take place in Bishkek. "People are tired of death,  of continuous flows of refugees and parliamentarians look for  points of contact," he said.    The Russian Foreign Ministry supports the desire of the CIS  inter-parliamentary group to contribute to peace in Karabakh.  Galina Sidorova, a political adviser of Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who had met with head of the CIS Karabakh peace group  and chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Soviet, told Interfax that  the ministry maintained close contacts with the group and was  willing to help it with expert advice. "We do our best as an  executive body. But parliaments are in a position to play quite  a different role in resolving the conflict by creating an  appropriate environment for acceptance of what the executive  branch has prepared," she said.</p>

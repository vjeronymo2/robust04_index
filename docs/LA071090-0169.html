			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY: CONFERENCE SHUFFLE MAY RESHAPE COLLEGE FOOTBALL, TV PAYOUTS  </P> <P> To the rules that govern the motions of terrestrial bodies must be added a new  concept: conferential drift, the tendency of a large college sports league to  try to engulf smaller ones when motivated by the pursuit of revenue. And when  the NCAA's major football conferences begin acting in earnest upon what has  been stirring for months, they promise to gobble up everything in their paths  with a race toward Manifest Destiny that could reshape the face of  intercollegiate athletics.  </P> <P> This summer may see the groundwork laid for rampant additions, defections and  mergers that could test the structural boundaries of Division I-A, as the  nation's elite schools and conferences scurry to establish regional  strangleholds in anticipation of megabucks television contracts. The eventual  result could be the disintegration of several existing conferences, the  affiliation of most independents and, by the mid-1990s, the emergence of three  or four "superconferences" with two divisions and 12 to 16 schools apiece -- a  transformation many see as the first step toward creating a college football  playoff system.  </P> <P> "Where it all leads, I don't think anyone is sure right now," said Navy  Athletic Director Jack Lengyel, who just completed his term as president of the  National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. "But it does seem clear to  me that there will be some sort of realignment in the very near future. . . .  The kind of money you're talking about makes that inevitable."  </P> <P> The possibilities are intriguing. What finally could emerge are an Atlantic  Coast Conference stretching from the Northeast to Florida; a Big Ten, which  recently added Penn State, that might have further holdings in the Northeast or  from the current Big Eight (Nebraska, most prominently); a Southeastern  Conference sprawling westward into Texas and including South Carolina and one  or two more Florida teams among its Atlantic entries, and a revised Pacific-10  picking up what it can in the West (Colorado, Brigham Young and Air Force,  among others).  </P> <P> Oklahoma has entertained notions about jumping from the Big Eight to the  Southwest Conference -- a move that could become moot if, as some close to this  process insist, the Big Eight and SWC eventually are left with no choice but to  combine. An on-again, off-again Eastern Seaboard Conference for football  composed of independents and Big East schools needing a football-only league  may yet arise.  </P> <P> By the middle of the decade, most observers agree, there will be considerable  movement involving college football's six major conferences and the 20 or so  significant independents. Of those presently unaffiliated, only Notre Dame --  essentially a conference unto itself, owing to its personal network TV contract  -- appears likely to remain that way.  </P> <P> The process began in December with Penn State's move to the Big Ten and was  accelerated in February when Notre Dame bucked the College Football Assn.'s  freshly negotiated TV deals with ABC and ESPN to sign instead with NBC.  </P> <P> Notre Dame's individual network deal stems from a 1983 Supreme Court decision  that opened the marketplace, finding the NCAA's monopoly on football television  rights to be a violation of federal antitrust laws. The CFA has since been the  negotiator for the members of every major conference except the Big Ten and  Pac-10, plus 20 independents, with participation voluntary -- a stipulation  that allowed for Notre Dame's pullout.  </P> <P> (Another catalyst to the realignment fever is the Federal Trade Commission's  investigation of the CFA package, which covers 63 teams. The FTC could find the  CFA's deal to be an illegal monopoly, which would enable individual conferences  to negotiate their own TV contracts earlier than anticipated. CFA officials,  however, seem confident Notre Dame's defection helps ensure the arrangement  will not be found to violate antitrust laws.)  </P> <P> In the aftermath, the nation's other powerful football leagues were left  wondering whether they might be better served by negotiating their own network  contracts next time around.  </P> <P> Dick Schultz, executive director of the NCAA, has said he envisions a future of  superconferences; his predecessor, Walter Byers, once predicted the same. "What  you have now is more talk than movement," Schultz said at a recent meeting of  the Knight Commission. But "I think it's probable you'll see the talk translate  into movement."  </P> <P> The floodgates haven't opened yet, but they may soon -- especially with  Arkansas having agreed to begin formal discussions with the SEC about joining  its existing 10 teams. If the Razorbacks -- with the prospect of doubling their  intake from conference revenue-sharing -- end their 76-year membership in the  SWC, the SEC (like the Big Ten) would be one school short of the magic number:  NCAA rules allow a league with 12 teams or more to match division winners in a  one-game playoff to determine a champion.  </P> <P> Such a setup, most officials in major conferences believe, would produce a TV  revenue bonanza. "It's hard even to venture a guess at the dollars that might  be involved in that," said Virginia Athletic Director Jim Copeland. "The  numbers are so big already."  </P> <P> Indeed, the CFA's contracts with ABC and ESPN will bring a combined $300  million over five years, beginning in 1991. The Big Ten and Pac-10 have their  own deals with ABC, while Notre Dame's agreement with NBC reportedly is valued  at $30 million over five years. Yet those figures don't even match the NCAA's  network TV intake before the 1983 ruling; realignment can be viewed most  basically as a struggle to create more lucrative packages for TV.  </P> <P> "I'm told the '90s will be a move toward three or four superconferences,"  Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles said. "Well, there are three or four  networks to broadcast college football, if you count ESPN. It's reasonable to  assume, I guess, that each conference could have its own network tie-in."  </P> <P> But that's not all. A break into two six- or eight-team divisions would allow a  conference to have a network deal, plus perhaps two syndicated television  arrangements, a conference championship game and the foundation for a national  playoff that would have the networks salivating.  </P> <P> "Most conferences would increase their TV revenue by up to 50%," an SEC  official said. "Some might come close to doubling it. . . . And, in most cases,  you're only talking about adding two to four teams."  </P> <P> Said CFA Executive Director Chuck Neinas: "Change is inevitable, and the time  for it has come. It will come, and it will come soon. The only question is in  what form."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THE SULTAN OF SWATTERS STRIKES OUT  </P> <P> "I hear a bee," my wife said the other day when we were both in the kitchen.  </P> <P> I heard it too. She handed me the fly swatter. I am deadly with a fly swatter.  The stroke is swift and true. It is one of the few athletic skills I have left.  </P> <P> "There it is," she said, "in the window."  </P> <P> It was against the window pane above the sink. I raised the swatter to deliver  a fatal swat. Then I realized that the bee was trapped in an invisible web. Its  wings were moving but it obviously couldn't fly. Now and then it would throw  its whole body into a frenzied effort to escape. It was like a seizure. Then,  evidently exhausted, it would simply hang there, as if appraising its  situation.  </P> <P> Then I saw the spider. It was suspended, also in an invisible web, about three  inches above the trapped bee. I lowered the swatter. "Might as well let nature  take its course," my wife said, reading my mind.  </P> <P> I was tempted to interfere, but I wasn't sure I could. If I killed the spider,  the bee would still be entangled. If I tried to free the bee, it would probably  sting me. Besides, I probably couldn't free it from the web without breaking  its wings.  </P> <P> Anyway, I thought, what right did I have to interfere in this dance of death?  It happened every second of every day. The hunter and the prey. I remembered  Tennyson's line:  </P> <P>  Nature, red in tooth and claw  </P> <P>  It was God's doing. From the protozoa on up, one species preyed upon another.  Who was I to intrude?  </P> <P> Of course we killed foxes and weasels to protect our chickens, but that was  different. In that case the predators had intruded on our establishment,  threatening our own prey. That man would protect his chickens was a part of the  divine equation.  </P> <P> One does not like to kill bees. They make honey. They are industrious. They  have qualities that we admire. On the other hand, spiders are sinister. They  are venomous, although only a very few are dangerous to man. But they are cruel  and relentless hunters. We are even told that in some species the females eat  their mates after copulation. That habit has been translated into a human  metaphor as the "spider woman."  </P> <P> I used to kill spiders on sight. But somewhere along the line I learned that  they were beneficial. A spider in the house kept even more unlovely creatures  from proliferating. Some house spiders are even thought of as good omens, like  lizards in Hawaii.  </P> <P> Years ago I killed a tarantula that was crawling up our screen door; but I  regretted it. I could have spared it. Since then I have never killed a spider,  except black widows when they turned up in the garage. I regard black widows as  one of God's mistakes. I have even rescued spiders from my bathtub and  transferred them outdoors, where they undoubtedly fell prey to one of their  other enemies.  </P> <P> We watched. The spider began making swift runs down its web to the bee. It  touched the bee with its legs. The bee reacted violently, turning itself upside  down in the web in its terror. The spider quickly withdrew. From a distance of  two inches it kept an eye on its prey. Then, every minute or so, it would go  down to the bee like a trapeze artist going down a ladder. Each time it would  reach out toward the bee and the bee would go into one of its terrible  exertions. And again the spider would withdraw. Once or twice, it seemed to me,  the spider got close enough to bite the bee with its fearful pincers. Every  spider, I have read, is equipped with fangs that secrete poison.  </P> <P> The spider was exquisitely careful, but unrelenting. Again and again it touched  the bee with its kiss of death. Finally I tired of the prolonged ritual and  went into the living room to finish my coffee.  </P> <P> Maybe 15 minutes later I went back to the window. The spider had drawn the bee  to the upper corner of the window, and now had it in its fatal embrace. The bee  was still, its struggle ended. It was merely a carcass. The spider, as we knew  it would, had won.  </P> <P>  Que sera, sera.  </P></p>

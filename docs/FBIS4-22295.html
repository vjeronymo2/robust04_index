			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V.G. Konyukhov, first deputy chairman of the </F> Uzbekistan State Committee for Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources, by N. Shulepina, under the "Man and  Biosphere" rubric; place and date not given: "`The Aral  Program'--For Five States"]    [Text] At the Nukus meeting, the heads of five states  approved a program of concrete actions aimed at the improvement  of the ecological situation over the next three to five years in  the Aral Sea basin. What are Uzbek ecologists to do within the  framework of the program? Our interlocutor is V.G. Konyukhov,  first deputy chairman of the Uzbekistan State Committee for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources.    [Shulepina] Vladimir Grigoryevich, what is the program?    [Konyukhov] The program considers the experience of  ecologists and water management specialists of Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Concrete  tasks are laid out, concisely and in depth, in 10 blocks. We  have already worked on many of them, and now we will concentrate  our efforts.    [Shulepina] What is the most important task?    [Konyukhov] To work out a general strategy of water  apportionment. There ought to be enough water for everyone. The  Amudarya and Syrdarya interrepublican basin water management  associations have been created and have given good account of  themselves, but a general legal base is necessary, and it is  planned to introduce a single system of calculating water  resources and their use. We will know how many water resources  we have, and we will be able to establish practicable usage  norms in the production of agricultural and industrial output.    The same goal may be served by a regional system of  ecological monitoring. Hitherto, we have not had complete  information on the condition of the natural environment. In  Uzbekistan, the committees of the State Committee for  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Tashkent, the  oblasts, and Karakalpakstan have been connected in a single  electronic network. A project for the creation of a system of  ecological monitoring in Fergana is ready. Such a system is  being prepared for the industrial cities of Tashkent Oblast.    The creation of monitoring in accordance with the program in  Uzbekistan and in other republics is being accelerated. Basin  water management associations and the observation points of  hydrometeorological services will be supplied with technical  equipment.    [Shulepina] Monitoring is necessary, but it is already well  known that the quality of the water is falling. How is this  process to be stopped?    [Konyukhov] That is one of the directions in which the five  states have worked together on the contiguous territories. Thus,  a year ago, Uzbekistan Hydrometeorology and Environmental  Control Service posts noted significant discharges of harmful  substances from the Osh cotton combine. We offered our neighbors  effective technology from the Tashkent institute Vodgeo, which  had been tested at the Namangansk silk combine. It will allow  the volume of water used in Osh to be reduced by 70 percent, and  losses of dye substances to be decreased. Such technologies are  taking root at light industry enterprises of Andizhan and  Bukhara Oblasts.    In the program it is planned to take effective measures on  the reduction, and in the future the complete cessation, of  discharges of unpurified industrial and municipal drainage. For  this, not a little has been done in Uzbekistan within the  framework of the program of water conservation in industry. The  Tashkent paper plant and the Yangiyul biological industrial  complex have reduced their discharges, and the Novokokand  chemical plant has been reprofiled. There were many complaints  against the Tashkent Aviation Production Association imeni  Chkalov--here preoperational testing of new and powerful  cleansing installations has begun. The same are being proclaimed  at Elektrokhimprom, in Chirchik.... We will continue our efforts  toward reducing industry's negative influences.    [Shulepina] A large problem is stopping runoffs into rivers  and collector and drainage canals. "Relatively clean"--this is  how their quality is described. Meanwhile, they contain  pesticides, mineral salts, and drainage from livestock-raising  complexes, which end up in Aral. What is to be done?    [Konyukhov] In 1997 the construction of collector channels  along the Amudarya and the Syrdarya will be completed. We will  divert dirty discharges from the rivers. But a complete solution  to the problem lies in treatment of the drainage water.  Effective methods have been worked out at the ecology of water  management center of the State Committee for Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources. These methods are already  being applied in the Aral region. In the region of Muynak Bay  and the lakes Dzhiltyrbas, Sudochye, and Togiz-Tore, shallow  reservoirs have been created, which have turned into rushy  jungles. There are enough of them to feed a herd of 50,000 head.  And the root system of the rushes, and the midges and plankton  that arise in the process of biocenosis, clean the water. It can  go both for the renovation of pastures in Kyzylkum and for  intensive fish-farming. The program envisions in the Aral region  the conduct of plant reclamation projects and the creation of  artificially irrigated landscape systems. But the same  technology could also be applied at rivers' headwaters.    [Shulepina] In many rayons, a shortage of good-quality  drinking water is being felt....    [Konyukhov] The provision to the population of the Central  Asian states of high-quality drinking water is one of the main  tasks. Pollution of underground lentils--a most important source  of drinking water--and of subsoil waters has taken on massive  scope. All sources of pollution must be brought to light and  eliminated.    In Uzbekistan, valuable experience in the conduct of such  work has been accumulated. An impetus to this was the pollution  of underground water near the Chkalovskaya metro station in  Tashkent three or four years ago. The method used by the  geo-ecologists from the Kyzyltepageologiya association ranks as  a discovery. Directly from a car, with special equipment, they  were able to see what was under the earth and discern the source  of the pollution. They conducted analyses at the Fergana furan  compound plant and the Kokand asphalt and cement plant, and  compiled an atlas of pollution in Chimkent [Shimkent] and  Tashkent Oblasts. Now analyses are being conducted of the  underground waters in the large area of the Aral region and in  the lands of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and our republic, and  also in Tashlak and Tashkent.    [Shulepina] How do pesticides influence the quality of  underground water?    [Konyukhov] The greatest danger is dozens of tonnes of  pesticides, whose use is forbidden and which are located in  Uzselkhozkhimiya [Uzbekistan Agricultural Chemical Association]  warehouses in various rayons in the republic. We evaluate them  as ecological bombs. The barrels are rusting; leakages will  begin, and then everything will go into the soil. At the  Atmosphere Institute, technology for the destruction of  pesticides has been worked out. This method takes place at high  temperatures and is harmless. The end product is a clean powder.  We offered the pesticide-processing technology to the Ministry  of Agriculture. This technology has regional significance.    [Shulepina] The solution of any problem can be slowed down  by  a lack of funds. What mechanism is envisioned for the  realization of the program of concrete measures for the Aral Sea  basin?    [Konyukhov] An international fund to save Aral has been  created. Funds will be transferred into it, as was decided at  the meeting in Nukus, after the currency quotation coordination  by the governments of the states in the near future. In  addition, we are also counting on assistance from the world  community. As is known, the Aral problem is acknowledged as one  of the most important. Experts of the World Bank have already  been working in the region; an impediment to the rendering of  assistance was a lack of unity in the understanding of help for  Aral's problems among the states of the region. Literally in the  very first days after the Nukus meeting, calls from  international organizations and banks began, informing us of  their readiness to begin real cooperation.    And concrete leadership and supervision over the carrying  out  of the program will be implemented by the interstate council on  the problems of the Aral Sea basin, the position on which was  also adopted at the Nukus meeting, and its executive committee,  for whose headquarters Tashkent was chosen.    [Shulepina] Vladimir Grigoryevich, a minimum program has  been  adopted. Who determines, and when, what is to be done further?    [Konyukhov] Ecologists and water management specialists of  the five states are proceeding with the elaboration of a  medium-term program, which is calculated for five to 10 years,  and a long-term program, which will cover 10 years and more. At  the same time, we will be working on a conception of improvement  of the social and ecological situation in the Aral Sea basin; as  yet, only its basic provisions have been coordinated.    All water-management and ecological projects will pass  through the most rigorous expert examination. After completion  of preparatory work, the region's heads of state will determine,  as was envisioned in Nukus, a long-term unified ecological  policy.</p>

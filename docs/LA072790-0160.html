			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AFTER SIX YEARS, LET THERE BE LIGHT  </P> <P> Six years after it conked out and 11 years after it was moved, the Big A is  scheduled to light up again.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium will spend $642,000 from stadium operating funds to renovate  the Big A and hopes to have it ready by Dec. 15.  </P> <P> The scoreboard never had any serious problems until it was moved from behind  the left-center field fence to the edge of the 57 Freeway in 1979.  </P> <P> "All the electrical parts were continually failing and we had to keep buying  replacement parts until they didn't make parts any more," said Greg Smith,  Anaheim Stadium's general manager. "Then we started cannibalizing -- taking  parts from one line of the board to fix the other parts."  </P> <P> But that didn't last, either, and the Big A was completely shut down in 1984.  "That one was actually a scoreboard," Smith said. "This one will be more  versatile. It will have a full matrix board, like the one inside the stadium."  </P> <P> Aside from the scoreboard, the structure will be checked by engineers and  reinforced if needed and new lighting will be installed so the A and the halo  can be lit at night.

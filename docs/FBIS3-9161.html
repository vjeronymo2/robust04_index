			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Drgoljub Stankic from Knin] </F>   [Text] The assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina is  continuing its work. The deputies are trying to adopt a platform  of work of the Krajina delegation at the negotiations in Zagreb  tomorrow. Dragoljub Stankic reports from Knin:    [Stankic] The assembly commissions met in the morning. This  was followed by a discussion in the assembly on amendments to  several bills. The speeches heard today were much calmer and  more composed than the ones heard yesterday, before the  resignation of Bjegovic's cabinet. Passions have calmed and  everyone is now turning toward the most important issue -- the  negotiations with the Croatian delegation that will be held in  the Russian Embassy in Zagreb tomorrow. This was also the  reason for the session of the foreign affairs commission.    It is worth mentioning that the views of the commission, the  parliament, and the government concerning the negotiations in  Zagreb are identical. The parliament last night confirmed the  composition of the Krajina delegation at the talks. Its members  are: Admiral Dusan Rakic, defense minister and head of the  commission; General Mile Novakovic, state security adviser of  the president of the republic; and Foreign Minister Slobodan  Jarcevic. The first comments here are that the negotiations  with the Croatian side have been going on for a long time,  ranging from New York, Geneva, Oslo, to Dobanovci, and that  nothing will be changed in the (?continuation).    Here in Knin they are particularly stressing the importance  of the report by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali who,  requesting the extension of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  mandate, is mentioning Croatia and Krajina as two entities.    Therefore, in the negotiations, the Krajina delegation will  insist on the withdrawal of the Croatian Army from the occupied  territories in Krajina, as well as demand the extension of  UNPROFOR's mandate for 12 months, which is identical to the  stand of the UN secretary general.</p>

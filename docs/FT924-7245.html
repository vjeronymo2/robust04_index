			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (11): Cleaner, sweeter, hotter - Andrew Baxter explains why gas fired turbines are hurting coal THE arguments rage about the future of the UK coal industry, the privatised electricity generators and the new independent producers continue investing heavily in combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power stations. Whatever the merits of this strategy for UK energy policy, and however much critics complain that the UK is building far too much generating capacity for its needs, it is clear that CCGT using natural gas has established itself virtually worldwide as the most energy-efficient method of thermal power generation in bulk. Energy efficiency has become one of the major reasons for the success of CCGT, although not the only one. Compared with traditional large coal-fired plants, shorter construction times, reduced emissions and lower capital costs - because the plants are usually slightly smaller - are also important reasons for their success. For the uninitiated, combined-cycle plants take the exhaust gases from a gas turbines through a waste heat recovery boiler to generate steam, which in turn powers a steam turbine. This means that thermal efficiency - the amount of energy from the fuel that can be converted into electricity - can be as high as 55 per cent for CCGT, depending on the design of the plant and its use. That compares with 40 per cent for the best coal-fired generation, and about 35 and 43 per cent for simple-cycle gas turbine and steam turbine power plants respectively. As for nuclear power, high thermal efficiencies are less of a priority than controlling capital costs, and the relatively low temperature of steam produced by pressurised water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs) limits the thermal efficiency to little more than 30 per cent, according to Steve Thomas and Francis McGowan of Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit*. Raising energy efficiency is partly a financial priority - it clearly makes sense for electricity generators to get the most from their fuel resources. Mr Mike Sharpe, director of power generation at Siemens UK, says that every one percentage point of thermal efficiency gained is worth about Pounds 3m a year in additional revenue for the operator of a typical 1,000MW combined cycle plant. Clearly, however, the environmental aspect of efficient fuel use is important. Not only is the CCGT process inherently less pollutive, it is also a more efficient use of fossil fuels which have taken millions of years to create and can only be used once. In January, Siemens claimed a new world record for commercial thermal power plant efficiency with a rating of 52.5 per cent at the 1,350MW Ambarli project near Istanbul. The result was obtained in acceptance trials on the first of three 450MW 'gas and steam blocks,' and the peak load figure was higher still at 53.2 per cent. With the new General Electric Frame 9F gas turbines and the latest series from Siemens, thermal efficiency of around 55 per cent is now possible, and the financial savings for their customers make it worthwhile for the equipment producers to continue raising the threshold. The consensus in the industry is that thermal efficiency can be further improved. 'I think there is the capability for efficiency to approach 60 per cent as the years go by,' says Mr Sharpe. GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbines unit (EGT), meanwhile, believes it could take a decade a more for the target to be achieved. Improving the efficiency of CCGT could be particularly important in the UK if the forecasts of generating overcapacity prove correct. Depending on the design, some CCGT plants suffer quite sharp losses of efficiency if they are not operated at peak loads. Even reaching 60 per cent, however, will depend on success for a number of separate technology developments. In the power generation process itself, achieving higher firing temperatures in the gas turbine will be crucial - the hotter the gas turbine, the greater will be the exhaust temperature. General Electric's 9F turbines are the hottest in the world at 1,260 degC, giving an exhaust temperature of 583 degC. Raising gas turbine temperatures to 1,500 degC over the next few years will require further steady advances in blade design and materials, and in cooling systems. But there are challenges. If the process design requires a gas supply at high pressure, a considerable amount of energy will be taken up powering a compressor, says Mr Sharpe. Environmental concerns also play a part in the efficiency equation. For example, the best source of coolant for a turbine is usually water from a nearby river, which can be returned after use. When this is not possible, cooling towers can be used, but are often considered unacceptable for environmental reasons. A solution is a dry condensing system which does not need water but can reduce overall efficiency by half a percentage point. In very cold temperatures, however, the system can be more efficient than a cooling tower, according to Mr Sharpe. Another important contribution to greater efficiency will come from increasingly sophisticated computer models controlling the operation of CCGT plants. Their aim is to optimise the power station's performance by striking the right balance between the use of the gas turbine and the steam turbine as power demand ebbs and flows. Although CCGT has won converts from power producers worldwide, proponents of small-scale power plants never tire of reminding the power industry that even CCGT wastes virtually half of its fuel's energy. In contrast, combined heat and power (CHP), which turns the waste heat into steam or hot water for use by industry or in the home, regularly achieves efficiencies of 75-80 per cent, and 90 per cent has been recorded in some cases. Although there would be no theoretical problems with a large-scale CHP plant, the challenge frequently would be to make use of the large quantities of heat produced by a plant similar in size to the CCGT stations now in vogue. On a smaller-scale, CHP may be much more efficient but normally requires infrastructural spending on distribution if used for, say, district heating. But there are hundreds of successful examples of such applications, especially in Scandinavia, and some have been around a relatively long time, such as a 20-year-scheme in Nottingham which harnesses a refuse incineration plant and a coal-fired power station to provide sufficient power for 2,000 dwellings. *The World Market for Heavy Equipment.

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CLEANING UP SPORTS SYSTEM'  </P> <P> I read with interest your editorial "Cleaning Up the Sports System" (Jan. 23).  I believe that your call for a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. review of its  standards and the manner of enforcing them is absolutely required, not only  from the standpoint of equity regarding black athletes but, as you rightly  point out, from the standpoint of equity between athletes and students  altogether.  </P> <P> We re-issued our magazine, New Perspectives, in January. This issue is entirely  devoted to the NCAA's Proposition 48. My own essay, "Rhode's Handicapping:  Slowing the Pace of Integration," provides considerable documentary evidence to  support your expression of concern. I do not call for the elimination of  freshman eligibility, as you do, thinking it well for each institution (or at  least conference) to decide that for itself.  </P> <P> But you will find support for your idea that athletic merit ought to be  rewarded proportionately to the gains it brings the institutions. You apologize  for this as "a radical proposal." I could not disagree more; I think that you  show yourselves, on this question, squarely in the mainstream of responsible  opinion!  </P> <P> WILLIAM B. ALLEN  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

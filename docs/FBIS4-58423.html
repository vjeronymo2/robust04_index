			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat at the signing </F> ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the  International Convention Center in Cairo -- live]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful the compassionate.  And we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed  in the land, to make them leaders in faith, and make them heirs  [Koranic verse followed by applause]    President Muhammad Husni Mubarak of the fraternal Arab  Republic of Egypt, Mr. Christopher, Mr. Kozyrev, Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and my  brother His Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa:    In the historic moments that we are witnessing today on the  land of fraternal Egypt, I extend to you, Mr. President, and to  the government and great people of Egypt, greetings and  appreciation of your constant concern and continuing efforts to  achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the entire region.  This is Egypt's fate and real role as determined by its  position in the heart of the Arab world and the Middle East and  between the three continents, Asia, Africa, and Europe  [applause]. Many happy returns on your birthday today.  [applause]    You are now carrying the banner that is building the  structure of peace. Without your constant contribution and  role, it would be difficult for us to see such an achievement.  To you, Your Excellency the President, and through you to every  Egyptian on this good and towering land, I extend the greetings  of every Palestinian in our land and abroad, those who look with  hope toward a new era of genuine, lasting, and comprehensive  peace. I also thank Foreign Minister brother 'Amr Musa.  [applause]    I also extend greetings and deep thanks to the sponsors of  the peace process, the United States and the Russian Federation,  and to President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin, who  are represented here today by His Excellency Secretary Warren  Christopher and His Excellency Minister Andrey Kozyrev. I also  thank the states of the European Union, the nonaligned states,  the Islamic states, and the African countries.    Their persistent efforts had a great effect on overcoming  the obstacles and on bringing views closer so as to complete  this first step in the Palestinian-Israeli peace course and from  it, God willing, move to the Arab-Israeli peace.    I also remember with reverence and respect our friend and  minister, Norway's Johan Holst, who died with great hopes of  sharing in these moments of implementing the first step of the  agreement. He participated quietly and effectively to achieve  it. I welcome here His Excellency Minister Tore Godal,  appreciating his important endeavors and the Norwegian  Government's constant efforts and good moves to serve the peace  process in every sphere.    In the name of every Palestinian man and woman, I look with  great confidence and hope at our brothers and our people's  friends who are participating in this historic occasion and I  think of those who could not come. I thank them all and stress  to them that our people today in the West Bank, Gaza, holy  Jerusalem, and in all the diaspora are looking more than ever  toward your role so that this first step in Gaza and Jericho  will become the real start for completing the peace process,  guaranteeing our Palestinian people's legitimate rights,  achieving justice and equality by ending the occupation of our  Palestinian territories, and building the Palestinian future  based on democracy, development, and progress, a future linked  with the tradition of its glorious Arab nation.    Today, brothers, belongs to all our brothers who have helped  to make it. It belongs to our brother President Zine el Abidine  Ben Ali, the president of green Tunisia, who provided the  Palestinian people's leadership with all the facilities for  achieving their rights. The day belongs to our brothers in the  great Arab Maghreb, especially His Majesty King Hassan II and  his good efforts, President Lamine Zeroual, chairman of the Arab  Maghreb Union, and the other brother members of the Union. It  also belongs to our brothers in the Arab Gulf. I particularly  mention the role of His Majesty King Fahd, custodian of the two  holy mosques, [applause] and all his brother leaders of the Gulf  countries. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's planes are today  carrying the Palestinian security forces who are returning to  the homeland. This highlights the constant support and  brotherhood, the ties of which will never be broken, God willing.    On this day, too, I salute fraternal Jordan, His Majesty  King Husayn, and Jordan's Government and people, who share with  us a common date and a promising future, God willing.    I also express to our brothers in Syria and Lebanon and to  President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi the  confidence that the ties of fate binding us will be strengthened  because we are acting on the firm basis that peace will not be  just if it is not comprehensive. Peace will prevail over our  region when the resolutions of international legitimacy are  applied to all the Arab fronts and when the eras of occupation,  the eras of wars, and the cycles of violence end.    I also salute the brothers in Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Libya  for embracing their Palestinian brothers since the departure  from Beirut.    Allow me to congratulate the people of South Africa and  struggling President Nelson Mandela and [former] President de  Klerk [applause] for the victory achieved by the South African  people in the democratic experience, when it vanquished  injustice and racial discrimination to build a future based on  tolerance, equality, justice, and respect for human rights.    Respected ladies and gentlemen, we are signing the step to  mark the start. It is a step linked with other steps in the  West Bank during the coming few months so that our people can,  for the first time, see the real horizon for establishing the  just peace.    The withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is the prelude; it  opens  the door to removing the entire occupation and to establishing  new relations between our peoples, Prime Minister Rabin, between  our Israeli and Palestinian peoples, for the sake of our  children and yours. [applause]    Completing this step required Herculean courage after long  periods of war and violence. The coming stage will require  still greater courage, a thorough insight, real farsightedness,  and firm patience so that we can establish a firm and  unshakeable peace, the peace of the bold.    The Palestinian people have lived on their land throughout  history. They helped to create civilization and raise the voice  of peace, the voice of the only all-powerful God, the creator,  the lord of the universe and of the three heavenly religions,  calling for praising God's blessings, giving, and his name on  this sacred land.    The people of Palestine, based on their deep historical  heritage, today express their loyalty to the just and  comprehensive peace. Thus our people demonstrated faithfulness  to the heritage of their successive generations; to the sweat of  the Palestinian people, mixed as it is with the soil of the  earth; to the Palestinian maker's determination to build life  and let it flourish; and to the creativity of the Palestinian  intellectual, who always believes that history will never go off  its track no matter how much time passes. [applause]    Our people, gentlemen, have struggled long to see the  beginning of the peace era. For peace to be achieved, our  people offered dear sacrifices. To achieve this recognition of  our national rights, the eyes of bereaved mothers and of  children who were raised to know that love and loyalty to the  homeland are the highest values of life looked forward. Also  looking forward to this were the prisoners, whose hope of  freedom, for themselves and for their people, is renewed every  day, and the refugee camp residents, who never lost confidence  that a new era of freedom would come.    Nothing has gone in vain. Alive and great nations make their  wounds, the sacrifice of their martyrs, and their long suffering  the motives for the future and the banners for building a new  era based on justice under the shadow of tolerance and  coexistence among the three religions of Judaism, Christianity,  and Islam over centuries.    We have offered a great deal to reach this day. We  confronted patiently and persistently every hindrance and doubt  and we always thought that every step in the peace negotiations,  despite all the pain, was a move away from the era of war and  violence nearer to the era of equal rights and the  implementation of international legitimacy. While today we  celebrate the signing of the first step, we must all realize  that all those concerned about peace, including our people at  home and in the diaspora, measure the seriousness of this step  by one criterion: honest and precise implementation and the  change it will make to the reality on the ground. It is the  right of our people and of everybody concerned with genuine  peace to point to the measures isolating holy Jerusalem from its  surroundings and preventing the Palestinians from entering it  and the other sacred Islamic and Christian places. These  measures obstruct life in the city, paralyze its economy, and  separate the sons of the same family.    All this is incompatible with the spirit of the just and  real peace, with the course of equality, justice, and human  rights that we are aspiring to adopt as the basis for free and  positive relations between the two neighboring peoples, as Mr.  Peres said, between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. The  suffering of the city of Hebron following the bloody massacre  cannot continue. It is still suffering encirclement and siege  both inside and outside it.    The continuation of the settlement and the attempt to impose  the fait accompli in Jerusalem and in other areas conflict with  the essence, clauses, and the short and long-term objectives of  the peace process.    The boldness of peace prompts me today to adopt the policy  of  frankness on peace without which we cannot end the age of  confrontation and start the age of constructive and real  cooperation. The Arab peoples and millions of Muslims and  Christians will observe our practical steps tomorrow to pass  judgment on the possibility of coexistence and of opening a new  chapter in normal relations. All those who want the success of  the Palestinian-Israeli peace experiment realize the importance  of the great steps facing this peace, including the settlements,  the refugee problem, holy Jerusalem, and the need to solve it  later, as we agreed, so as to help create a new era of  protecting the future of the entire region and ensuring openness  between their peoples and countries on the basis of respect for  the rules and resolutions of international legitimacy.    Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident today that the  Palestinian people will receive this new stage with a desire to  provide a real opportunity for building real peace with the same  desire it has for its national identity and its independent  national being. Our people extends its hand to the Israeli  people to start this era and end the whirlpool of violence for  the sake of our real interests today and the interests of our  coming generations.    Coexistence is possible. It is inevitable. It is our common  fate to live together as neighbors governed by the rules of  justice, democracy, and national and human dignity.    Hatred, bigotry, and extremism will only lead to more  squandering of our creative and brilliant resources. We are  proposing the alternative today, namely equality, joint  building, and respect for every people's right and independent  choice and security.    Today again I also address our great Arab nation, leaders  and  peoples, on the threshold of the first step of the return to the  homeland and stress to them that their pain, sacrifice, and  determination to uphold our Palestinian people's national  legitimate rights prompt us today to strengthen our fraternal  ties in every field so that peace for Palestine will, as always,  be a peace for all the Arabs.    Yes, gentlemen, our peace is a peace for our Arab nation. It  is a peace for Israel, for the Middle East region, for the whole  world. Yes, it is a peace for the whole world.    O God, you are peace, peace comes from you, and peace is for  you. Blessed are you God, full of majesty, bounty, and honor.  Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill  toward men. Peace be with you.</p>

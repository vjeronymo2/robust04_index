			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Trading in Chicago hit for second day: Flooded business district is declared disaster area CHICAGO'S business district was declared a disaster area yesterday after flooding of the city's underground tunnel system on Monday cut power supplies and closed offices. Many buildings in the city's downtown area were shut for a second day after a tunnel under the Chicago River burst. Damages could reach several billion dollars, although assessments are still being made. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) remained closed and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), while unaffected directly, closed early except for trading in its stock index futures. The equity-based futures, which have an important impact on share dealing in New York, were traded during normal hours. The CME said it shortened its day as the clearing of trades was difficult given that many member firms were closed by the flood. The CBOT, which still has a flooded basement, will open from noon to 2pm local time today while the CME will be trading normally. Emergency crews cut the water flow into the tunnels to a trickle yesterday. Many of the buildings affected by flooding were still without electricity and thousands of workers were unable to return to work or were sent home early. Companies scrambled to find temporary office space, some trying to fulfil an April 15 deadline for tax receipts. However, the Internal Revenue Service extended the tax deadline by a week for those affected by the flood. Mayor Richard Daley has dismissed the city's acting director of transportation, Mr John LaPlante, who knew about a leak in the tunnel at least a month before it burst, but failed to act quickly enough to correct it.</p>

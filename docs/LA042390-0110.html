			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> ONE FAMILY THAT'S A FLOCK OF FUN;  </P> <P> TO THE BIRDHOUSE BY CATHLEEN SCHINE FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX $16.95, 273  PAGES  </P> <P> As "To the Birdhouse" opens, Alice Brody is a happy woman. She has just married  Peter Eiger, a rare bird of solitary habits who makes his living doing baseball  statistics. Alice's brother, young Willie, is still in his bachelor stage,  about midway through a string of ethnically variegated girlfriends, the current  one a Japanese sociologist named Yuki. Alice's father has flown from the family  nest and married again, but the rest of the relatives -- Alice's relentlessly  eccentric grandma and an assortment of aunts and great-aunts -- make up a  friendly, nurturing flock.  </P> <P> Only Brenda, Alice's mother, seems unhappy. A kind and beautiful dove, she has  somehow gotten mixed up with Louie Scifo, a kind of immigrant Italian carrion  crow. Louie deals in stolen goods and secondhand furniture. He wears gabardine  leisure suits and butts in where he's not wanted. He's an embarrassment, a  disaster, and although Alice -- as a newly married woman -- wishes domestic  contentment on everyone she knows, she draws the line at Louie. He's a curse.  </P> <P> Brenda soon finds this out for herself. She breaks up with Louie, but he will  have none of it. His heart (if he has a heart) is broken. In a string of  bizarre incidents, Louie begins the secondary courtship of the already rejected  lover: He bashes in Brenda's windows, puts black widow spiders under her  pillow, makes crank phone calls to her and her extended family at all hours of  the day and night. Finally, he hauls out his binoculars and begins watching the  Brody family. Alice can't look out of a window into a tree without seeing a  ClamberingLouie, his binoculars trained on her.  </P> <P> For Alice, this is particularly disconcerting. She is a bird watcher by trade,  putting out a newsletter for New York Birders. The morning after her wedding  night, she rises early to take the subway to Prospect Park, all for the sake of  a Bullock's Oriole, blown in from the Rockies on the mighty wings of a winter  storm.  </P> <P> The story of Alice's first year of married life, then, is punctuated by typed  lists of birds she spots: On Sept. 15, at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge: "1.  2 Pied-Billed Grebes, 2. 14 double-crested cormorants, 3. 2 great blue herons,"  and so on. When Alice is happy, she sees a lot (this particular list runs to 53  items). When she's sad, or tormented by Louie, she finds only: "1. 67 Cicada  shells."  </P> <P> By now, the family has moved to Brenda's summer home in Westport, Conn. Louie  has gotten himself hired as a gardener by the woman next door and runs a power  mower back and forth across their yard, howling, "Brenda! Brenda!" Things have  gotten out of hand, and Alice must devise a strategy to drive the Clambering  Louie out of their collective lives.  </P> <P> Obviously, this book is not for everyone. You have to buy into the idea that  all of us are terminally weird and driven by behavior patterns that are best  described as birdbrained. Ethically, I must disclose my own bias here: This  review was written on a day when seven California Jays, two pairs of nesting  doves, one pair of nesting quail, eight house finches, one towhee and one  red-shafted flicker flew through our patio. (But no Clambering Louies, thank  God.)  </P> <P> Next: Lee Dembart reviews "When Technology Wounds: The Human Consequences of  Progress" by Chellis Glendinning.  </P></p>

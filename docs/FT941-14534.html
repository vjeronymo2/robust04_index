			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Group of Names accepts offer Names on one of the worst-hit syndicates at Lloyd's of London yesterday agreed to accept the insurance market's Pounds 900m deal to settle legal action outside the courts, Richard Lapper writes. A total of 215 members of the Merrett syndicate 421 Names Action Group have been offered about Pounds 5m in compensation for losses of more than Pounds 16m. More than 22,000 Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance market - have until the middle of next month to accept or reject the offer. Mr John Franklin, chairman of the action group, said the offer had 'some unsatisfactory features'. But litigation would be expensive and there was no certainty that Names would win in the courts. By contrast, two of the largest groups of lossmakers - Gooda Walker and Merrett 418 Names - have rejected the offer in favour of legal action.</p>

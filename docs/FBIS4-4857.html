			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- The head of the influential  business leaders' group expressed his optimistic outlook on the  economy Tuesday [5 April], saying it is heading for a steady  recovery.    "Economic indicators are increasingly showing the evidence  (that the economy is on the rise) and corporate sentiment is  gradually improving," said Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan  Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), at a  regular news conference. But Hayami, calling the yen's advance  against the U.S. dollar "excessive," said, "the current  dollar-yen level will have an adverse effect on export-oriented  companies."    "The U.S. Administration apparently hopes the yen will post  a  further gain in the face of a `triple' decline of stocks, bonds  and dollars," Hayami said.</p>

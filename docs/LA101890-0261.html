			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH JOBLESSNESS UP 0.1%  </P> <P> British unemployment increased only 0.1% in September, but officials warned  today that upcoming wage settlements will determine whether British industries  -- and jobs -- survive in a unified European market.  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted unemployment figures released by the Central Office of  Statistics showed total unemployment at 1.6 million -- 5.8% of the British work  force.  </P> <P> And, in a reflection of the changing politics, owners of the historic Cammell  Laird shipyard at Birkenhead on the River Mersey, 210 miles north of London,  announced that defense cuts had forced them to try to sell the once-proud yard,  builder of Britain's first aircraft carrier, the Ark Royal.  </P></p>

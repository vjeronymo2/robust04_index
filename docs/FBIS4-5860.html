			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in seven parts by the Corporate Finance Reporting </F> Team]  <H5>  [21 Feb p 1] </H5>   [Text] (1) Handling Bad Debts, Banks' Priority    The relationship between corporations and banks and  securities companies is worsening. Reciprocal holding of stocks  practiced by corporations and banks, which used to symbolize the  close relationship between the two, has begun to fail due to the  prolonged stagnation of the stock market, as well as low rate of  corporate profit growth. Leading corporations are hurrying to  separate themselves from banks. This is especially apparent in  their overseas operations, where they are trying to find a way  to raise funds by themselves. Will the intensified competition  caused by banks branching out into the securities business bring  profit to corporations? We will examine the relationship between  corporations and banks and securities firms, which is definitely  changing at this unstable time after the collapse of the "bubble  economy." (Corporate Finance Reporting Team)    Testimony 1. "One lower rank city bank told us that they  wanted to sell the reciprocally held stocks. We agreed and both  of us sold a part of our holdings in the market." (Itochu Corp.)    Testimony 2. "Sometimes banks sound us out on selling our  stocks. It seems some banks are selling their reciprocally held  stocks without even asking corporations." (Hitachi Ltd.)    Testimony 3. "We have sold out a part of our reciprocally  held stocks which two of the city banks had held." (Sankyo Corp.)    Banks are rushing to sell reciprocally held stocks of  corporations.    "Now, it has become easier to sell stocks." One financial  director of a major steel company expressed his relief this way.    It was evident that the March 1994 period would show a heavy  deficit. They were preparing to sell stocks in order to balance  accounts. They were wondering how to approach the bank whose  stocks they were planning to sell. Just then, The Long-Term  Credit Bank of Japan, The Nippon Credit Bank, and some trust  banks came to them to ask about selling their reciprocally held  stocks of the steel company. How timely! "Since banks are  selling our stocks, we can sell theirs, too." They found a  perfect excuse.    Corporations, too, have reasons to want to sell banks'  stocks  which they reciprocally hold. Leading corporations in steel and  automobile industries are plagued with poor business results,  and rushing to sell their assets. The main sale items are  stocks, mainly bank stocks which do not produce cash flow,  except for a little dividend.    According to Daiwa Research Institute's estimate, the latent  profit of security holdings of the corporations listed on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange was 40 trillion yen. Of this, 23 trillion  yen, which is about 60 percent of the total latent profit, was  from bank stocks. Bank stocks are great items to sell to produce  profits. Considering efficiency of assets, it is better to sell  them off, rather than buy them back.    Nihon Paper Manufacturing Co., the largest in the paper and  pulp industry, was established by the merger between Jujo Paper  Mfg. Co. and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp Co. last spring. They began to  negotiate with 20 percent of their creditor financial  institutions with the intention to cut them off within a year.  Naturally, they will discuss cancellation of the reciprocally  held stocks.    Before the merger, Jujo had 44 creditor companies, including  life insurance companies. Sanyo Kokusaku had 28. After the  merger, they still had over 50 creditor companies. "When you  have so many creditors, the business process gets complicated.  Also, fund-raising becomes less flexible" (a director of Nihon  Paper Mfg. Co.). This is the reason for being selective in  deciding which financial institutions to keep. Restructuring of  corporations (business restructuring), including mergers, is  promoting cancellation of banks' stocks they hold reciprocally.    Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals has also begun to limit the number  of  financial institutions it transacts with. The company has  selected about 10 city banks and regional banks to which it had  relatively small debt out of 41 banks it dealt with. Within two  to three years, it is planning to cut ties to the rest of the  banks as it finishes paying off its debts. "We have had a  long-term relationship with these banks, and we reciprocally  hold stocks with them, also" (Tetsu Nakayama, managing  director). However, concerning the banks it is cutting off, it  is planning to sell their reciprocally held stocks. It is  prepared for the time when the banks will sell its company's  stocks.    The warrant bonds (a debenture with preemptive rights) are  also affected by the stagnant stock prices, and the rights are  not being exercised. It is ironic that we do not have to worry  about stabilization of stock prices anymore.    Reciprocal holding of stocks by corporations and banks is  closely related to loan situations. We have results of research  done by Nissei Kiso Research Institute on major city banks and  The Industrial Bank of Japan.    This study shows the relation between the lending ratio of  major city banks and the Industrial Bank against total corporate  borrowing, and the banks' stock holdings. When a bank holds  stocks of a loan customer, the lending ratio is 13-17 percent.  When they do not hold stocks, the ratio is only 3-4 percent.    While some companies are cutting down the number of  correspondent banks, some companies are trying to reinforce  their relationship with certain banks. Fuji Bank, which is the  main bank for Unidax, an electronics parts sales company, bought  about 100,000 more shares of Unidax stocks last fall. Fuji  Banks' shares of Unidax stocks doubled. Unidax is also planning  to increase its shareholdings of Fuji Bank.    Unidax has already had some directors transferred from Fuji  Bank. Its loan from Fuji Bank has increased, also. It is trying  to strengthen the relationship with the bank. Life Corporation,  a bulk dealer of foods, is reinforcing its ties to Mitsubishi  Corp., and at the same time it is starting business transactions  with Mitsubishi Bank.    Many of the leading corporations are diversifying  fund-raising methods, and lowering its dependence on bank loans.  The necessity for corporations to reciprocally hold banks'  stocks is decreasing, from the fund-raising point of view, also.  However, corporations cannot cut off ties with all banks.  Corporations are beginning to select banks.  <H5>  [21 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] (1) Reciprocal Holding of Stocks Is Relaxing,  and Cost Awareness Is Up    Reciprocal holding of stocks between corporations and  financial institutions progressed in the late 1980's, when stock  prices were high. Both corporations and financial institutions  rapidly increased equity financing (fund-raising with issuance  of new stocks) in order to raise funds with low interest. For  smooth promotion of equity financing, it was considered  effective to keep stock prices the same by holding stocks  reciprocally.    The basis of reciprocal holding of stocks was established  "during the post war period up to 1960" (Nissei Kiso Research  Institute). Reciprocal holding of stocks during this period was  supposed to "stabilize the management of corporations" (Nissei  Kiso Research Institute). Reciprocal holding of stocks during  period of high stock prices is different in nature, since its  goal is to raise funds.    Another way to raise funds for corporations, which is more  effective than equity financing, is to use internal reserves  [hold internal profits by not selling stocks]. When the number  of issued stocks increases through equity financing, the burden  of dividend payments also becomes heavy. With internal reserves,  there is no such problem. Even though the dividend is kept low  in order to increase the internal reserve, there will not be  much criticism if reciprocal holding of stocks is widely  practiced. Reciprocal holding was thus useful in this sense,  also.    There is some cost involved in internal reserves. When stock  prices were increasing and the investment profit rate was kept  high, the cost was not much of a burden. Not to mention that  internal reserves were believed to generate latent profit.    When stock prices stopped increasing, the cost of internal  reserves began to be reviewed again. Shosuke Ide, director of  research at Nomura Management School, pointed out, "if you  perceive stocks as profit bonds rather than control bonds, the  reciprocal holding system will have to fail."    Nomura Research Institute conducted a study on the  corporations listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock  Exchange. According to this study, the reciprocal holding rate  of financial (institutions') stocks was 41.0 percent as of the  end of March 1993. This was lower than a year before by 0.8  percent, the largest drop among all the industries. The trend to  cancel reciprocal holdings by corporations and financial  institutions was already evident then.    "In the United States, maintenance of assets which do not  generate cash flow has been avoided as much as possible, because  it was considered to be a factor for lowering profitability. In  Japan, cash flow has not been regarded as important" (Daiwa  Research Institute). Corporations and banks have been accepting  the situation where they held "assets that did not generate cash  flow" (stocks jointly held). This type of relationship is  becoming very difficult to keep any more (Toru Hasegawa of the  Tokyo Securities Division.).  <H5>  [22 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] (2) Unreliable Main Banks    Koyo Machine Industries, a manufacturer of construction  machinery and listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange, requested  the Osaka district court to apply the Stock Company  Reorganization and Rehabilitation Act to them. "Banks were very  nice to us in this matter. We owe them a lot." Akinori Fujitani,  president of Koyo, stressed that they had a strong relationship  with banks. However, contrary to what Koyo expected, the banks  had already begun to consider stopping their support to the  company in the beginning of fall.    It was about a year ago when Koyo's fund situation worsened.  It was having difficulty recovering the large investment it made  for golf course development. To add to this, the number of  orders decreased due to the recession. Its main bank, The  Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, supplied a loan of several  billion yen for operational funds and gave Koyo advice on  restructuring.    Last fall, when Koyo Machine Industries asked The Long-Term  Credit Bank to send them some personnel, its request was denied.  At that time, Koyo believed that "the bank must have considered  this matter positively. Probably they will send us some  personnel in spring" (manager at Koyo). Koyo was still hopeful.  The Long-Term Credit Bank felt that "Koyo does not seem to have  made any particular effort on its part, and there is not much  hope for reconstruction." It avoided supporting Koyo by sending  its personnel there.    The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan stopped any additional  loan to Koyo in late December, and at the same time it sent a  representative to Koyo in Osaka to inform it of the following.  "If you are going to legally seek reorganization, we will  support you as much as we can." A few days later, Koyo Machine  Industries applied for application of the Stock Company  Reorganization and Rehabilitation Act. According to its  certified public accountant, its total debt was as much as 72  billion yen.    One of the management people at The Long-Term Credit Bank  confessed, saying, "I am just speaking generally. Times have  changed. The economy does not expand anymore like it used to if  banks worked diligently and got a shot in the arm once in a  while. We must consider more seriously than before how much  support to give so that our loss will not become too much."    It has been an important role of main banks to support and  lead reorganization of companies that are going down. This  function as the "lender of last resort for companies" is  disappearing. Where do banks draw the line? They have begun to  seriously consider the following three points.    First, the owner of the corporation may keep management  information to themselves and may not provide it to the bank.  Therefore, it has become more important to have a good  understanding of the management situation because the breakdown  of the "land myth" caused real estate-secured loans to become  less practical.    Second, the type of industry has poor growth possibility.  Therefore, in a mature economy, the business is not expected to  revive by just existing.    Third, supporting one company indefinitely may cause banks  to  be criticized by society. Therefore, while efficiency of banks'  assets is being questioned, supporting a business, which may  take a long time to rebuild, may cause stockholders and  depositors to distrust banks.    In Koyo Machine Industries' case, the problem has been  caused  by a combination of its excess investment during the bubble  economy and its poor business results. The second point is true  in this case.    "This would not have happened, if we had kept our ties with  banks stronger," a sales manager of Kikko, an Osaka wholesaler  of confectionery, is more critical of its former management than  the banks which forsook it.    When it was having a difficult time raising funds, there was  no evidence that its banks, such as Fuji Bank, aggressively  supported them. This manager was told by the bank's branch  manager, who was soon to be transferred, "our business is to  loan money. If we could, we would. However, because we will not  know where the loaned money will go, we cannot do anything about  it."    After this incident this manager was informed that  management  "lacked sincerity in dealing with its banks." The first point  applies here.    However unreasonable it may be, what if the banks continued  to support the company? A manager at The Long-Term Credit Bank  points out that "a lawsuit by the stockholders awaits the bank."  This is the third point. The lawsuit filed against Mitsui Trust  and Banking Co. by Azabu Building Co., which drew attention as a  question of "lender's responsibility," caused banks to be  hesitant about getting deeply involved with corporations.    Of course, there still are cases where a bank saves a  corporation in crisis, and the relationship between the two is  strengthened. Last December, when Isetan's stocks were bought up  by a real estate company, Shuwa Corp., the Mitsubishi group  bought back 58.8 million shares that Shuwa held. Thus Isetan's  crisis was resolved. At the press conference, Isetan's  president, Kazumasa Koshiba praised Mitsubishi Bank, saying that  "it (Mitsubishi Bank) fulfilled perfectly its role as our main  bank."    However, Mitsubishi did not support Isetan unconditionally.  Isetan's former president, Kuniyasu Kosuga, was rumored to have  had disagreements with Mitsubishi Bank. His resignation last May  preceded the bank's decision to help Isetan. Mr. Kosuga is said  to have tried to change the traditional way of dealing with  banks by distancing itself from Mitsubishi and approaching Sanwa  Bank.    From now on, banks will make clearer distinction between the  corporations they will support and those they will not.  Corporations must forsake the concept that "they have the main  bank as their lender of last resort." They must learn to deal  with banks without getting attached to them. "The time will come  when corporations will choose banks and banks will choose  corporations" (Financial Research Room manager at Sakura  Research Institute).  <H5>  [23 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] (3) The Third "Good-By, Banks!"    A manager at a long-term credit bank listens carefully every  day to the news about issuance of bonds with a little concern.  His main concern is Mitsubishi Corporation's plan to issue  five-year straight bonds (SB).    As a result of reviewing the regulations and customary  practice, they virtually removed the restriction on issuance of  five-year SB's, which they had asked companies to limit because  "their five-year SB's would compete with the five-year  interest-bearing bonds issued by long-term credit banks." Nippon  Steel Corp., Orix, Tokyu Land Corp., and Nissan Motor have  already issued the five-year SB's.    Issuance of the five-year SB's means that the cost incurred,  when a corporation raises five-year, long-term funds directly  from the market, will be exposed to the public eye. Mitsubishi  Corp. is considering issuance of more than 100 billion yen worth  of the bonds, which is considerably above its normal amount of  20 billion yen. If the bonds continue to be issued this way, it  will make interest-bearing bonds less attractive" (a manager at  a long-term credit bank).    In addition, if Mitsubishi Corp., which is ranked higher  than  long-term credit banks, continued to issue this type, it will be  able to issue bonds at the same or lower cost. The difference in  creditworthiness of corporations and financial institutions as  shown by this ranking really means something.    If this scenario becomes true, the very purpose of long-term  credit banks, which boasted that they were leading industrial  finance, may be questioned. Issuance of bonds, which costs less  than the long-term prime rate (the best loan interest), is  already becoming a reality. Following this, some corporations  may demand loans with interest rates lower than the long-term  prime rate. Some say that "the long-term prime rate is based on  the yield of interest-bearing bonds, plus 0.9 percent. This  system may be shaky" (manager at The Industrial Bank of Japan,  Securities Dept.).    "Good-bye, banks! Part Three...," one accounting manager of  a  major corporation explained, using words sounding like a movie  title.    Part One was in the 1950's and 1960's, when there was an  investment trust boom, mainly among individual investors. Part  Two was in the 1970's and 1980's, when there was a shift in the  financial trend toward direct financing by equity financing  (funding with new issuance of stocks). Both parts ended with a  sudden drop in stock price. Now, for the third time, a trend of  "breaking away from banks" is beginning to take place.    Yuraku Real Estate Co. is increasing use of funds raised by  the deposit in Taisei Corp., its parent company. The amount of  deposit was 13 billion yen at the end of March 1992. It has  grown to 20 billion yen now. According to Taisei, "for Yuraku  Real Estate Co., our interest is better than banks, and for us,  their deposit is always better than getting a loan from banks."    According to Bank of Japan statistics, the spread of banks'  deposit and lending interest (average lending interest rate  minus free interest term deposit interest) grew from 0.5 percent  at the end of 1989 to over 2 percent in 1993 (month end average  from January to November). Banks had to rush to secure a certain  interest spread. Corporations competed with them.    More and more companies are opting to have new money  products, such as MMF (money market funds), and bonds, rather  than depositing in banks. At Nippon Kayaku Co., the balance of  short-term securities as of November 1993 was 16.3 billion yen,  which was a big jump from the previous year's 0.1 billion yen.  This is a result of moving bank deposits to MMF.    Major corporations, such as Nissan Motor and All Nippon  Airways, have begun to accelerate their operational funds' shift  to bonds since the end of 1992. More and more corporations are  preferring better yield on their operational funds than  long-term relationship with banks.    The boom in warrant bonds (debentures with preemptive  rights)  has ended, and the ratio of loan is increasing as a funding  method. This may seem like the trend of "breaking away from  banks" is being stopped. However, the power relationship between  leading corporations and banks is definitely changing.    "The main bank is Japan Development Bank." As of the end of  September 1993, the long-term and short-term loan balance of  Tokyo Gas Co. was 80 billion yen, of which 54 billion yen was  loaned from Japan Development Bank. This was its largest loan.  For the current term, Tokyo Gas Co. raised 70 billion yen  externally, 54 billion yen from corporate bonds, and 16 billion  yen from a loan from Japan Development Bank.    Why Japan Development Bank? Japan Development Bank' loan  interest rates are sometimes higher than the long-term prime  rate. However, the bank allows long-term fixed-rate loans, such  as 15-year loans, while most other banks want to use variable  interest rates. In the long run this may be more profitable.    Tokyo Electric Power Co. borrowed from regional financial  institutions which are affiliated with the Norinchukin Bank  [Central Bank for Agriculture and Forestry]. This was because of  the installation of "competition system" which allowed them to  select a financial institution to borrow money from.    In the "competition system", Tokyo Electric Power Co. would  have each financial institution propose its conditions  concerning the amount, term, and interest rate, and the company  would take the loan which would be most beneficial. An  individual financial institution's loan terms used to be a fixed  condition which was decided by share distribution. From now on  "it will be possible that loan terms will vary depending on the  individual financial institutions" (top-level executive at Tokyo  Electric Power Co.).    The corporate trend to break away from banks, which had  apparently stopped, has been continuing. Shigeru Watanabe, chief  of the Corporate Finance Research Room at Nomura Research  Institute, affirms, "concerning major corporations, banks have  no controlling power." The relationship between corporations and  banks is becoming more and more distant, though it has not gone  as far as it has in the United States, where corporations base  their decision on cost.    The third "Good-bye, Banks!" is different from the first two  in the sense that "banks that used to have enough power are now  exhausted" (executive at Industrial Bank of Japan). As long as  banks function as the place to operate the funds or the fund  provider is weakening, large and powerful corporations have no  choice but to be selective in choosing their correspondent  banks. With the trend of financial deregulation, power  relationship between banks and corporations is even more  accelerated.  <H5>  [24 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] (4) Hesitant in Providing Risk Money    There was a demand for 8.7302 million shares against 550,000  shares that were offered for public subscription. A tender for  Koekisha's public offering was held on the 21st. Koekisha is the  first funeral company in Japan to be listed on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange. The demand was 15.9 times more than the number of  shares they offered.    It was September 1992 when Koekisha applied to be listed on  the Stock Exchange. However, it was put on a waiting list for a  year and a half for the reason that "excess supply of new stocks  may cause stock prices to fall." The people at Koekisha, who had  to wait, are feeling uneasy after seeing the popularity of their  stocks.    They do have complaints and distrust about this wait. They  seem to think that "placing the stock on the market will  activate the stock market." However, public subscription was  like a "hostage" and "until the company gets listed on the Tokyo  Stock Exchange, we could not do anything to upset the  authorities" (executive of C.I. Kosei Co., which was listed on  the Stock Exchange at the end of last year).    In Koekisha's case, "fortunately the delay in offering for  public subscription did not alter its plan of funding or  management" (Koji Konishi, Koekisha's Management Planning Room  chief). However, it is possible that this kind of delay may  cause an unrecoverable loss for a corporation.    Yu Inaba, deputy director of the Sales Planning Department  at  Nikko Securities Co., points out, "Sometimes the ranking in an  industry can be affected by even a slight difference in timing.  A company may grow very rapidly as soon as it starts public sale  of shares, while another company may be right behind it on the  waiting list, but could not start its public sale of shares  until a little later." As a matter of fact, one company in 30  has had to give up being listed on the Stock Exchange while it  was still on the waiting list.    At present, new public offerings of stocks are limited to a  total of three companies a week in the stock exchange and  over-the-counter markets combined. More than 120 companies have  applied to go public based on their 1992 business results and  are still on the waiting list. Including those that applied in  1993, about 200 companies are crowding the waiting circle.    "For securities companies, whose profit comes mainly from  sales and purchases fees, securing the sales amount by  maintaining the market is vitally important" (president of  Chuken Securities Co.). This way of thinking is dominant. The  Ministry of Finance is also involved in interfering with the  supply of "risk money" to growing corporations, for the reason  of protecting investors.    "Promotion of newly established businesses is an urgent task  in reviving the blocked-up Japanese economy. However, funding  restrictions are a major obstacle..." The first meeting of "the  Subcommittee on Funding Environment Improvement Concerning New  Businesses" was held on 26 January on the 17th floor of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] building.  This subcommittee is a part of the Industrial Structure  Council's Industrial Finance Committee.    "Venture companies are lacking in collateral and credit, it  is hard to receive loans from financial institutions." "Due to  various regulations and customary practices, it is difficult for  them to participate in capital markets." The subcommittee  attacked banks and securities companies. MITI officials showed  their frustration, saying, "Unless we let the new group of  companies grow, there is no future for Japan." To this, the  securities companies and MITI reacted rather coolly.    The Japan Securities Dealers Association, which is working  on  reforming the over-the-counter market, said, "there is no  discussion of opening up the market by lowering the standard of  criteria for public sale of stocks." On the contrary, they say  that a series of bankruptcy of several corporations listed on  the over-the-counter market shows that corporations must be  examined more closely at the time of their application and  disclosure (releasing information) should be emphasized.    MOF is also ignoring MITI, using the excuse of "protecting  investors." Securities companies are also hesitant about opening  up the market, saying, "we need to consider first the  corporations that are already listed" (an executive of a major  securities company).    Banks are not fulfilling their function as risk-money  suppliers to small and midsized businesses, either.    Junichi Miyake, vice chairman of the Japan Research  Institute, recollected, "at the last yearend party, I had an  unpleasant encounter with the chairman of a major city bank." It  was because Mr. Miyake expressed his own opinion that "small and  midsized businesses are in a credit crunch." The chairman  insisted that "there is no hesitation by banks about lending  money." The two were not able to agree on this issue at the  party.    According to The Bank of Japan's "Evaluation of Financial  Institutions' Attitude on Loans DI (`lenient' minus `severe'),"  the figure for major corporations was -9 as of November 1992;  and the figure became positive in August 1993, and in November  the figure was 1. The attitude is clearly improving [banks are  getting more lenient in financing major corporations]. During  this time, the figure for small and midsized businesses changed  from 0 to 5. The figure was 3 last November, and the change is  not as drastic.    An executive chairman of one credit bank confided, "Since  city banks are not responding to corporations' request for  additional loans, they come crying to local credit banks for  loans." Hurt by the collapse of the "bubble," banks are more  cautious about taking risks. A top executive of a top-ranking  bank insists, "Banks' general attitude of lending money to  anyone with collateral is being corrected. It is not that we are  hesitant to give loans." On the other hand, some criticize banks  for "lacking the ability to examine companies, and take business  as a security."    Venture capital (VC), which was originally for promoting the  growth of venture enterprises, is not functioning properly. The  investment balance of VC, as of the end of 1992, was 876.1  billion yen (67 companies responded to Nikkei VC survey).  Compared to the previous year, this amount was 15 billion yen  less. This is because each company has been reorganizing its  investments.    Cases are increasing where VC requests company owners to buy  back their stocks. In their attempt to recover funds from  their investments, this is the last resort for corporations,  which rapidly expanded their investments, taking advantage of  the "bubble economy" and the VC boom.    "They supplied us with the risk money to begin with. It is  unreasonable for them to demand it back when our business  doesn't do well." "Venture capital is a false sign." Venture  enterprises are expressing their dissatisfaction. The Banking  and securities industry is not trying to understand the needs of  venture businesses that want to grow. The industry is not able  to measure the potential of these businesses, or it may be that  it is not trying to do so. The supply of risk money will  continue to decrease, unless they start understanding each other.  <H5>  [25 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] (5) Battle Between Banks and Securities  Companies    It was 24 February. The phone rang at the manager's desk in  the Corporation Department at the Yamato Securities Co. annex in  Yaesu, Tokyo. "Concerning the SB's, which are planned to be  issued the end of this month, we have decided to ask Yamaichi  Securities, Nikko Securities, and IBJ [Industrial Bank of Japan]  Securities to be the managing underwriters." The caller was an  accounting executive at Nissan Motor. At that moment, it was  decided that IBJ Securities obtained the position as a managing  underwriter in a Japanese company's domestic bonds issuance.    Until then, Nissan had always appointed the three major  securities companies, Yamaichi, Nikko, and Daiwa, to be at the  top of the managing underwriter syndicate. For Daiwa, "we were  very much shocked that we were the only one removed from the  managing underwriter position" (Masatake Makino, Daiwa executive  manager).    It is not unusual for Nissan, which once brought in a  president and a vice president from the Industrial Bank of  Japan, to give IBJ Securities Co. the honor of being a managing  underwriter. However, Nissan's getting too close to IBJ  Securities may cause the balance among the other financial  institutions to be lost. One Nissan executive confided, "we  wanted to avoid being the first one to do this."    Their struggle to maintain the balance is evident. They even  divided their issuance of SB's into three parts, 20 billion yen  each, to let Yamaichi and Nikko be managing underwriters, also.  The underwriting ratio of the three parts total is in the order  of Yamaichi, Nikko, Daiwa, and IBJ Securities.    Nissan's urgent problem is to reduce its interest-bearing  debts. They need to pay off the same amount of debt with funding  from SB's. They chose relatively low-interest commercial paper.  Normally, they should pay off bank loans which have high  interest rates. However, being concerned about offending  financial institutions, they wanted to avoid the change in loan  share.    It was last July when IBJ Securities Co. opened for  business.  It joined the managing underwriter syndicate through SB's issued  by Nissan, Nippon Steel Corp., Tokyo Electric Power Co., and  Fujitsu. It was also able to get into the managing underwriter  syndicate in the issuance of Cosmo Oil Co.'s convertible bonds  (CB's) planned for mid-March.    "We regret that we could not maintain our position as the  managing underwriter." The underwriting manager of New Japan  Securities Co. visited underwriting departments of the four  major securities companies. The purpose of his visits was to  report that their position as the managing underwriter for a  midsized construction company, Oki Construction Co., was taken  by Fuji Bank's local Swiss corporation in the issuance of  foreign currency warrant bonds which is to take place on the  Swiss market at the end of March.    Underwriting of equity financing (funding with new issuance  of stocks) is an area that existing securities companies would  not want to give up. It makes sense that New Japan Securities  went to apologize to other companies in the industry.    This is why securities companies put up strong resistance to  banks' aggressive operation, and corporations caught in between  did not know what to do. Last October, Aichi Tokei Denki Co.  issued warrant bonds in Swiss francs, with a midsized Swiss bank  as its managing underwriter. There also was a twist to this.    Aichi Tokei's main bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, moved  to make its foreign subsidiary the first managing underwriter  for this type of bond issuance. Aichi's managing underwriter,  Nikko, noticed the move and tried to stop them. It sent its  Nagoya Branch manager, Takao Matsui (now a managing director),  and even Takao Nakanishi, a managing director from Tokyo, to  Aichi Tokei. The accounting manager of Aichi Tokei, who was  hurrying to raise funds, did not know what to do.    At last, Aichi decided not to appoint either of them as the  managing underwriter, thus saving face for both Nikko and IBJ.  Aichi's accounting executive talked, looking back, "when a  company has some history, it is difficult to cut off past  relationship completely."    When for the first time IBJ of Switzerland became the  managing underwriter for Riken's warrant bonds in Swiss francs,  three major securities companies except Yamaichi, which had been  Riken's underwriter, refused to join the syndicate and caused  trouble. Despite the fact that Shoji Saotome, managing director  of Yamaichi, tried to persuade Riken to change its plan, Riken  would not change its plan of the issuance. "Even if the four  major securities companies all decided not to cooperate, Riken  would still have gone ahead with the plan" (Mr. Saotome). This  was how strong the tie was between Riken and the Industrial Bank  of Japan.    There were, however, some companies that refused to be  involved in the battle between banks and securities companies,  and that have their own opinions. When Kobe Steel Ltd. issued  Euroyen bonds last December, the four major securities companies  did not join the syndicate, complaining that the fee standard  that was proposed by a foreign corporation of a bank was too low.    Kobe Steel offered a 0.1 percent fee, and IBJ, Dai-Ichi  Kangyo Bank, and Sanwa Bank's London corporations accepted it.  Securities companies suggested a fee of 0.3 percent, and that  the adjustment be made through issuance price, saying that  "accepting a 0.1 percent fee may cause their fee structure to  collapse." However, negotiation was never made.    As a result, Kobe Steel was able to raise funds effectively.  Concerning existing securities companies, they feel that "they  are sticking too much to traditional practice" (an executive).  In the application for domestic SB's issuance registration they  submitted to MOF, Kobe Steel added IBJ Securities Co. to the  four major securities companies in the managing underwriter  candidates column.    Some are raising question about bank tactics that resemble  dumping. In the Euromarket, foreign corporations of Japanese  banks continue to issue bonds with interest levels lower the  market rate.    Last April, Yoshida Kogyo issued SB's in Euroyen, with a  London corporation of IBJ as its managing underwriter. The issue  terms were about 0.3 percent below the market. This issue, which  ignored the market, was refused by investors, and the company  ended up with many unsold stocks. The investors accused them of  "making SB's like loans." Some IBJ members say that they regret  this now.    SB issuers may raise funds with low interest at the time,  however, "they will eventually lose public trust" (Rei Ogino,  managing director of Nomura Securities Co.) if they keep up this  financing method which does not suit the market. It will take a  long time before corporations are be able to effectively raise  funds.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The issuers of SB's in Euroyen for which foreign corporations of Japanese ba-|  |nks were appointed managing underwriters in the period between April and Dec-|  |ember 1993:                                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lead Underwriter                      |Issuers                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |IBJ                                   |Yoshida Kogyo, Nissan Motors, Kobe St-|  |                                      |eel Mfg.                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank                  |Toyobo, Itochu, Ashihara Mfg., Seiyu, |  |                                      |Nissho Iwai, Kobe Steel               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bank of Tokyo                         |Marubeni, Mitsui &amp; Co.            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sakura Bank                           |Mitsui Trading Co., Tostem, Toray Ind-|  |                                      |ustries, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mitsubishi Bank                       |Mitsubishi Chemical, Mitsubishi Mater-|  |                                      |ial, Kirin International, Toda Corp., |  |                                      |Mitsubishi Oil Co.                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fuji Bank                             |Tokyo Tatemono, Marubeni, Canon, Mits-|  |                                      |ui &amp; Co., Nichirei Co., Kao Corp.,|  |                                      | Nissan Motors, NTT, Data Communicati-|  |                                      |on, Taisei Corp., Nippon Seiko        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sumitomo Bank                         |Sanyo Electric, Sumitomo America, Maz-|  |                                      |da, Kao Corp., Hankyu Railway, Sumito-|  |                                      |mo Electric Finance                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Daiwa Bank                            |Osaka Gas                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sanwa Bank                            |Nichimen, Hankyu Railway, Takashimaya,|  |                                      | Nissho Iwai, Nitto Electric Netherla-|  |                                      |nds, Takashimaya International, Kobe  |  |                                      |Steel                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tokai Bank                            |Uny                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Asahi Bank                            |SMC                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Note) Survey by a major securities company                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  [1 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>   [Text] (6) Many Asian Corporations of Japanese  Companies Are Getting Listed on the Local Stock Exchange    "Starting with next year's account settlement, we are  preparing to consolidate the Asia region's settlement of  accounts. Kazuhiko Yamazaki, president of Fujikura Asia (FAL), a  Singapore corporation of Fujikura Corp., a major manufacturer of  electric cables in Japan, began to speak.    FAL is the center for Fujikura's Southeast Asia operation,  approved by the Singapore Government to be OHQ (operational  headquarters), which is granted special tax treatment. By  issuing corporate bonds and taking full advantage of their  location at the financial center, they are to raise low-interest  funds, and to play the role of supplier of funds to production  bases in other Asian countries. Leading the consolidation of the  settlements, they are the "Asian headquarters."    FAL has leased over 0.2 billion yen to Fujikura Federal  Cable  [FFC], a Malaysian electric cable company. FAL has financed 90  percent of the capital to Shukai Fujikura Denso, a producer of  wire harness in Shukai economic special district in China, in  place of their Tokyo headquarters. FAL is funded by issuance of  bonds in Eurodollars and loans from local banks. "Our funds are  raised in the most effective market in Asia" (Mr. Yamazaki,  president of FAL). FAL has established this system without any  help from their Japanese main banks.    With Fuji Xerox added last year, a total of eight companies  have been approved as OHQ. Whether designated OHQ or not,  increasing numbers of Japanese corporations in Singapore are  issuing convertible bonds and commercial paper. This means the  movement to use direct financing is accelerating among Japanese  companies that have gone into Asia.    FFC began full-scale production of optic fiber cable in a  part of Pulai Industrial Park across from Penang Island, which  is known as an international resort. They have already begun  construction of additional facilities. Because Malaysia is  making an effort to improve its communication infrastructure,  the demand for the cable has skyrocketed, and FFC is in need of  major expansion of its facility.    What they came up with to satisfy this high demand for funds  was to get listed on the stock exchange. "We may be able to  apply based on the settlement of March next year," Hideo Sano,  president of FFC, smilingly said.    As of the end of 1992, more than 850 Japanese corporations  have gone into Malaysia. Among these corporations, only a few  companies, such as Matsushita Electric Corporation's Malaysian  operation, are listed on the stock exchange. Under the present  situation where the capital is provided 100 percent by Japanese  parent companies, "there is no benefit to getting listed on the  stock exchange" (Hiroyuki Shirafuji, president of Matsushita  Television, Malaysia). Only 17 companies listed on the stock  exchange have 5 percent or more of the capital provided by  Japanese capital (survey by a local commercial bank).    Recently, however, the trend is changing. The Malaysian  Government has begun to request that Japanese corporations be  listed on the stock exchange. Localization may be to their  advantage in receiving project orders.    Stock markets in Asian countries have grown rapidly, and  their aggregate market value even exceeds that of the Second  Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They have more means of  raising funds than before, and Japanese corporations' local  companies are beginning to be listed on the local stock exchange.    Mitsuo Saito, president of Shanghai Air Conditioner, which  is Sharp Corporation's joint venture, said, "that's the only  way." Shanghai Air Conditioner Corp. began manufacturing air  conditioners last December in the "Hoto Development Area" in  Shanghai, China.    "The only way" is for them to be listed on the stock  exchange. In China, due to monetary restraints, local foreign  corporations are troubled by a shortage of gen. "Business has  gone smoothly this year, and 65 percent of the amount payable is  in gen." They have a big problem.    "We have already consulted some local Japanese companies on  getting listed on the stock exchange," confided Yuichiro Sekine,  Nomura Securities' Shanghai branch office manager." As of the  end of January, 115 companies were listed on the Shanghai Stock  Exchange. Five of them are joint corporations with foreign  capital. "It is a matter of time for Japanese joint companies to  be listed" (a Japanese city bank's Shanghai branch office).    In Hong Kong, Jusco Stores, Hong Kong, which is Jusco's  local  company in Hong Kong, became listed on the local stock exchange.  In Singapore, several companies, such as Mitsubishi  Corp.-related companies, have been listed, starting with Hitachi  Shipbuilding Singapore in November 1992.    Following these movements by corporations, local companies  of  securities companies and Japanese banks have begun a fierce  competition.    The Bank of Tokyo sent its international business  commissioner, Mr. Ryozo Kakitsubo, as an adviser to Bumiputra  Merchants Bankers the end of last year. Bumiputra is the  fifth-ranked commercial bank in Malaysia, and Tokyo Bank is  financing them.    Mr. Kakitsubo's mission was to obtain the position of the  managing underwriter in the Japanese corporations' public  issuance of stocks. Mr. Kakitsubo estimates that "about 20  companies are considering going public." He has been busy  meeting with local Japanese corporations.    Tokio Takezawa, president of Sanwa International Finance  (SIF), Sanwa Bank's Hong Kong securities company, said, "An  increasing number of business trips to Shanghai are being taken  from Japanese banks' Hong Kong securities companies." Nomura  Research Institute, Hong Kong, has employed a special analyst to  study corporations in Shanghai this year.    "Nomura's enemies are not Nikko or Yamaichi. Rather, they  are  the European and U.S. securities companies and Japanese banks'  local companies, such as Sanwa (a securities analyst in Hong  Kong). SIF has had good results in competition for the position  of the leading underwriter in issuance of stocks. This year so  far, only Nomura International (Hong Kong), Nomura Securities'  local company, obtain the position of the leading underwriter.  Japanese securities companies do not seem to be doing well.    This year, within Japan several securities companies have  been established as subsidiaries of city banks, and the time is  about to end when banks could sit peacefully on titles, such as  "main bank" and "leading underwriter". Right now, an opening  match is taking place among banks, securities companies, and  corporations in Asia where the wall of restriction is low, and  the issue is how to respond to corporations' needs.</p>

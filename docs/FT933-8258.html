			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: At the heart of Europe - The dominance of UK firms in a survey of the top 500 Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law firm, has emerged as the leading provider of commercial legal services in Europe, according to a survey of Europe's top 500 companies. UK firms took four of the top five rankings in the survey by Euromoney Research. Linklaters &amp; Paines was second, Slaughter and May third, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, the Dutch firm, fourth, and Freshfields fifth. Respondents to the survey also found the UK the most important jurisdiction outside their own country of head office, followed by Germany and France. That was unlikely to change over the next two years, but they expected the importance of Spain, Italy, Ireland, Austria, Poland, the former Soviet Union and Sweden to increase. In the UK commercial law field, Linklaters was ranked top, followed by Lovell White Durrant, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, and Slaughter and May. There were 185 respondents to the survey, with offices across 20 European countries. The majority said they were increasing the size of their in-house legal departments, mainly to deal with increased volumes of work rather than to cut costs on outside law firms. Corporate finance and joint ventures were seen as the most important areas of in-house legal activity, after core company law and contract work. Banking law, licensing, environmental law and tax were seen as areas of growth activity. The survey shows there is increasing use of international law firms. Almost half of the respondents gave only two-fifths of their work or less to law firms domiciled in the country where their head office was based. More than 43 per cent did three-quarters of their legal work in-house, and respondents expected that pattern to remain the same over the next two years. Some 80 per cent of respondents did at least half of their general company law work in-house. The survey confirms the shift in the method of charging for legal services, and the increased interest in alternative billing methods. Over 40 per cent of respondents still paid for more than four-fifths of their legal work on the basis of an hourly charging rate, with a further 17 per cent stating that between 61 per cent and 80 per cent of their work was paid for on that basis. However, 36 per cent of respondents now required law firms to provide alternative billing methods. Of these companies, 35 per cent had used volume discounts, 30 per cent had received discounts from the quoted hourly rate, 29 per cent had paid multi-stage fees - where the price increases as different stages of a transaction are reached - and 21 per cent had used fixed fees for a job. More than 60 per cent of respondents had increased their expenditure on legal services in the last two years. The survey found the level of fees charged by law firms was not as high as some recent surveys had suggested. A survey by a sister publication, the International Financial Law Review, last year found UK law firms to be the most expensive in the world, charging an average of Dollars 585 an hour for legal advice from a senior partner. After the UK, Germany had the most expensive law firms, with top commercial lawyers charging Dollars 510 an hour, followed by Switzerland (Dollars 445) and Austria (Dollars 385). But the Euromoney Research survey found the highest charge paid by a respondent for international legal work was Dollars 352 an hour and the lowest Dollars 150. The average hourly charge for international work was Dollars 241. For domestic work the top rate was Dollars 320 an hour and the lowest Dollars 161, with an average of Dollars 195. The most highly paid in-house lawyer among the respondents received a total remuneration package of Dollars 420,000 a year. The average annual remuneration for senior in-house lawyers was Dollars 147,721, comprising Dollars 106,064 salary, benefits of Dollars 17,136 and bonus of Dollars 24,521. Junior in-house lawyers had an average salary of Dollars 45,071, benefits of Dollars 6,089 and Dollars 3,208 bonus. Sponsoring or holding lectures and seminars on specialist topics was rated by respondents as the best method for law firms to market their services, followed by proprietary research, cross-selling of other areas of legal practice, and expert articles in the client-oriented press. Most respondents received an average of 17 marketing approaches a year from law firms domestically, and an average of 23 approaches internationally. Only 5.4 per cent of respondents had received offers by law firms of free work for a trial period. In spite of the need to cut costs on legal services during the recession, cost was rated only seventh in order of priorities when choosing a law firm. Companies rated technical ability the most important criterion, followed by domestic capability, understanding of the markets in which firms operated and of the industry's character, senior level support and commercial awareness. Although much has been made of the international expansion of law firms in recent years, most respondents did not consider international presence as one of the most significant factors in choosing a law firm. In selecting a firm for the first time, a recommendation by another company or someone whose opinions carried weight was regarded as the most important factor. Companies also regarded a strong general reputation as important. Only 19.6 per cent of respondents had held 'beauty parades' (where they invited a number of firms to make presentations) when choosing a law firm. Most respondents cast doubt on the value of such methods of selection. Just over 20 per cent of the respondents are headquartered in the UK, followed by just over 10 per cent in Germany and 10 per cent in France. This could partly explain why UK firms were rated much more highly than their continental counterparts. But there seems little doubt that London remains Europe's pre-eminent legal centre, and that UK firms continue to dominate the European legal scene, in spite of the challenge from large US firms, some of which already feature among Europe's top firms. Of the top 50 European firms overall, 23 are based in the UK or Ireland. The move by the Big Six international accountants into legal services is also reflected by the survey. In Spain, for example, five of the top 10 providers of legal services were accountants. Although the survey suggests that size and international spread do not matter, two firms in particular stand out as having benefited both from being bigger and having more overseas offices than other firms. Clifford Chance, arguably the second largest law firm in the world, not only came top overall, but was rated in the top 10 law firms in Poland, France, the Netherlands and the UK. Baker &amp; McKenzie the largest law firm in the world was ranked in the top 10 in no fewer than eight European countries - Belgium, CIS, Hungary, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland - as well as finishing just outside the top 10 in the UK and France. Size is not everything, but when it comes to providing legal services in Europe, clearly it helps.

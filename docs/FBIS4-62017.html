			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS--"Germany remains Russia's major  foreign economic partner," Russian President Boris Yeltsin told  a joint news conference he gave here together with German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday. He reported that "issues  of economic cooperation were also in the focus of attention at  today's talks in Bonn".    Under conditions of a complicated transition period Russia  is  presently going trough, it is difficult to avoid certain decline  in economic ties. "Moreover, most far-sighted economic partners  do not scale down their activity despite the temporary  difficulties confronting Russia. I am confident that we will  manage to overcome them", the president stressed.    "During the talks, we agreed to pay most attention to such  fields of cooperation as power engineering, machine-building,  conversion, support of small and medium-sized business,  especially in the production sphere. We suggested using such  effective instrument of economic relations as non-interest  bearing commercial credit, or the so-called `swing'", Yeltsin  said, adding that "the discussion of trade and economic  relations between Russia and Germany will be continued on the  second day of his visit".</p>

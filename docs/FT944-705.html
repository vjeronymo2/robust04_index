			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Labour urges curb on 'board excess' Labour yesterday outlined proposals for clamping down on what it says are excessive executive salary increases. It claimed that all 12 regional electricity company chairmen had made Pounds 1m out of privati-sation. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the government was 'vulnerable to defeat . . . over the issue of boardroom excesses' during debate on the finance bill. He called for the following proposals to be adopted: Executive share options should be taxed as income. New powers should be given to regulators enabling them to cut prices where there are 'boardroom excesses'. More information should be provided in company accounts on 'pay perks and handouts' to top directors. Remuneration committees should be opened up to make them 'more representative'. Mr Brown said the proposals would force ministers to 'come off the fence on the scandal of salary excesses in the privatised boardrooms'. His attack came as Labour released figures indicating that 63 electricity company directors held share options entitling them to notional profits of an average of nearly Pounds 500,000.</p>

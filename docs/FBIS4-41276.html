			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan June 22 TASS--The Armenian parliament  ratified today a treaty on the legal status of Russian troops  deployed on the territory of the republic. However lawmakers  imposed several conditions. The number and features of the  conditions are not clear so far.    135 MPs voted for the decision, and only four members of the  Armenian Communist Party voted against it. The latter insisted  that the treaty should be ratified without any further  conditions.</p>

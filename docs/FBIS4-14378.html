			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] Tunis -- President Yasir 'Arafat announced that  6,000 Palestinian policemen, accompanied by their families, in  addition to 100 body guards will enter Gaza and Jericho within  the coming three weeks. President 'Arafat, who was speaking at  a Fatah Central Committee meeting in Tunis, said that in the  first stage 25,000 Palestinians will arrive in the self-rule  area.    The Fatah Central Committee meetings witnessed heated  debates  and arguments between Hani al-Hasan on one hand, and Ahmad  Quray' and Hakam Bal'awi on the other. Leaked information  indicates that Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department  and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris economic  talks with Israel, threatened that he will not go to Paris in  protest of Hani al-Hasan's objections to and observations on the  economic talks.    Differences within the Fatah Central Committee extended to  Sakhr Habash, Muhammad Ghunaym, Major General Muhammad Jihad,  and 'Abbas Zaki when they expressed their dissatisfaction over  the current situation, especially following the Cairo accord.    According to Palestinian sources close to the Fatah Central  Committee, the situation inside the committee became more  aggravated after Muhammad Ghunaym, who is responsible for  mobilization and organization in Fatah, submitted his  resignation protesting the decisions about the higher national  authority.    For his part, Ghunaym stressed that he did not submit his  resignation nor was there any mediation for rescinding his  resignation because it did not happen in the first place.    Ghunaym said that this session of the Fatah Central  Committee  meetings is devoted to drawing up the blueprint of the coming  stage in Gaza and Jericho. He added that each committee member  has his own views about this subject and that there were  differences between some viewpoints. He explained that the  Central Committee has not drawn up the final blueprint yet.    Other sources in the Central Committee emphasized that  President 'Arafat expressed his anger at the visit by Mahmud  'Abbas to the United Arab Emirates, stressing that 'Abbas went  there without a decision by the leadership. Faruq Qaddumi, head  of the PLO Political Department, backed 'Arafat on this issue.    The sources said that some Fatah Central Committee members,  including Hani al-Hasan, voiced strong criticism at Nabil  Sha'th's negotiating performance. They said that 'Arafat  proposed to Hani al-Hasan to manage the negotiations with  Sha'th. Al-Hasan told 'Arafat that in the past he had called  for reassessing the negotiating reference point and adopting a  policy of playing off the political blocs and persevering.  Al-Hasan continued: What I said about the multilateral talks  has proven to be true, but unfortunately it was ignored by the  Palestinian leadership.    The Fatah Central Committee meetings will continue until the  final perception of the Palestinian self-rule authority is drawn  up.    It has been learned that President 'Arafat is disappointed  with the Israeli position, which has engrossed the PLO in  details while failing to broach the extent of the self-rule  authority's powers.</p>

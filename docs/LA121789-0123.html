			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY METAL BANDS AT AMPHITHEATER  </P> <P> I feel that the issue of volume, not curfew, should be raised concerning the  Pacific Amphitheatre. Many concerts, especially those of heavy metal bands, are  extremely loud and are capable of injuring a person's hearing.  </P> <P> A curfew will not help control the noise the residents of the area are  complaining about.  </P> <P> JOSH DeWITT  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

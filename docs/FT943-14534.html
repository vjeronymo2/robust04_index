			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Political Notebook: The race for second place It has not been what you might call an exciting contest. Everyone except Mrs Margaret Beckett's friends seems to know that Mr Tony Blair will be crowned Labour leader next week. He professes in turn to be neutral as to whether Mrs Beckett or Mr John Prescott is installed as his deputy. He has a point. The obsession of Westminster insiders with nominal hierarchies has persuaded commentators that the deputy's post is a vital one. There will, after all, be at least half-a-dozen Tuesdays or Thursdays every year when Mr Blair will be away hobnobbing with the great and the good abroad. The deputy then will have to face Mr John Major across the Commons despatch box. This is an awesome task. The truth is otherwise. The few hundred voters who catch on television the occasions when the understudy quizzes the prime minister doubtless will have views about Mr Prescott's rhetorical style or the colour of Mrs Beckett's outfits. The rest will regard the choice of runner-up as irrelevant. Mr Blair will not be an all-powerful leader. After the internecine warfare in the 1980s Mr Neil Kinnock's invaluable legacy was a party ready once again to listen to the leadership. Attentiveness however is not the same as subservience. The new leader will secure real control when he wins a general election. His starting point though will be stronger than that of the late John Smith or Mr Kinnock. The election will be as near-as-dammit democratic. Shadow cabinet colleagues believe he has a real chance of ending up in 10 Downing Street. They want to sit round a real cabinet table. So they will behave. But back to the contest. Mrs Beckett has emerged as the candidate of the party's we-mustn't-betray-our-principles tendency. Never mind that her views changed somewhat between her infamous denunciation of the treachery of Mr Kinnock in 1981 and her ready acceptance a decade later of John Smith's offer of the deputy's job. Now she has rediscovered her radical roots. She has said little about policy, preferring instead to stress her experience. In a party still over-subscribed with male chauvinists she has emphasised the need for a balanced ticket. But the overall tone of Mrs Beckett's campaign has been unapologetically that of the blinkered left. She has spoken of the need to sweep away the Tory union laws, of re-nationalising the water industry and of ridding Labour of the obsession with costing which has stifled its ambitions. So most in Labour's hard-left Campaign Group have been trailing after Mrs Beckett as if she had never jettisoned a principle in her life. Never mind that before the last general election she stripped the manifesto of spending pledges. Doubtless Mr Blair assumes that if Mrs Beckett wins she will rediscover the virtues of modernism. The Conservatives, of course, want Mr Prescott to win the deputy's post. He may well do so. Mr Prescott has been followed around for the whole of the campaign by a little man from Tory Central Office clutching a tape-recorder. The basement of Smith Square, we are told, is already crammed with evidence of the rash pledges and policy contradictions uttered by Mr Prescott. Then there is the promise of more 'gaffes' when he is quizzed by the media during the election campaign itself. The trouble is there is no longer much mileage for the Conservatives in the look-what-he-said-then approach to politics. Look what they once said about taxes and about the European exchange rate mechanism and the European Union and you will understand why. Anyway, few Tories understand Mr Prescott and most underrate his intelligence and political skills. He does have an acute sense of Labour's history. It is also fair to say his burning ambition for full employment has not caught up with the painful realities of a global economy. But he has moved on since his days as a steward on Cunard liners turned him into a union radical. Mr Prescott does not belong to the Labour tradition which thinks it is the job of the party to make life comfortable for the workers on the factory floor. The language may be different, but Mr Prescott shares Mr Blair's view that the job of socialism is not to patronise the working classes but to provide them with escape routes. Nothing is too good for the workers. Some say that if he had not drifted into Labour politics, Mr Prescott would have made a personal fortune as a northern entrepreneur. Many of his friends in Hull have done just that. He might even have ended up voting Conservative. Mr Prescott would regard that last comment as libellous (but would never sue). He is irritated still by the easy confidence of Mr Blair and his friends among Labour's 'beautiful people'. His weakness is his unpredicatability - but as deputy to Mr Blair he would be loyal. That counts.</p>

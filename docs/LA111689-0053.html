			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL NEWS: STUDENTS SEE GOVERNMENT AT WORK  </P> <P> More than 250 students attended the Claremont City Council meeting Tuesday. Why  the large turnout? It was part of Youth and Government Day for Claremont and  San Antonio high schools.  </P> <P> Seniors from government and economics classes were required to attend the  two-hour meeting. Some sat in cliques. Some talked with friends. Others asked  the council questions about the conditions of city roads and youth activities.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Diann Ring said she wanted students to attend the meeting because  they should become more aware of local government.  </P> <P> "Most of these kids are going to be voters," she said. "This is where you can  really make a difference. The youth brought it to our attention that the most  under-served group in the city are the youth."  </P> <P> The meeting started at 1 p.m., during the fifth period. Many students left to  attend their last class before the meeting was over.  </P> <P> One of the few who stayed to the end was Aytek Celik, 16, who had never  attended a City Council meeting. She said she stayed because she was interested  to see what happens at the meetings.  </P> <P> "I wanted to see how they deal with the formal procedures," she said. "It gives  the students insight to see what happens."  </P> <P> Celik, who said she may go into politics as a career, said she was more  interested in international politics.  </P> <P> But, "you have to start somewhere," she said.  </P> <P> This was the second year high school students attended the meeting. Council  members hope to make it an annual event. LUZ VILLARREAL  </P></p>

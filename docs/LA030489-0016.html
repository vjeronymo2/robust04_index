			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD STUDENTS OBJECT TO ATWATER TRUSTEE ROLE  </P> <P> About 2,000 students, protesting the selection of Republican National Committee  Chairman Lee Atwater as a trustee of Howard University, took over an auditorium  stage Friday, forcing officials to move a convocation that included  presentation of an honorary degree to comedian Bill Cosby.  </P> <P> Cosby was a scheduled speaker at a ceremony marking the founding of the  predominantly black university 122 years ago. Police reported no arrests.  </P> <P> The students' comments indicated they identified Atwater with controversial  ads, during George Bush's presidential campaign last year, featuring Willie  Horton, a murderer who attacked a Maryland couple while he was on furlough from  a Massachusetts prison. The Horton issue contributed "to the rising anti-black  sentiment of the American people," said a spokesman for students who organized  the protest.  </P></p>

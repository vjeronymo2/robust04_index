			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Nine die as clashes erupt in Algeria CLASHES between the security forces and supporters of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) yesterday erupted in towns across Algeria after Friday prayers. At least nine people were reported killed and scores injured. The clashes were the most widespread and violent since the suspension of elections nearly one month ago, after FIS candidates won 47 per of the popular vote. The eastern capital of Constantine, the western seaport of Oran, Setif, Tebessa, Sidi Bel Abbes and Tlemcen all witnessed violence. Police and soldiers encircled mosques in FIS strongholds at dawn in Algiers but this did not deter FIS militants from protesting for the fifth Friday in succession. Two died and ten were wounded in the capital after dozens of gendarmes swept down streets firing shots to dispersedemonstrators. Black smoke was seen rising from FIS strongholds in Algiers, as fundamentalists lit bonfires of used car tyres and built makeshift barricades. Last night, police and soldiers were holding hundreds inside Kouba mosque in Algiers demanding that a fundamentalist who read an FIS communique before prayers be turned over. The French Interior Ministry said yesterday Mr Tedjini Haddam was resigning from Algeria's five-man presidency. Mr Haddam, rector of the Paris Mosque, had received complaints from France's Moslem community that the two posts were incompatible.</p>

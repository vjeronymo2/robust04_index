			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: UK should direct 'more aid to poor' Britain should progressively reduce its use of aid in pursuit of political and commercial interests and direct a greater proportion towards poverty alleviation programmes, argues a report published today. A study by the London-based World Development Movement says that there has been a significant fall in British aid going directly to the world's poor in the past five years. Over the same period, there has been an increase in aid spent on British consultants and industry. The report also criticises the level of UK aid. Between 1980 and 1992 Britain's aid to sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, fell by 2 per cent in real terms, when for all donors there was an average increase of 55 per cent. The UK aid budget has fallen to two-thirds of the 1979 level as a proportion of GNP, and by 12.5 per cent in real terms, according to the report. It notes that Britain is the sixth largest aid donor after Japan, the US, France, Germany and Italy, but in 1993 UK aid amounted to 0.31 per cent of GNP. Using this yardstick, it was 13th out of the 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development aid donors. Technical co-operation - consultants, training and research and development at UK institutions - provides the bulk of the project aid. The remainder is used to win commercial contracts, such as the Pergau dam in Malaysia under the aid and trade provision (ATP). Although spending on agriculture has risen by 40 per cent in the past five years, it still received less than 8 per cent of total project aid in 1992-3. In that year, says the report, 'three times as much was spent supporting British companies working in agriculture through the ATP, than on direct financial assistance to farmers'. Almost half of Britain's bilateral aid from 1987-8 to 1992-3 was spent on technical co-operation, says the report, including the ATP. Funding for non-governmental organisations is included in this budget and took up little over 10 per cent of the total in 1992-93.

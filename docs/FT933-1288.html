			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Falling champagne sales hit earnings at LVMH LVMH, the French luxury goods group and a leader in the troubled champagne industry, yesterday cautioned of a fall in net profits for 1993. The warning followed the announcement of a 28 per cent fall in interim profits, from FFr1.29bn (Dollars 228m) in the first half of 1992 to FFr935m in the same period this year. The group, which owns some of France's most prestigious brand names - including Hennessy cognac, Louis Vuitton luggage, and a 24 per cent stake in the Guinness drinks group - saw its shares fall 4.1 per cent to FFr3,924 following the announcement. Mr Bernard Arnault, who became chairman of LVMH in one of the fiercest takeover fights of the 1980s, this summer warned of a slightly smaller fall, of 25 per cent, in interim profits. He had also hoped the group would be able to maintain profits for the full financial year. The situation in the champagne sector has since deteriorated. LVMH yesterday confirmed it had lost FFr100m on its champagne business during the first half, and that its contribution from the Guinness stake had fallen 26 per cent due to sterling's weakness against the French franc. As a result, it said, it was 'unlikely' to achieve the same level of profits in 1993 as last year. Ms Joanna Clapp, an analyst at Hoare Govett, forecast a fall in LVMH's net profits, from FFr3bn in 1992 to FFr2.73bn this year. 'There should be a pick-up in earnings next year,' she said. 'But the improvement will be for technical reasons, such as lower restructuring and financial costs and the impact of stronger sterling on the conversion of the Guinness contribution. Trading will still be difficult.' The group saw total sales rise from FFr9.68bn in the first half of 1992 to FFr10.03bn at the interim stage this year. However, the tough trading climate and adverse exchange rates took a toll on operating profits, which slipped from FFr2.35bn to FFr2.03bn. The main area of difficulty for LVMH was wine and spirits, where pressure on the profitability of its cognac sales in Japan added to problems in the champagne sector. The drinks division's operating profits fell from FFr1.26bn to FFr867m between the two first halves, on sales down from FFr4.44bn to FFr4.36bn. The luggage business mustered an increase in operating profits, from FFr890m to FFr968m, on sales of FFr2.33bn against FFr2.43bn. Perfumes and cosmetics were affected by heavy promotional expenditure. This was in spite of the momentum of recent launches, notably Christian Dior's Dune and Givenchy's Amarige. Operating profits slipped from FFr330m to FFr326m on sales up from FFr2.54bn to FFr2.86bn.</p>

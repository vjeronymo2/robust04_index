			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Organics_Nonwastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The Universal Treatment Standards Promulgated in Today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is promulgating UTS for organics in nonwastewaters as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed with the exception of the standards for m- and p-cresols. These are the only organic constituents for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters provided data supporting changes to the proposed UTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although organic nonwastewater UTS differ in some cases from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously promulgated standards, the same technology basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion, can meet the limits. In the previous standards as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as the UTS, the organic standards are based on a detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level in a combustion residue (adjusted upward by a variability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor accounting for analytic and process variability). Differences between UTS and previous standards reflect a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent assessment of achievable detection levels for various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents in combustion residues, and continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievable using BDAT, combustion. Because the essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical issue at the heart of these adjustments is the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the detection limit, most of these changes reflect analytical artifacts rather than absolute differences in the quantities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxics available for release following land disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ii. Modifications to Universal Treatment Standards Made in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A petroleum refiner involved in building a biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment system submitted data on organic nonwastewaters, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated their concern about the lower treatment standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain organic constituents that were proposed as UTS. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency evaluated the commenter's data and found, in some cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenter was requesting that UTS levels be set at levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher than the maximum levels in their untreated wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the commenter's data did not represent proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring. The Agency was able to determine from their data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that one limit, the proposed m- and p-cresol limit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be raised from 3.2 mg/kg to 5.6 mg/kg. This adjustment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on other factors described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed UTS for m- and p-cresol was 3.2 mg/kg, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differed from the proposed UTS for o-cresol, which was 5.6 mg/kg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule promulgates 5.6 mg/kg for both o-cresol and m- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p-cresol. The proposed limits for cresols were based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection limit of 2 mg/kg for o-cresol and 1 mg/kg for m- and p-cresol from an incinerator ash study used to develop nonwastewater standards in the Third Third rulemaking. The differences in detection limits occurred because EPA used different treatment tests to set the limits for o- versus m- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p-cresol. Examination of the same test runs revealed that where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> o-cresol had a detection level of 2 mg/kg, the detection level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for m- and p-cresol was also 2 mg/kg. In addition, where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection level for m- and p-cresol was 1 mg/kg, the detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level for o-cresol was also 1 mg/kg. Upon further review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other data, the Agency observed that within a test, o-cresol and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m- and p-cresols had the same detection levels. The numbers for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> o-cresol and m- plus p-cresol promulgated in today's rule were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated with the same detection limit, as justified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data review, and the same recovery factor. The resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical treatment standards reflect the fact that incineration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treats both of these isomer groups to the same level, within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing analytical constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> iii. Use of Alternative Treatment Technologies to Combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In establishing numerical treatment standards, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows the use of any technology (other than impermissible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilution) to comply with the limits. Some previous standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> namely those for petroleum refining wastes, were based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion as well as thermal desorption and solvent extraction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under UTS, organic nonwastewater standards are based on and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievable by combustion. As for other technologies, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed whether the changes in limits disrupted commitments made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use these other technologies. With regard to thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desorption, EPA examined comments on the proposed levels by three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;vendors of thermal desorption units (Seaview Thermal Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (STS), Separation and Recovery Systems, Inc. (SRS), and Ecova  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (formerly Waste Tech Services)), BDAT Background Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documents for treatment standards applicable to petroleum wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Marathon delisting petition, and other available literature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These data demonstrate the achievability of UTS by thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desorption for petroleum refining wastes. This was an expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, given the comments on the Phase I LDR rule which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed F037 and F038 petroleum refining wastes. In these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, a thermal desorption company called for limits lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than today's UTS limits (these data reflected lower detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels, not necessarily better treatment than today's UTS). Also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important in the use of thermal desorption are the operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions: raising the temperature, and/or the detention time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the amount of hazardous organic constituents desorbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for solvent extraction, the data used for development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the K048&hyph;K052 treatment standards achieved UTS levels for about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> half of the demonstration runs. Operating conditions, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent selection, solvent to waste ratios, detention time, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of treatment passes significantly affect treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results, and the agency believes these parameters can be adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with the UTS. There may, however, be other factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which result in this technology not being selected, and based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information available to the Agency, no petroleum refining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are utilizing solvent extraction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requested comments on the achievability of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTS for petroleum refining wastes when treated via noncombustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies. (See 58 FR 48106&hyph;48107.) EPA also requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on whether the industry has invested in non-combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, including those designated as BDAT in previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules that cannot meet the UTS. In particular, EPA requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the type of treatment, performance data, and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation of why existing treatment could not be adjusted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated more efficiently to comply with the UTS. EPA also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out it was willing to revise the proposed UTS, if data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that appropriate noncombustion technologies could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve slightly higher levels than those proposed for UTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one commenter, Valero, Inc., submitted comments with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to a contractual agreement for the construction of a full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale bioslurry reactor and data from a bench scale treatability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study. None of the other petroleum refining commenters indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they had invested in noncombustion technologies. Valero, Inc.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and two remediation companies, Retec Technologies and OHM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, submitted data on biotreatment of organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents. They reported treatment efficiencies from 40 to 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for some PNAs and questioned whether the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards can be routinely achieved by biotreatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies. EPA does not generally consider such treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiencies adequate for organic constituents. As indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously, facilities can use any technology other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermissible dilution to comply with the treatment standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If design and operating conditions can be adjusted to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits, this could be full compliance. If not, the technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may still be appropriate for remediation wastes, for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are currently being revised in the development of HWIR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Lessons in Customs and practice - In a nutshell UK companies will in future take more responsibility for managing the Customs' regulations which apply to exports and imports.

Help for businesses with the implications of self-regulation and with the setting-up of control systems will be provided at a one-day seminar on July 2 to be run by accountants Grant Thornton, Customs and Excise and the Department of Trade and Industry. Contact Grant Thornton. Tel 071 383 5100. Fee Pounds 176.50 inc VAT.</p>

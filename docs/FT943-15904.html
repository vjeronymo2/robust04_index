			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Political Notebook: Time to make common cause on pay and jobs Let us get one or two things clear. The debate about the relationship between jobs, pay and benefits will not go away. Politicians cannot ignore the structural shifts in the economy which are driving down the wages and the employment opportunities of the unskilled. But sound-bite politics and complex economics make uneasy bedfellows. The debate will become a serious one only when politicians recognise that neither the market nor government alone offers simple solutions, and when they address the electorate in terms which illuminate rather than obscure the arguments. Take the fashionable phrase of the moment. When Labour leadership contender Mr Tony Blair or chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke say they are committed to full employment they are deliberately not speaking the language of the average voter. Of course both would likely the sort of economic revival that delivered a job to everyone who wanted one. But all they are promising is the formulation of the 1944 white paper - a high and stable level of employment. Whatever that is. Next the minimum wage. The government insists that any interference in the rates of pay set by the market is anathema. Depending on what day of the week it is, ministers proclaim a minimum wage would price hundreds of thousands or even millions out of work. They omit to add that the government already imposes a floor on wages - or more accurately a series of floors - through the benefit system. In-work benefits have removed the 100 per cent marginal tax rates which used to apply to those on the bottom end of the income scale. But if an individual is guaranteed, say, Pounds 120 a week in income support, housing benefit and council tax rebate he or she is hardly like to jump at a job paying Pounds 100 a week. Then there is Mr Blair's commitment to a minimum wage. The pledge apparently is inviolable. But he will not put a figure on it and certain groups - young people being the most obvious one - are to be excluded. Mr Clarke is promising to square one of the circles. He is looking in his November Budget to an expansion of in-work benefits such as family credit. His reasons are partly political - the government needs a carrot to put alongside the stick of tougher rules for unemployed claimants when the new Job-seekers' Allowance is introduced. But in the chancellor's mind benefit supplements for those on low wages allow the government to meet its social obligations without destroying jobs by re-regulating the labour market. He calls it combining US-style economics with European-style social policy. Of course, it is not as simple as that. Just as the benefit level blunts market forces, so too do income supplements. Family credit allows employers to maximise profits by keeping wages below the level the market would otherwise force them to pay. In some cases in-work benefits simply prolong the life of uneconomic businesses. Taxpayers employed by more efficient companies provide the subsidy. But perhaps we should be glad that Mr Clarke's faith in the free market falls short of his public pronouncements - and, incidentally, that Mr Blair sees the role of the welfare system as providing a path out of dependency. The political priority of both parties should be to get many more of the unskilled unemployed back into work. A few ideological inconsistencies are a small price to pay. An extension of in-work benefits from parents to single people and a more gradual tapering of the rate at which the support is withdrawn as recipients move up the income scale will provide some but not all the answers. There are other perversities in the tax and benefit system which make a mockery of incentives by subjecting the low-paid to effective tax rates of 70 per cent or 80 per cent or by preventing them from taking part-time work. Remedying that will be expensive in the short-term and will lead to predictable howls from the Tory right about the numbers of people on benefit. More fundamentally, the economy needs a better-educated workforce and a higher level of productive investment to provide the capacity for a faster growth rate. Finding the right mix of market forces and government action to achieve that ambition remains the subject of serious and legitimate disagreement between the two main parties. But there should be common cause about the need to do more now to provide an escape from dependency for the present generation of under-educated, unskilled workers. Mr Blair and Mr Clarke should tell us for once they agree.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Housing market recovers strongly: US figures reflect fall in mortgage rates A STRONG recovery is under way in the US housing market following reductions in mortgage rates this year to the lowest level in two decades, figures indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department said housing starts rose by 2.7 per cent last month and by 14 per cent in the year to October. Officials revised up already strong figures for starts in August and September. Building permits also rose, pointing to continued strength of starts. Most analysts expected only a marginal increase in starts last month given big increases earlier this autumn. Starts are now running at an annual rate of 1.4m, the highest level since February 1990, when the previous business cycle was approaching its peak. Most of the strength was concentrated in 'single family' homes, which rose 5.8 per cent from September. Construction of apartments remains subdued, reflecting overbuilding in the 1980s and fewer young people seeking first homes. The increase in starts was strongest in the Midwest, where rebuilding after flooding contributed to a 13.3 per cent increase from September. Starts rose only modestly in the west, because the Californian economy remains depressed, and fell in the northeast. The starts figures are the latest in a series of economic statistics indicating that the pace of US economic growth is accelerating after a weak first half. Starting in the new year, changes in the way the US Labour Department estimates unemployment will increase the official jobless rate significantly. On the new definition, the jobless rate averaged 7.6 per cent in the year to August, compared with the published figure of 7.1 per cent. Officials said the female jobless rate had been seriously under-estimated because many women seeking work had been wrongly classified as 'homemakers'. Using the revised series, the female jobless rate was 6.8 per cent in the year to August, not 6 per cent as previously reported. The new unemployment series is likely to increase concern on Capitol Hill about lack of job opportunities and harden opposition to any early move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. The new series will come into effect with the release on February 4 of unemployment figures for January and could increase the January jobless rate by anything from 0.1 to 1 percentage point.</p>

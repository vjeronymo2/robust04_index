			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Number of share owners falls 1.2m THE NUMBER of personal shareholders in the UK has fallen by 1.2m in the past year, Richard Waters writes. This is the first decline since the boom in share ownership created by the privatisations of the 1980s. About 9.8m people now own shares, compared with 11m a year ago, according to the Treasury's annual survey of share ownership conducted with ProShare, the wider share-ownership group. The number has fallen in spite of the privatisations in the past 12 months of the electricity generating companies and Scottish electricity companies, and the sale of a substantial stake in BT. It means the proportion of adults in the UK owning shares has fallen from 25 per cent last year to 22 per cent this year. According to the survey, conducted by NOP, 14 per cent of adults in Britain own privatisation shares, the same proportion as last year. The proportion of adults owning shares in the companies for which they work has remained stable at 4 per cent.</p>

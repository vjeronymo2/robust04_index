			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sweden moves to negotiate Procordia deal THE SWEDISH government has appointed a two-man team to negotiate with Volvo over the future of Procordia, the country's food and pharmaceuticals company in which the state and Volvo are the main joint owners. These are Mr Johan Gernandt, the solicitor responsible for the recent liquidation of Sweden's state holding company, Fortia, and Mr Tony Hagstrom, the general director of the country's telecommunications utility, Televerket. This follows the government's rejection of the proposed SKr38.7bn (Dollars 6.6bn) deal to merge Procordia with Volvo. Despite an angry public exchange of letters on Thursday, Volvo's executive chairman, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, and Sweden's prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, seem keen to reach a settlement over Procordia as soon as possible. Procordia is going ahead with a restructuring plan to make its organisation better focused to meet market demands in Europe.</p>

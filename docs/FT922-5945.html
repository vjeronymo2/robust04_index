			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Arts: Oedipus rex The London Philharmonic Orchestra and the male half of the LP Choir delivered a high-octane performance of Stravinsky's 'opera-oratorio' on Tuesday: sung by a group of first-rate solo singers, riproaringly delivered by orchestra and chorus, and highly worrying. The conductor was Franz Welser-Most, the LPO's music director, who here evidenced only the faintest familiarity with the tenets of Stravinsky style. A sudden unlicensed spurt on the accelerator pedal halfway throught the granitic opening chorus was a warning sign that proved all too timely. For, throughout the work, Mr Welser-Most sought speed and noise, surface show and drama at the expense of plain musical intelligibility. It is quite a feat to drown out a bass as naturally powerful as John Tomlinson, the Creon, but conductor and orchestra managed it - as indeed they did the quadruple 'Divum Jocastae' cries of Peter Coleman-Wright's potentially impressive Messenger. Stravinsky's score works its lapidary magnificence through the exact place and change of gesture and scene, through the cutting edge of 'antique' harmonic and textural invention. In this slam-bang reading, which paid scant attention to the timing of sentences and paragraphs, to letting air into the sound, the magnificence largely went missing. Anthony Rolfe Johnson's agile, liquidly lyrical, emotionally forceful Oedipus, Marjana Lipovsek's bronze-toned Jocasta, the authoritative Shepherd of John Mark Ainsley and Tiresias of Alastair Miles, and the elegantly matter-of-fact narrator Lambert Wilson deserved better. Earlier, the programme had offered Young Uck Kim's scrupulously musical but small-scale account of the Prokofiev First Violin Concerto, and a simply frightful La Valse as concert-opener - un-Ravellian in coarseness of loud sound, utterly lacking in wit and irony, a linked series of firecracker climaxes rather than (as the composer imagined) a 'fantastic and fatal whirling'. Mr Welser-Most is young and hugely talented, but at the head of one of London's big orchestras, the handicaps of his inexperience become ever more widely exposed. Royal Festival Hall. (Concert under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, sponsored by Commercial Union).</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Less than sum of its parts Subsidising coal mines is barmy. Permanent handouts to a dirty industry in long-term decline are indefensible in any economy. In a free market the very idea is inexplicable. Adding yet further subsidies would be positively wicked. The purpose of keeping pits open is said to be to save jobs. This is true, but it is fear of losing ministers' jobs, not miners', that motivates the government. There are 20 men and two women in the cabinet. A Pounds 500m a year subsidy works out at a save-the-job contribution from taxpayers (or electricity consumers) of very nearly Pounds 23m per minister per annum. That is a definition of value for money that even Lambeth borough council might question. The actual cost of the backhander, which Mr Michael Heseltine is expected to announce in a few weeks, may be less than Pounds 500m. The latter is merely a figure floating in the air. Yet the president of the Board of Trade maintains that coal is already supported to the tune of Pounds 1bn a year. It is not clear whether he is proposing to add to that huge sum, or merely not subtract from it. Either way, he may be obliged to limit the largesse he contrives to transfer from the general population to workers in an industry that should have been shut down long ago. We do not yet know. We are told that no final decision has yet been taken. That is what most politicians say when they are scared witless by the prospect of being seen to have settled on any of a set of disagreeable options laid out on a list before them. In this instance one of the virtues of delay is that the debate can be held in semi-public, by means of leaks, innuendoes, working papers and parliamentary select committee reports. Meanwhile, Mr Heseltine can do what he is best at. He can soften up public opinion. The entire process is a crutch for scaredy-cat decision-making. The government is free to choose. Choose what? Not the best energy policy. That is not what it is looking for. It is seeking the cheapest, most trouble-free, most survival-proof package that its back-benchers can be persuaded to accept. This explains why the cabinet has been engaged in what most of us would call a squabble, but Mr Major prefers to look upon as a discussion. Over the weekend those prolific midwives, Ms Inspired Rumour and Ms Purposeful Kite-flying, appeared to assist in the birth of a new consensus. If this holds we will be obliged to pay a political bribe to the coal industry for the next five years, that is, beyond the next election. The select committee on industry prefers a two to three year payout. As a small consolation, the subsidy will be reduced each year. The air will hum with promises. Half or more of the pits scheduled for closure last year will be 'saved'. There will be much talk of a new energy policy. The eventual result, we will be assured, will be a self-financing, privatised coal industry. The chimneys of power stations that use its products will emit Chanel No 5. It is all short-sighted nonsense, supported by four voluminous studies commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry and published last Friday. The only piece of foresight in any of these tomes is the last sentence of the report on markets for coal prepared by Caminus Energy Ltd. 'The advantage which gas has over coal would be further enhanced if carbon taxes were imposed in order to meet environmental goals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,' says Caminus. The consultants might have added that the optimum medium-term strategy for coal is to stop mining. This view is supported by the evidence in a slim discussion paper on climate change published by the Department of the Environment just before Christmas. The purpose of that document, presented with some glee by the environment secretary, Mr Michael Howard, is to initiate a debate on how Britain can reduce its CO output. The government is committed, by its signature in Rio last year, to bring emissions of the main greenhouse gas down to 1990 levels by the year 2000. President Bill Clinton made the same promise in his campaign literature. Mr Howard's paper notes flatly that '96 per cent of the UK's man-made carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy use'. It makes further telling points. Generating electricity from gas produces about half as much CO per unit as does coal. A carbon tax would be 'likely to have the greatest impact on energy use by industry'. Such a tax has been proposed by the European Community. It is likely to be considered by the new US administration, especially with Vice-president Al Gore around to make his case. Mr Howard, who is one of the ministers who might conceivably succeed Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor, has, however, ducked the issue. Alluding to the whole package of possible government measures to reduce CO emissions, his paper intimated that decisions will be taken in the light of whatever Mr Heseltine gets away with on coal. A similar po-faced neutrality informs the environment secretary's paragraphs on transport. These show that the worst offender, in CO terms, is road traffic. Public transport creates fewer emissions per passenger kilometre than private cars. The lessons are apparent. Do not commercialise the railways in such a manner that train services are likely to be further reduced. Charge more for petrol, as the Americans eventually will. Introduce toll roads. Use taxes and perhaps tradeable permits to reflect the true environmental costs of various forms of transport. You can easily deduce most of this, although not in such stark terms, from Mr Howard's little tract. Yet the principles implied do not figure in the government's thinking. The cabinet is preoccupied with the necessities of survival in mid-recession. A parliamentary majority of only 21 and a sorely divided party have emasculated it. The prime minister has '21' engraved on his forehead. Do not get me wrong. I think that Mr Major will sit in Downing Street for many more years. I acknowledge his government's persistence with its sensible education and health reforms, while regretting its inability to think beyond the troubles on its backbenches. The rest is gloom. For we are saddled with a government of which it must be said that the whole is less than the sum of the parts.</p>

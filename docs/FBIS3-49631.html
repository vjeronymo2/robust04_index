An  international news conference, at which Peter Boross and Arpad  Goncz talked about their meeting with the American President and  the Visegrad Group, ended a short while ago. Peter Nyaradi  reports:    [Nyaradi] The American partner has unexpectedly extended its  previous position. First of all, the new element is that they  are willing to give more significant economic support to us,  Prime Minister Peter Boross pointed out at the beginning of his  summary of the day. Besides this, during the regional and  bilateral meetings in Prague, Peter Boross said, the Partnership  for Peace was seen as a good plan; that Hungary expected more is  another issue,, but this is reality. However, it is a good  thing that as regards NATO, thoughts can already be given to the  concrete tasks of the plan provided by the Partnership for  Peace. In connection with this plan Peter Boross said the  following:    [Boross] "This is the program of a newly elected president  who is to be the president of the United States for another four  years. Obviously, he wants to fulfill his first foreign  political program of great significance. This is encouraging.  We would be less optimistic if the president had proclaimed  such a program when he only had, let us say, six months to go.  We see a chance and we see that it is not possible to adopt a  position in these questions with unrealistic ambitions. We also  see that extremes and extreme wishes which are impossible to  fulfill do not create a good impression."    [Nyaradi] Regarding the bilateral meetings with leaders of  the other Visegrad countries, the head of government said that  during his talks with Vaclav Klaus, first of all the problems of  the free trade zone was discussed. Peter Boross also added that  it creates bad feelings if a country pushes itself to the  forefront too much. It is no sin that all politicians protect  the interests of their own country, but to overemphasize them  may result in the danger of the action missing its target. Many  questions were discussed with Slovak Head of Government Meciar.  Although there are topics on which there is no harmony, this  cannot be an obstacle in, for example, the development of  economic cooperation between the two countries.    On the matter of Bos [Gabcikovo power station] and the  minority question, both countries stuck to their own opinion.  The Hungarian party also said that the system of individual  rights in Slovakia is was good, however, many individuals  already represent collective interests [as heard].    The Polish-Hungarian meeting took place without any conflict  and difference of opinion, Peter Boross evaluated.    President Arpad Goncz said the following about this  extraordinary day today and about the negotiations:    [Goncz] "I start by saying that these negotiations consisted  of bilateral and regional meetings. This was an indication of  the fact that the United States is not non-committal and does  not seclude itself; its commitment towards our region is  unchanged. Its presence is a key issue from the viewpoints of  the continent's stability and of the positive U.S. influence.  The conditions for European stability are the U.S. presence,  NATO's ability to act, NATO's extension, and a stable central  Europe -- since security, the security of Europe is indivisible,  and central Europe should not be a gray zone, a security vacuum.  Russia and Ukraine, which are in the process of  democratization, also represent conditions of stability, as do  good relations between the United States, NATO, and central  Europe and Russia."

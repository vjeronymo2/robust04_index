			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Bosnia peace talks resume at the UN A FURTHER round of Balkan peace talks opened at the United Nations yesterday, with UN and EC mediators due to hold separate meetings with the three main parties. A spokesman for Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen voiced optimism that all parties to the conflict would be brought together before the end of a 'crucial' week. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who came to New York on Sunday ignoring the threat of a human rights lawsuit, was the first to call on the mediators. Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croats' leader, made an appointment and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic sent a message he was leaving Washington for New York and would be available for a meeting last night. UN officials were elated the talks were under way after more than three weeks. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the mediators, said they 'continue to feel they have the three parties close to agreement, and with sufficient leverage applied by governments day to day, it could be wrapped up'. If the parties left New York later this week without agreement it could be hard getting them together again.</p>

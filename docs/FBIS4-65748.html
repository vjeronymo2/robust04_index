			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tension has again risen in Greek-Albanian  relations because the [Albanian President Sali] Berisha regime  brought very serious charges against six North Epirus persons  who are members of the Omonoia organization. Specifically, the  Albanian authorities filed charges against six North Epirotans  that could even result in the death penalty for so-called  espionage, separatist acts, and contacts with the Greek  intelligence services. [passage omitted]    In a statement today, New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis  Evert  called on all political and social organizations to mobilize  overseas in order to exert pressure on the Albanian Government  to free the six Greek Albanians, who are being held  unjustifiably and illegally. The Greek Government should deal  with the indictment of these Greek Albanians in a strong manner  through diplomatic avenues, Evert stressed. The opposition  leader also stressed that the Foreign Ministry should mobilize  all Greek ambassadors and international organizations to this  effect. In conclusion, Evert underlined that next week New  Democracy deputies will go to international organizations  related to human rights to brief them and inform international  public opinion.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Suncrush posts fall in sales volumes at halfway stage Suncrush, South Africa's authorised bottler of Coca-Cola and Schweppes soft drinks, suffered a decline in sales volumes in the half-year to December 31 which was masked at the pre-tax level by a sharp improvement in investment receipts. Although sales revenue improved to R317.4m (Dollars 92m) from R296.7m, sales volumes at the Natal-based company shrank 3 per cent as consumption was knocked by a company price increase in January last year, added to a 25 per cent increase in excise tax, the introduction of VAT, sluggish consumer spending and the impact of township violence on Suncrush's market. Mr Robin Hamilton, chairman, said Suncrush would expect real growth in demand in the current six months were it not for the uncertainty surrounding the country's first non-racial elections in April. He said: 'Question marks must hang over business prospects around the election, with the probability of political stayaways hitting consumption of our products and productivity at our plants.' Operating income rose to R53.1m from R49.1m before investment income improved to R5.46m from R2.8m and interest charges declined to R1.2m from R4.07m. Pre-tax profit jumped to R57.3m from R47.8m. Distributable profit rose by nearly 30 per cent to R38.1m, equivalent to 25.5 cents against 22 cents a share, after the company's 50-for-one share split in late 1993. The interim dividend is raised to 4 cents from 3.4 cents.</p>

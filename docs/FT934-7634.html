			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Employers remain hostile to work-sharing idea: Companies and economists have cast doubt on the latest plan to tackle rising unemployment THE renewed interest among European governments in work-sharing as a means of combating unemployment has been greeted with scepticism, if not downright hostility, by many of Europe's large employers. 'It is tinkering with the symptoms, not dealing with the disease itself,' says Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of the European employers' body, UNICE. Such scepticism is shared by many labour economists, but it is unlikely to stop momentum building up behind the idea. Interest in work-sharing tends to revive when unemployment is high, but has usually been confined to parties of the left. But this time there are signs of support for work-sharing from centre-right governments in western Europe - France and Germany in particular - and, crucially, a tentative readiness on the part of workers to countenance pay cuts in line with cuts in working time. One of Europe's largest companies, Volkswagen, for example, is currently discussing with its employees plans to cut working time, and pay, by a fifth to avoid reducing its workforce from 100,000 to 70,000 by 1995. VW is not necessarily a typical employer: the voice of labour is perhaps stronger at the company than elsewhere because of the strong three-way relationship between VW, IG Metall, the German engineering union, and the Social Democrat-led state government of Lower Saxony, where the company is based. But the VW case illustrates that work-sharing takes many different, and often familiar, forms. The VW plan is a dramatic form of short-time working introduced in response to a slump in demand and designed to prevent the loss of jobs rather than to create new ones. Most large manufacturing companies in Europe occasionally revert to short-time working when orders fall. Placing employees on short time is usually cheaper than lay-offs because it is often subsidised by the state and there is no cost in terms of lost skills. Another important way in which individual working time has been reduced and employment spread among more people is through part-time work, which has grown rapidly, especially in Britain and the Netherlands, in the 1970s and 1980s. But employers appear to dislike the idea, being promoted by some governments, of reducing the working time of full-time workers, by, for example, cutting one day per week, in order to create more jobs. The French senate, for example, has recently approved proposals to give companies a 40 per cent cut in social charges if they move staff to a four-day week and increase their payroll by at least 10 per cent. 'Of course we all worry about unemployment,' says one British employer, 'But it is not our function to create jobs. We must concentrate on being as competitive as possible, and these proposals will make competitiveness more difficult.' Mr Peter Reid, of the British Engineering Employers' Federation, says the idea of work-sharing cannot be dismissed out of hand, but he is sceptical about whether unions will agree to corresponding cuts in pay. Mr Steve Palmer, of the Confederation of British Industry, also says that even if workers did accept pay cuts the result would not be neutral for unit labour costs. 'There are all sorts of hidden head-count costs from having a larger workforce doing the same amount of work - the extra training, the cost of recruitment, and so on,' he says. Mr Tyszkiewicz of UNICE points out that employers would have to buy more equipment if they took on more workers on a shorter week. Supporters of shorter working hours acknowledge some of these difficulties but argue that these extra costs would be a legitimate subject of state subsidy, especially if the state is going to save on unemployment benefit. Ms Pam Meadows, director of the Policy Studies Institute in London, says the state could pay a one-off subsidy, for example, for taking on an extra person. Supporters also claim that productivity would improve if people were working only four days per week. Mr Tyszkiewicz disagrees, saying he believes productivity would actually suffer. It is easier for governments to encourage work-sharing in the public sector than in the private sector. The government of the Netherlands has done so by decreeing that no new employee in the public sector will work more than 32 hours per week. European unions may not like the choice, but work-sharing could be an important test of their commitment to the principle of solidarity.</p>

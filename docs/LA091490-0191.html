			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BURNS, 94, STILL LOVES SHOW BUSINESS  </P> <P> By 11 a.m., George Burns is sitting in his Hollywood office, schmoozing on the  phone and finishing off cigar No. 3.  </P> <P> He's just nixed an offer to work with Bob Hope in Australia for five weeks.  "Too tough," he explains. "I'm 94. I faint twice a day, sometimes three times a  day."  </P> <P> A long pause, then the gravelly, smoke-filled voice breaks into laughter.  Although he lacks a stage and a large audience, the elder statesman of comedy  can't help but turn a phone conversation into a joke fest.  </P> <P> On being interviewed: "It's very nice to be 94 years old and get out of bed to  be interviewed. At 94, you can't make any money in bed."  </P> <P> On the new comedians: "You mean the younger kids like Milton Berle and Danny  Thomas? Oh, they'll all make it."  </P> <P> During his 86 years in the business, Burns has become known as the  self-deprecating master of the one-liner, a best-selling author and  Oscar-winning actor. But the show-biz legend offers one simple reason for his  success.  </P> <P> "I love show business," he says. "That keeps me going. Lemme tell you  something, and this goes for all your readers: Fall in love with what you're  going to do for a living."  </P> <P> For Burns -- whose real name is Nathan Birnbaum -- the love affair began in  1904 on New York's Lower East Side. His father had died, and the 8-year-old,  born ninth of 12 children, wanted to earn extra money. After selling  newspapers, running errands and shining shoes, he found his real calling:  performing. With several friends, he formed the Peewee Quartet and combed the  streets looking for people willing to shell over a coin for a song.  </P> <P> By age 14, Burns had left school for vaudeville.  </P> <P> He tried impersonations, trick roller skating and Latin dancing, and even  played in a trained-seal act.  </P> <P> "I was very lucky," he recalls. "In those days, there were places to be bad.  There are no places to be bad today. The only place you can play today is the  comedy clubs and the Johnny Carson show. But in vaudeville in those days, they  had thousands and thousands of theaters. . . . When I started in show business,  it would take you seven or eight years to play every theater. And I was bad for  a lot of years, but I didn't think I was bad. . . . I thought the audience was  bad."  </P> <P> Burns' luck changed when he teamed up with an unemployed Irish-American actress  named Gracie Allen. She played the scatterbrain; he was the straight man. "I  was able to think of the things, and Gracie was able to do them," he says.  "That's what made us a good combination."  </P> <P> After performing together for three years, the couple married in 1926. Over the  next 36 years, they made movies, created a legendary radio show and TV program,  and formed their own multimillion-dollar production company.  </P> <P> "Before I went on the stage to work with Gracie, I used to walk out by myself  to see which way the wind was blowing so the smoke from my cigar didn't go in  Gracie's face," Burns recalls affectionately. "If I blew smoke in Lucille  Ball's face, she'd blow it back. But . . . Gracie, she was very fragile. She  weighed about 95 pounds, dainty and beautiful."  </P> <P> After Allen's death from a heart attack in 1964, Burns submerged himself in his  career -- going on to win an Oscar for his supporting role as an  ex-vaudevillian in "The Sunshine Boys," playing God in the movie "Oh, God" and  its sequels, and penning numerous bestsellers, including "Gracie: A Love  Story," an affectionate memoir about his wife and their marriage.  </P> <P> He still lives in the Beverly Hills home the couple shared and visits Gracie's  grave once a month. "I talk to Gracie sometimes. I tell her a joke, but she  doesn't laugh. She's heard them before," he says.  </P></p>

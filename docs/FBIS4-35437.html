			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alon Ben-David] </F>   [Excerpts] What is happening in the negotiations with  Syria? Not much. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today dismissed  as total nonsense reports that he had told Egyptian President  Husni Mubarak that Israel would agree to implement a full  withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Rabin was speaking before the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Rabin added that  in his opinion, the United States had exhausted its role in the  negotiations with Syria and expressed the assessment that the  talks in Washington would not resume. [passage omitted]    The prime minister opined that the Syrians would not  continue  the talks in Washington. Incidentally, Mr. Rabin said that the  talks held in Washington so far had led to nothing. Rabin also  sent a message to the Americans: I believe that Washington has  already exhausted its role with regard to the Syrian track, he  said. Israel, however, continues to have an interest in  occasional visits by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I  am neither pessimistic nor optimistic, the prime minister  concluded.    The Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem were also  discussed  at the session. We are currently preparing a list of all the  Palestinian institutions and examining the issue not on the  basis of goodwill but rather from the viewpoint of the legal  measures at our disposal, Rabin said.

			<p>11, 15-18, 23-25, 29, 31 Mar; 1, 5-6, 8, 12 Apr 94 -- FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> 942A0139A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article in 43 installments: "Profile of </F> Financial Authorities"]  <H5>  [5 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Policy Planning Bureau/Planning  Division--Creating Market for Nonperforming Loans, Creating New  Directions for Debate    In recognizing the importance of stabilizing the financial  system, even as part of Japan's economic recovery plan, the  public has wanted to know more about those at the helm.  Financial authorities like the Ministry of Finance [MOF] and the  Bank of Japan [BOJ], both of which have a role in formulating  and implementing government policy and supervising Japan's  financial institutions, have thus become the subject of growing  interest. This series presents a honest profile of those  agencies, introducing readers to their personnel, organization,  and policy-making structures.    When the decision was made on 21 September 1993 to lower the  official discount rate, the seventh in the Bank of Japan's  history, BOJ's released statement referred to what it called "an  unprecedented low interest rate" ("somewhat an exaggeration,"  according to Governor Yasushi Mieno of the central bank) and  became the subject of much discussion within financial circles.  The announcement was drafted in the Planning Division of the  central bank's Policy Planning Bureau.    Manipulations of the official discount rate stir up a great  deal of interest not only at home but in other countries. As  recently shown, when people reacted to the central bank's action  as a "lowering of interest to save the banks," the public often  refuses to take BOJ's explanations literally, and generations of  planning division heads have had to put a great deal of thoughts  and labor into drafting such announcements.    The Planning Division is where the basic direction for the  bank's monetary policy is formulated and is considered BOJ's  "brain center." The division formulates important policy on  matters such as the official discount rate on the basis of  information gathered from each bureau and branch office. Because  of its importance in policy formulation, the division is  considered a "gateway to success" within the bank for those who  become division chiefs. Of those currently in the leadership  ranks of the organization, many have at one time or another  headed the Planning Division, including Governor Mieno (Class of  1947 [year in which he entered BOJ]) and central bank director  Toshihiko Fukui (1958). Masaaki Shirakawa (1972), who currently  heads the division, was chief of the Credit Systems Division for  three years and was appointed to his present post May 1993 after  handling a number of difficult cases, including [the dissolution  of] Toyo Credit Bank.    In addition to monetary policy, another important area of  concern for the Planning Division are measures to stabilize the  financial system. It is studying the problem along with the  Credit Systems Bureau and Operations Bureau.    At a lecture given at the end of 1993, Governor Mieno  touched  on the need to free up the flow of credit, citing the example of  the United States. He was thus planting the seeds for what has  become a lively debate on the merits of establishing a market to  buy and sell nonperforming loans. In other words, an idea  planted by the central bank has started people to think in a new  direction. This too is the work of the Planning Division. Its  job is to put together the ideas that are officially presented  later by the central bank governor at press conferences, or at  lectures, or in reply to parliamentary interpellation.    Also, under the Planning Division are various deliberative  bodies, including the Fiscal System Council, the Securities and  Exchange Council, and the Financial Problems Forum. Thus,  division members are in frequent contact with private-sector  banks and those in other ministries and agencies to exchange  views. The situation, says Division Chief Shirakawa, "hardly  gives them any time during the day to sit down."  <H5>  [6 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Policy Planning Bureau/Coordination and  Public Relations Divisions--Setting Up a Same Day Account  Settlements System    The goals of the Bank of Japan, as defined in Article 1 of  the Japanese Banking Law, are to regulate the money supply,  control currency, and maintain and foster the credit system. For  the Coordination Division of the Policy Planning Bureau--a  division which examines the appropriateness of new operations to  BOJ's objectives and then contacts and coordinates its actions  with departments and agencies within and outside the central  bank--Article 1 provides the most important rationale for  whatever it undertakes.    By "coordinating" a matter after it has been studied and  examined means making adjustments that are necessary for it to  be in conformity with various rules and regulations that are  pertinent to the bank's mission, including the Japanese Banking  Law, articles of incorporation and bylaws. Of course, a wealth  of knowledge about existing systems and regulations is required  of staff, and the division is fully represented by those who  have successfully passed the national law examination.    Last year, the division grappled with the task of converting  the domestic exchange settlement system (All Bank System) into a  system of same day funds and preparing the way for government  bond accounts to be settled on a cash on delivery (or delivery  versus payment [DVP]) basis. In either case, these are recalled  by Division Chief Chikanobu Mori (1972) as "measures to respond  to fluctuations in assets and the transactions of financial  institutions."    The division is also responsible for carefully checking  contracts between BOJ and outside groups when, for example, a  computer system is introduced or equipment and furnishings are  purchased. In other words, its members carefully watch if there  aren't any mistakes in internal matters or in those related to  outside agencies.    The Public Relations Division was inaugurated in May 1990  when the Information Division, which until then had been in  charge of general information, was reorganized as a window to  the bank for other information organs. Its main work is to 1)  arrange press conferences and interviews with the bank governor,  2) assist in collecting news and information about the bank and,  3) disseminate information and answer inquiries about the  central bank. The third to head the unit since its  reorganization, Division Chief Yasuo Nakayama (1976) notes that  the BOJ has "recently been getting a lot of foreign media  coverage."    As the recession drags on, the public has grown more  critical  of the central bank. As division chief, Nakayama wants to get to  understand the sentiments and views of the public through closer  contact with the mass media. At the same time, he wants to make  the BOJ's views and policies more accessible to the public and  "to build a two-way relationship."  <H5>  [7 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Credit Systems Bureau/Credit Systems  Division--A Group Well-Versed in Laws and Regulations    The Credit Systems Bureau was born (in May 1990) out of the  first large-scale organizational reform to be undertaken since  the BOJ was founded. The Credit Systems Division, a pivotal  component in the bureau, was formed when the maintenance of  credit systems, until then under the divided charge of the  General Affairs and Bank Examination Bureaus was made the  responsibility of a single, newly created division. Behind this  move was the failure of a series of financial institutions in  the United States and concern about the stability of Japan's own  financial system.    A new unit, which is headed by Eizo Kobayashi (Class of  1992), still only the second division chief it has had. He came  to his post May 1993 after heading the Bank Examination Division  to replace his predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa (1972), who headed  the Credit Systems Division for three years before becoming  division chief in charge of the Policy Planning Division.    As Kobayashi notes, "there seems to be no end in sight to  what we still have to learn from other countries." As his words  suggest, one of the division's priorities is to look into  deposit insurance systems in other countries as case studies and  to research financial regulatory systems at home and abroad.  Therefore, the division has a group of people, including a  Havard Law School graduate, who are very well-versed in law  within the BOJ.    Also under the division's charge is the Committee of Bank  Supervisors for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  From the start, the division has been involved in creating  specific measures to deal with BIS's capital-to-asset ratio  requirements, which were adopted by Japanese banks from March  1993.    With plans to introduce a second set of regulations (market  risk regulations) intended to address risks with fluctuations in  the exchange and stock markets, the division has born part of  the responsibility for creating new regulations while taking  into account the views of Japan's financial institutions.    Since the division was formed, it has handled cases using  the  deposit insurance system when financial institutions have gone  bankrupt, including mergers and aquisitions of Toho Mutual  Savings and Loan Bank by Iyo Bank and of Toyo Credit Union by  Sanwa Bank and the liquidation of Kamaishi Credit Union. It has  become an important function of the Credit Systems Division to  carefully the activities of financial instititutions and prevent  trends from developing which might disrupt or cause creditors  and depositors to lose confidence in the financial system.  <H5>  [11 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Credit Systems Bureau/Settlement System  Division--Eliminating Inter-Bank Settlement Risks    One day, somewhere in the world, a bank fails and a  financial  institution in Japan, operating in a different time zone, finds  it cannot recover the payments due on its loan. With the  internationalization of financial markets and their  computerization, the risk of nonpayment because of a lag in  settlement dates caused by time differences or inadequacies in  the system has grown and has become a concern for financial  authorities throughout the world.    That worry became justified in July 1991 when financial  authorities in Europe and the United States suddenly froze the  accounts of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)  due to their discovery of bank irregularities and misconduct.  Repercussions were felt in Japan, when Nippon Kogyo Bank, which  had been doing yen-dollar transactions with BCCI, reported a  loss of about $30 million.    "A fairly strong sense of crisis took hold," recalls Hajimu  Mizuno (1975), who currently heads the BOJ's Settlement  Division. At the time he had just been transferred from the  Information and Computer Systems Bureau to the Policy Planning  Bureau's Coordination Division. Fearing a domino effect, the BOJ  asked financial institutions in Japan to stay calm and, in  effect, the incident passed without causing a major disruption  to Japan's financial system. Rather, according to Mizuno, the  BCCI incident "gave Japan's financial institutions a chance to  realize, first hand, the importance of being able to respond to  settlement risks."    While endeavoring to eliminate these risks, the Settlement  System Division tackles the job of putting together plans and  measures that will enable Japan's settlement system to operate  with stability and efficiency. Mizuno assumed his current post  as division chief last May and is highly regarded for his skills  not only in responding to the BCCI incident but also in  developing and putting into operation the central bank's  [computer] network which enables accounts with private financial  institutions to be settled immediately. A number of those in his  division took part in developing this network, and with today's  rapidly advancing technology at their command, they form a  management team, which is highly skilled in the latest  technology, to anticipate failures and risks inherent in their  system.    Until last spring, private financial institutions, which had  been using the system of next-day settlements (All Bank System)  for domestic exchange accounts, changed to a system of same-day  settlements. It was this division which was urging the necessity  for such a change at the time, arguing that "the key antidote to  risk was reducing outstanding balances on account." Based on  plans drawn up by this division, the BOJ is also targeting the  end of this fiscal year to introduce a DVP [delivery versus  payment] system for government bonds, which would make it  possible to receive payment for such bonds at the time they are  surrendered or the delivery of bonds at the time of their  purchase.    However, the kind of problem that surfaced in the BCCI  case--the lag time in settlement dates for yen-foreign currency  transactions--still has not been resolved. "We still have a lot  to learn," says Mizuno. Apparently, this division's battle  against risk will be continuing for awhile.  <H5>  [12 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Financial Division--On  the Backline in Lending, on the Frontline in Restructuring    In the Financial Division of the Bank of Japan's Operations  Bureau, there is a tacit understanding: If the division chief  plans to be away on a long holiday, he is to indicate where he  can be reached; in principle, vacations outside Japan are to be  discouraged. The Financial Division stands on the frontlines of  Japan's efforts to restructure its financial system.    Among the central bank's various roles, the one that falls  to  the Financial Division is that of "final lender." The division  is in close contact with each of the financial institutions  which have current accounts with the central bank and keeps a  close, daily watch on their activities. City bank officials  shrug their shoulders. "Whether you get financing or not is  ultimately up to the Financial Division," says one.    Before being reorganized in May 1990, the General Affairs  Division, which is in the Operations Bureau, was responsible for  the day-to-day regulation of financial markets, but the job of  supervising the flow and absorption of funds for these markets  as a whole now falls to the Markets Division. This division,  too, is in the Operations Bureau. The role of the Financial  Division is to decide what to do about lending to individual  financial institutions.    Important, along with regulating the fund raising activities  of individual financial institutions, is the work of analyzing  trends among financial institutions with regard to lending and  deposits. "Window guidance," the practice whereby the BOJ  determined lending limits for each bank, was abolished in July  1991, but it is still necessary to monitor the activities of  each bank in terms of how funds are absorbed and invested.    With the problem that has developed with regard to  nonperforming loans, another important role for the division is  responding to anxieties about the financial system and being  able to prevent any future disruptions to the settlement system.  A special team was formed last year to carefully monitor trends  among nonbanks and companies specializing in housing loans,  sectors which have been hard hit by nonperforming loans.    The reorganization of divisions was also an opportunity to  shift the job of monitoring the international affairs of banks  from the Foreign Division to the Financial Division. The aim was  for this division to be able to monitor the domestic activities  of individual banks as well as their activities abroad. Also  coming under the charge of the Finance Division is the job of  determining the soundness of the collateral offered by city  banks when the BOJ extends credit to them.    The head position in the Financial Division, like the head  position in the Planning Division, is considered a star post for  aspiring bureaucrats. Eiji Hirano (Class of 1973), who  represents the third-generation of division chiefs to head the  financial unit, feels that "in addition to developing the  banking sector's future image, it is necessary to create the  kind of environment that fosters competitiveness among banks."  He says he would like to see "financial deregulation bring out  more diversity and individuality among banks."  <H5>  [13 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Securities  Division--Groping Its Way Toward Structural Reform in the  Capital Market    In December 1992, the Bank of Japan released a report titled  "Regarding the Functions of the Stock Market." Its position, for  the first time directly broaching the subject of stocks, sent  ripples through the market community. The report, which pointed  out the importance of the stock market as a way of restraining  the behavior of firms, was co-authored by the Securities  Division (Operations Bureau) together with the Research and  Statistics Bureau. The analysis of the capital market by the  Securities Division became the rationale for Governor Mieno's  proposal last year for creating a market for the sale and  purchase of nonperforming assets. After the conspicuous failure  of capital market to function adequately following the collapse  of the economic bubble, there has been more attention than even  before on the Securities Division.    The 18-member division is located on the second floor of the  BOJ building between offices occupied by the Markets Division  and the Financial Division. Following the panic on the  securities market in 1965, it was finally elevated to its  present divisional status in 1968; it was formerly the  "securities desk" in the bureau's General Affairs Division. The  Operations Bureau's current setup, with its Markets Division,  Financial Division, and Securities Division--is the result of  the organizational reform that was undertaken in 1990. Because  there are strong ties between these three divisions, two members  of the Securities Division also work in the Markets Division.    The Securities Division collects information from securities  firms with which the bank does business and monitors the ability  of the capital market takes in and absorbs the central bank's  directives. At the same time, its role is to pick up signals the  market sends out and to input them into policy decisions.  Compared to the Markets Division, which follows the market on  daily basis, the Securities Division's role is to focus its  attention on medium- and long-range problems. It guards a broad  territory, and besides making recommendations to improve the  system--for example, rationalizing corporate bond  transactions--the division handles the job of assessing the  market value of collateral securities when the bank loans out  money. It also decides on suitable collateral.    Just as the Financial Division superintends bank operations,  one of the duties of the Securities Division is to monitor the  operations of securities firms. Its top priorities, however, are  policies aimed at restructuring the market and other such  macro-level analyses. Division Chief Nobuo Inaba (Class of 1974)  says that, when the average price of listings on the Nikkei  suddenly nose dived soon after he assumed his post in May 1992,  the question constantly on his mind was "what cause the sudden  drop and what could be done about it," he recalls. Compared to  the money market, the capital market--to the degree that it is  less within the reach of the government arm--seems for those at  the central bank to be where the market principle has been taken  in and assimilated to a greater degree.    With a strained smile, Inaba refers to the report released a  year ago on the stock market. "We were told by those who work  at securities firms," he says, "that matters are never that neat  and clean." It looks as though it will be awhile yet before the  Securities Division's goal--to build a better system in order to  revitalize the capital market--will be able to actually change  the real world.  <H5>  [14 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Operations Bureau/Markets  Division--Monetary Regulation on a Day-to-Day Basis    When the Nikkei average suddenly fell to the 15,000 yen  level  at the end of November 1993, the Bank of Japan promptly moved to  increase the supply of funds to financial markets and urged  lowering of the interest on unsecured next-day call [loans].  Lower interest rates then spread to the 3-month CD market and,  in December, were linked to a 0.375 percent drop in the  short-term prime rate offered by city banks. In other words, by  regulating the money supply, the central bank was carrying out  an easy-money policy and trying to apply brakes to falling stock  prices. The unit responsible for carrying out monetary  regulation on a day-by-day basis is the Markets Division in  BOJ's Operations Bureau.    The money market may be short of funds one day and  oversupplied the next. In order to smooth out these bumps,  monetary regulation sees to it that funds are supplied to or  absorbed by the market. When funds continue to be slightly on  the oversupply-side, it is taken as a sign of easy money.    Minoru Masubuchi (Class of 1966), a consultant to the  Operations Bureau, is the man currently responsible for monetary  regulation. "I'm still doing the same work I did when I was  young and in charge of such matters," he says wryly. With  increasing progress being made toward deregulation, interest  rates on bank deposits and on loans have come to respond  sensitively to the slightest monetary adjustment, and such  adjustments have taken on an even greater importance. The  short-term money market, where the central bank makes its  adjustments to the money supply, is also becoming more tightly  interconnected with the stock, securities, and foreign exchange  markets.    Although all three divisions are under the Operations  Bureau,  it is the Markets Division that is becoming more closely tied to  day-by-day monetary regulation and to monetary policy (for  example, changes in the official discount rate) than the  Financial and Securities Divisions. The Markets Division is  under the overall supervision of Toshihiko Fukui (1958), a BOJ  director who is also in charge of policy matters for the central  bank. Both the Financial and Securities Divisions are under the  charge of BOJ director Kunio Kojima (1960).    An accurate understanding of the financial markets is  indispensable when determining monetary policy. Members of the  Market Division, which has been called an "information  switchboard," are on the telephone with financial institutions  even before the markets open, assiduously trying to decipher  even the slightest market trends. Division Chief Masanori Tanabe  (1975), who took his post last May, says, "With the market  expanding and transactions becoming more complicated, it is  important, so as not to lose sight of the market's view on  interest rates, to at least keep an open mind to the market's  rich, diverse texture."  <H5>  [18 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Bank Examination Bureau/Bank Examination  and Management Divisions--Looking for Sound Bank Management    "There was more commotion around here than we've ever seen."  This is how Bank Examination Division Chief Yasuo Mizota (Class  of 1972), a nine-year veteran of the bureau, characterizes last  year in retrospect.    Certainly, it was a year to jolt the Bank Examination  Bureau's equanimity. In January, it was reported that  information from the bureau's examination of Mitsubishi Bank  documents had gotten into other hands, perhaps leaked, and the  bureau chief was penalized with a drop in pay. Then, again in  October, several newspapers reported the same thing happening in  the bureau's examination of Fuji Bank's documents. The BOJ  denied the allegations, but interest has grown in its  information management system.    Despite these events, it is also true, however, that in the  midst of noticeably worsening bank profits, bank examinations  are becoming increasingly important as a way of checking the  soundness of bank management. "We must earn the people's trust  by carrying out our business rigorously," stresses Mizota.    The bureau's examiners are sent into the field to do on-site  inspections and, in so far as they check for trouble spots, are  like the Ministry of Finance's banking inspectors. One  difference is that the MOF inspections are mandatory since the  ministry has supervisory authority over the banks. The BOJ's  examinations, on the other hand, assume a relationship of trust  between the central bank and the financial institutions which  are its customers. Again, unlike the MOF's inspections, which  are made without prior notice, the BOJ's examinations are  scheduled one month in advance.    The Banking Examination Division actually carries out the  examinations, to carry out the examinations, which are scheduled  once every two-to-three years and usually last about three  weeks. They are intended to give an accurate picture of the way  banks are being managed and include interviews with bank  officers and department heads, an inspection of the  administrative operations of branch offices, and an inspection  of bank documents.    More recently, the emphasis has been on bank's risk  management system. This is because banks are now subject to more  complicated, high-tech risks. In addition to the appearance of  so-called derivatives (financial derivative commodities), for  example, banks are turning increasingly to computer systems.  Thus, there are also efforts within the Bank Examination  Division to upgrade skills through staff training courses taught  by its more experienced members.    The Management Division collects data related to a financial  institution's management, including information on its profit  situation. This information is collected on a regular basis and  helps examiners during their site visits. Again, division  members work closely with the Credit Systems and Operations  Bureaus to consult on restructuring plans for financial  institutions and then follow up on their progress. According to  Division Chief Masahiro Sumikawa (Class of 1972), it is  important, in order to maintain the stability of the financial  system, to be able to see things through the eyes of the private  sector. That attitude, he says, is something he wants his  division to maintain.  <H5>  [19 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ International Bureau/General Affairs,  Foreign Exchange Divisions--Central Bank's Intervention Task  Force    "The Bank of Japan [BOJ] is only one of many participants in  the foreign exchange market. It can't control everything that  happens." The speaker, the man who heads the International  Bureau's Foreign Exchange Division, is Hirohisa Hashimoto (Class  of 1974). Every day finds him hard at work trying to maintain  "dialogue with the market."    It is the Foreign Exchange Division chief who leads in the  troops when the central bank decides to intervene and influence  the exchange rate. When Hashimoto stepped into that position  June 1993, every passing day seemed to be boosting the yen to  another record high, and it wasn't unusual for him to be  awakened late at night by an overseas caller. Though daily  exchanges of information with the Ministry of Finance  International Finance Bureau's Foreign Exchange Division might  be expected, quite unexpected was the volume of calls, day and  night, from overseas central banks in New York, Germany, and  other countries.    Despite of heroic efforts to intervene by selling off  several  billion dollars in yen currency, the exchange rate went $1 =  100.40 yen on 17 August, thrusting the yen to the threshold of a  new era. Two days later, on the 19th, however, the Federal  Reserve Bank in New York intervened to stop the massive selling  of yen and somehow prevented the exchange rate from breaking  through the 100 yen per dollar mark. Hashimoto managed to escape  a serious crisis in his battle with the market.    Qualified to act as the Minister of Finance's  representative,  the Foreign Exchange Division has the authority to intervene and  buy or sell yen through the Foreign Exchange Fund Special  Account. There are many ways to intervene. Depending on the  situation, there may be efforts, for example, to "boost" the  exchange rate level or to use some "behind-the-door" method. The  Foreign Exchange Division will also undertake analyses of  foreign economies with the primary aim of influencing exchange  rates or investing in foreign markets using funds from Japan's  foreign currency reserve.    The job of coordinating activities within the International  Bureau, including the Foreign Exchange Division, falls to the  General Affairs Division. It is headed by Fumiaki Kimura (Class  of 1972), who likens his division to "the BOJ's international  strategy task force." Its work concerns laws and regulations,  such as the Foreign Exchange Control Law, as they pertain to  negotiations with foreign countries and agencies like the  Ministry of Finance. It also concerns official pronouncements by  the Bank of Japan governor--at meetings of the foreign ministers  and central bank governors of the Group of Seven Nations (G7) or  at Bank for International Settlements (BIS) meetings of central  bank governors.    As Division Chief Kimura has also been expending a great  deal  of his energies recently in establishing and maintaining  relationships with Asian countries. In the past, economic  diplomacy has been directed mainly toward Europe and the United  States. This "Asia effort" means broadening Japan's economic  ties with its more immediate neighbors through technical  assistance and meetings with the heads of the central banks of  some 11 Asian nations, including those of China and Southeast  Asia. Last December, BOJ officials were also dispatched to  Vietnam and Kyrgyzstan. Rather than the kind of bilateral ties  that now exists between Japan and the United States and Japan  and Europe, Kimura says his dream is to move toward  "establishing multinational ties."  <H5>  [20 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ International Bureau/International  Financial Division, Investment Division, Balance of Payments  Division--Struggling with Derivative Commodities    There is a theory--the "Age 35 Rule"--that says financial  derivatives, which require a command of higher mathematics, is  beyond the understanding of those past their mid-thirties. The  International Financial Division's job is to look into these new  products and devise the rules that will help eliminate the risks  associated with them. For example, in the case of forward rate  agreements (FAA), where the two parties involved agree on the  interest rate to be paid at a future date, there is a question  as to whether or not such estimates of future rates are a form  of illegal gambling. Those in charge are charting new and  unfamiliar territory, looking into laws and regulations, both  national and foreign, they may never have imagined existed, and  trying to understand if there are any market risks in such  products.    "It's all Greek to someone like me, who is past 35," says  Division Chief Shinichi Yoshikuni (Class of 1973). "But the  younger ones look on this new area as a challenge." His staff,  which (unusual for BOJ) includes a graduate of Tokyo  University's Engineering Department, is wrestling with a problem  that has become an urgent concern for every central bank in the  world. Staff members here are also responsible for studying the  economic situation in regions throughout the world.  International specialists, some with experience working with the  International Monetary Fund, are Asia- and U.S.-watchers,  studying to see where the economies of these countries are  headed.    The International Balance of Payments Division, on the other  hand, collects microeconomic data regarding foreign countries  and trade. Last August, for example, when the yen suddenly  started to gain in value, the division held fact-finding  hearings to address such questions as the impact of the stronger  yen on export profits and on corporate plans to restructure or  invest in plants and equipment. Staff members are constantly in  touch with trading companies and manufacturers to put together  figures on the balance of international payments. Their  particular field is the collection and analysis of industrial  data. Up-to-the minute information of this kind is then used as  the basis for monetary policy decisions as it was last September  when the official discount rate was lowered.    Another pressing task before the division is to revise, for  the first time in 30 years, [the type of data it gathers for]  its statistics on the balance of payments. Japan's statistics  are singled out as being behind-the-times by foreign critics.  Says Division Chief Takayoshi Hatayama (Class of 1973), "We want  to restructure our statistics to reflect the trend toward  securitization that has emerged and toward more services like  lease transactions and get a better grasp of the money flow."    The Investment Division is entrusted by the minister of  finance to superintend administrative matters concerning foreign  exchanges such as the notification of receipt of foreign direct  investments. With more and more progress being made toward  internationalization, investment activities are getting more  complicated every year. Understandably, Division Chief Kazuo  Taneda (Class of 1972) is determined that his office will  "respond with speed, clarity, and accuracy."  <H5>  [21 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Business Management  Bureau/Divisions--Processing Data, Managing the Shop    The Bank of Japan's image is closely tied to its role as a  policy organization, which implements monetary policies (for  example, by manipulating the official discount rate) and  measures to maintain and foster Japan's credit system. However,  as its name implies, it is also a "bank."    The Business Management Bureau bears the responsibility for  carrying out that role. Michiaki Morita (Class of 1972), who  heads the General Affairs Division under this bureau, says of  his goal: "As a banker's bank, we should be able to settle final  accounts with the same ease that a fish takes to the water or  bird takes to the air." His division is in charge of "regular  business," as written in Article 20 of the Banking Law and is  responsible for laying the groundwork which will facilitate the  implementation of policy.    One of the Business Bureau's main jobs is processing and  managing data. For example, the bank handles 30,000 transactions  (receipts and payments), the equivalent of 300 trillion yen,  each day in its business with financial institutions which have  current accounts with the bank. It also handles 3,600  transactions, the equivalent of 15 trillion yen, a day in  settling government bond accounts. Again, as the National  Treasury, it handles 500,000 transactions, or 4.5 trillion yen,  per day in the receipt and disbursement of national funds such  as annual pension funds.    Data concerning these transactions are quickly processed by  four divisions: the Settlement of Accounts Division, the  National Treasury Services Division, the National Treasury  Accounting Division, and the Government Bonds and Securities  Division. "Needless to say, the work in these divisions is very  exacting," says Katsutada Akiyama (Class of 1974), who heads the  General Coordinating Division. "They bear very heavy  responsibilities."    With the installment of BOJ's computer network in 1988, it  has been possible to effect large-scale rationalization in areas  such as the settlement of bond accounts and transfers between  current accounts. For disbursements of national funds, however,  magnetic tapes are sent from the Ministry of Finance's  accounting center, and on the basis of these tapes, itemized  lists and portfolios are drawn up and distributed to financial  institutions on a daily basis. Thus, the bureau is studying the  possibility of switching in 1995 to computerized data processing  in this area as well.    The Market Affairs Division puts monetary adjustments as  specified by the Markets Division of the Operations Bureau into  effect. It is through this "window," opened to private-sector  financial institutions, that incentives to lower short-term  interest rates are carried out. It is also this division that  carries out the central bank's government bond operations.    The General Affairs Division works together with the  Settlement System Division of the Credit Systems Bureau to study  measures that can be taken to avoid non-payment or other  settlement risks. According to Division Chief Morita, his staff  is "considering various options that will enable accounts to be  settled smoothly even in the unlikely event that a financial  institution fails." The division is also giving its input into  policy matters in order that the central bank's broad-ranging  work can continue to proceed smoothly.  <H5>  [26 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Information and Computer Systems Bureau  and Its Three Divisions--Providing Support for Japan's  Settlement of Accounts System    Last July a "fortress" was unveiled in an industrial park in  Fuchu (Tokyo). The gray-walled nine-story building dominates the  scene, looking sturdy enough to easily withstand even a temblor  on the scale of the Great Kanto Earthquake. It is here that the  computer system which supports Japan's financial structure is  located. It is the central bank's network, controlling account  settlements between fellow financial institutions.    It is in this Fuchu annex, which the BOJ newly constructed  to  accommodate the growing volume of business it handles, that one  finds the Information and Computer Systems Bureau ensconced far  from the familiar environs of Nihonbashi. The bureau is in  charge of developing, managing, and operating the entire  computer system.    The General Affairs Division is in charge of the plans and  proposals that are entered into the system and is also  responsible for coordinating divisions and carrying out  communications with them. The division's new chief, Michitaka  Yoneda (Class of 1973), assumed his post October 1993. "BOJ's  network," he says, "supports the settlement system, which is the  infrastructure of Japan's economy," and thus forcefully argues  the importance of its mission.    The Systems Development Division, with its staff of systems  engineers, is involved in developing computer software. The  Systems Operation Division's main job is to operate the system  under normal circumstances and to be ready to respond when  problems arise.    Two important themes informing the development of the system  were efficiency and stability. BOJ's network, which was put into  operation in 1988, was equipped to meet both of these criteria.    The current account deposits which banks and other  institutions make with the central bank and build up as their  reserve deposit are also used when banks exchange funds among  themselves for domestic and foreign exchange transactions and  for check clearances.    Before, in order to transfer funds from such current  accounts, a bank official would have to go to one of the central  bank's teller windows and present a written request for the  transfer. With the establishment of BOJ's computer network,  however, the entire transaction can now be completed very simply  at one of the computer terminals at the withdrawer's bank. Of  course, in order to access BOJ's net by terminal, users will  have to negotiate many layers of safeguards that have been put  into place (for example, they will have to have the appropriate  identification card and password). The system is also completely  "hacker-safe."    The Information and Computer Systems Bureau has also  undertaken the development of a system to process information  for use within the central bank. It also provides support, from  the computer and systems end, for the delivery of taxes to the  National Treasury, located in the central bank; for the  disbursement of pension funds; for the management of financial  statistics; and for the purposes of understanding the loan  status or fund raising status of individual financial  institutions. Sometimes systems development falls prone to the  error of not keeping up with the latest technology. Conversely,  it may latch on to technology that is so new as to be virtually  unusable. The task then, says Division Chief Yoneda, is to "find  a way to incorporate the best technology in a timely fashion," a  task which is easier said than done when advances in technology  are, as he says, occurring so rapidly.  <H5>  [28 Jan 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Research and Statistics Bureau/Economic  Research Division, Planning and Research Division--Research in  Step With Real World Realities    Critics said, "The Economic Planning Agency announced the  recession has bottomed out. Why hasn't the Bank of Japan?"  Pressed by such critics, Akinari Horii (Class of 1974), head of  the Economic Research Division, responded May 1993 with a  statement that there were no signs to a recovery. Unfortunately,  there has been no change in the economic recovery as Horii  predicted.    The Economic Research Division has the onerous  responsibility  of making economic assessments. The macro-side, his staff  pursues trends in personal consumption and plant and equipment  investment and, on the micro-side, financial trends and trends  in corporate supply and demand. Equipped with this data and  other information gathered from its branch offices, staff then  put together the material that becomes the basis for economic  assessments. This is done every quarter.    Besides having worked in the Ministry of Finance, Horii has  been assigned on temporary loan to work at the Bank for  International Settlements as well as the World Peace Institute,  which was established by former Prime Minister Nakasone.  Including his years as an exchange student in the United States,  he says, "out of my 20 years with the bank, eight were spend  abroad." Which may be why, as he says, "the aim of our research  is not necessarily to fit in with BOJ's reality but with the  wider reality outside our doors."    After Horii assumed his present post, that attitude has  shown  itself in the fact that the texts for public statements about  the economy are written concisely and in a way easily understood  by the general public. His aim, he says, is not to be swayed by  policy or other such considerations but to produce "research  that is accurate and neutral."    If the Economic Research Division is likened to a regular  army, in charge of studying economic trends over a certain  period of time, then the bureau's irregular army is the Planning  and Research Division, which undertakes studies targeting  specific problems. "Shouldn't there be a quantitative measure we  can use to judge the progress companies are making in adjusting  their balance sheets?" "Is there an indicator we can use instead  of money supply?" These are the kinds of probing questions this  division asks.    Its division chief is Kunio Okina (Class of 1974), a man  with  a scholarly bent, who has had many years of experience working  at the BOJ Financial Institute and as an assistant professor at  the University of Tsukuba (teaching international monetary  theory). Economic Analysis of Expectation and  Speculation, called by Ryuichi Tate, Tokyo University  professor emeritus, "probably the first systematic study in the  world on the bubble phenomenon," was released in 1985, early  pointing out the dangers of an inflationary "bubble" economy.    However, as Division Chief Okina reflects, "The publication  came out too early to sound any alarms." Since then, he adheres  to the view that research should be "a half step ahead of the  economy." "If it tries to be two steps ahead," he says, "its  findings won't be accepted." Given the dizzying speed at which  the economic and financial situation changes, one can understand  his determination to choose only those research topics that have  the greatest time value.  <H5>  [1 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Research and Statistics Bureau/Economic  Statistics Division, Commodity Price Statistics  Divison--Economic Statistics, Promptly Compiled    It was at 1345 on 10 December 1993, a crowd of over 500  stood  at the east gate of the Bank of Japan building. They were from  corporations and private research groups trying to get  just-released copies of the November edition of BOJ's  Short-Term Economic Survey of Principal Enterprises in  Japan.    As such scenes may indicate, interest is very high these  days, not only at home but also overseas, in Japan's economy and  particularly the kind of economic indicators that are released  by the Bank of Japan and other knowledgeable sources. This is  all the more true because of Japan's prolonged business slump  and the lack of any visible signs of an exit door. Because BOJ's  short-term survey contains both current data and information  stretching back over many years, it is widely used by other  government agencies and research groups to gain an understanding  of the current state of the economy as well as to make forecasts  and predictions about its future course.    It is the Economic Statistics Division which handles the  analysis and questionnaire survey. The division has a staff of  about 40 people working on the Short-Term Survey,  either in the corporate statistics group or in the financial  statistics group, which is responsible for compiling data on  deposits and loans and the money supply. Their goal, says  Division Chief Mitsuo Fujimoto (Class of 1972), is to "work  expediously to compile statistics that have a high degree of  precision and reliability so as to reflect the actual state of  the economy." That attitude shows itself in the fact that the  number of those surveyed for the November edition has been  increased to nearly 3,000 companies, many of the additional  respondents coming from smaller enterprises and from the  nonmanufacturing sector.    Also important in getting an accurate picture of the economy  are trends in the price of goods and services. The corporate  service price index and wholesale price index are compiled by  the Commodity Price Statistics Division, which is headed by  Hiroshi Nakagawa (1975). "Commodity prices," he explains, "are a  measure of the value of the currency. They are also like body  temperature.' [A good thermometer] will register trends in goods  and services."    The division's work covers three areas: 1) thermometry  (compiling statistics), 2) assessing changes in temperature  (analysis), and 3) polishing thermometers (improving research  and analytical methods). For example, to take the case of the  wholesale price index, over 1,200 items are covered. This is  over 90 percent of all products and merchandise traded among  businesses. To get this data, staff members will actually go to  the company or will make inquiries by phone and then enter their  findings into computer terminals. Statistics are compiled at the  beginning, in the middle, and at the end of each month.    The Bank of Japan states the objective of monetary policy is  the launch Japan's economy "on the road to sustainable,  inflation-less growth." These economic and commodity price  statistics are important sign posts for the bank in giving  direction to monetary policy.  <H5>  [3 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] BOJ Institute for Monetary and Economic  Studies--Emphasizing Long-Term Returns on Basic Research    Walking down the red-carpeted corridors on the second floor  of the old Bank of Japan building, one's eyes are drawn to the  portraits of bank governors, past and present, which are hanging  on the walls. Unlike the busy corridors of the headquarters of  the central bank, the atmosphere here is quiet. The room at the  end of the corridor belongs to BOJ's Institute for Monetary and  Economic Studies.    The institute assumed its present form in 1982--the same  year  as BOJ celebrated its 100th anniversary. At the time of the  institute's founding, then governor Haruo Maekawa spoke of the  reason for establishing the institute.    "What we anticipate from the institute," he said, "is basic  research which will be of valuable use, if not immediately, then  at least in the long run. It may seem at times to be research  that is irrelevant to our immediate interests or that it is a  long, roundabout way to get somewhere. But if we lengthen our  horizons and take a long-term view, we ought to be able to see  its value as one important link among many."    An important difference between the institute and the  Research and Statistics Bureau is that, while the latter  provides the basic data from which to make daily policy  decisions, the institute stresses basic research which will be  useful in the long term. Researchers, here, are not only limited  to in-house staff but are also brought in from outside the bank.  According to Hiroo Taguchi (1971), who heads the First Research  Division, "an important role of the institute is to serve as a  bridge between the academic world and the real world of finance."    The Research Institute has three divisions. The First  Division, which Taguchi heads, is concerned with theoretical  research dealing with basic questions about economies, monetary  matters, and public finance. The Second Division is involved in  research on regulations and systems related to economic problems  and the Third Division, historical research. The Third Division  is also in charge of running the famous Currency Museum as one  of its field study courses.    Research findings are published every month in Kinyu  kenkyu, a collection of papers covering a broad range of  research topics. Among the subjects covered in recent issues,  for example, one finds papers titled: "Regarding Consumer Logic  and Currency Demand" (December 1993), "Problems Concerning the  Tax System and Financial Accounting" (October 1993), and "An  Observation Regarding Deposit Insurance and Moral-Hazard  Risk-Neutral Insurance Premiums" (October 1992).    In each case the research represents a very specialized  field  of interest and yet is related to a current concern. For  example, the paper on deposit insurance in the October 1992  issue. When viewed in light of events in the United  States--where troubled banks have rushed to get insured  deposits--the relationship between deposit insurance and the  presence of moral hazard incentives needs to be considered in  Japan as well. While it is basic research, it is research that  tries to incorporate a contemporary perspective. This seems to  be, in fact, one of the research institute's distinctive  features.  <H5>  [4 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MPT Postal Savings Bureau/Operations and  Planning Division--Building the Framework for Deregulation    The deregulation of interest rates on current, or floating,  deposits has become the target of a great deal of interest and  concern among private financial institutions. Hoping to put the  deregulation of interest rates into effect by mid-1994, the  Ministries of Finance [MOF] and Posts and Telecommunications  [MPT] are on the final leg of their negotiations. Trying to  build the framework for deregulation on the MPT side is the  Planning Division in the Postal Savings Bureau.    This is the division, considered the "brains" of the Postal  Savings Bureau, which is involved in creating "products"  [savings account plans] that are more attractive to depositors.  It also formulates proposals to amend any regulations affecting  such accounts. The unit is considered an elite post for those  assigned there as division chief, a position held at one time or  another by a number of the ministry's top-ranking officials. The  current head of the Postal Savings Bureau, Akemi Yamaguchi  (Class of 1963), and Chief Secretary Tsuyoshi Kimura (1966), for  example, were both formerly division chiefs here. The man who  currently heads the Operations and Planning Division, Chikanori  Saio (1974), has been with the Postal Savings Bureau since 1989.    The Operations and Planning Division is one of the few  places  that will receive advance notice of a change in the official  discount. Word will be passed quietly into the chief's ear by a  member of the Ministry of Finance. Communications of this sort  is necessary because changes in the official discount rate are  closely tied to changes in the interest paid on postal savings  accounts. After last June's deregulation of interest rates on  fixed-amount savings accounts, the most popular type of postal  account, only the interest on regular savings accounts remained  linked to the official discount rate. Before June 1993, advance  word of a change would come several days before the change took  effect. When the official discount rate was lowered in September  [1993], however, word came only the night before. Perhaps, after  regular savings account interest rates are deregulated, contact  between the Ministry of Finance and the Operations and Planning  Division--at least over the matter of the official discount  rate--will stop entirely.    Instead, what has become more important work for the  division  is deciding on interest rates for fixed term (new fixed-term)  and fixed-amount savings. Here, the decisions have to be made on  the basis of trends in market interest rates. As a rule, rates  change for fixed-term savings every Monday and for fixed-amount  savings on the first and third Mondays of each month. But the  Operations and Planning Division announces changes in its rates  on the Monday prior to their taking effect. Private financial  institutions, which have competing fixed-term savings accounts,  are very interested in those figures.    Questions concerning current deposits, which have become the  focus of much attention recently, are handled directly within  the Operations and Planning Division by the unit set up to  promote financial deregulation. This unit is headed by Seiji  Katsuno (1978), an expert of long standing in the savings area.  Negotiations on how to decide what the interest rate on regular  savings accounts should be (it is now 1.32 percent per annum)  are sailing on rough waters, and since last autumn Katsuno's  unit has been swamped with work as negotiation with the Ministry  of Finance continues.</p>

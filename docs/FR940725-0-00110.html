When submitting estimates of institutional costs without the waiver, the agency may use the average per capita costs of ICF/MR care even though the deinstitutionalized developmentally disabled were inpatients of NFs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) For persons diverted rather than deinstitutionalized, the State's evaluation process required by &sect;441.303(c) must provide for a more detailed description of their evaluation and screening procedures for recipients to ensure that waiver services will be limited to persons who would otherwise receive the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR, as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

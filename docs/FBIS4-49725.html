			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by XINHUA reporters Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031) </F> and Qian Yonghong (6929 0737 5725): "The Premier Braves the  Rain To Visit Herdsmen"]    [Text] Hohhot, 5 May (XINHUA) -- It was drizzling on the  verdant Ordos prairie on the morning of 2 May. Premier Li Peng  and his entourage, who were inspecting work in the Inner  Mongolia Autonomous Region, arrived by car at the home of  Alengdai, a Mongolian herdsman, in Bulag Village, Ejin Horo Sumu  [the preceding word denotes a Mongolian administrative  division], Ih Ju League.    Before stepping into the courtyard, a smiling Premier Li  Peng  extended his cordial greetings to Mr. and Mrs. Alengdai, his  hosts who had come out to welcome him warmly. Using a Mongolian  phrase she had just learned, Comrade Zhu Lin [Li Peng's wife]  said: "Saibainu (How do you do)?"    His tanned face betraying extraordinary excitement, a sturdy  Alengdai, in a Mongolian gown, clasped Li Peng's hand with both  of his hands and said repeatedly: "How do you do, Mr. Premier?  How do you do, Mr. Premier."    Premier Li Peng sat cross-legged on a heatable brick bed in  the house. Following Mongolian etiquette, he gladly took the  bowl of hot tea with milk from his host, with whom he chit  chatted as he drank from the bowl.    Alengdai profusely praised the dual contract responsibility  system for grassland and animal husbandry that has been in place  since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee. He said: "Before the introduction of reform, I lived  in a small mud house and our per capita annual income was less  than 100 yuan. Things have got better in recent years, thanks to  state policies and our own hard work. My family now has more  than 140 sheep and goats, as well as some horses and cattle. We  have built more than 70 mu of grass enclosures, as well as  plastic heating sheds. Our 3-mu irrigated field yields more  than 3,000 kg each year. Last year, our family income topped  5,000 yuan, or 1,200 yuan per capita."    The premier asked solicitously: "How many children do you  have? Are they in school? Is their schooling expensive?"    "Two of my children are in school. My daughter attends  paramedical school in Hulun Buir League. I have to send them  money every year," Alengdai said.    The premier said: "Good. Herdsmen are willing to invest in  their children, who represent the new generation on the prairie."    The premier asked: "Do you grow grain for your own  consumption or for sale?"    "Primarily for use as fodder."    The premier asked in detail: "How much wool can a head of  sheep yield per shearing? How is the quality of wool?"    "Sheep yield two kg of wool per head, whereas each goat  produces 4 liang of down. The quality of wool and down is not  very good."    The premier then said in an emphatic tone: "Well, you cannot  sell your wool for a good price if its quality is bad. We need  to improve our breeds of sheep and goal, raise them  scientifically, and change our conventional method of raising  livestock in an environment that is susceptible to the  elements." Upon hearing the premier's remarks, Alengdai and  other herdsmen nodded repeatedly.    When the premier handed him brick tea [a mass of tea leaves  in the shape of a brick], a gift he had specifically taken  along, Alengdai said excitedly: "Why, Mr. Premier has us  herdsmen on his mind!"    Not long before, Alengdai had built a brick house with a  floor space of more than 100 square meters. Upon seeing the  television, videocassettee recorder, washing machine, and  knockdown cabinets in the house, and upon learning from Alengdai  that he had bought yet another diesel-powered pedicab a year  earlier, the premier remarked joyously: "Herdsmen on the  prairie are leading a different life than in the past. They  will lead an even better life in the future."    The drizzle linked the premier's heart with those of the  herdsmen. As he shook hands with Alengdai before leaving, the  premier asked: "What is Mongolian for `Good-bye'?"  "Bayaritai," replied Alengdai emotionally as he reluctantly bid  the premier farewell. The premier blurted out: "Bayaritai!"    On his way home, Premier Li Peng told Wang Qun, secretary of  the autonomous regional party committee, and Wuliji, chairman of  the autonomous region, who were traveling with him: "Although  Inner Mongolia's wool output is not low, the wool quality is not  good enough. We should adopt measures to improve quality and  raise prices, cut down on intermediate links in the distribution  system, and let peasants and herdsmen derive real benefits to  encourage them to improve wool quality."</p>

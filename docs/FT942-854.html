			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (11): Confrontation is a possibility - John Lloyd sees a change in foreign policies Earlier this month, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned the US Congress against insisting on the implementation of its vote to arm Bosnian Moslem forces. This would be, he said, a harbinger of a new great power confrontation - when Russia and the US would again arm their allies in a proxy war. He obviously had in mind, but did not explicitly mention, the Serbs as Russia's proxy. This was not the Mr Kozyrev who became foreign minister in 1991 and who has stuck - despite constant rumours of forced resignation - to his post ever since. But the country's mood towards foreigners has changed greatly and Mr Kozyrev with it: it is the reason for his survival. The swing to the nationalist right and left in the elections of last December is usually held responsible for this, but that is only true in part. Some time before, the country's politicians had begun to make quite sharp corrections to a pro-western foreign policy which even western diplomats thought excessive. Russia had rediscovered its 'interests' and it is still doing so. As now expressed, these interests include: A concentration on the 'near abroad,' the Russian designation for the 14 other former Soviet states, most of which have a common border with Russia and all of which are still strongly linked to it by economic, political and security ties. The news here, for Russia, the former Soviet states and for the 'far abroad' is not all bad - although some of it is. The good news is that Russian troops are withdrawing or have withdrawn from Lithuania and Latvia: only Estonia among the three Baltic states still has no agreement (and the negotiations remain tense and mutually abrasive) - but both Estonian and Russian officials still say they expect one. Further, the states which make up the Commonwealth of Independent States, which include all former Soviet countries except the Baltics, are now prepared to work together more closely than in the first two years of that organisation's life. They lack properly functioning bureaucracies to implement the network of agreements they have signed between themselves - but they are now making efforts to moderate the burst of destructive protectionism in which they indulged immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The bad news is that the CIS is not a common market, has no properly working interstate economic mechanism or banking agreement and most of the non-Russian states are extremely dependent on Russia - to the point of being vulnerable to, and suffering from, Russian pressure. For this reason, there remains, and will remain, great ambiguity about Russian military and security activities there - always interpreted by Russia as necessary measures to keep the peace and preserve or bring back stability, but interpreted by some at least in the west, and on occasion by the other former Soviet states, as more or less dangerous manoeuvring to further Russian power. In the past year, the west has drawn a rough line under the Baltic states, saying that these at least should not be touched and must be cleared of Russian troops: for the rest, it averts its gaze. An effort to strike a relationship with the US and with Nato which confirms Russia's 'great power' status - even as that status is more and more under question in any but the field of nuclear weapons. This is proving hard: although the Russians probably will sign up to the Partnership for Peace - the Nato-inspired plan to bring the former communist countries into association with it while withholding full membership from the central European states which wish it - they do so with some reluctance. This is accompanied by demands for a special status to be recognised and codified and with a constant commentary that Nato should be subsumed into a larger organisation such as the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe - a trend which could serve as a warning for the future. Russia is also likely to be accepted as a 'political' member of the Group of Seven advanced industrial countries in Naples next month - a membership which will give its politicians the sense of belonging to a wealthy club but which will impose responsibilities for which their reduced circumstances badly fit them. It will be a further mark of acceptance by the international community that reforms continue or are at least deemed to continue - the other this year was the granting of a Dollars 1.5bn loan by the International Monetary Fund  -but it comes when Russia is proving a prickly and difficult partner and when much comment in the west points to the impossibility of a real 'partnership' with a country whose interests are seen by itself as being so different from those of most western states. Russia wishes to be both of Europe and out of it: although western Europe, and in particular Germany, remains the second most important focus of its diplomacy after the CIS, it cannot forget its Eurasian nature and cannot take its place as simply a bigger, more eastern, European state. Its relations with the countries to its east and south have generally improved. China - now its largest trading partner - presents no quarrels for the first time for many years and seems as interested as is Russia in preserving good neighbourly relations. Visits by Mr Yeltsin and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, confirmed the importance of the relationship. India is no longer as close as it was when it sought to use the Soviet Union to balance western influence on it - but there is no tension. Of the leading states to the east, only with Japan does suspicion and a certain animus remain, expressed over the Kurile Islands or Northern Territories taken by the Soviet Union at the end of the last war, and whose return Japan demands before it puts its diplomatic relationship with Russia on a normal footing. For the rest of the world, Russia has largely withdrawn. The former Soviet satellites find little interest and no support from a state now forced to weigh expenditure much more carefully than in the past, and with no ideological profit to be gained from buying their alliance. Before this year, this withdrawal was accompanied by a commensurate absence from many of the theatres of the world where the most important states, above all the US, were playing a mediatory or controlling role. In the past year, however, Russian diplomacy has again become more active - insisting on being taken into account in the former Yugoslavia, in the Middle East and in the present crisis in North Korea. In each case it has proposed distinctive approaches and though often posing a challenge has so far been accommodated without major ructions. Mr Kozyrev's challenge over Bosnia, however, raises the question of how long this will continue to be so. Russia has, in this past year, shown it will advance its interests. It has not so far pushed these to direct confrontation with those of other leading countries with whom it has a new-found friendship. But the possibility now exists.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Russians play down the danger of Ukraine clash LEADING Russian politicians in Moscow yesterday played down the danger of conflict with Ukraine over control of the Black Sea fleet, but action at the fleet headquarters of Sevastopol underlined the tension between the two sides. President Boris Yeltsin sent Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, commander of the Commonwealth of Independent States naval forces, to Sevastopol to oversee the transfer of the fleet to Russian control. This followed Mr Yeltsin's signing on Tuesday of a decree taking the fleet under Russian jurisdiction - a direct counter to a similar decree issued by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine president, on Monday. The Ukraine parliament met in emergency session yesterday to discuss the crisis and Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, reported that Admiral Chernavin had told Ukrainian representatives that they could have a fleet but would have to find new headquarters. Meanwhile, thousands of pro-Russian demonstrators were reported to have surrounded the fleet headquarters, brandishing banners saying 'We won't give up the Black Sea fleet' and 'Sevastopol is a city of Russian glory'. A spokesman for the Black Sea fleet said demonstrators had come to the defence of Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the pro-Russian commander of the fleet. 'The whole town has risen up in support of the admiral,' a spokesman said. But it was not clear that the headquarters was under any imminent danger of attack by Ukrainians. Indeed, the Ukrainian minister of defence, General Constantin Morozov, said pro-Russian forces had surrounded the headquarters of Ukraine's appointee as commander of the fleet, Counter Admiral Boris Kozhyn, in the early hours yesterday. Black Sea fleet spokesmen would not comment. In Moscow, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, for talks in Moscow on Saturday, the official news agency Itar-Tass reported. General Dmitri Volkogonov, military adviser to Mr Yeltsin, said: 'It is inconceivable that there would be war between the two great Slav states on this issue. We must now set up a commission between the two states to discuss these questions and we must find a compromise between us. A compromise is certainly possible.' But the discussion of the issue in the Ukrainian parliament underscored the escalation of tensions between Ukraine and Russia. Defence minister, Gen Morozov, said: 'We see the main problem in the fact that the CIS is not viable.' Mr Kravchuk reasserted Ukraine's claim to the Black Sea fleet and to the Crimean peninsula, where it is stationed. Nationalist deputies were in truculent mood. 'This is naked Russian imperialism,' said Mr Mikola Porovsky, who wore an embroidered Ukrainian peasant shirt under his blue jacket. 'Yeltsin is trying to kill two birds with one stone. First he wants to deflect attention from the failure of his economic policy and second he wants to seize property that is not his by rights.' Mr Vitold Fokin, the Ukrainian prime minister, said that Russian vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoi had 'personally deceived me' when he travelled to Sevastopol over the weekend.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Milk and water If you wonder what will happen if we wake up 56 mornings from now under a La-bour government, here is the answer in executive-summary shorthand: Britain will become a regulatory state. If he gets the chance, Mr Neil Kinnock will try to achieve by means of regulation and tax incentives or penalties what his party could not deliver when it tried nationalisation, demand management and the perpetual expansion of the public sector. Labour has abandoned socialism, but it means to civilise capitalism. This is evident from a close study of the several policy documents published by the party over the past two years, but there is no need to consult them again. Reading through all that boilerplate is anyway not worth doing for less than Dollars 1,000 an hour, and it would take the seller of the service many long hours. We can turn instead to Next Left, a slim pamphlet about to be published by the Institute for Public Policy Research*. It is not a party document, but in its general thrust it might as well be. The IPPR is Labour's think-tank in the same way as the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute for Economic Affairs and the Adam Smith Institute are the Conservatives'. Two of the four authors of Next Left are confidantes of Mr Kinnock. I fancy I detect the voice of Dr John Eatwell, the Labour leader's economic adviser, in some of the arguments. So while it would be wrong to pin details of its proposals on the Labour party, we may safely ascribe the pamphlet's tentative theorising to some of Mr Kinnock's favoured thinkers. Do not get too excited. This is no Das Kapital. It is not even a viable synopsis for a 1990s equivalent of Tony Crosland's The Future of Socialism, which famously sought to modernise Labour thinking in the 1950s. But it is probably the best that British socialists can do at this stage of picking up the pieces left by the collapse of the command economies. A small thing, but Labour's own. The essence of it is that the kind of capitalism nurtured by the Conservatives 'badly needs reform'. It suffers from what the authors call the two 'fallacies' of laisser faire. The first is that markets come first and social intervention thereafter. On the contrary, they argue, the state creates and sustains markets, 'the important point being that it should do so in such a way that the individual energies released lead to socially desirable results'. The second so-called fallacy is that the pursuit of individual self-interest will, by the magic of the hidden hand, produce the greatest good of the greatest number. Not so, say our Kinnockites, 'markets have to be designed to maximise social good . . . markets are created by political rules . . . and different rules produce different results.' This is in tune with the writings of David Marquand, a Liberal Democrat and professor of politics at Sheffield University, whose centrist volume, The Unprincipled If Labour is elected it means to civilise capitalism Society (Jonathan Cape, 1988), is as serious a work as Crosland's. Professor Marquand asserted in a recent article in the New Statesman that 'the capitalisms of Britain and the United States are hopelessly unproductive and inefficient'. What he favours is 'a developmental or social capitalism, which has been hammered out, without benefit of theory, in the solidaristic, consensual political economies of central Europe and in the similarly solidaristic political economy of Japan'. All this was a prelude to a warning to Mr Paddy Ashdown not to take the Liberal Democrats too far down the road leading to Anglo-American capitalism. Mr Ashdown should stick to his guns. If Next Left is any guide, a Labour government would travel in the central European - that is, German - direction. The key Thatcherite liberalisations of the past decade would be reversed. 'In our view,' the authors state, 'these changes have been little short of disastrous; collective re-regulation of the economy is essential.' Re-regulation of the credit market could be attempted by introducing a two-tier lending rate, a reserve asset regime for banks and constraints on consumer credit growth. Industrial regulation would, in takeover cases, include the transfer of the onus of 'public interest' proof from target to predator. That apart, Labour's industrial interventions would not be outstandingly different from what we would get if, say, Mr Michael Heseltine were to be rewarded for his past 14 months of virtue by being enabled to realise his dreams as super-secretary for industry in a Major administration. This is not true of the broad sweep of Next Left thinking. It is far away from contemporary Tory orthodoxy. Pension fund trust law would be 'overhauled', in the interest of combatting short-termism. The regulatory approach is proposed for the labour market, which means the minimum wage and much else, and - three cheers - for environmental protection. Let me stress that the details I have alluded to will not necessarily become formal Labour policies. The most likely outcome under a Kinnock government would be the dilution of the extensive regulatory regime implied by following Labour's current thinking to a logical conclusion. It would be milk-and-water regulation by a party that throughout most of its career in government practised milk-and-water socialism. But nobody can say that the voters wouldn't have a choice. In spite of yesterday's dour news on unemployment and house repossessions that choice is still - just - more likely to be Tory than Labour. As one minister commented: 'Look at the 91 per cent in work. For them, average earnings are still running about 3 percentage points ahead of inflation. When election day comes, those are the figures that will count.' * Tessa Blackstone, James Cornford, Patricia Hewitt and David Milliband. IPPR 30/32 Southampton Street, WC2E 7RA</p>

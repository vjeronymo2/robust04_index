			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] After leaving discussions held by the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] in Casta Papiernicka,  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar held a telephone conversation  with the chairman of the strongest opposition party [Party of  the Democratic Left, PDL]. Ivan Samel, an editor, today asked  PDL Chairman Peter Weiss about the content of the conversation.    [Begin recording] [Samel] Mr. Chairman, the subject of your  telephone conversation yesterday with the prime minister was a  proposal to reach a compromise solution on the bill amending the  existing law on the privatization of large enterprises. How did  you react to that proposal?    [Weiss] We are not against discussions. Nonetheless, we have  already declared our position quite clearly.    [Samel] We have heard that a part of that proposal was to  link the privatization of large enterprises to the question of a  vote of confidence or no-confidence in the government.    [Weiss] We have envisaged such a tactical variant. In this  instance, however, the main issue is the content of this law--in  order to calm down the atmosphere surrounding privatization and  in order that the law should provide guarantees for effective  parliamentary and public supervision of the privatization  process, with the aim that privatization ceases to be a bone of  contention between political parties. Unless this problem is  resolved, such suspicion will constantly destabilize any  government. [passage omitted]    [Samel] In your view, is there a will within the opposition  to force the resignation of the government or cast a vote of  no-confidence in it?    [Weiss] Within the opposition, there is a great deal of  dissatisfaction with the way the government is governing the  country. The government lacks a concept of economic policy; it  has a bad, a very bad, image abroad, it is not sufficiently  open, and there is not a rational division of labor in the  government; and decisionmaking is being increasingly  concentrated in the hands of one person, which is not solely a  political problem because it is a problem of government  operation.    To put it simply, it is no longer possible for one man,  however hardworking he may be, to be able to cope with such a  number of problems within the time frame available. [passage  omitted]    [Samel] We have also learned that, during the telephone  conversation, a proposal was made to keep this government in  office until early parliamentary elections are held, which  should take place at the beginning of this summer.    [Weiss] We are in favor of early elections, but we do not  see  any reason for giving support to this government.    [Samel] Are you going to hold separate talks with the group  that has been created within the HZDS?    [Weiss] We will hold political discussions with anyone who  is  prepared to resolve this political crisis in a democratic manner  so that the power does not lie in the street but, rather, so  that the citizens make the decision in the end, in early  democratic elections.

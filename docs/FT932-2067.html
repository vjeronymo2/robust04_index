			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: National conservation museum A disused railway warehouse (pictured above) in the heart of Liverpool is to become a national centre for museum conservation. The Pounds 5.3m contract to convert the former Midland Goods Depot in Victoria Street, Liverpool, has been awarded to TARMAC CONSTRUCTION by the National Museums &amp; Galleries on Merseyside (NMGM). There will be studios, workshops and laboratories where experts can restore valuable paintings, statues, sculptures, furniture and fabrics as well as industrial, maritime and historical artefacts. The scheme involves complete refurbishment of the Grade II listed building, a three-storey rail freight warehouse built in 1874 which has lain semi-derelict for several years. Total cost of the project is expected to be Pounds 7.2m with a grant of Pounds 2.2m from the government's City Challenge initiative and another Pounds 3.5m from the Department of National Heritage. The centre is scheduled to open in 1995 and a public exhibition area will open the following year.</p>

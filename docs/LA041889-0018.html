			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARSAW COURT ACTS;  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY GETS LEGAL STATUS BACK  </P> <P> The independent, self-governing trade union Solidarity is legal again. For the  second time in history, it has become the only independent trade union in the  Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> The final step in the legalization process took place Monday in Warsaw's  provincial courts building, a soot-stained four-story maze of dim hallways and  high black doors, in the same chamber where Solidarity's original charter was  accepted by a beleaguered and reluctant Polish government in November, 1980.  </P> <P> "All workers have the right to create and gather together in labor unions  according to their wish," said Danuta Widawska, presiding over a panel of three  women judges as she read from court documents. "Accordingly. . . . "  </P> <P> Chants of "Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!" filled the courtroom where about 300  supporters had gathered, while the three judges, their scripted moment upon  Poland's political stage concluded, shook hands with the leaders of the  Solidarity delegation and retreated to their chambers, ready to let the  continuing drama unfold.  </P> <P> Hours later, in what was billed as a planned response to the legalization,  President Bush, in a speech in Hamtramck, Mich., announced a new package of  economic aid and debt relief for Poland. There was no immediate response from  either the government or Solidarity, with spokesmen for both sides saying they  preferred to withhold comment until they had read Bush's speech.  </P> <P> French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, on a visit here, welcomed Poland's move  and said that Paris will back efforts to ease Warsaw's crippling foreign debt.  </P> <P> Lech Walesa, whose name was also taken up in rhythmic chant by the courtroom  crowd, was not there -- he was home in Gdansk nursing a cold and preparing, it  was said, for an early rendezvous with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist  Party leader forced into an accommodation with the union he once suppressed by  declaring martial law.  </P> <P> In response to Monday's court action, Solidarity issued a statement by Walesa  saying, "I appeal to all workers and supporters of our union to form factory  organizations as soon as possible where they still don't exist and to report  their membership in Solidarity or to join it."  </P> <P> The legalization of the union movement followed eight weeks of "round-table"  talks between government and union officials. The accord reached April 5 set  out a program of democratic and institutional reforms and provided for the  National Assembly to amend the legislation that had outlawed Solidarity in  1982.  </P> <P> After the amendment, it remained only for Solidarity to petition the court for  legal status. The court responded favorably Monday.  </P> <P> At the courthouse, meanwhile, there was the usual supporting cast -- the scores  of elderly women, eyes primed for tears and hands clutching bouquets,  gray-haired men with canes and Solidarity pins affixed to their worn lapels.  </P> <P> "I've been waiting eight years for this," said Kaszimiera Jaziewicz, who, as  with many of her friends on the courtroom, had spent much of that time in the  basements of Roman Catholic churches, laboring with faithful defiance for  Solidarity's ultimate return to the scene. "We are very happy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contrast Noted  </P> <P> Delighted as she was, Jaziewicz and others could see a sharp difference between  the courthouse scene Monday and the one that took place on Nov. 10, 1980. The  contrast suggested the length of the journey Poland has made -- and the  distance it has yet to travel.  </P> <P> Back then, as an intoxicating mood of defiance swept Poland, the courthouse  hallways teemed with Solidarity supporters, the streets were filled with  banners and chanting crowds prepared for a triumphant march through the  streets.  </P> <P> On Monday, as a sudden cold rain turned to snow, Warsaw's busy streets absorbed  the handful of Solidarity enthusiasts virtually without a trace. One of them,  on the steps of the court building, suggested staging a march.  </P> <P> "That's fine," said Father Henryk Jankowski, Lech Walesa's parish priest from  St. Brygida's in Gdansk, who had journeyed to Warsaw for the occasion. "That's  fine, but I don't think we have enough people."  </P> <P> Father Jankowski was right. In addition, the union, legalized as part of a  bargain struck after long negotiations with the Polish authorities, has more  pressing concerns.  </P> <P> The bargain itself is not easy, for Solidarity must balance its determined  calls for a reform of the country's economic system with the need to protect  the interests of the workers in whose name the union was founded -- goals that  are bound to come into conflict. Also, the union's activists and chief advisers  are preparing for national elections to a newly created Senate and to compete  for 35% of the seats in the national Parliament.  </P> <P> Among the Solidarity officials present at the court proceedings Monday was  Bronislaw Geremek, a university professor who was one of the leading architects  of the sweeping round-table agreements signed by Solidarity and the government.  </P> <P> "I remember eight years before today," said the ginger-bearded historian as he  stood in the jury box of the courtroom waiting for the panel of judges to  emerge. "I have the feeling that now we start with different conditions."  </P> <P> The first of the new conditions, he said, stemmed from the Soviet Union and the  changes brought about by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "Second," he went on, "I have a feeling that on both sides, the Polish  government side and Solidarity, we learned something. We learned how to cope  with one another. I have the feeling that the Communist Party changed and  Solidarity learned how to practice compromise."  </P> <P> Both the government and Solidarity hope that the compromise will hold together  for at least four more years, when -- as Geremek reminded his listeners -- the  next elections to the Polish National Assembly will be fully free.  </P> <P> "This was the most important thing we decided at the talks," he said, "that the  next elections should be simply democratic. This means that it is a promise,  and the realization of this promise depends on the strength of Polish society."  </P> <P> Faced with rising consumer shortages and mounting inflation, Polish society may  have to bear greater hardships before any economic renewal occurs. The Polish  government has counted on its agreement with Solidarity to pry badly needed  financial support from Western nations, both for investment and for relief from  a $39-billion foreign debt.  </P> <P> Solidarity has made it clear that it will join forces with the government in  this appeal, even to the point of sending Walesa abroad -- to Rome this month,  followed by trips later in the year to West Germany and the United States --  not quite as an official emissary, but at least as a demonstration of a new  spirit in Poland.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ONCE OUTLAWED, NOW LEGAL  </P> <P> Key events in the history of Solidarity:  </P> <P> 1980  </P> <P> August -- Electrician Lech Walesa leads strike at Gdansk's Lenin Shipyard and  starts worker revolt against Communist state. Authorities agree to make  Solidarity the Soviet Bloc's only legal independent union.  </P> <P> 1981  </P> <P> Dec. 13 -- With general strike threatened, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski declares  martial law, suppressing Solidarity activities and interning thousands of  members, including Walesa.  </P> <P> 1982  </P> <P> Oct. 8 -- Solidarity is banned and a government-run trade union alliance is  created to take its place.  </P> <P> Nov. 11 -- Walesa is freed.  </P> <P> 1983  </P> <P> July 22 -- Jaruzelski lifts martial law but leaves many curbs in effect.  </P> <P> Oct. 5 -- Walesa wins Nobel Peace Prize.  </P> <P> 1986  </P> <P> Sept. 11 -- Government releases 225 political prisoners, including all senior  Solidarity leaders.  </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Nov. 29 -- Poles vote in first referendum in 41 years but deny support to  government for its economic reform package.  </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> August -- After series of strikes in spring, new strikes break out and spread,  creating Poland's worst labor strife in seven years. On Aug. 31, in response to  government overture, Walesa holds first meeting with government officials in  six years and appeals to workers to end strikes.  </P> <P> Sept. 3 -- Strikes end.  </P> <P> 1989  </P> <P> Jan. 17 -- Communist Party leadership decides Solidarity can be legalized under  certain conditions, meeting Solidarity's terms for talks.  </P> <P> Feb. 6 -- "Round-table" negotiations begin.  </P> <P> April 5 -- Walesa and Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak conclude historic  deliberations by endorsing a new "social contract" for Poland, including the  legalization of the union.  </P></p>

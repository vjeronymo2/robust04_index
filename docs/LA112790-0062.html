			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 117;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMATIC FRONT:  </P> <P> The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed on a January  deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. But until the deadline, no military  action would be taken against Iraq.  </P> <P> The plan may be modified before it is formally presented as a resolution. Talks  were under way on whether Jan. 1 or 15 would be set as the date after which  military force could be used.  </P> <P> In an address to the Supreme Soviet in Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned  Saddam Hussein that his aggression against Kuwait will be punished and vowed  that the alliance against Iraq will not be broken.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Kuwait's finance minister, Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah, said Iraq  can resist the U.N. economic sanctions for a very long time because its  centralized economy allows Hussein to shift resources easily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> The Army ordered 10,567 more military reservists to active duty, bringing to  more than 90,000 the number of part-time soldiers, airmen and sailors activated  by the Pentagon since early August.  </P> <P> In Saudi Arabia, two top British commanders predicted that allied forces would  defeatIraqi forces in "days or weeks" if war breaks out. They said that  additional ground forces on the way to the gulf will effectively counter Iraq's  current numerical superiority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hostage Front:  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein told the visiting relatives of three American hostages in Iraq  that they are free to take their loved ones with them when they return home,  Iraq's official INA news agency reported. The announcement spurred new hope  among 16 Americans who plan to visit Baghdad next week to provide comfort to  their relatives.  </P> <P> The State Department restated its opposition to such trips.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Reservists Called Up:  </P> <P> Army: 69,000  </P> <P> Marines: 10,800  </P> <P> Navy: 4,500  </P> <P> Air Force: 5,000  </P> <P> Coast Guard: 1,000  </P></p>

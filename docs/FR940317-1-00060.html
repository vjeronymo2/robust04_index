			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The investigation is performed to ascertain the facts of an incident. Which facts are relevant will often depend on the law and regulations applicable to the conduct of the parties involved, but as general guidance, the investigation should develop definitive answers to such questions as ``When,'' ``Where,'' ``Who,'' ``What,'' and ``How.'' Generally, the time, place, persons, and circumstances involved in an incident may be established by a simple report, but the cause and the resulting damage may require extensive effort to obtain all the pertinent facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The object of the investigation is to gather, with the least possible delay, the best available evidence without accumulating excessive evidence concerning any particular fact. The claimant is often an excellent source of such information and should be contacted early in the investigation. The investigative file should include medical records, witness interviews, photographs, and expert opinions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.15  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Immediate investigation requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Immediate investigation of an incident is required when_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Property other than Government property is damaged, lost, or destroyed.

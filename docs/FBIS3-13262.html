A 15-year-old youth was killed and some 20 people  were wounded, and two fugitives were captured in a special  operation yesterday. Nisim Qeynan reports:    For a week, there have been serious daily incidents in the  Gaza Strip. A wide-ranging operation to capture fugitives was  conducted in the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp. A curfew was  clamped on the camp, and the security forces operated in a  highly populated area to capture two wanted men, Hasan  Abu-Daramah and Zayid Hasinat, 21, belonging to the Fatah Hawks,  and four others who sheltered them. Palestinians rioted to  disturb the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] efforts to apprehend the  fugitives. At one stage, the rioters shot at the soldiers. One  was slightly wounded, and another was hit by stones. The  soldiers fired at the rioting mob, killing a 15-year-old youth.    During the searches for the wanted men, antitank missiles  were fired at several houses in which fugitives were suspected  to be hiding, and the buildings sustained serious damage. In  additional searches in the area, many weapons were found. The  two detained fugitives are suspected of firing at security  forces in Dayr al-Balah.    In other locations, 15-20 people were wounded in rioting in  the Jabalyah refugee camp, al-Shati', Rafah, and Khan Yunus,  according to Palestinian sources. During the incidents in Gaza,  a border policeman was slightly wounded when hit by stones and  was taken to the hospital.    The IDF is on an especially high alert on Fridays. The  curfew imposed on many areas will be lifted for two hours to  enable the residents to stock up on food. The closure continues  until decided otherwise.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0500 GMT on 11 March  adds details on incidents at other locations in the territories  yesterday. "In Tulkarm, an Israeli truck driver was lightly  hurt from glass fragments in a stone-throwing attack when his  windshield was shattered, and in Hebron, a shock grenade was  hurled at an Army patrol. The grenade went off. No one was  hurt and no damage was caused."]</p>

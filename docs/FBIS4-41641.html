			<p>BFN     [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk today began his working  trip to southern Ukraine with a visit to Dzhankoyskyy rayon in  the Crimea, our special correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko reports.  The economy in this part of the Crimea is literally paralyzed  by the lack of diesel fuel on the eve of the harvest campaign.  Due to adverse weather conditions, thousands of hectares of  crops have perished. It is expected that the harvest will be  significantly lower than usual. As the head of our state noted,  the main goal of his visit is to examine the state of affairs in  the agricultural sector of Dzhankoyskyy rayon, and to take  quick, decisive, and efficient measures to provide assistance.    Answering a question from a correspondent of Ukrainian  radio,  citing the fact that some of Leonid Kravchuk's rivals in the  presidential race support a joint command over the Black Sea  Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk stated that this standpoint is shared by  neither the Russian leadership nor President Boris Yeltsin.  Everyone has come to the conclusion, Leonid Kravchuk said, that  the fleet can be either single or divided, but there will be no  peace under this unusual -- so-called joint -- status. By the  way, Leonid Kravchuk noted, servicemen of the Black Sea Fleet  understand this.    Leonid Kravchuk also stated that, according to legislation  adopted by our Supreme Council, Ukraine should have three types  of armed forces -- land, air, and naval. Therefore, he, as  president, executes Ukrainian laws. If the Black Sea Fleet was  to fall under joint command, the law would have to be amended,  and one would have to state that Ukraine does not need a navy.  The president also noted that he advocates, and will continue  to advocate granting as many powers as possible to the Crimea,  provided Crimea remains an integral part of Ukraine in  accordance with the Constitution and international norms.  Otherwise, if there is a coup against Ukraine's territorial  integrity, all this will make no sense, the president emphasized.</p>

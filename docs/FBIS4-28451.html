			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The foreign languages  publishing house brought out book "Kim Il-song, the Great Man of  the Century" in foreign languages.    The book was written by Han Myong-ho, a Korean expatriate,  on  the occasion of the 80oh birthday of the great leader President  Kim Il-song.    Pictures of President Kim Il-song on Mt. Paektu and among  woman workers are printed in the first two pages of the book.    The author in preface says it is a long time ago that he,  residing overseas, came to respect President Kim Il-song.    Noting that the Korean people are outstanding as they are  blessed with President Kim Il-song and overseas compatriots can  live proudly enjoying a high national prestige as the Korean  nation is so outstanding, he says he offers the book to the  public, with his best wishes for a long life to the president.    The book consists of two titles "The Revolutionary Kim  Il-song" and "Kim Il-song, the Thinker," including 9 subtitles  "The Finder and Trail Blazer of the Age of Independece," "His  Whole Life Devoted to the Revolution," "With Faith and Will  Power," "With Ambitious Spirit and Ardour," "Great Philosopher"  and "The Grand Garden of the Chuche-Orientated Theory."</p>

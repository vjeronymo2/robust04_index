			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Doomed flotilla finds itself on the beach: Bernard Gray on what to do with submarines past their sail-by dates the boats designed for the deep oceans of the world end up buried in the desert, which is considered the safest place to allow their radioactivity to decay naturally. Britain has no desert in which to bury its retired submarines and so they languish in the two nuclear dockyards, Devonport in Plymouth and Rosyth in Fife. There are seven boats at the two yards. The hunter-killer boats Dreadnought, Swiftsure and Churchill with the Polaris nuclear missile boat Revenge are at Rosyth, while hunter-killer boats Courageous, Warspite and Conqueror, the submarine that sank the Argentine cruiser Belgrano, sit mournfully side by side in an unused dock at Devonport. The government's policy on the boats is to do nothing for the time being. Each submarine has had its highly radioactive fuel and nuclear cores removed and sent to British Nuclear Fuels for storage and eventual disposal. The hulls are sealed and the reactor compartments - radioactive as a result of long exposure to the nuclear cores - are being allowed to cool down over a period of years. Since the risks and costs of sawing up the hulks will be lower once some of the radioactivity has decayed, the government argues that there could hardly be a better place for the reactor compartments than inside the strong pressure hulls of the submarines. The Ministry of Defence said: 'There is no urgency. With the cores removed most of the radioactivity has gone and the remaining radioactivity continues to decline.' The policy of laying up the boats where they are decommissioned is likely to result in a sizeable flotilla at both Rosyth and Devonport over the next few years. Eleven nuclear submarines - including all four Polaris boats - will have been decommissioned by the end of the century. If normal practice is followed the Polaris boats will go to Rosyth, where all of their maintainance work has been carried out. While the MoD is content to play it cool, the options for final disposal are very limited. The boats cannot be taken out to sea and scuttled because that would violate the international moratorium on nuclear dumping. Burial whole in a dry-land site, which would prevent the radiation leaching into the water table, is difficult in a crowded and notoriously wet island. The remaining option is disposal in the nuclear waste repository which is planned by the government, but which has yet to get approval and will not be available until 2005 at the earliest. Even that would require the radioactive compartments to be cut up, an expensive job that the MoD is understandably in no hurry to start. As a result, Rosyth, Devonport and all of their potential users are likely to have to get used to the sight of disused nuclear submarines.</p>

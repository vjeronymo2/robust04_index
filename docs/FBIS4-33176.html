			<p>BFN     [Text] After surpassing the sugarcane spring planting  program in April, the Sugar Industry Ministry was behind  schedule at the end of May. Preliminary data shows that 8,700  caballerias have been planted; this represents a lag of over  5,000 caballerias, according to May projections. The excessive,  continuous rains in the eastern provinces and the ensuing floods  are among the causes for the delay. We must keep in mind that  the sugarcane planting program is of national significance in  Camaguey, Holguin, Las Tunas, Granma, and Santiago de Cuba  Provinces. It is expected that the lost time will be recovered  in June through tremendous planting efforts. Everything will  mainly depend, however, upon the amount of land prepared to  receive the seed.</p>

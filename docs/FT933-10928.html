			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: Hess; the myth debunked THE TRUTH ABOUT RUDOLF HESS by James Douglas-Hamilton Mainstream Pounds 14.99, 256 pages CONSPIRACY theories never die, nor even fade away. One can only try to expose them. This book should be read because it puts to rest some of the myths that have gathered about the story of Rudolf Hess's extraordinary flight to Britain on May 10 1941. An expanded re-issue of a book first published in 1971, this account by the Duke of Hamilton's son makes use of fresh documentary material, some from Hamilton papers but also from Foreign Office records, including MI5 files, opened for public scrutiny in 1992. It is handsomely illustrated with many unusual, and previously unpublished photographs from British and German collections. A well-researched introduction by Roy Conyers Nesbit, a wartime navigator, and Douglas-Hamilton's expanded text demolish the myth that the man who flew to Scotland and was later imprisoned in Spandau was not Hess but an imposter. Nesbit's reconstruction of the RAF's tracking record for Hess's flight calls into question the account given by John Costello in Ten Days That Saved The West (1991) and undermines the argument that the Duke of Hamilton knew of Hess's project and made efforts to assure his safe passage. It was a combination of Hess's daring and skill, the RAF's technological deficiencies, and luck which helped the deputy Fuehrer evade his pursuers until a fuel shortage forced him to bale out south of Glasgow. Douglas-Hamilton disposes of the charges that the Duke knew Hess and that the flight was arranged by the Secret Service as a peace plot in the name of Hamilton but without his knowledge. Hamilton had never met Hess previously although both attended the 1936 Olympic Games. The connection was through Albrecht Haushofer, son of the geo-politician Karl Haushofer, whose theories so appealed to Hitler. The elder Haushofer, teacher and friend of the young Hess, became partly dependent on the protection of his old student because he had a half-Jewish wife. Albrecht was a conservative nationalist German with deep misgivings about the Nazis. Albrecht became Hess's pre-war personal assistant and Ribbentrop's diplomatic agent, with a particular interest in Anglo-German relations. Opposed to the war, and passionately concerned to preserve peace between Germany and Britain, Albrecht, in a letter in July 1939 to the future Duke of Hamilton, whom he knew well, warned of the imminence of war and pleaded for a British peace plan. By 1940, still serving Hess, Haushofer was in contact with conservative resistance circles. He provided the link between Hamilton and Hess in May 1940 when Hess, anxious to restore his position with Hitler, sought to open communications with the London government. German documentation, not used here, supports the author's contention that the Fuehrer knew about these peace efforts. They were but one of many attempts in the summer of 1940 to secure the agreement with Britain that Hitler wanted. Albrecht, on Hess's urging, wrote to Hamilton, now in the RAF, in September 1940 suggesting a meeting in Portugal. The letter was intercepted and for reasons still unknown not acted upon until five months later. It was forwarded to Hamilton, who was asked by the Air Ministry to arrange a rendezvous for intelligence purposes. The matter was still under discussion when Hess, frustrated by the failure of Albrecht's initiative and knowing of the forthcoming Russian invasion, took off for Hamilton's home in Scotland. Hitler was taken by surprise. Hamilton was totally in the dark. It was not until Hess's flight that London realised that Albrecht was the eminence grise in the affair, though he knew nothing of Hess's plan. False information on the BBC, subsequently corrected, directly linked Hamilton and Hess. Churchill's decision to provide no details beyond the announcement of Hess's arrival and detention opened a Pandora's box of speculation that is still not closed. The British government mishandled the affair, missing a propaganda opportunity in Germany and raising alarm in Moscow. Misleading intelligence reports from Kim Philby and Colonel Moravetz, head of Czech military intelligence, convinced Stalin that Hess had been encouraged to come to Britain to conclude a peace settlement and to secure support for the attack on Russia. These suspicions, never abandoned, were reflected in a British Communist Party pamphlet calling Hamilton a friend of Hess. The British government reluctantly allowed Hamilton to sue for libel. A public retraction followed but ministers sweated out the possibility that Hess might be a witness. Douglas-Hamilton has successfully dealt with some - though not all - of the questions still surrounding this bizarre episode. His account leaves out some of the background information needed to understand the connection. For the most part, too, the author has only used the new Foreign Office files to amplify the story he has already told. It is unfortunate that he did not expand the later sections for, as his tantalising summary of the contents suggest, they apparently provide far more information than is given here. A brief epilogue covers Hess's trial at Nuremberg, his imprisonment and suicide in 1987. As in the original version, the last chapter deals with the fate of Albrecht, who was arrested after the July 20 plot peace and shot on the night of April 22-23 1945 as Russian troops closed on Berlin. One is grateful for a sensible account of the flight, but this will not be the last book on Hess.</p>

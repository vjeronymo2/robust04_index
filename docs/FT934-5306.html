			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (7): Instant dollars a threat - Mark Graham voices concern about the rush to develop tourism Five years from now, Hanoi's shaded avenues are full of cars, Ho Chi Minh City's streets are clogged with traffic jams, Vung Tau's beaches are surrounded by sterile high-rise apartment blocks and hotels and the peace of Ha Long Bay is shattered by hundreds of tour boats. Such is the overweening desire to promote tourism in Vietnam that this prediction is more than likely to be fulfilled. Vietnamese officials have in recent years travelled widely among neighbouring countries, such as Thailand, to see the results of south-east Asia's tourist boom. Without exception they voice concern over tourism's often negative impact on the environment, threats of uncontrolled growth around scenic areas and lack of infrastructure to sustain tourism in the long term. But evidence suggests that the immediate need for foreign exchange will overrule most of these considerations and rapidly lead to the production of familiar touristic eyesores. After years of isolation, it is only during the past three years that Vietnam has welcomed foreigners with open arms, and even then it has directed them to a relatively small number of destinations such as Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, Hanoi and Ha Long Bay. Nevertheless officials claim that more than 500,000 tourists will visit Vietnam in 1993 generating more than Dollars 200m in foreign earnings. The attractions are obvious - a little visited country with a fascinating past, areas of great scenic beauty, the romance of an Asia still living in the past and an excellent and varied cuisine. And it is cheap. For the hardy traveller, prepared for the unexpected and the stimulus of exotic adventure, Vietnam offers vastly different fare from the predictability of well-trodden destinations elsewhere in Asia. With the exception of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, decent hotel accommodation is in short supply. Transport is made difficult by the appalling state of roads and railways which have suffered from 50 years of war and neglect. A limited number of vehicles are available for hire and the public transport system creaks under the combined weight of humanity and the inheritance of ageing eastern European trucks and buses and still older vehicles left by the Americans in the 1970s. In an effort to conserve the environment and offer more exotic destinations to visitors, the government is looking at national parks and wildlife sanctuaries to see if they can be sensibly exploited. Some of these areas, such as Nam Cat Tien, where a small number of Javan rhinos roam a lowland swamp forest reserve 150km north of Ho Chi Minh City, will remain off-limits. Others, such as Cat Ba island in Ha Long Bay offer immediate opportunities for small groups intent on adventure and exploration. Ha Long Bay has long been considered one of the world's most spectacular seascapes. Hundreds of limestone islands, reminiscent of a Chinese landscape painting from Gwailin, emerge suddenly offshore from the flat Red River delta. Stretching more than 150km, the area is populated with hundreds of small fishing villages (and smugglers plying their trade between Hainan island and the Vietnamese mainland). Among the many motorised fishing vessels it is still possible to admire the graceful shape of a junk slowly wending her way through the maze of inlets and islands. For the most part uninhabited, many of the islands offer pristine beaches and countless unexplored caves. Cat Ba, the largest, covers more than 150 sq km with its rugged limestone hills and heavily forested valleys. Part of the island is a national park, home to the rare golden-headed langur monkey, numerous birds, the flora of evergreen tropical forests and a multitude of exotic butterflies. The forestry department's headquarters provides simple accommodation for about 30 people. Other diversions include visits to ancient fishing villages and enjoyment of plentiful fresh seafood. Although few organised tours exist to the more inaccessible parts of Vietnam, the department of ecotourism at the University of Hanoi will organise small group expeditions, obtaining the necessary provincial permits and providing transport and guides. Tourism offers instant dollars but it is hard to determine where this fits into overall government policy of trying to feed one of the most densely populated and poorest countries in the world. The arrival of multinational hotel chains, the sale of land concessions to foreigners for the construction of golf courses and an increasing mass of ignorant tourists suggest that the heroic discipline which served the Vietnamese so well throughout two anti-colonial wars has deserted them. Idyllic though Vietnam may now be, the temptations of easy wealth will ensure that today's unspoilt land will soon become another case of too much too quickly. Mark Graham is a Bangkok-based naturalist and business consultant who has co-authored books on the national parks and wildlife of Thailand.</p>

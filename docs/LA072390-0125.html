The crew decided to land at Petrozavodsk, 150 miles north of  Leningrad, the Tass news agency said.  </P> <P> Security officials arrested the two passengers, who were identified only as  Kovalenko, 22, a vocational training student, and Kuznetsov, a 27-year-old  bricklayer.  </P> <P> Five young Soviet men hijacked five airliners to Sweden and Finland in June and  July. They surrendered to police and said they wanted to stay in the Nordic  countries. Sweden extradited one of the men to the Soviet Union last week.  </P></p>

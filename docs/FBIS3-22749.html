			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 14  February in connection with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's  current visit to the United States to tune the ROK-U.S. policy  on the nuclear issue.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on page 5  a  1,600-world article by Washington-based correspondent Yang  Sung-hyon summing up Foreign Minister Han's visit to the United  States.    Recalling that North Korea begins to show signs of change  through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement while Foreign  Minister Han's U.S. visit was close to an end, the article  analyzes that Foreign Minister Han attempted to deliver three  different messages to North Korea through his U.S. visit.    The article says the first message is "the invariable  efforts  to settle the nuclear matter through dialogue." The article  notes that the ROK and the United States, through in-depth  discussions, were able to tug out an agreement to "open a  dialogue channel to the last moment for the solution of nuclear  problem."    The second message, the article maintains, is connected with  "the reports on a crisis on the Korean peninsula and the United  States preparing stern measures against North Korea." The  article interprets Han's expression of mild gestures as a move  to avoid the current situation on the Korean peninsula being  termed as a crisis. Citing the ROK-U.S. agreement that if the  North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, U.N.  action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than  through immediate sanctions, the article says Han made clear  that "the ROK and the United States have no intention of driving  North Korea to an extreme situation."    The third message, the article notes, is "an expression of  firm will to use a stick if North Korea continues to hold out to  the end." The article says that the ROK and U.S. Governments  try to deliver a warning to North Korea that unless North Korea  accepts inspections by the end of February, sanctions by the  international community against North Korea will be "out of our  hands."    The article sees that North Korea reacted to Han's such  messages through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement and  concludes that "in this perspective, Han's visit can be  evaluated as successful."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,400-word  article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Pyong-chin on  Foreign Minister Han's achievements during his U.S. visit.    Citing press reports focusing on possible military scenarios  in case of war on the Korean peninsula, the article says Han, in  connection with this, has calmed down the U.S. media's  aggravated reports by pointing out detailed points.    The article continues that "the purpose of Han's U.S. visit  is to narrow the differences in opinions for the solution of the  nuclear problem and to make correct diagnosis of the reports on  a crisis on the Korean peninsula by going into the epicenter of  the reports."    The article then adds that "President Kim's personal letter  to President Clinton also firmly reaffirmed ROK-U.S. cooperation  over the nuclear issue and expressed "concern and  unpleasantness" over the U.S. media's reports on a crisis on the  Korean peninsula.    The article concludes by saying that Han reassured the U.S.  media that the current military movements on the Korean  peninsula -- including the recent reports on concentration of  North Korean troops near the DMZ, deployment of the Patriot  missiles, and resumption of Team Spirit exercise -- are not  something new aimed at preparing steps to countermeasure a  possible crisis.</p>

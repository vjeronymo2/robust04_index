			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: "Deputies Feel White </F> Paper Is Acceptable"]    [Text] With neither enthusiasm, nor aversion: The white  paper on defense published last week will not cause a dispute --  at least not in the National Assembly. The deputies on the  defense and finance committees who started examining it did not  find anything -- regardless of their political leanings -- that  would lead to great or violent passions.    They read the government's guidelines for ensuring our  country's security between now to 2015 with "real interest,"  combined with "caution" and scattered "skepticism." They felt  that the work of the committee chaired by Marceau Long was  "suitable, honest, and satisfactory," and that the result was  "acceptable." That is what the respective committee chairmen,  Jacques and Jacques Boyon, said yesterday to Defense Minister  Francois Leotard.    The pride of France since the early 1980's, the consensus on  defense still endures. While there are some exceptions, the  vast majority of the National Assembly does not intend to call  into question these two pillars of nuclear deterrence and a  "mixed" Armed Forces model which is based on the principle of  conscription. The National Assembly also seems resolved to  maintain a "significant" budgetary effort, i.e., enough to  guarantee our decisionmaking autonomy.    Although the consensus is comprehensive, it nevertheless  gives the impression of cracking, or even splitting apart, since  there are now a great many ambiguities and reservations on which  it rests. The primary quality of the white paper stressed  Jacques Boyon (of the RPR (Rally for the Republic), Ain) quite  clearly is that it does not compromise the future. "It does not  close any doors," the implication being that it will not act as  a constraint on the future president of the republic, who will  be elected in 1995.  <H5>  Debate on M5 </H5>   The cleverness of the exercise appears with regard to the  nuclear issue. The white paper satisfies supporters and  opponents of resuming testing. "The moratorium does not  currently penalize our discussion, but they will have to be  resumed," echoed Francois Leotard. Similarly, it does not  bother enthusiasts of any given weapons system. However, on  this topic, there are many nuances within the parliamentary  majority. A good illustration of this is the debate surrounding  the production of the M5, a missile intended to arm  missile-launching submarines around 2010 and which, in 1992, was  the subject of a decision regarding missile launches made by  Francois Mitterrand. Today, Jacques Chirac feels it is an  "urgent matter," while Jacques Boyon and Rene Galy-Dejean  [members of the National Assembly], for example, feel that a  postponement would not be disastrous.    The defense minister does not go along with the idea of  accelerating this program which, he reiterated, could not have  been launched until 1995. He also confided that he does not  intend to give the M5 the same warhead as the M45, or to make an  S5 version for the Albion platform -- "the cost of that would be  unreasonable" -- unlike what Francois Mitterrand let it be  understood.    As for the future military planning law, the deputies and  the  defense minister agreed to meet again, when the government has  undertaken the necessary and difficult arbitration between the  Defense Ministry and the Budget Ministry. Francois Leotard said  he was satisfied that the basis chosen by the prime minister  should be the 100.4 billion francs in equipment credits to be  made available in 1994. From then on, he scarcely hopes to  obtain more than a rise of 0.5 percent in constant francs. Such  a result would just be acceptable for the Defense Ministry in  view of the programs already begun and the new operational  needs. However, at the same time it would be a notable  exception to the law on controlling public spending.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MARYLAND;  </P> <P> JEWISH SECONDARY SCHOOL VANDALIZED  </P> <P> Vandals tore through a Jewish secondary school in Silver Spring, Md., upending  furniture and equipment and smashing bottles of laboratory chemicals. Police in  the Washington suburb said the 12-room school, Yeshiva of Greater Washington,  apparently was invaded late Tuesday, the fifth night of the Jewish festival of  Hanukkah. The school, which has 85 students in grades seven through 12, was  closed this week. The vandalism was classified as a "hate-violence incident"  because of messages left behind, officials said. The word "Satan" was written  in chalk on a blackboard and the words "Roman Catholics rule" were scribbled  across six lockers.  </P></p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: Contracting-out plan is asking too much Sir, The fact that the minister for market testing, William Waldegrave, believes a letter from the prime minister will sort out the dire mess his contracting-out programme is in demonstrates just how out of touch he is with the situation in departments and agencies. ('Major intervenes over market testing delays', June 28). Next week, my union will be publishing a study based on the detailed analysis of almost 200 current market tests. The report reveals that almost half of them stand little realistic chance of being completed by Mr Waldegrave's September 1993 completion date. As the second round of tests is due to begin shortly afterwards, we expect that this backlog will effectively mean departments having to undertake more than 500 tests over the next 12 months. Since Pounds 10m has already been spent to get less than a dozen contracts in total, the overall cost of this exercise is likely to be immense. Apart from not having the resources to carry out contracting out on the scale set by Mr Waldegrave, departments are still in a state of near paralysis over his repeated refusal to say whether the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations will apply to central government work. This has resulted in contractors putting in two bids for each contract on a Tupe and a non-Tupe basis. Our analysis reveals that for every 10 contracts tendered, departments are having to evaluate an average of 200 bids. Instead of getting the prime minister to write him a wee note, William Waldegrave should admit that he is asking for too much, too soon, and call an immediate moratorium on further market tests. If he does not, the chaos and confusion will only intensify, at great cost to the taxpayer, as well as to the overall detriment of our public services.

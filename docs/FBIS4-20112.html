			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Tax Increases"] </F>   [Excerpt] On Tuesday [26 April] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky  stated that, not least because of the transition measures  envisaged in the agreement between the Social Democratic Party  of Austria and the Austrian People's Party, raising taxes will  not be necessary in the eventuality of accession to the European  Union [EU].    The planned financial means serve to support economic  development and thus revitalize consumption. This automatically  leads to higher tax revenues. Vranitzky also expects a positive  effect on purchasing from planned stricter price controls to  make sure that price reductions resulting from EU membership are  indeed passed on to the consumer.    The government has passed on to parliament the necessary  documents to discuss accession to the EU in time so that both  the government and the opposition have a "sufficient cushion of  time" to discuss the matter. Thus, in his view, there is  nothing that speaks against holding the referendum on 12 June,  Vranitzky stressed. Austria has decided to hold the referendum  before summer because his understanding of democracy indicates  that the people's positive decision should be made by the time  the EU Treaty, with the four new members, is signed at the end  of June. No one should get the impression that the government  is signing such an important treaty over the heads of the  people, Vranitzky said.    In deciding the amounts set down in the agreement to finance  the balanced package for professional and social groups, the  government relied on the official figures provided by the  Economics Research Institute [WIFO]. Asked about the statements  by WIFO expert Fritz Breuss to the parliamentary EU committee,  Vranitkzy said that there is a "wide range of expert opinion";  he can, however only rely on official figures. Vranitzky thinks  that the figures used in the agreement are appropriate, but he  admits that it has been clear from the very start that during  the first two or three years after accession to the EU there  will be a difficult budget situation because of the economic  stimuli, which, however, will also ease because of the better  economic prospects in the EU.    In Vranitzky's view, in addition to agriculture and  manufacturing industry, the most important items of the  agreement are improvements in labor law and health, the  introduction of the European shop council, the reactivation of  Article 39a of the Labor Market Promotion Law, and the promise  to support the Austrian steel industry with money from the  budget if analogous measures are introduced in the EU.    Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider sees  his negative attitude toward the EU confirmed by the information  provided by WIFO expert Fritz Breuss. In Breuss' view, the  budget deficit threatens to rise to 135 billion schillings and  tax increases cannot be avoided. In the view of Greens Deputy  Johannes Voggenhuber, WIFO expert Breuss is telling the truth  about the consequences of EU membership for the budget. The  government is covering up this matter and exerting pressure on  the WIFO, Voggenhuber said.    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer distanced himself from Breuss'  statements at the parliamentary EU hearing. "We did not arrive  at these figures," Kramer said. This is the "private opinion of  the expert."    The Ministry of Agriculture also rejected Breuss' statement  and stressed that the claim that 100 billion schillings are to  be paid to Austrian agriculture over the next four years for  adjustments to the EU is completely unfounded. In addition, the  theory that solidarity leads to budget problems is untenable,  nor can one speak of excessive compensation for losses in  agricultural income.    FPOe politicians Walter Meischberger and Holger Bauer called  the chancellor's statements an "incredible faux pas" and said  that the head of government is ridiculing WIFO experts.    Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina and State Secretary  Johannes Ditz also made it clear that Austria's accession to the  EU will not entail higher taxes.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Now comes the hard part: France's new government has little room for manoeuvre on the economic front Even before the election, France's conservatives knew that winning would be easy, but governing far harder. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, long-time favourite for the job he assumed this week, had his priorities well-prepared. Within minutes of convening his new cabinet on Wednesday, he instructed his ministers to cut FFr20bn (Pounds 2.5bn) from the budget to finance tax incentives boosting the construction industry; to examine new ways of halting the relentless rise in unemployment; and to salvage the country's pension and unemployment insurance systems. But he was equally quick to announce that he would travel to Germany as soon as Chancellor Helmut Kohl could see him. After months of reflection, Mr Balladur, and indeed the leadership of his RPR Gaullist party and of its centre-right UDF partner, can see no way out of France's macro-economic impasse except to throw their monetary and trade concerns at Mr Kohl's feet, and seek a more equal relationship with their stronger German partner. For, the new government badly needs a rapid improvement in the economy. The rise in industrial output by 0.4 per cent in January, after three months in which gross domestic product fell by 0.5 per cent, has not shaken the conviction of most government and bank economists in France that the economy is totally flat. Without improvement, unemployment will go on rising beyond its February level of 3,024,000 or 10.6 per cent of the work force. It may even show a sharp momentary jump in early summer when several hundred thousand young people finish a temporary work scheme set up by the departed Socialists. The audit which the prime minister has commissioned of state finances will show them in a sorry state after two years of Socialist passivity in the face of looming recession. The state's central budget deficit was FFr226bn last year, and it will be nearer FFr300bn this year. The pension and unemployment insurance schemes, funded by employer/employee contributions, are also more than FFr65bn in the red, and the state may have to step in here to bail them out. But the French economy is not in its 'worst shape since the second world war', as Mr Balladur said on the campaign trail in a piece of electoral exaggeration. With low inflation, competitive wages, and a high rate of personal savings which would flow in massive amounts from money market funds into the stock market and thence into productive investment - if only interest rates would come down by several points - France is well-poised to take advantage of any recovery in its export markets. The key, of course, to kick-starting this process is a drop in interest rates, which have been kept at a high level to maintain the franc's parity with the D-Mark in the European Monetary System. Until the Bundesbank lowers German interest rates, French hands are tied. But if and when German rates comes down significantly and if France's budget deficit and unemployment have stabilised or are heading downwards by the end of this year, the Balladur government can optimistically expect economic growth of nearly 2 per cent next year. This would give the centre-right government a good prospect of staying in power for the next seven years and of helping a conservative candidate, probably Mr Jacques Chirac, into the Elysee in 1995. A President Chirac would probably capitalise on his victory by immediately calling legislative elections. It is hard to see the French centre-right, now holding 400 seats more than the combined remnants of the French left, losing even in two years. The left may well be out of government for the next seven years. This would give Mr Balladur time for the longer term aspects of his programme - such as gradually taking the cost of France's welfare state off the shoulders of companies and putting it on the back of the state budget - provided he can somehow relaunch growth in the short term. In his first move, Mr Balladur has chosen not to reflect fully the electorate's rightward lurch at the polls in the make-up of his cabinet. He has put a centrist stamp on it. This is good consensus politics. He is conscious of the fact that the RPR and UDF won only 40 per cent of the vote in the first round, though a higher share in the run-off. But the new cabinet will produce no radical solutions to the country's economic problems. Free-market Thatcherism has few adherents in France, and they do not include Mr Balladur, nor Mr Chirac or Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the leaders of the RPR and UDF, respectively. These party bosses are not in the government but will cast a long shadow over it. Mr Chirac has ruled out any lowering of the minimum wage (which might be one way of preventing the least-qualified workers being priced out of the job market), while Mr Giscard d'Estaing has ruled out extending privatisation to a sale of monopoly utilities (despite the money that it would bring in). In political and economic terms, Mr Balladur has, in fact, little elbow room, even on his announced FFr20bn worth of budget savings. He inherits a 1993 budget which his predecessor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, had recently trimmed by FFr20bn (freezing FFr15bn worth of public spending and cancelling another FFr5bn). Most of the impact of these measures was on the army, provoking complaints from the conservatives who, now in government, will want to let the axe fall elsewhere, probably on education. But most of the FFr1,367bn budget is virtually untouchable, with FFr900bn committed on pay or debt service. Wherever the savings are found, they will be used to finance tax incentives for the construction and property sectors, which have been hard hit by recession. The government has come to power with the promise - ambitious in an economic slowdown - of decreasing the overall burden of direct taxes on both companies and individuals. Mr Balladur will not announce his programme until next Thursday. But there is a plan to reform the system under which all individuals pay the country's special welfare tax, and another proposal for the state, over 10 years, to take over the cost of family allowances which at present amount to FFr150bn and are paid by employers and employees. Employees would, therefore, be better off, but instead of taking the extra money home, they would have to put it into savings plans. Indirect taxes, by contrast, may well rise further on the usual excise targets of alcohol, tobacco and petrol. But only growth will really swell the state's depleted coffers, and that depends on interest rates coming down. A Balladur adviser reckons that 'we have a potential margin of manoeuvre to bring our rates down by more than six points', because France's short-term rates are a couple of points above those of Germany, whose inflation rate is a couple of points above that of France, and because German rates themselves should come down by a couple of points in the next few months. In using even a fraction of this 'potential' to cut French rates, while keeping the franc in lock-step with the D-Mark, the government knows it cannot move ahead of market sentiment. But to hurry that sentiment along, it is trying to enlist German support. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new finance minister, paid the Bundesbank a visit on March 24, after his election outright on the first round but before his ministerial nomination. Mr Alain Juppe, the new foreign minister, is to visit Bonn in the next few days, followed by Mr Balladur later in the month. Their collective message is that France will shortly - by July, say some government advisers - pass a law giving the Banque de France autonomy in monetary policy. France and Germany will then have two governments with the same ideological stamp and with central banks of the same independence, ideally suited to share in monetary policy- setting, or at least to take more account of each other's monetary concerns. 'From the moment that the Germans accept that they will no longer decide (on monetary policy) alone, we will have taken a decisive step to European monetary union,' said Mr Alphandery this week. It is not yet clear that the German authorities will respond favourably to a rather imprecise French government request to 'share' monetary policymaking. But it is clear that France's new government is unhappy about the constraints on its monetary and trade policies. The conservatives have been out of power for five years. They feel the Socialists acquiesced in a Maastricht timetable which is too long to suit France's needs and in a Gatt negotiation which does not take proper account of French interests. Determined to be less passive than its predecessor, the new government is trying, with Germany's help, to redefine the rules of the game.</p>

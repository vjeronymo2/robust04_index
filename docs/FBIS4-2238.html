			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa will announce his resignation to the nation at a mid-  afternoon news conference after convening a final cabinet  meeting, Masayoshi Takemura, the chief government spokesman said.    Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted a leader of his ruling  coalition as saying that Hosokawa would resign to take  responsibility for controversy over his personal finances, a  coalition party leader said [sentence as received].    An extraordinary cabinet meeting is planned to be held at  0515 GMT, Takemura told reporters.    Komeito party chief Yuichi Ichikawa said on television, "the  prime minister told us he would resign from office."    Hosokawa had been under opposition pressure to step down  over  a 100 million yen (952,000 U.S. dollars) loan he took in 1982  from a trucking firm, later to figure in the money-and-mobsters  scandal which last year toppled the Liberal Democratic Party  from power.    The opposition has staged a month-long boycott of budget  business in parliament, demanding Hosokawa allow a former aide  to testify to the assembly on the matter. But Hosokawa refused.    Ichikawa said that Hosokawa had tried all he could to clear  up controversy over the loan issue, but he had just learned of  unspecified further illegalities over the cash.    Hosokawa came to power last August after his eight-party  coalition defeated the long-ruling LDP in general elections.    JIJI news agency reported that Hosokawa expressed his desire  to resign in a meeting with leaders of his coalition government  at the prime ministers official residence this afternoon.</p>

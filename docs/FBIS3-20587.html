There presently are 88 national  distilleries and 90 breweries in the province and annual  production of spirits and beer is nearly 1 million tons. Taxes  and profits realized from spirits and beer in addition to wine  and state commercial alcoholic beverage sales in recent years  have exceeded 700 million yuan, making up an important part of  provincial revenue.    But these reporters understand from the people concerned  that  in recent years, Heilongjiang's alcoholic beverage production  and sales both have been in a rather chaotic state, not only  causing serious erosion of revenue, but more directly  endangering consumers' physical health.    Alcoholic beverage production is out of overall control.  Based on calculations of current production capability,  throughout the province state enterprise production of spirits  is 100,000 tons greater than sales and production of beer in  200,000 tons greater than sales. In some state enterprises,  production capacity is idle and with results still not fully  brought into play, small individual distilleries have grown  incrementally. According to incomplete statistics, in 1991 there  were 879 small distilleries throughout the province, and this  year it has already reached 2,500. According to a survey, the  vast majority of small distilleries do not meet standard  production conditions. They do not have specialized technicians  and they do not have testing equipment. Some even sell diluted  industrial alcohol. What causes extremely serious consequences  is that fatal poisonings continue to occur. In March 1993, a  farmer, Bu Sulong [0592 4790 7893], in Songjiang village,  Songjiang township on the outskirts of Jiamusi without any  license operated a small private distillery, used adulterated  industrial alcohol diluted with unboiled water to make spirits  in bulk, and peddled 1,500 kilograms to thirteen sales points in  that locality, poisoning five people to death, paralyzing three  people, and blinding three people in both eyes. An inordinate  amount of poisonings also occurred in Bin county last year  causing injury and death. Because of their limited technology,  small distilleries' grain consumption is generally twice that of  state distilleries. According to statistics, in this province  alone, 150 million kilograms of grain is wasted.    According to surveys, the existence of small distilleries  depends mainly on tax loopholes. Experts reveal that if they  paid 10 percent taxes, all small distilleries would lose money.  The current state distillery tax is levied at 35 percent. Based  on this calculation, every year throughout the province taxes  evaded by small distilleries reach 50 million yuan or more.    The alcoholic beverage sales market is out of control. Since  the circulation system has been reformed and the state  commercial monopoly has been broken, channels for circulating  alcoholic beverages have increased and a brisk market has  flourished. But at the same time it has brought some problems.  The first is that falsely labeled alcoholic beverages have run  rampant. In 1992 alone, throughout the province special  alcoholic beverage sales control organizations confiscated more  than 260,000 bottles of fake Maotai and fake Wuliang.    The second is that low-grade spirits diluted with ethyl  alcohol are flooding the market. In 1992 throughout the  province, special alcoholic beverage sales control organizations  confiscated more than 200,000 kilograms of low-grade alcoholic  beverages made by individuals using ethyl alcohol diluted with  unboiled water, and in 1993 they confiscated more than 300,000  kilograms.    Experts believe that the key to turning around the chaotic  situation in the production and sale of alcoholic beverages is  in learning from other provinces and augmenting special  alcoholic beverage sales controls and speeding up special sales  legislation for alcoholic beverages.</p>

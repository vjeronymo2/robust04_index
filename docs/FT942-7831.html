			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / British Council theft linked to gang behind Pounds 1/2m fraud A gang responsible for defrauding the British Council of more than Pounds 500,000 appears to be behind a cheque theft that has cost the government-funded body more than Pounds 70,000, the Treasury has admitted. In its response to a critical report from the Commons public accounts committee on the original fraud, the Treasury said subsequent police inquiries uncovered the theft of two blank cheques from the council, the body which promotes UK cultural interests overseas. One was used to draw Pounds 70,104.60 in April 1992. The other, which has not been presented, has been cancelled. Police have concluded that the theft was carried out by the same gang that stole Pounds 520,072 by transferring funds electronically into the overseas bank accounts of bogus suppliers in December 1992. A British Council employee has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the theft, and has been suspended pending the outcome of police and council inquiries. Police believe that the discovery of the cheque theft has established an internal connection between the gang that committed the earlier fraud and the council, the Treasury said. Mr John Hanson, the council's director-general, told the public accounts committee in December that the gang had access to 'insider information'. In its report on the fraud published in March, the committee criticised the failure to identify the source of the information.</p>

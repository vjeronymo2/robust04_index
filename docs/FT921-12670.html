			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Baseball chiefs strike out bid by Nintendo founder to buy US team BASEBALL being as American as apple pie, it came as little surprise yesterday when US authorities gave a Japanese bid to buy a controlling interest in the Seattle Mariners baseball team a polite but firm brush-off. Mr Fay Vincent, the all-powerful commissioner of baseball, said Americans should be flattered by the interest shown by a group of investors led by Nintendo, the world's largest video game company. But in its present form, the bid was unlikely to gain approval, he said. The Japanese offer of Dollars 100m for 60 per cent of Seattle Mariners, one of the less glamorous teams in baseball, has come at a delicate moment in US-Japan relations. President Bush's disastrous trip to Tokyo this month has magnified American fears about Japan's industrial and financial muscle. Mr Vincent said the issue of foreign ownership had already been settled, with baseball team owners expressing a strong preference in favour of local ownership. 'We're presented with a very difficult and complicated set of problems,' he said. Any sale would have to be approved by a majority of major league team owners who were due to hold a telephone conference late yesterday. The Japanese consortium bid was supported by some of the best known business and political names in Seattle, and the current team has threatened to move out of town unless a deal is struck. Even though Japan-US tensions are running high, the Yamauchi family, founders of Nintendo, hope to avoid attack in the US by emphasising their offer comes in response to an appeal for help from Seattle politicians. Mr Booth Gardner, the local state governor, and other leaders appealed to Nintendo in order to stop Mr Jeff Smulyan, a West Coast businessman and the Mariners' owner, selling the team to another city. Japanese buyers have been criticised in the past in the US for acquiring landmarks of American culture including Columbia Pictures and control of the Rockefeller Centre in Manhattan. Nevertheless, the appeal from Seattle sets the Mariners deal apart from other Japanese investments. Mr Smulyan, a radio station owner and baseball fan who bought the Mariners in 1989, is being forced to sell the team to clear debts. Other cities are trying to buy the Mariners' franchise but the team's lease on their stadium required them to first try a local buyer. When none emerged, people in Seattle began to grow restless. With a deadline of March 27 for an offer fast approaching, Mr Gardner, the governor of Washington state, wrote to Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, the president of Nintendo, which has its US headquarters in Seattle and is one of the larger local employers. The Yamauchis put together a consortium in which they took a 60 per cent stake and the rest was divided among Seattle businessmen. The consortium has offered to pay Dollars 100m to Mr Smulyan and invest a further Dollars 25m in the club. Mr Yamauchi said yesterday that he was responding to an appeal. He had no interest in baseball, only in helping the citizens of Seattle, he said. He added he was acting in a personal capacity not on behalf of Nintendo which would have nothing to do with the club. 'I have no intention of doing something which would hurt national feelings.'</p>

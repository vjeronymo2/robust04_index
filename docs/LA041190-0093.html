			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY'S OLDEST WORKER GOING STRONG AT 91  </P> <P> Poring over a computer printout of every type of crime code listed at the  city's Police Department, records assistant Murray Ross shakes his head  incredulously at the thick stack of pages.  </P> <P> "When I see all the stupid things that people are up to, it's amazing to me,"  he said. "I guess I have a Pollyanna attitude about overlooking deficiencies in  human nature."  </P> <P> Naive optimism, perhaps, but he makes no apologies. Ross, who turned 91 on  Tuesday, believes that this quality has been the key to his long life.  </P> <P> He is the city's oldest employee, and works 20 hours a week in the Police  Department's records division, where he was hired in 1987 under its senior aide  program.  </P> <P> "He's so sharp for a person his age. He's remarkable," said Pat Davies, Ross'  supervisor. "We've really lucked out with our senior aide program in general,  and Murray has been exceptional."  </P> <P> And Ross said he may well continue working past his 100th birthday. Throughout  his life, he said, he has faced obstacles much more formidable than age.  </P> <P> A son of Russian Jews, he said he has never been daunted by the anti-Semitism  he has encountered his entire life. As a theater manager through five decades,  he survived the arrival of television that nearly devastated the movie  business.  </P> <P> And when doctors told him on two separate occasions that his days were  numbered, he wouldn't believe them.  </P> <P> The first time was in 1930 when, during the Depression, Ross was stricken with  polio. At that time, the disease typically was a harbinger of lifetime  disability or death.  </P> <P> Ross said the illness contributed to the demise of his first marriage and loss  of his successful job with RKO studios in Los Angeles, and initially left him  incapacitated.  </P> <P> But he kept on working.  </P> <P> He moved to Seattle to take advantage of a hydrotherapy program for polio  victims, and landed another theater management position. Four years later, he  was walking again. None of the symptoms ever recurred.  </P> <P> "Things looked pretty bleak for a while though," Ross recalled. "I remember at  the time getting a letter from the White House. President Roosevelt had heard  about my situation and invited me to visit. I decided not to go, though,  because I didn't think it would be of any help to me. I thought nothing would  help me more than my willpower to overcome my deficiencies."  </P> <P> In 1984, Ross, at 85, developed an aortic aneurysm -- just weeks after he  attended the funeral of a friend who died of the same affliction.  </P> <P> But eventually, he made a nearly complete recovery.  </P> <P> Since then, Ross said his health has been relatively good.  </P> <P> Besides his job, he also heads up his block's Neighborhood Watch committee and  helps care for his wife of 52 years, Mimi.  </P> <P> "Can you believe it? I'm going to be 91," he said a few days before his  birthday. "I don't feel it, or look it or act it. I might just get to see the  21st Century. My kids are taking bets on it." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAW IN HUBBLE TELESCOPE  </P> <P> Astronomers, among others, like to talk about parity in discussing physical  systems; mirror images of stuff or even their properties.  </P> <P> It looks as though the Hubble Telescope is a clear confirmation that the much  sought after serendipity in scientific investigations obeys parity. I doubt  that there has been a more clear example of not "finding valuable or agreeable  things not sought for"; negative serendipity, that is. Or is it  anti-serendipity? I forget.  </P> <P> ELMER H. RICE  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

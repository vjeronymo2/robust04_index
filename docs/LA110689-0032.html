			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> RELIGION MAY HAVE COST SOLDIER A MEDAL  </P> <P> Army investigators will decide this month whether a veteran said to have killed  more than 500 Japanese soldiers during a single encounter in World War II was  denied the Medal of Honor because he is Jewish, the New York Times reported.  David Rubitsky, 72, a retired merchant seaman who lives in Wisconsin, and his  supporters say that the veteran, armed only with a machine gun, a carbine and  an automatic rifle, cut down 500 to 600 enemy troops in New Guinea in December,  1942. The New York Times said that two of Rubitsky's superiors recommended him  for the Medal of Honor but a third rejected the idea because Rubitsky is  Jewish. The paper said that an important piece of evidence is a handwritten  message from a Japanese officer who said he elected to commit suicide for his  role in a battle in which "600 fine Japanese soldiers died because of a  solitary American soldier."  </P></p>

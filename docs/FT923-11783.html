			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Fears on welfare cost dismissed FEARS that thousands of European Community citizens living outside Britain will add millions to the bill for UK welfare benefits are groundless, the British government said yesterday. The scare arose after a ruling in the European Court of Justice that the UK government was wrong to deny family credit, which is designed to supplement low incomes, to the wife of a civil servant who worked in Northern Ireland but lived in the Irish Republic. The court held that the UK's arguments would impede freedom of movement for workers - a right that is one of the EC's principal long-term goals. The ruling means that people who travel to work in Britain leaving dependants behind in their home states will be able to claim family credit on behalf of their families. The ruling is believed not to apply to other benefits. 'We are not expecting a flood of successful claims costing the Treasury millions,' The Department of Social Security said. 'You have to be on a low income to qualify for it, and most EC workers either bring their families with them or are single people with no dependants.' The maximum permitted income for a successful claim is at present Pounds 11,180. That would rule out most people from other EC states who work in the UK. A family on that income with one child aged between 16 and 17 would be entitled to Pounds 1.47 a week. Nevertheless, the DSS said it shared the concerns of the German government, which is worried about additional pressure on already tight social security budgets. The DSS said it believed UK nationals working in other member states would not enjoy reciprocal benefits.</p>

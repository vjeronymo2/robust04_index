			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign </F> affairs of Russia, by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA observer Denis  Molchanov; place and date not given: "Was There a Breakthrough  by Russian Diplomacy?"]    [Text]    [Molchanov] Vitaliy Ivanovich, whose idea was it to commit a  Russian battalion to Bosnia?    [Churkin] I believe that this initiative was born somewhere  between Yeltsin and Kozyrev on Saturday, 12 February. I was in  Geneva and was about to leave for Moscow. I suddenly received a  call from Sergey Lavrov (deputy minister of foreign affairs of  Russia-- D.M.), and, citing the president, he conveyed  instructions that I fly to Belgrade to discuss the situation  that had taken shape following the ultimatum with the Serbian  president. I flew to Belgrade that same day and was speaking  with Milosevic in the evening. Then came Skopje, Zagreb, and  Sarajevo and meetings with Izetbegovic and Silajdzic. Following  the news conference in Zagreb, I was approached by our  ambassador in Croatia, who said that I had to fly to Belgrade--I  would be told why on arrival.    In Belgrade I was connected with Kozyrev by HF from the  embassy bunker, and he directed me for the first time: work this  option through with the Serbs--at Russia's request they put  their arms under UN control, and we commit our contingent to  Sarajevo.    I said immediately that this was a brilliant idea. I took it  to Milosevic, he summoned Karadzic, and the three of us talked  together. The main task was to invest this initiative with the  most precise form possible. The Serbs had to be convinced that  our battalion would be in Sarajevo in timely fashion, and our  aims had to be explained precisely to the world community.    I spoke by telephone with Grachev, Ryurikov, Lavrov, and  Kolesnikov. With Pavel Sergeyevich (Grachev--D.M.) the  conversation took just two minutes: He assured me immediately  that tomorrow he would give the order for preparation for action.    But I still had to receive the text of Yeltsin's actual  message to Milosevic. Incidentally, up to the decisive moment I  had not told the latter that this would be a letter signed by  Boris Nikolayevich. This was my final trump card. And when, on  Thursday morning, I went to the president of Serbia with a  message signed by the president of Russia, Milosevic put a high  value on this.    But this was not the end of the matter. It should be  remembered that, granted all the authority of Milosevic and  Karadzic, obtaining their "go-ahead" was only half the matter.  The Bosnian Serbs are a law unto themselves, as they say, and  would never do anything that was even to the least extent  contrary to their interests (as was the case with the Vance-Owen  plan, incidentally, when the Serbs said a firm "no"). So that  even after the conversation with the president of Serbia, I was  not wholly confident of success. This was why we went to Pale,  where we met with the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs, and only  then did I understand that the mission could be considered  accomplished.    [Molchanov] Yes, this truly was a breakthrough. But should  things have reached the phase where this breakthrough was  necessary?    [Churkin] It would have been better had they not, of course.  We had been conducting the process so as to ensure that a crisis  over Sarajevo not arise. Back at the end of January we had  proposed a two-tier plan for a settlement of the conflict:  convening a session of the UN Security Council at foreign  minister level with an invitation to the representatives of the  belligerents in order to seek a political solution. The second  proposal amounted to a reinforcement of the conditions of the  security zone--we had in mind Sarajevo primarily, of course. But  these proposals were not accepted.    On 6 February, following the explosion in Sarajevo's market  square, I called Milosevic and said: "Mr. President, the  question of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo must be settled  now. The parties will be meeting this week in Geneva, and this  simply must not be 'one further successful round of  negotiations,' the issue must be settled."    Milosevic agreed. We went to Geneva. Late in the evening I  turned on the television in the hotel room and heard Clinton's  statement and, immediately after this, the news conference given  by Woerner (NATO secretary general--D.M.)--the ultimatum. It was  immediately clear that continuing the negotiations was futile  because the participants were looking more at the skies than at  their partners.    Incidentally--the NATO people prefer to forget about this  now-- the decision on the transfer of heavy arms to UN control  had been adopted by the Serbs and Muslims with the mediation of  General Rose, commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia,  several hours before the announcement of the ultimatum. Thus  NATO issued the ultimatum after the decision had already been  made. And I, naturally, have the impression that the most  important thing for NATO was not the lifting of the blockade of  Sarajevo but striking a blow at the Serbs. Many people would  like to change the political situation by means of such actions,  but this would have very serious consequences.    [Molchanov] What is the explanation for the strange position  of the UN secretary general, who farmed out the adoption of the  decision on a bombing assault to the NATO command?    [Churkin] I would not want to criticize Butrus-Ghali but my  personal opinion is that he was being subjected to colossal  pressure on the part of a number of NATO countries, which very  much wanted to bring matters to the point of an ultimatum.    Being subjected to pressure is the essence of the work of  the  secretary general, come to that. I would merely like the UN  secretary general to cooperate more with the UN Security Council  than the NATO Council.    We cannot agree with a situation where the right to  interpret  Security Council decisions is given over to another  organization. And NATO, in interpreting these decisions, even  attempted to dictate  to the United Nations what should be done.    This is why those who maintain that Russia has seized the  propaganda initiative and that everything would have been o.k.  according to the NATO ultimatum in any case are wrong. No, our  role was, in fact, pivotal. Take just the following fact:  Despite the agreement between the Serbs and the Muslims, the  intensive withdrawal of artillery only began following the  commitment of the Russian soldiers. We asked the Serbs why. They  replied: The public would not allow us! Women and children would  gather and stand in the way of the equipment. But when we told  them that a Russian battalion was coming, this was another  matter....    To be honest, when I was working on this problem, the main  thing that I tried to prevent was Russia's national humiliation.  Not a further escalation in Bosnia--although I did not want  this, of course, and my instructions here were clear--but  humiliation of Russia. For if on this occasion also everything  was handled without us, if we allowed ourselves to be brushed  off this time also, the consequences, despite our present  dispirited self-awareness, could have been more onerous for us  than the Bosnians.    [Molchanov] Truly, for the first time in the entire  post-Soviet period we permitted ourselves our own say in the  world. What brought about this change?    [Churkin] There was a transition from quantity to quality.  Earlier the line had been as follows: If we do not like  something or other, we shall not say "no" immediately, but shall  attempt to find a common language with our partners. But in time  our reluctance to get into a confrontation came to be perceived  by some people as spinelessness. And we said: Enough! All the  "i's" need to be dotted. As Yeltsin did in conversation with  Major: "We will not permit it without Russia!..."    [Molchanov] I was recently talking with Vladimir Lukin,  chairman of the State Duma's International Affairs Committee. He  commented quite sharply on the American position in respect to  Russia. "One quickly becomes accustomed to pleasant things," he  said, "and America had very quickly become accustomed to us  agreeing with Washington on just about everything." Today we  have begun to speak with our own voice, and we have immediately  been accused of neo-imperialism....    [Churkin] Well, first, I would say that these charges are  not  the official position of the United States, they are not Clinton  and not Christopher. These statements belong more to the  opposition. After all, the present president of the United  States has set serious store, the main store, perhaps, in his  foreign policy by Russia. But there are symptoms of attempts  being made to take us for simpletons (at some forum or another,  say: What do you mean by opposing me, we are partners, accept my  draft!). But we are increasingly seldom affording pretexts for  people to talk to us in this way.    [Molchanov] That is, the transitional period is coming to an  end?    [Churkin] Yes, unequivocally. We have drawn the line, I  believe. And this line was drawn in Bosnia.    [Molchanov] We are restoring to ourselves great-power  status,  in other words?    [Churkin] Yes, we are moving along this path. Of course,  this  is impossible without a certain reinforcement--as in Sarajevo.  Had we not had this battalion, what then? It is clear to  everyone that there cannot be a great power without strong armed  forces capable of accomplishing the mission entrusted to them at  the modern level. And this work is under way. Our new military  doctrine corresponds to these requirements in full.    [Molchanov] All this is well and good, but it seems to me  that these goals are unattainable until the national  self-awareness of the Russian people has been revived. But what  is to happen when even such concepts as "patriotism" and "love  for the motherland," have just about been given over to the  opposition?    [Churkin] I believe that this was the democrats' biggest  mistake when they began to use the word "patriot," albeit in  quotation marks, in a disparaging sense. The word "patriot" is  not enclosed in quotation marks, in the same way that the word  "Motherland" is written with a capital letter. When people say  "patriot," I consider that this is addressed to me, just as the  democrats should have considered it addressed to them.    [Molchanov] The result is that the word "democrat" is now  enclosed in quotation marks.    [Churkin] Yes, I believe that the losses on account of this  have been very serious. We should have learned to equate the  concepts "democracy" and "patriotism." Another, not mistake  even, but tragedy, has been the fact that our democrats imagine  the concept of "democracy" to be inseparable from the idea of  the disintegration of the state. We are still dealing with the  consequences of this delusion.    [Molchanov] Vitaliy Ivanovich, how, in your opinion, will  events develop in the former Yugoslavia?    [Churkin] I have convinced myself repeatedly that to be an  optimist in Yugoslav matters is to be a fool. One thing I can  say: Our initiative prevented the intervention of the armed  forces of NATO in the conflict, and this would have done no  good. Aside from all else, in the event of our diplomatic  failure, there would have been here, in Russia, a reassessment  of our relations with the West, but no longer on the basis about  which we have spoken--partnership with precise emphases--but  closer to a position of strength.    As far as a forecast is concerned.... In any event, peace  there is impossible without the consent of Russia, America, and  Europe. Perhaps we will succeed in arriving at some arrangements  in the coming weeks. But the main thing, I believe, is that the  worst is behind us.</p>

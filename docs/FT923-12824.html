			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: US pulp and paper group breaks even GEORGIA-PACIFIC, the US forest products group, has reported break-even results for the second quarter, with a sharp drop in pulp and paper profits partly offset by a big rise in lumber income. The company announced earlier this month that its results would be 'slightly better than break-even'. The break-even figure, compared with net income of Dollars 29m, or 34 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year when the company was helped by a Dollars 29m after-tax gain on the sale of forests. Sales for the latest quarter, at Dollars 3bn, were unchanged from last year. For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 5m, or 6 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 5.88bn, against a net loss of Dollars 44m, or 51 cents, last year, on sales of Dollars 5.76bn. ***** Dun &amp; Bradstreet, US business information group, yesterday posted second-quarter net income of Dollars 128.8m, or 72 cents a share, compared with Dollars 119.1m, or 67 cents, a year ago, writes Karen Zagor. The company has restated its 1991 results to reflect new accounting standards and the recognition of revenue for software services. Revenues eased to Dollars 1.16bn from Dollars 1.17bn, reflecting the divestiture of the communications unit of the company's IMS International division. Revenue growth for Dun &amp; Bradstreet's portfolio of businesses rose about 3 per cent in the quarter. For the first six months, the company had net income of Dollars 227m, or Dollars 1.27, against Dollars 217.5m, or Dollars 1.22 a year earlier. Operating revenue slipped to Dollars 2.27bn from Dollars 2.29bn. ***** American Home Products, the US pharmaceutical group, yesterday turned in second-quarter net income of Dollars 296.1m, or 94 cents a share, up 12 per cent from the previous year's earnings of Dollars 265.2m, or 84 cents, writes Karen Zagor. Sales in the three months to June 30 rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from 1.62bn. Shares in American Home Products closed Dollars 2 1/8 lower at Dollars 72 3/4 in active trading. For the first half of 1992, the company's net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 702.4m, or Dollars 2.23, from Dollars 617.7m, or Dollars 1.96. Sales grew 11 per cent to Dollars 3.75bn from 3.38bn. ***** Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group was depressed by weak aluminium prices in spite of record shipments, writes Barbara Durr in Chicago. The company reported second-quarter net income of Dollars 33.1m, or 56 cents per share, a 46 per cent drop from last year's Dollars 61.4m, or Dollars 1.04. Revenues in the quarter ended June 30 were Dollars 1.49bn, compared with Dollars 1.52bn a year ago. In the first half, net income was Dollars 46.4m, or 78 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 2.82bn, compared with Dollars 88.9m, or Dollars 1.50, on revenues of Dollars 2.89.

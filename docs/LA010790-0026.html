			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RED PLANET BY ROBERT HEINLEIN (DEL REY: $3.95)  </P> <P> Although his sprawling "Stranger in a Strange Land" became one of the icons of  the '60s counterculture, Robert Heinlein did his best writing in the juvenile  novels he produced during the late '40s and early '50s. Crisply paced, neatly  plotted and peopled with agreeable characters, "Red Planet" (also "Tunnel in  the Sky," "Starman Jones," "Farmer in the Sky" and "Time for the Stars") still  can entertain readers, while such "adult" works as "Glory Road" and "Farnham's  Freehold" have been consigned to the shelves reserved for pretentious bores.  </P> <P> A pronounced conservatism runs through Heinlein's work, and he manages to  transplant old-fashioned Midwestern values to other planets and centuries. Near  the end of "Red Planet," at a town meeting on Mars, the colorful, wise Doc  declares, "Any man old enough to fight is a man and must be treated as such --  and any girl old enough to cook and tend babies is an adult, too."  </P></p>

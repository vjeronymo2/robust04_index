			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell issue sets committee at centre stage - The powers of parliament THE future of parliament's select committee system has been thrown into the balance as a consequence of the Maxwell brothers' refusal yesterday to answer questions on the management of the Mirror Group's pension fund, several MPs claimed last night. If parliament does not now act decisively, some academics agree that the backbenchers' committees - chiefly intended to act as a check on the executive power of government - could suffer an irreversible diminution of power. But others - not least, in private, many government ministers  - are likely to counter that the committees' powers have always been exaggerated and centre specifically on a custom-and-practice, not legal rights, to question the government. Responding to the challenge yesterday, Mr Frank Field, the chairman of the social security committee that had attempted to question the brothers, said the issue must now be tackled by parliament itself. 'This has raised questions of crucial constitutional importance and I am anxious they are dealt with in as non-controversial a way as possible,' he said. Nonetheless, while emphasising that the interests of parliament, the Mirror Group pensioners and the Maxwells were all at stake, he added: 'The Maxwell brothers in one stroke have brought two issues to a head: the lack of ownership members have of pension funds and, second, what will happen to the select committee system.' The question of the Maxwell's right to stay silent in the face of questioning by the committee will now go to the 'usual channels' - a parliamentary euphemism for a behind the scenes negotiation between the two main political parties. Once a decision is taken, the committee will formally report the event by publishing a report to the House. Many committee members of all parties believe that the government and the Labour leadership can have little alternative but to take some action or risk being seen as defending the Maxwells' interests before those of parliament or aggrieved Mirror pensioners. They also pointed out that some questions asked yesterday did not raise any suggestion that the brothers had been involved in alleged wrong-doing, thereby rendering invalid the claim that they could prejudice any future trial. But what recourse does parliament have? The last time a citizen was fined directly by parliament for contempt of its powers was as long ago as 1660 and the last custodial sentence was in 1880. Both decisions were of dubious legality. This century the last time punitive action was taken against a citizen was in 1955 when Sir (then Mr) John Junor, a journalist, was called to the bar of the Commons for an official reprimand for imputing that MPs were receiving excess petrol rations. What is more the modern select committee system has only been in force since 1980 when Mr Norman (now Lord) St John-Stevas overhauled it to allow MPs to 'shadow' government departments. Though this has raised a perception of enhanced powers for backbenchers, hopes that they would become as powerful as their US Congressional equivalents have been largely disappointed. In reality, ministers have proved adept at stonewalling the committees when they so desire. There are also no sanctions to force them to give evidence or even to oblige them to attend. Furthermore, with (in most cases) a government majority built-in to committee memberships, questioning can often be tame. As one former Cabinet minister noted contemptuously last month: 'A third of a committee's members are young supporters of the government anxious for office, a third are has-beens and a third are political opponents whose criticisms can be dismissed.'</p>

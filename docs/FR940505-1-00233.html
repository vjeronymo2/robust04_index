			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described more fully below in the nonroad fleet averaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, EPA is concerned that engine and truck dealers may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly hurt if fleet owners prebuy 4.0 g/bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines to reduce the need for purchases of 1.5 g/bhp-hr NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines in the initial years of the program. Dealers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally local, unlike all manufacturers and some fleet owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They therefore may have trouble surviving more than a year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slow movement in the California market. Therefore, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting comment on a manufacturer sales mandate for heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onhighway similar to that for nonroad engines. Interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readers should review section C.(7)(b) of this appendix for more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on all aspects of the heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declining fleet average proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Fleets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in the enhanced light-duty vehicle section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A(6)), EPA is proposing a revised Clean Fuel Fleet program in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast and requesting comment on expanding it into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other two FIP areas. As described in the Clean Air Act Title II,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part C and in EPA's Clean Fuel Fleet program regulations (see 58  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 32474, June 10, 1993 and 58 FR 64679, December 9, 1993) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national Clean Fuel Fleet program would require certain centrally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled fleets to make a certain percentage of their new vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchases clean fuel vehicles. The CAA HD fleet program applies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fleets up to 26,000 pounds GVWR and requires that 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all purchased be Clean Fuel Vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the light-duty enhanced vehicle program, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposing to require that the affected fleets purchase ILEVs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which meet a composite NMHC standard set to reflect their low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emission potential, rather than merely clean fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. This requirement ensures that the fleet program will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve significant hydrocarbon reductions beyond what is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the general enhanced vehicle program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of this program is straightforward for most vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up to 14,000 lbs. GVWR. On the other hand, for vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified to engine based standards (all vehicles above 14,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lbs GVWR and some under that threshold), an ILEV requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already in place and therefore no composite is necessary. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore is proposing to apply the fleet program only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles certified to a chassis-based standard, currently to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles up to 14,000 lbs GVWR. If EPA extends the chassis-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification option to vehicles between 14,000 and 26,000 lbs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GVWR, the fleet program will extend to these vehicles as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. General Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It would be a violation of federal law for any engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers or owners to fail to comply with the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and prohibitions described above. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the enhanced heavy-duty vehicle program, it would be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of federal law for the California Department of Motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicles (DMV) or any other department of the State of California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or any political subdivision thereof) to register any vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to any requirement for which a valid certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or waiver (either paper-based or electronic) has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been presented. Any person providing fraudulent certification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise aiding or abetting in the violation of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also be violating federal law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That is, it is a violation to permit registration or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate reregistration of a model year 1999 or later engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which there is not in force a valid certificate of conformity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from EPA (either for the engine or for the rebuild). Further it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a violation to register any model year 1998 or previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or engine after 2001 without EPA confirmation that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate fleet average fee, if any, has been paid. Violations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could result in civil penalties under federal law of up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $25,000 per violation. Each instance of unlawful registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be considered a separate offense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Nonroad Engines Over 37 kw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA intends the enhanced in-use compliance program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines to apply to most nonroad engines at or above 37  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kw, with the exceptions described above. This means that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency is adding two categories of nonroad engines not covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the nationwide federal rulemaking. The first category is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spark-ignition engines for all categories except recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine engines. The second is high speed Diesel marine engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are at or above 37 kw; these engines are not included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other FIP regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The enhanced nonroad engine program is proposed to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both CI and SI engines. EPA is concerned that applying more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent emission standards only to CI engines would create an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive to replace diesel (CI) engines with gasoline (SI)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, because if left unregulated these engines could have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost advantage. This shift would increase emissions because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unregulated gasoline engines would have higher exhaust levels and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly higher evaporative emissions than diesel engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is therefore proposing exhaust emission regulations for both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CI and SI engines (i.e., all engine types in the size range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described) and adding a requirement to prevent evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission increases. This strategy should level the playing field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from an emissions perspective and avoid introducing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate encouragement to shift to gasoline and higher HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

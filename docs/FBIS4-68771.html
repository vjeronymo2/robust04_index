			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA FEDERATSIYA correspondent Tamara </F> Aleksandrova: "Will the Provinces Revive Russia?--Comments Upon  Introduction of the RSMS"]    [Text] There is no end to the number of new parties and  movements, their press conferences and introductions. And so, at  a meeting of leaders of the Russian Union of Local  Self-Government (RSMS), everything went according to the  standard arrangement with journalists--questions and responses  on the aims of the new sociopolitical movement, on near-term  objectives. It would seem to be too early to judge what kind of  force has appeared in our society--better to wait and see. All  the same, however, this first meeting with RSMS left the  impression that the organization might be able to appreciably  influence our lives, becoming a significant counterweight to the  super-centralization of government. While trusting the plain  truth of our first impression, it does no harm to delve into  where it comes from.    RSMS is not the fruit of a dozen capital  politicians who drafted a program and approached people  with populist slogans. The emergence of this union is the  logical development of a self- organization of cities. Already  15 diverse city organizations-- unions and associations--are  involved, from which many of the leaders of the new movement  come. Convinced of the productivity of jointly resolving various  economic and management problems, they became convinced of  something else as well--that the rights and interests of city  and village residents must be protected by political methods, in  developing and consolidating local self- government.    Appearing in a natural way, the movement immediately  acquired a solid foundation. Its constituent assembly was  held in June of last year, and its first (constituent)  congress--in October. Presently there are 80 branches of the  RSMS in 48 Federation entities. They unite people who hold dear  realization of the concepts of decentralization of authority,  and the dominance of law over arbitrary rule by the state  apparatus.    The main objective of the RSMS--implementation of the rights  of citizens to participate in management of the life of society  and the state on all levels, from block, street, and city, to  Federation-- determines its specific tasks: protection of the  rights and interests of local self-government entities,  participation in the lawmaking process, the nomination and  provision of support to candidates in elections of the organs of  local and state authority...    Who are the leaders of the RSMS counting on seeing among  their supporters, as their allies? They are relying on employees  of the organs of local and state authority who have become  convinced, on the basis of personal experience, of the need to  develop self- government; active citizens from block and  community committees, and veterans' unions, who have always  protected the interests of territorial associations and diverse  groups; employees in the municipal sphere--public health,  education, culture; and representatives of small and mid-size  business whose interests are directly related to a specific  territory.    The RSMS is prepared to engage in extremely close  cooperation  with unions and all regional associations of cities, with the  Zemstvo Union...    I believe this alone is sufficient to overcome any doubt  that  this movement is a significant one, with a grand future. And  Karamzin's concept to the effect that Russia is strong by virtue  of its provinces occurred not just to me that evening,  apparently. After all, the leaders of RSMS are primarily  representatives of the provinces (if, of course, you consider  that the provinces begin just beyond the Moscow Ring Road).    Viktor Ivanovich Dorkin, chairman of the RSMS  Central Council, is mayor of the city of Dzerzhinskiy, outside  Moscow, a city under rayon jurisdiction. Along with city  residents, he has come to feel the entirety of the injustice  incorporated in this status. And being a Russian people's  deputy, he sees another "disconnect" between the life of the  localities and the lawmaking process.    "In the former Supreme Soviet only a third of the deputies  voted with a knowledge of the business of problems of  self-rule..."    Svetlana Nikolayevna Yurkova, deputy chairman, is  also the mayor of a city well known to all--Shlisselburg. But  whereas for us this city represents history primarily, for her  it is a burden of troubles and cares about what is most  essential.    "In a small territory, every citizen feels the ill effects  of  legislation on local self-government," she believes. "The city  is deprived, its residents are deprived, and the local authority  is too feeble to help. Today it is important for people and  groups of people to learn to defend and stand up for their  interests. Then we will be able to talk about the development of  a civic society, then the most diverse forms of self-government  will emerge on their own and develop. In our city, for example,  the committee for community self-government emerged in the  territory of a former departmental kindergarten which was  intended for sale to private owners. The parents rose up and  defended their interests and the interests of their children..."    Vasiliy Fedorovich Andreyev, member of the Central  Council, historian from Novgorod, chairs the Russian History  Department at a university.    "Is it possible to revive the zemstvo?"--he repeated the  question in a resounding manner. No, probably not. But we must  study the zemstvo. We must find guidance as much in our rich,  productive experience as we do in our sad, national experience.  The history of the zemstvo movement reminds us of the short  history of contemporary self-government--pressure, a cry from  above..."    Naturally a question was also asked about the numerical  strength of the new movement.    Membership in the movement is not stipulated, RSMS leaders  explained, and no one is fighting to get membership in the  multi- millions. The important thing is rather that RSMS slogans  permeate the minds of as many people as possible, and that they  vote for them--for democracy based on local self-government.  There simply cannot be any other kind of democracy. RSMS leaders  consider this introduction of the organization as the beginning  of their preparation for the elections to the State Duma, Second  Convocation.

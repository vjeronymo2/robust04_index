			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Domestic electricity users to get refund EIGHT regional electricity companies are to return a total of Pounds 35m to their domestic customers because of overcharging last year. The money will be returned in the form of lower tariffs rather than in cash. The overcharging resulted from the sharp fall in the rate of inflation last year. Electricity companies have to announce their tariffs in advance using assumptions about the likely level of inflation. These turned out to be too high in many cases. The agreement to refund customers followed action by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, who regulates the industry. In October he wrote to several regional suppliers warning them that they might be overcharging, and subsequently launched an inquiry. He said yesterday: 'The companies have taken reasonable steps to share with customers some of the benefits of lower inflation, and this year's tariff increases can be expected to be below inflation. I believe that customers can regard this as a satisfactory outcome.' Four of the eight companies, London Electricity, Manweb, Seeboard and Yorkshire Electricity, have agreed to return all the excess they earned last year. But the other four argued that the terms of their operating licences allowed them to keep part of the excess to cover the sharp rise in their own costs, mainly the cost of buying electricity. This was accepted by Prof Littlechild. The four are Eastern Electricity, Northern Electric, Norweb and Southern Electric. The excesses earned by the eight companies (and the amounts they have agreed to return) are: Eastern Electricity Pounds 15m (Pounds 3m), London Electricity Pounds 4m (Pounds 4m), Manweb Pounds 2m (Pounds 2m), Northern Electric Pounds 5m (Pounds 4m), Norweb Pounds 9m (Pounds 5m), Seeboard Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m), Southern Electric Pounds 12m (Pounds 5m) and Yorkshire Electric Pounds 6m (Pounds 6m). Mr Jim Hart, Southern's commercial director, one of the companies holding back part of the excess, said that purchase costs had gone up 'quite dramatically since we made our assumptions'. But he said next year's tariff would still rise by less than the rate of inflation which Southern expects to be in the range of 4-4.5 per cent. Yorkshire, one company which is refunding all its excess, said the giveback would have only a small effect on profitability.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONLY UCLA SPIRIT WILL BE ON TAP AT ROSE BOWL  </P> <P> The lemon slush and bottled water will flow freely, but alcoholic beverages  will not be on tap during UCLA's home football games at the Rose Bowl this  year.  </P> <P> A trial, one-year no-alcohol sales period begins Saturday at the Bruins' home  season opener against the University of Oklahoma, stadium officials said.  </P> <P> The ban on beer and other alcoholic beverages has been planned for more than a  year as part of a drive by UCLA and Pasadena city officials to encourage a more  family-oriented environment, said Rose Bowl General Manager Greg Asbury.  </P> <P> Vendors will hawk a lemon slush beverage from portable carts, and bottled  water, nonalcoholic beer and soft drinks will be available.  </P> <P> Thirsty fans can also console themselves with an expanded food menu, including  fish and chips, polish sausages, chicken wings, nacho dogs and fish tacos,  which will be sold from new stands on both sides of the bowl.  </P> <P> As part of the no-alcohol policy, fans will be prohibited, as before, from  carrying cans and bottles into the stadium. Under a new rule, they will also be  prevented from leaving the stadium and returning during halftime.  </P></p>

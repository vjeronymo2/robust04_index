			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] The Senegalese capital Dakar yesterday witnessed  some of the most violent scenes it has ever seen. After a  meeting was dispersed by police, demonstrators took to the  streets. There were clashes and a number of policemen were  killed, apparently murdered. A civilian also died. On the  line, Jeremy Skeet asked our Dakar correspondent, Djadje Ba,  what the situation was today.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Skeet] Are the  government saying that any one particular opposition party is  behind these demonstrations?    [Ba] Well, according to an official communique read today on  the national radio, an Islamic group called the (Mushashidin wa  al-Mushashidadi), which means in Arabic Youth, Young [Men] and  Women following the truth, is banned starting from today in the  territory of Senegal. It seems that from the government's point  of view now, according to observers here, the people who were  behind yesterday's demonstrations are definitely the  (Mushashidin wa al-Mushashidadi).    [Skeet] Now, that's the government's version. You were on  the streets yesterday. Do you think the demonstrators only  belong to this Islamic party or do you think they came from  other opposition parties?    [Ba] Personally, I have heard yesterday among demonstrators  some young people chanting Islamic slogans in which they were  saying that well, all the hardship is due to the ruling party  and that they wanted to get rid of the current government.  Well, this is one thing. Another thing, there were also some  other youngsters who were saying that they were simply in the  streets, simply because they are tired once again of the  economic hardship. They don't belong to any of the parties here  in Senegal but are simply Senegalese who want a better life and  were on the streets because they wanted to live better.

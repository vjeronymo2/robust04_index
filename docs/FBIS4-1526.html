			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Wang Shujun (3769 2885 6874) and reporter </F> Zhang Dongbo (1728 2639 3134)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- The General Staff  Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics  Department of the People's Liberation Army today jointly issued  a "Circular on Tightening Control Over the Budget," calling on  all army units to practically strengthen leadership over budget  control; tighten control; manage money matters according to the  law; and ensure an overall balance between receipts and payments  in the annual budget.    The "Circular" requires that units at and above regimental  level in the whole army must incorporate all receipts and  payments of outlays in the annual budget according to  regulations, and must not practice "external circulation." When  compiling an annual budget, they should draw up an annual budget  plan for outlays on the basis of actual needs and financial  capacity, and through earnest study and adequate proof. The  compilation of a budget for different outlay items for the same  unit or within a department shall be under the direct  administration of financial departments. After the budget is  examined by the party committee, it shall be reported to the  higher authorities for approval. The compilation of a budget  must not include a multitude of outlay items. Once a budget is  approved, it shall have legal effect and no unit or department  is permitted to alter it without authorization. After an annual  budget is issued to the lower levels, there will be no more  examination or approval of fragmentary outlay items. It is  necessary to strictly implement a budget control responsibility  system; all outlays earmarked for the budget control contractual  responsibility system must be channeled to their recipients. It  is necessary to bring expenditures on capital construction  outlays under control; all capital construction projects must be  incorporated into the plan and placed under centralized control.  No unit or department is permitted to alter a construction  project without authorization or carry out construction of a  project in excess of approved standards or area. If the source  of funds for a construction project to be financed by a unit or  department from funds raised by itself is improper, it must not  be reported to the higher authorities and must not be treated as  a project; in such a case, even though a capital construction  plan has been issued to the lower levels, construction of the  project is not permitted to start.    The "Circular" stipulates that extra outlays kept by units  and departments at all levels in reserve for emergency use shall  be placed under centralized control by party committees and  under the direct administration of logistic financial  departments. The use of such extra outlays shall be under a  complete rationing system; their use shall be proposed by  relevant departments and, after examination and approval by  financial departments, shall be reported to chiefs in charge for  approval, provided the amount of such extra outlays do not  exceed their prescribed standards (norms).    The "Circular" stresses: It is necessary for organs and, in  particular, leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in  handling jobs according to budget. They are not permitted to  approve, earmark, or answer questions on outlays as they please.  Auditing departments must audit and supervise budgets for all  departments at all levels and their implementation, and must  sternly deal with those who violate the regulations on budget  control.</p>

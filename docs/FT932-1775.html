			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Siemens in talks on Austrian stake SIEMENS, the German electronics and electrical group, is in talks with the Austrian government to acquire up to 15 per cent of Austrian Industries (AI), the state-owned metals and mechanical company, writes Eric Frey in Vienna. The transaction, which would be worth as much as Sch3bn (Dollars 256m), would give AI a badly-needed cash infusion and help cover its losses from its troubled aluminium subsidiary, AMAG, which last year ran up losses of Sch9bn. AI is not stock market listed, but analysts put its value at Sch15bn to Sch20bn. This excludes AMAG, which is to be spun off from the main group to make the remaining steel and engineering activities more attractive for investors. Beside Siemens, Bank Austria and the insurance group Wiener Staedtische are interested in taking small stakes in AI. By selling 25 per cent of its equity capital, AI is hoping to raise up to Sch5bn. An agreement in principle between AI and Siemens, headed by chief executive Mr Heinrich von Pierer (pictured), could be ready in the early autumn. Through its subsidiary Siemens Austria, the German group has traditionally held close links with Austria's state-owned sector. AI holds a 26 per cent stake in Siemens Austria.</p>

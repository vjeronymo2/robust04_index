			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: SOME SERVICE WRITERS ARE AFTER A SALE  </P> <P> Question: I understand that service writers at auto service shops typically are  given incentive pay figured as a percentage of the total of the service orders  that they write. This is on top of their straight salary. Would this not  motivate them to order maintenance and repairs that are unnecessary? I have got  to wonder about this after paying for a fuel-filter change during a 30,000-mile  service on my 1987 Camry. The Toyota factory representative later advised me  that this was not recommended as necessary. -- F.N.  </P> <P> Answer: Certainly, the widespread practice of dealerships and, to a lesser  extent, independent garages to pay commissions to service writers, based on the  amount of repair work they bill to customers, appeals to some of the worst  business instincts imaginable. It is almost like the government giving defense  companies contracts that pay greater profits if they incur cost overruns. Such  contracts are outlawed, but apparently motorists are not as well protected.  </P> <P> Motorists who take their car in for service must realize that the friendly  service writer that warmly greets them at the front desk all too often wants to  sell service -- and the more the better. The service writer is part auto  diagnostician, part salesman and part psychologist.  </P> <P> Dealerships typically earn huge profits on their service operations. In some  cases, profit margins amount to an awesome 50% of receipts, far more than car  manufacturers would ever dream of making, according to experts. It means that  the frugal motorist is jumping into uncharted waters and possibly  shark-infested waters just to get a car fixed.  </P> <P> Some dealerships require that their service writers be aggressive salesmen. If  a motorist comes in with a cigarette lighter that doesn't work, why not sell a  tune-up? That can add more than $100 to the bill, and at a standard 10%  commission that puts another $10 into the service writer's pocket.  </P> <P> The situation has probably gotten worse in recent years. Car manufacturers are  recommending less and less regular maintenance, such as the fuel filter in the  reader's question. So, dealerships are beginning to tell motorists that they  should buy more service than the manufacturer recommends.  </P> <P> In some cases, the dealership may be right, but the potential for abuse is so  vast that it should raise a lot of red flags any time a garage recommends  service that is not specified in the owners' manual. You should ask why and ask  the service writer to justify it. If you have guts, ask him if he earns a  commission too.  </P> <P> You should know that it is not just the service writers who are paid  commissions. The mechanics and parts-desk salesmen often earn commissions as  well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Look at the Other Side  </P> <P> Having been made aware of all this, you should realize that service writers can  also be decent, honest people who make every effort to only recommend service  or repairs that are needed. Just because they earn a commission doesn't mean  they want to sell a brake job when you don't need one. After all, washing  machine salesmen and stock brokers earn commissions too. Even senators get  honorariums, which is probably worse than commissions.  </P> <P> The important factor in choosing a repair garage or dealership is to find a  professionally run operation. Look for a clean, well-organized garage. The  mechanics should be disciplined and clear-minded. If a service writer is pushy,  beg off and find another garage.  </P> <P> In most cases, garages know that their success depends on building a base of  loyal customers, rather than ripping off everybody who walks in the door. So,  look to see that the same service writer is at your garage every time. The same  applies to the mechanics. You don't want to get stuck with an outfit that turns  over its work force every month.  </P></p>

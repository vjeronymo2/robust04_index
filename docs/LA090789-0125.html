			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL PUTS UP $96 MILLION FOR NEXT PHASE OF METRO RAIL PROJECT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday agreed to fund its $96-million share  of the next phase of the Metro Rail project, after strictly limiting the city's  liability for any cost overruns on the $1.4-billion segment.  </P> <P> The agreement forged with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission  after weeks of bargaining is expected to clear the way for the commission to  apply to the federal Urban Mass Transit Administration for $667 million. That  would provide 46% of the projected cost to build the next 6.6 miles of the  subway, extending the line to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street.  </P> <P> The commission is the funding authority for the entire $3.7-billion rail line,  which is designed to run from downtown Los Angeles 17.3 miles to North  Hollywood. By the terms of the funding agreement, the city will pay 6.6% of the  costs over the next 10 years, using its share of a half-cent sales tax approved  by county voters in 1980 to pay for rail development.  </P> <P> The council also committed the city to share in any cost overruns on the next  6.6-mile segment of Metro Rail construction. However, in the agreement approved  Wednesday, the city's liability is limited to 5% of the over-budget costs up to  a maximum of $90 million.  </P> <P> With expenditures headed for $300 million a mile as the first phase of the  project approaches the halfway mark, cost overruns have become the focal point  of a growing controversy involving the city, the Southern California Rapid  Transit District and the county Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> Construction on the first 4.4-mile segment of the project from Union Station to  MacArthur Park at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street is under way by the  transit district. The job is estimated to be $135 million over budget and  nearly two years behind schedule, according to a commission audit. Transit  district officials, while agreeing that costs have gone up, say the  commission's numbers are exaggerated.  </P> <P> The commission -- which has overall funding authority on the project -- and the  transit district are locked in a struggle over which agency will control the  budgets and construction of the next phases of the big subway project.  </P> <P> There is already concern that the second phase of Metro Rail construction --  extending the line from MacArthur Park 13 miles out to North Hollywood -- will  run over the projected $2.5-billion cost by as much as 15% or $338 million,  officials report.  </P> <P> To contain these escalating costs, the commission has created a cost-reduction  panel and is considering ways to scale back project expenditures without  reducing the miles of track or number of stations.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve less than 100 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the units requested in all applications for each allocation area that score  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above a HUD State or Area Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of units allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If applications are to be funded at less than 100 percent of the units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested in the applications, the HUD State or Area Office must either (i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the same percentage of the number of units requested in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application or (ii) divide approvable applications into two or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories, for example, those scoring over 80 points, and those scoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 50 and 80 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the HUD State or Area Office elects to divide applications into two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories, the HUD State or Area Office may choose to approve a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage for applications in each of the two ranking categories so that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher percentage of units requested would be approved for all applications in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the higher category and a lower percentage of units requested would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved for all applications in the lower category. The HUD State or Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office must approve the same percentage of each application within each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two ranking categories unless there are insufficient funds to approve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum 25 units. If the HUD State or Area Office is unable to fund all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for the minimum funding allowed in either of the two categories,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HUD State or Area Office must reduce the applicable percentage factor in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the category in order to fund all applications for the minimum 25 units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (unless the HA requested less than 25 units or the total budget authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the allocation area will fund less than 25 units).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an HA applies for a specific program (i.e., rental vouchers or rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificates) and funding for the specified program is not available in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metropolitan area or non-metropolitan allocation area, the HUD State or Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office will award the available form of assistance, even though not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically requested by the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HUD State or Area Office must promptly notify the applicable Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Programs Office for each allocation area as to the status of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications from IHAs and, if applicable, the amount of budget authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made available for IHA applications that were rated high enough to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Reallocations of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each HUD State or Area Office must make every reasonable effort to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all available funds. It may be necessary, however, to reallocate funds from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one HUD State or Area Office to another when the funds are not likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the HUD State or Area Office to which they were initially assigned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In such cases, the following procedures shall be followed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reallocations Within the Same State.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the allocation of funds to a HUD State or Area Office cannot be awarded within the office jurisdiction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during Fiscal Year 1994, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD State or Area Office in the same State where they can be used during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fiscal Year 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reallocations Between States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a HUD State or Area Office cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use funds within the same State, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another HUD State or Area Office for use in a State where they can be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during Fiscal Year 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reallocations Between Metropolitan and Non-metropolitan Areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD State or Area Office must follow the original fund assignments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas when it reallocates unused budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority among allocation areas. If there are not enough approvable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for the designated metropolitan or non-metropolitan budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority, the HUD State or Area Office may switch the budget authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area within the same State,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that an offsetting switch can be made in another State within the HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or Area Office. If an offsetting switch cannot be made and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metropolitan or non-metropolitan amounts require changes to the fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignments, the HUD State or Area Office must obtain the approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing, before switching budget authority between a metropolitan and a non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metropolitan area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A request for Headquarters approval of a reallocation within or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between States must explain the reasons that funds cannot be used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original State, the amount being withdrawn from the original State, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program type, and the metropolitan/non-metropolitan mix, and the amount to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reallocated. These requests must be submitted to Headquarters (ATTENTION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing) for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Notification of Funds Awarded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) After the HUD State or Area Offices have reviewed, rated, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranked applications, and the HUD State or Area Offices and Native American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs Offices have approved the applications, each HUD State or Area Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and each Native American Programs Office must submit to Headquarters a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all approved applications. The application approval list is due in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Headquarters (ATTENTION: Rental Assistance Division, Office of Public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian Housing) on the tenth working day following the date set by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Headquarters for completion of application ranking and selections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Offices must provide the following information for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application approved:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The name and address of the HA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The project number, and the number of rental vouchers and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of rental certificates, as applicable, approved for the HA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The amount of contract authority and budget authority, stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately for rental vouchers and rental certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Maxwell pension claims backed: Lord Goodman calls on government to assume 'full responsibility' THE GOVERNMENT is being urged by Lord Goodman, the prominent solicitor, to assume full legal responsibility for pursuing claims on behalf of Maxwell pensioners. Under Lord Goodman's proposals, the government would undertake to meet the pension entitlements of the Maxwell pensioners. In return the pensioners would assign to the government their rights over any of the missing pension fund assets. In a letter to Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, Lord Goodman says his proposal is 'the most economical and only just solution'. The final cost to the government would be limited to the value of any assets it was unable to recover. Although the letter was written in a private capacity, it follows an earlier private submission to the minister by Lord Goodman and follows extensive consultation with interested parties, including pensioners, at a time of continuing public pressure on the government over the Maxwell affair. Lord Goodman comments on the considerable differences between the positions of the members of the different funds, and between the resources of their employers 'so that the various administrators are having to spend inordinate time and money in sorting out the respective claims and liabilities.' Lord Goodman also urgently calls on the government to allow the pensioners to see the full Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and Securities and Investments Board reports, because 'without this they are surely denied the proper oppor-tunity to prove their case at law'. Lord Goodman suggests that the new government trust headed by Sir John Cuckney to solicit contributions on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners could have its powers expanded to enable it to take on, on behalf of the government, the management of the pensioners' rights of legal action. A report by the SIB confirms that the board had considered scrapping Imro because of the way it regulated the fund management companies at the centre of the Maxwell pensions fraud involving more than Pounds 400m, but had decided against. Instead, it recommends 'appropriate strengthening.' The SIB said yesterday that a date had yet to be fixed for the publication of Imro's self-critical report into the Maxwell affair. The Treasury meanwhile was still seeking 'clarification' of certain aspects of the report. Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, yesterday called on the government to make the full SIB and Imro reports available to both liquidators and the trustees of the pension funds.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Ceasefire agreed in Bosnian war: Three sides to suspend hostilities in 11-month-old conflict from tomorrow LEADERS from Bosnia's three ethnic groups last night agreed to a ceasefire in Bosnia's 11-month-old civil war, to take effect at noon tomorrow. The agreement was being treated with caution because several ceasefire accords have collapsed since the war erupted nearly a year ago. But it was considered of more than usual significance because the negotiations had taken place under the aegis of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic last night said he had agreed to a general ceasefire and would today allow a relief convoy to enter Srebrenica, the most vulnerable Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. The agreement was reached after a five-hour meeting in Belgrade with General Lars Erik Wahlgren, the commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, and General Philippe Morillon, the commander of UN forces in Bosnia. Gen Morillon said Bosnian Moslem vice-president Ejup Ganic and Croat leader Mate Boban had also agreed to the ceasefire. 'They gave their agreement to give the same directive to their own forces,' he said. The decision to hold yesterday's talks was made at the urging of President Milosevic in a meeting with Gen Morillon on Thursday. Gen Wahlgren said that Gen Mladic had authorised the departure today of a 20-truck UN aid convoy to the besieged town of Srebrenica. The convoy, currently blocked by Serb militiamen at the Serbian border town of Mali Zvornik, will evacuate civilians from Srebrenica. The announcement of the ceasefire was made as Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, arrived in Belgrade from New York. He immediately threatened to pull out of the peace talks on Bosnia, chaired by international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Mr Karadzic, who on Thursday refused to follow President Alijah Izetbegovic of Bosnia in signing the map of the semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided under the proposed settlement, was sceptical about the ceasefire agreement concluded by his own army commander. Mr Karadzic yesterday came under growing pressure from the international community to sign the peace accord when President Bill Clinton said the US would give Serbia a few days to sign before considering more stringent actions to pressure Belgrade. He said talks would be held with America's allies on the possible lifting of an international arms embargo against the combatants in the former Yugoslavia, a move that would aid embattled Moslems in Bosnia.

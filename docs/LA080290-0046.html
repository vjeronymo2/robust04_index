			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART AND POLITICS MIX TO CELEBRATE LEGISLATURE'S RESCUE OF POOL MURAL  </P> <P> Artists and politicos mixed Tuesday at a pool side bash to celebrate the  Legislature's decision to rescue a hip hotel's underwater mural from swimming  safety laws requiring pool bottoms to be solid white.  </P> <P> New York artist Francis Forlenza, who painted an "aquamural" full of colors and  curlicues for Chip Conley, owner of San Francisco's Phoenix Inn, said the  salvation of his work represents a victory for art and a defeat for  fuddy-duddies the world over.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think art can only be on a four-by-four canvas in an art  gallery," the 32-year-old painter said. "Little kids don't want to go to an art  gallery, but they see art this way. It's fun."  </P> <P> The Phoenix Inn's 45-foot egg-shaped swimming hole, which sports pale-blue  "stylized waves" that look like sixes and nines on a navy blue base, became the  second pool in the state to be exempted from the law. California lawmakers in  1988 spared a pool painting done by British artist David Hockney at the  Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who whisked the exemption bill  through the Legislature, and San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos were among about 200  supporters of the Phoenix Inn underwater mural who attended the evening pool  party.  </P> <P> Innkeeper Conley said he staged the soiree to celebrate what he once thought  was a lost cause. He didn't know about the state law mandating white pool  bottoms when he commissioned Forlenza in January to paint the pool at his  44-room motel. The underwater Pop Art was to be the finishing touch in Conley's  transformation of a once-seedy motel into a trendy inn now frequented by such  pop stars as Tracy Chapman, Sinead O'Connor and Linda Ronstadt.  </P> <P> "I was almost sure that we were going to have to paint it over," said Conley,  who avoided trouble with the law by briefly closing the pool to swimmers this  spring until San Francisco Supervisor Terence Hallinan, Agnos and Brown pledged  to fight to save Forlenza's painting, titled "My Fifteen Minutes/Tumbling  Waves."  </P></p>

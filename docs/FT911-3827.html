			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: How Group declines 19% and warns of bigger fall this year HOW GROUP, the Midlands-based building services contractor, warned that profits were likely to be much lower this year as the trading environment remained difficult. Mr Peter How, chairman, said: 'In a recession the bigger companies and the smaller companies come out better and it's the people in the middle who get squeezed. But we're not ultra dispirited.' The group made its forecast as it reported a 19 per cent decline, from Pounds 5.18m to Pounds 4.21m, in pre-tax profits for 1990. However, the 1989 figure included Pounds 1.15m from investment disposals. A fall in margins had put pressure on profitability, Mr How said. Margins were down about 1 per cent on order book values. Turnover rose 6 per cent to Pounds 236.58m (Pounds 222.83m) while orders overall had fallen about 15 per cent. The group was particularly hurt by a 20 per cent fall in the engineering division's order books since that accounted for a large proportion of its businesses. Costs associated with delayed orders were a main factor, Mr How said. On the other hand, the distribution division, which supplies refrigeration and air conditioning machinery, saw its order book climb, helped by the fact that its business was outside the construction industry. Steps had been taken to try to maintain profit margins, tighten credit controls and cut costs through staff reductions. Recent bids were on very slim profit margins so that the group has had to be extremely selective in what it tendered for, Mr How said. It still had a net cash position. Earnings per share were 5.94p (8.32p) and an unchanged final dividend of 2.25p is recommended, holding the total at 3.6p. In order to bring more accountability to the organisation, the decision-making and managerial functions have been split. A main board will be responsible for planning and monitoring performance, and a group executive board will be responsible for implementing policies and overseeing the management of divisions. Mr David Summerfield has taken over as chief executive from Mr Arthur Hogarth, who is retiring as managing director.</p>

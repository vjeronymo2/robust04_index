			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Parliament as watchdog IF THE SOLE aim of Mr Frank Field and the parliamentary select committee on social security which he chairs is to court publicity, they have certainly achieved it this week. There are two reasons, however, why Mr Field and his committee were mistaken in summoning the Maxwell brothers to answer questions on their role in the Mirror Group pension fund. The first is that it was unlikely that the brothers would have anything to say and on Monday, flanked by lawyers, they duly kept silent. The second, and related, reason was that for the committee to misjudge its role in this way risks bringing the entire select committee system into disrepute. That is a pity. It is not that the select committees lack powers. On the contrary, the biggest single weakness of the system since it was established in its present form in 1979 has been the failure of the committees to realise how potentially powerful they are. The committees are entitled to 'send for papers, persons and records'. They may sit at any time, regardless of whether Parliament is in session, in any place, and may report whenever they like. Nor do the committees lack resources. They are empowered to appoint technical experts to assist them on any subject. Moreover, under the House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978, the funding for such activities is controlled not by the Treasury, but is voted directly by the House of Commons. The committees are thus an extension of the House proceedings, devoted to detailed and specialised work. They can report to the full House at any time. Star witnesses There was a period, shortly after they were established, when some of the new departmentally-related committees seemed exceptionally useful. The select committee on the Treasury, for instance, attracted star witnesses and written submissions on monetary policy and the conduct of the economy. The City and other interested observers queued up to listen and to read. More recently, the select committee on the DTI has done some helpful ferreting on dubious foreign arms sales. By and large, however, the performance of the committees has not lived up to the promise of their creation. Valid reason Perhaps that was what Mr Field was trying to rectify in his search for publicity. He of all people should have known better. Mr Field is the most independent of MPs, an expert on social security matters respected as such on all sides of the House. He is also more skilled than most in eliciting information, whether by Parliamentary Question or the use of the committee system. For him to call witnesses already under investigation elsewhere and who thus had a valid reason to avoid self-incrimination before the committee, lacked wisdom. But the important underlying question is why the system has not been working as it should. One of the explanations is the power of the whips, the party managers who have some say in who goes on what committee. It is unlikely, for instance, that the Tory Party would allow too many members of the Bruges Group on to the select committee on foreign affairs. Allied to that is the lure of government. An ambitious MP looking for office, whether shadow or real, may be reluctant to be associated with a committee which is critical of party policy. Not least, the government of the day can give the nod to officials as to how much information the committees should be given. The present tendency is very little; there is no reason to believe that the Labour Party, with its own hopes of office, much dissents. The question comes back to individual MPs. The powers are there; why do they not use them? It is not primarily a question of producing long reports, often published after parliament has gone into recess; it should be more a relentless probe of how government is run, how decisions are made and how public money is being spent. As parliament's role as lawmaker diminishes, its no less honourable and important role as scrutineer needs to be enhanced.</p>

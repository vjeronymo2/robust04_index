			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Komatsu plunges 55% in worst showing for decade Sluggish growth worldwide saw a slump in consolidated profits at Komatsu, the world's second largest manufacturer of construction machinery, in the year to the end of March. The group's pre-tax profits fell by 55 per cent to Y13.9bn (Dollars 132.38m), the worst performance in a decade. Turnover was down by 2.8 per cent at Y845.9bn. The parent company's profits dropped by 28 per cent at Y15.8bn on sales lower by 4.6 per cent. The company said the year had been marked by a continued sharp decline in domestic demand for building equipment, its principal activity, as private sector investment remained flat. Despite the growth in new public works projects, a full recovery in public sector demand had been held back by start-up delays. Domestic sales overall declined by 1.8 per cent. Overseas, sales to the US and south-east Asia were buoyant, despite the sharp appreciation in the yen. But in the already weakened European markets, the strong currency had significantly affected demand and total overseas sales fell by 3.1 per cent. Non-core activities produced mixed results. Civil engineering contracts were up slightly on 1993 and sales of electronics products rose almost 7 per cent. But industrial machinery sales, buffeted by weak domestic demand and the strong yen, fell 22 per cent. The company reaffirmed its commitment to long-term growth on a global scale. For Komatsu, as for many other Japanese manufacturers, this means a significant reorganisation of its global operations to help it reduce the adverse impact of the strong currency. The group is now accelerating the shift of some manufacturing plants abroad and increasing overseas out-sourcing of its domestic activities. Komatsu said that it expected the effects of the restructuring combined with gradual recovery in its major markets to produce a recovery in the next year.</p>

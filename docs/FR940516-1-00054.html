Gas sensors shall be installed in all inadequately ventilated, enclosed classified areas. Adequate ventilation is defined as ventilation that is sufficient to prevent accumulation of significant quantities of vapor-air mixture in concentrations over 25 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL). One approved method of providing adequate ventilation is a change of air volume every 5 minutes or 1 cubic foot of air-volume flow per minute per square foot of solid floor area, whichever is greater. Enclosed areas (e.g., buildings, living quarters, or doghouses) are defined as those areas confined on more than four of their six possible sides by walls, floors, or ceilings more restrictive to air flow than grating or fixed open louvers and of sufficient size to allow entry of personnel. A classified area is any area classified Class I, Group D, Division 1 or 2, following the guidelines of API RP 500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General platform operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Surface or subsurface safety devices shall not be bypassed or blocked out of service unless they are temporarily out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing procedures. Personnel shall monitor the bypassed or blocked-out functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any surface or subsurface safety device that is temporarily placed out of service shall be flagged. When conducting repairs or maintenance that expose the production safety system to the atmosphere or to conditions that constitute a potential danger to safety of personnel or protection of the environment, the system shall be purged of hydrocarbons and flow shall be blocked from the area under repair or maintenance. Valves, pumps, or other equipment that could initiate flow through the designated area shall also be flagged and removed from service. The activation of such equipment from the control panel shall be temporarily precluded. Only the person in charge of the repair or maintenance may authorize the resumption of service. This authorization may not be given until the repair or maintenance action is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

Horizontal sections of risers shall be of minimal length and protected to prevent damage from falling objects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9.

The PSHL shall be set at 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above and below the normal operating pressure range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Incoming pipelines boarding to a production platform or delivering gas to a power plant platform shall be equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) below the lowest production deck of the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Departing pipelines receiving production from production platforms shall be protected by PSHL to directly or indirectly shut in all production facilities. The PSHL shall be set not to exceed 15 percent above and below the normal operating pressure range. However, high pilots shall not be set above the pipeline's maximum allowable operating pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Departing pipelines from a production platform shall be equipped with an SDV below the lowest production deck of the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems in a manner that allows the safe shut in of the platform prior to SDV closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)(i) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction platforms shall be equipped with an SDV on both the incoming and departing lines below the lowest production deck. These SDVs shall be connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Crossing pipelines on unmanned nonproduction platforms shall be equipped with an FSV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Bidirectional pipelines servicing production or manned nonproduction platforms shall be equipped with a PSHL and an SDV on all risers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) All SDV's shall be operable locally and connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems. The SDV shall be protected from fire, explosion, and impacts from falling objects and marine vessels. The SDV shall be accessible for inspections, maintenance, repairs, and testing. The SDV shall be inspected and tested at least once each calendar month, but the interval shall not exceed 6 weeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Virgin drink risks holy row Mr Richard Branson provoked a potential holy row yesterday by announcing in the staunchly Roman Catholic Irish Republic that he planned to launch a drink next year called Virgin Mary. The tomato and Tabasco mixer is intended to go with Virgin Vodka, due in the shops in three weeks, and is part of the continuing programme of launching drinks to go alongside Virgin Cola. Mr Branson expressed surprise that using the Virgin name to sell a Virgin Mary drink might be controversial. 'It never occurred to me,' he said. 'A Virgin Mary is what you call a tomato and Tabasco drink. I drink it all the time. He added: 'If we are going to offend people, we will obviously think twice.' In interviews at the Commercial Radio Convention in Dublin, Mr Branson also gave a progress report on Virgin Cola. He said there were firm sales already of 30m cans, with 24m going to the Tesco supermarket group. Mr Branson said that at a retail price of 25p he expected a 50 per cent market share in Tesco stores before Christmas. The Iceland foodstore chain, he said, would replace Pepsi with Virgin Cola and was likely to give the new brand greater prominence than Coca-Cola. Next week Virgin will also announce a cola deal with a 1,800-strong off-licence chain which Mr Branson declined to name. 'By the end of November we will be in 3,500 stores,' he said. The Virgin chief added that he planned to launch a range of soft drinks under the Virgin name, including Virgin Water, orange juice and lemonade. 'The range of drinks that Coke sells we will be selling,' he said. Mr Branson conceded that the Virgin name had been considered, and rapidly dropped, for two other company ventures: Mates condoms and a model agency.</p>

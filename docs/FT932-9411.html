			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / BT profits fall Pounds 1bn as pension fund shows big deficit BRITISH TELECOM yesterday reported a Pounds 1bn fall in full-year profits and a far worse than expected deficit on its pension fund. The setback on the pension fund is expected to make a significant dent in its profits for next year and may foreshadow similar pressures on pension funds generally. The salary of Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, is to be frozen at Pounds 465,000 and will not be reviewed again until July 1994. The performance-related component remains unchanged at Pounds 90,000. Despite the recession turnover for the year to March 31 was only slightly down on 1991/92, and underlying income growth of 2.8 per cent in the final quarter led BT to claim it had 'turned the corner quite significantly'. With an 8 per cent increase in net dividend payments the City appeared to discount the impact of the pension fund deficit in yesterday's trading. BT's shares closed 1.5p up, at 404p, encouraging news for the government as it prepares to sell a third tranche of its BT shares in July. The pre-tax profits, down 36 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn from Pounds 3.1bn last year, include over Pounds 1bn in costs incurred in the voluntary redundancy scheme which helped reduce BT's workforce by 19 per cent over the year. Disposals and the repurchase of bonds reduced profits by a further Pounds 190m. At 15.6p a share, the net dividend for the year was 8.3 per cent up on last year, increasing payments to shareholders from Pounds 888m to Pounds 967m despite a fall in earnings per share from 33.2p to 19.8p. BT said this was justified by the 'underlying performance and financial strength'. Because of a deficit of about Pounds 750m in its pension fund as of January 1, BT resumed the payment of employer contributions to the fund on April 1, and plans to make an additional contribution of Pounds 800m. Its total net contribution to the fund in the current year will be about Pounds 1.3bn, compared to only Pounds 40m in the year just reported. Mr Barry Romeril, BT's finance director, said the pension fund deficit was not due to the past year's redundancies alone, but also to the poor performance of dividends and property and to the impact of the changes to Advance Corporation Tax announced in Mr Norman Lamont's spring budget. The last two factors are thought to be having an adverse effect on most pension funds, and others could soon be in a similar predicament. Mr Vallance said: 'In a year when BT's prices were capped at 6 1/4 per cent below the retail price index, we think customers and shareholders alike have had a good deal.' The company shed nearly 40,000 jobs during the year, and plans to cut 30,000 over the next two years. The cost of job losses in the coming year is budgeted at around Pounds 500m. The Telecommunications Users Association said there was 'no doubt' that BT's quality of service was improving, though it was concerned at the impact of job cuts on quality.

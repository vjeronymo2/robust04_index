			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flanders and Rwanda"] </F>   [Text] The majority of Flemings do not want Belgium to send  soldiers to Rwanda anymore. Still, our country should not  abandon Africa, and Rwanda in particular. This was revealed by  a poll of 499 people in Flanders conducted by Dimarso-Gallup.  In spite of the deaths of 10 Belgian blue helmets, a small  majority believes that Belgium should continue to provide  military personnel for future UN peacekeeping operations. Most  Flemings agree that our country should accept political refugees  from Rwanda and maintain its development aid to the former  mandated territory.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limited use of these chemicals as substitutes is anticipated since section 610 imposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant restrictions as of January 1, 1994, on their use as aerosol propellants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Alternative processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative processes, such as manually operated pumps and sprays, provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative delivery mechanism in place of the aerosol dispenser. Development of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process replacements depends on technological feasibility. Some products, such as aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foams, cannot now be easily formed with alternative processes, making the replacement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellant difficult. In other products, the alternative process may not provide proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispersion or accurate application of the product, limiting its use. Persons using manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pumps or sprays (in applications where alternative processes function adequately as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements) on a continuous basis may become fatigued with the constant pumping motion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus producing poor product performance. Nonetheless, these substitutes can serve as viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives in certain applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Substitutes for solvent/diluents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Petroleum hydrocarbons (C6&hyph;C20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petroleum hydrocarbons are generally defined as C6&hyph;C20 hydrocarbons fractionated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the distillation of petroleum. These compounds are loosely grouped into paraffins (six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon chains to ten carbon chains_n-hexane, n-heptane, etc.) and light aromatics (toluene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and xylene) and come in various grades of purity. Components with up to twenty carbons are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now also being used in an effort to reduce flammability. These compounds have good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent properties, are relatively inexpensive (about half the price of MCF), and are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available from chemical distributors. When a controlled substance is used only as a diluent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as in automotive undercoatings, substitution using petroleum hydrocarbons can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved with minor reformulation. Many of these products containing petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbons even outperform their chlorinated counterpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petroleum hydrocarbons are, however, flammable, and thus cannot be used as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement solvents in applications where the solvent must be nonflammable such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic cleaning applications. In addition, pesticide aerosols formulated with certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum hydrocarbons must adhere to requirements imposed under the Federal Insecticide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Oxygenated organic solvents. Oxygenated organic solvents are compounds based on hydrocarbons containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendant oxygen (alcohols and ketones), integral oxygens (ethers), or both (esters). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds are relatively inexpensive compared to MCF_about half the cost_and are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available from chemical distributors. These compounds are also flammable, however, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be used as substitute solvents in applications where the solvent must be nonflammable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These compounds are currently being blended with class I substances to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of class I substances used in a product's formulation. Since the quantity of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds is small, the product still remains nonflammable. Some manufacturers, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are completely reformulating products such as spot removers with ketones, esters, ethers, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohols. To continue the safe use of these convenient products, consumers may have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educated about the product's increased flammability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;141b is a potential substitute to replace CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent/diluent applications in aerosols and pressurized dispensers. HCFC&hyph;141b's ODP is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to that of MCF, making it unlikely that aerosol manufacturers would reformulate their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products away from MCF towards HCFC&hyph;141b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;141b has a number of characteristics that make it a suitable alternative solvent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> namely: It is nonconductive, nonflammable according to U.S. Department of Transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications, and evaporates quickly. However, HCFC&hyph;141b is expensive compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pretax price of CFC&hyph;113_almost three times the cost. Further, HCFC&hyph;141b is slightly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosive to plastic parts, and could not serve as a drop-in replacement for all the uses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 as a solvent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Terpenes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons based on isoprene subunits. They have good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent properties and could replace ozone-depleting compounds in some solvent cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. They are flammable, which limits their use in applications that require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonflammable solvents. Some terpenes have a slight citrus scent while others have stronger,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpleasant odors, making them difficult to use over an extended period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Finland's experiences, however, indicate that reality is more  multifaceted than this kind of dogmatic analysis would suggest.  Sometimes, even the distinction between neutrality and  nonalignment has been like a line drawn in water.    A good example of this is the direction taken by the Nordic  countries, which was outlined in December of 1935. The purpose  of this was to show that Finland was not a German satellite, but  wanted, as did the other Nordic countries, to preserve its  neutrality in the face of the confrontation between Germany and  the USSR. There was also, however, a desire to use this to  create a basis for military cooperation with Sweden in the event  of a Soviet attack.    The final goal was a defense pact between Finland and  Sweden--an alliance with the purpose of securing neutrality.    Negotiations with Sweden progressed so far that an agreement  was reached about the joint defense of the Aland Islands. But  Sweden pulled back when faced by opposition from the USSR. This  was a fateful message to Stalin.    It was later explained that the Finnish attempt at  neutrality  failed because Stalin could not trust the sincerity of that  striving. But Stalin had no qualms about Finland's neutrality as  long Germany formed a counterforce to the USSR in the Baltic.    We still do not know what Stalin's ultimate motives were, at  that juncture, but we know that the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement  provided him with the chance of realizing them. The agreement  allowed him to launch an attack on Finland without having to  fear retribution from the Germans. The start of the Winter War  indicated that the policy of neutrality conducted by a small  nation can only succeed when a power balance has been achieved  between the superpowers.    After the Winter War had broken out, Finland embarked upon  an  active search for Western allies. In February 1940, England and  France offered Finland military support, but it was too little,  too late. But the offer of aid still had a significant effect in  that it made Stalin willing to drop the Kuusinen government and  sign a peace accord with the legal government of Finland, as he  did not want to precipitate a conflict with the West.    After the Winter War, Finland abided by a policy of  neutrality, but was continuously under threat, as long as the  Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement was in effect. The situation  changed in the fall of 1940, at which time Germany was willing  to support Finland; the power balance had been restored. This  saved our country from the fate of the Baltic states.    Paasikivi wrote about this situation, that Snellman's often  quoted statement, according to which a nation should only trust  itself, is only a half-truth: "This only applies to a large  nation. It is not enough for a smaller one. Naturally, even a  small nation, such as Finland, should do all it can to defend  itself, and fight for its own survival. But when Finland is  facing an opponent as large as the USSR, Finland's own  resources are not enough, and we must search for help from  abroad, in this case from Germany."    In 1941, Germany controlled all of the European continent  and  was preparing to attack the USSR. In this situation, Finland had  no way of maintaining its neutrality. Even Sweden was forced to  bend its policy of neutrality and permit German troops to move  through Swedish territory. Finland was left only with two  alternatives; either voluntarily participate in the German  offensive or be forced to become a support area for German  troops.    But Finland did not become a signatory to a specific  alliance  with Germany. Finland went to war next to Germany, and fought  its own war against the USSR, only in order to achieve its own  national goals.    This effort of combining the benefits of enjoying the  support  of a major power, with the freedom of neutrality, required some  diplomatic acrobatics, but it succeeded in that it kept the  United States from declaring war against Finland.    However, in June 1944, Finland had to commit to fight  alongside the Germans until the end, in order to secure military  aid to stave off the offensive by the USSR. But as the  commitment only took the form of a personal promise by President  Risto Ryti, it could be abrogated as soon as the attack, with  the aid of Germany, had been thwarted.    In the situation following World War II, Finland was at the  mercy of the USSR as long as the alliance formed by the victors  stayed in effect. However, the favorable view taken by the West  toward Finland had a dampening effect on the USSR. Stalin  admitted to this later, during discussions with Tito. Finland  was not occupied because he did not want to irritate the United  States.    Finland's position became stronger and stronger as the  relationship between East and West became more and more  strained, and the West started to demand a counterforce against  the military power of the USSR. Because of this, Finland was  able to reach satisfactory terms in the Treaty of Friendship,  Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (FCA). But it was not until  the return of the Porkkala Military Base--as a result of the  superpowers' power balance turning in favor of the West--that  Finland was given the opportunity to seek international approval  for its policy of neutrality.    Combining the FCA Treaty with a policy of neutrality again  required exhibits of diplomatic acrobatics. The credibility of  such policies was tested from both the East and the West,  depending on from what direction the political winds were  blowing at any given time. But overall, during the Cold War,  Finland was able, together with Sweden and Austria, to utilize  the situation created by the power balance between East and  West, to stabilize its own position.    History is not a cookbook from which one can glean complete  recipes for solving today's problems. Paasikivi often quoted the  Swiss historian, Jakob Burkhardt, by noting that we cannot learn  from history for the next time--as next time will never come.  But history can help us become wiser.    We can also become wiser by studying the history of Finnish  security policy. It shows that Finland, during the course of  many decades, has survived wars and crises because it has shown  a willingness to try different policies in ever changing  situations--sometimes neutrality, sometimes nonalliance, and  sometimes a combination of the two--to ensure its security. We  must be just as willing today to consider all available options.</p>

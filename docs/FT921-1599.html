			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): What makes a self-made man - The search for the secret of entrepreneurial success JUST AS the alchemists in the Middle Ages sought for the formula for turning base metal into gold, so researchers in more recent times have attempted to distil the essence of the entrepreneur. What is it that distinguishes the self-made man from his counterpart who is quite happy to spend his working life in the employ of others? What prompts some managers to leave well-paid jobs in large corporations to set up in business on their own or to stage a management buy-out? The business tycoon has always fascinated readers, as the newspaper column inches and the yards of bookshelf devoted to men such as Robert Maxwell, 'Tiny' Rowland and Richard Branson testify. But the past decade and a half has seen a more serious interest develop as the important economic role of small businesses - and the men and women who run them - has become better appreciated. If we can understand what makes the entrepreneur tick, governments may be able to devise policies to encourage enterprise. Four recent books each examine different aspects of the entrepreneurial psyche and the world in which entrepreneurs operate. For the policy-maker there is a discouraging inconclusiveness to their findings. Entrepreneur] by Tom Lloyd (Bloomsbury Pounds 9.99, 176 pages) promises insights into the entrepreneurial mind but fails to deliver. Lloyd takes the life stories of eight entrepreneurs as the basis for his book but then perversely chops them into sections which fit his chapter headings, weakening the narrative effect. Some of the entrepreneurs chosen, such as Bob Payton, the pizza potentate, and global marketeer Martin Sorrell, will be familiar to many readers but Lloyd does the debate a service by broadening his definition to include Jenny Pitman, a leading racehorse trainer, and Richard Noble, holder of the world land speed record. Puzzlingly, the author says his aim is to tell us about the entrepreneur as a 'human being living in the ordinary world', though most of us want to know what makes entrepreneurs different. On this score the book is disappointing. It points to the entrepreneur as having a positive outlook, a different vision system and a love of change. Newcomers to the subject of enterprise may find Entrepreneur] a readable basic introduction but must look for more probing approach elsewhere. The Naked Entrepreneur (Kogan Page Pounds 14.95/Pounds 7.99, 122 pages) attempts a more substantial analysis and seeks to paint a picture of the entrepreneur stripped of what the author, David Robinson, calls 'the self-seeking promotion of the gossip columns.' But Robinson's conclusion that the entrepreneur is 'dedicated to the pursuit of wealth and power' differs from that of many other studies which have stressed that money is not a prime motivator. His study also suffers from a lack of real case histories. He draws on his experience as an accountant for his analysis but, being unwilling to use identifiable examples of clients, opts for 'composites' of real people he has known to illustrate his arguments. Like so many other studies of the entrepreneur this one notes that much of the evidence on the motivation of entrepreneurs is conflicting, but concludes they possess in accentuated form common character traits such as imagination and dedication. One advantage of creating 'composite' entrepreneurs is that the author avoids any sexual bias, but most books devoted to enterprise suggest it is a largely male activity. However, as Women as Entrepreneurs (Academic Press Pounds 24.95, 172 pages) points out, male self-employment rose by only 30 per cent in Britain during the 1980s while female self-employment rose 70 per cent. This soberly academic book by Sara Carter and Tom Cannon studies the problems confronting this largely unacknowledged army of women entrepreneurs. It examines the proposition that women face problems, some of which are in addition to, or different from, those met by men in starting up and running a business. In spite of the detail of the argument the reader is left with the feeling that the similarities are greater than the differences. The Carter/Cannon study identifies five types of female entrepreneur ranging from the youngish, frustrated career woman to the older returner who has raised a family. The successful ones have in common a high degree of formal education and a willingness to train to fill the gaps in their business skills. In contrast to Robinson's conclusion that money is an important motivator, Carter and Cannon find women judge success in personal rather than commercial terms, at least in the early stages of their entrepreneurial careers. Entrepreneurs in High Technology (Oxford-New York Dollars 27.95, 386 pages) looks at a very different sample of entrepreneurs but comes to remarkably similar conclusions about motivation. Most company founders are strongly driven by a desire for independence but are only moderately interested in financial rewards when they start, says Edward B. Roberts, professor of technology management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Roberts' entrepreneurs form an elite group, largely comprising former students and academics from MIT who set up business in the technological hot-house formed by companies on Boston's Route 128. For all the depth of his research over 25 years into hundreds of high tech businesses, he is forced to conclude that success cannot be predicted from personal charac- teristics. He does, however, identify pointers to success among his closely defined target group. A background of work on applied development rather than pure research is a considerable help and the entrepreneur must be able to transfer a considerable amount of technological knowledge from his former employer when starting up on his own. So, what makes an entrepreneur? And what allows some to succeed and others to fail? The diversity of the men and women portrayed in these studies makes for no easy conclusions. Nature and nurture both play a part, but then so does a bewildering array of other external factors. The origins of the entrepreneurial spark remain elusive.</p>

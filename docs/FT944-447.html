			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Major renews tax cut promise: PM admits that rift over Europe is threatening to destroy the Tory party Mr John Major last night made his strongest promise yet to reduce income tax. He told senior Tory officials it was no longer a question of whether the government would cut tax, but of when. In a pugnacious new year's message, delivered with the Conservative party trailing far behind Labour in successive opinion polls, the prime minister called for an end to the party's civil war over Europe. 'United the Conservative party can continue to be invincible,' he said. But he admitted the rift over Europe threatened 'to destroy our party from within'. His words, in a letter to Tory constituency chairmen, cut little ice either with Labour or with Conservative Eurosceptics. Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, said Mr Major had 'confirmed his desperation over Europe and his unbelievable complacency over everything else'. Sir Teddy Taylor, the Euro-sceptic MP for Southend East who was among those suspended from the parliamentary party for not supporting the government in a confidence vote on Europe last month, said Mr Major could unite the party if he would 'identify the real issues in Europe and take a strongly Eurosceptic line on them'. In comments made a week after new Treasury figures confirmed that the amount of tax the government takes from the average family was set to rise again next year, Mr Major said the day ministers could revert to their 'tax-cutting agenda' was getting closer. Reaffirming the government's pledge to 'make progress towards' a 20p basic income tax rate as soon as prudently possible, he argued that the Conservatives were still 'the only party committed to low taxation'. But amid indications that the so-called 'feel bad' factor among consumers may be spreading to business, he appeared to acknowledge that the benefits of Britain's improving economy were not yet getting through to voters. 'People have been through the pain and not yet seen the gain,' he said. 'But the pain was necessary to create the present favourable prospects.' His remarks came after Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the Conservatives had lost credibility as the party of low taxation after raising taxes by the equivalent of 7p on the standard rate of income tax. The government would 'insult the intelligence of the British electorate' if it expected people to be grateful for getting some of that money back, said Mr Blair, who will deliver his own new year's message today. He said tax cuts should not become 'just another political ploy by the Conservatives to retain power'. On Europe, Mr Major sought to portray himself as a mediator between the warring Eurosceptic and pro-European extremes in the Conservative party, saying he agreed with those who thought Brussels interfered too much in 'day-to-day affairs'. But he said the government had 'won the argument' to ensure that Europe intervened as little as possible in people's everyday lives. In an uncompromising call for Tory rebels to train their fire on 'our real opponents', he said that nothing was more soul-destroying for the party's grass roots supporters than 'to see those whom they helped to get elected arguing against other Conservatives'.

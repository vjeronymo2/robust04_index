			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Offer to footballers improved THE PREMIER League improved its offer to the Professional Footballers Association yesterday after the PFA announced that 91 per cent of its First Division members had voted to support strike action. The Premier League and the PFA are in dispute over revenue from TV coverage. The PFA has rejected a Premier League offer of 5 per cent of the proceeds of TV coverage of the new league. Under its present agreement with the Football League, the PFA gets 10 per cent of TV revenue. Mr Gordon Taylor, the PFA chief executive, said: 'There will be no industrial action taken for the immediate future.' The organisation says any extra money from the Premier League will go to the welfare of all 2,500 players at the 92 English and Welsh clubs.</p>

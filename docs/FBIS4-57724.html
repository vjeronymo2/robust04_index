			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said that  Central American countries will assume a unified position at the  fourth Ibero-American summit to be held next month in Cartagena,  Colombia. This will be the second time President De Leon Carpio  participates in this regional summit.    [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...all the  presidents and heads of state who will attend this important  meeting, especially those of us representing Central America.  We will not present individual proposals from each country, but  a proposal as a family, as we have called it. With this in  mind, we will have a preparatory meeting in El Salvador to unify  opinions and criteria, particularly on a proposal we already  presented -- I had the honor of presenting it recently in  Washington -- on a pilot project for Central America for  ecological protection and an alliance for sustained development  of the area. Our forests and natural parks -- which no longer  belong to us, but to mankind -- must be protected with the  assistance of Ibero-American countries. This will probably be  one of the proposals we will present in a unified manner. In any  event, Central American countries will present unified proposals  with the hope that many of them will receive a positive reply  for our nations and for the Central American people.    [Unidentified reporter] When will this meeting take place?  We understand that all the Central American presidents will  arrive together.    [De Leon] The preparatory meeting will be on 31 May in San  Salvador, on the occasion of the presidential inauguration. We  will take advantage of that opportunity to exchange views and  unify criteria. In August, we will arrive together at the  summit of the Ibero-American presidents and heads of state to  show our solidarity as a bloc, and our integration, which is not  only economic but political and extends to all areas. We will  meet in San Jose, Costa Rica, and from there all the Central  American presidents will travel together in one plane, to show  our solidarity and maintain our unity which has always been so  necessary in Central America, and which today is more urgent in  facing the economic and political blocs. I believe we are  definitely advancing toward true Central American integration.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine shows modest advance to Pounds 9.3m THE SHARE price of Alfred McAlpine yesterday jumped 12p to 205p after the construction, housebuilding and building materials group announced a marginal increase to Pounds 9.3m in pre-tax profits for the year to end-October. Profits in the previous 12 months amounted to Pounds 9.2m. The rise was in line with forecast made by the group when it announced its Pounds 39m rights issue last April. Mr Graeme Odgers, chief executive, said that profits could rise further in the current year provided that the recent improvement in the group's housing division was sustained. He said that the profits improvement stemmed from lower costs, reduced interest charges as a result of lower borrowings and a reduction in provisions made against housing land and developments. Even so, McAlpine was only able to pay a maintained final dividend of 5.8p - making a a same again total of 10.3p - by raiding reserves. After all deductions the group incurred a total loss of Pounds 2.3m. This was struck after an extraordinary provision of Pounds 3.9m, mainly to cover further losses and write-downs in the concrete block business which is currently up for sale. Mr Odgers said that this was a substantial improvement on the previous year when the group made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 39.5m for a total loss of Pounds 35.7m. 'We believe that there should be no further provisions. We have reorganised substantially the business and management of the company and have improved the balance sheet. Gearing has been been reduced from 60 per cent 18 months ago to about 5 per cent including off-balance sheet finance. 'Given that the dividend, before extraordinary items, was covered 1.4 times, on earnings of 14.1p, we felt that we should maintain payments to our shareholders, particularly after a rights issue,' said Mr Odgers. A breakdown of profits after interest showed that construction made Pounds 13m against Pounds 13.3m; housebuilding incurred a Pounds 1.2m loss (Pounds 1.9m loss); building materials made a Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.2m) profit while US profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 2.3m. COMMENT The sharp rise in McAlpine's share price recognises the big improvement in management since Graeme Odgers arrival. He has done all the right things in reducing borrowings, reorganising and cutting fat from central management overheads and weeding out poor performing businesses. In the current year margins on housebuilding will continue to benefit from cheaper land prices while the switch of Pounds 35m of debt from sterling to dollars will assist finance costs. On the other hand construction profits are expected to fall sharply while building materials and US operations will at best remain flat. If the group makes Pounds 10m this year - which some analysts believe is optimistic - the shares will be on a multiple of 17 which looks a little high given that there are better pure housebuilding recovery stocks around.</p>

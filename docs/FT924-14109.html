			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Lamont faces tough economic probe from MPs MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor of the exchequer, today faces tough questioning by MPs on his economic strategy against the backdrop of the steepest decline in British business confidence in three years. As the chancellor prepared for his cross examination at a televised session of the Commons' Treasury Committee, Dun and Bradstreet International published the first analysis of business confidence since sterling was suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism four weeks ago. The survey showed that six out of 10 companies expect no upturn in sales in the final quarter of this year, while 39 per cent expect sales to decrease. It coincided with a survey by the Confederation of British Industry and Coopers &amp; Lybrand which revealed deepening pessimism among financial services companies. Banks, building societies and stockbrokers saw business volumes dwindle between July and September of this year. Evidence of a renewed downturn in the UK economy has also led to calls for the chancellor to signal another cut in UK base rates, currently at 9 per cent, to boost recovery. There is growing speculation that a cut in UK rates could come as early as this week following sterling's rise by nearly 15 pfennigs against the D-Mark in the past seven days. The pound's recovery to a close of DM2.52 in New York on Friday night may relieve the government of the need to support the currency through high interest rates in an attempt to control inflation. The issue of Pounds 800m of five-year government bonds on Friday compounded talk of a near-term rate cut. The issue of shorter-dated gilts has heralded base rate cuts in the past. Ministers may also believe the pressure to ease monetary policy will intensify later this week if fresh economic data highlight a deteriorating landscape in UK industry. On Wednesday, industrial production figures for August are due to be released, with some economists expecting a fall of 0.2 per cent. Thursday's unemployment figures for September will be awaited with particular anxiety by the cabinet, with some analysts projecting a monthly rise in those out of work in the region of 50,000. Compounding the gloom is the prospect that up to 25,000 mining jobs could eventually be lost if British Coal goes ahead with a pre-privatisation pit closure programme due to be finalised this week, along with thousands of jobs in related industries. There are suggestions that 30 of the 50 collieries are due to close to clear the way for privatisation. The surveys on business confidence follow a report from Halifax building society last week, which showed a 3.1 per cent fall in house prices in September. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Warburg Securities, said the picture presented by these reports was extremely gloomy. 'It may be that we are entering a period of new economic weakness,' he said, 'with the economy no longer just bumping along the bottom, but moving downwards once again.' A report out today from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, shows the government faces hard choices on whether or not to cut base rates. Using a Treasury model of the economy, Ernst &amp; Young calculated that a cut in base rates to 6.5 per cent by the middle of 1993 would lead to a rise in gross domestic product in 1993 by 1.8 per cent. However, inflation would jump outside the government's declared target of 1-4 per cent, rising to an annual level of 5.7 per cent in 1994. Alternatively, if rates are cut by no more than one point next year, inflation will peak at 4 per cent in 1993, but unemployment will rise to 3.6m in 1994.

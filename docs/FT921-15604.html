			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Appointments: Woolley to chair API API, the packaging group buffeted by upheaval and a hostile bid last year, is hoping for a steer into calmer waters with the appointment of Moger Woolley (right) as non-executive chairman. Woolley, formerly chief executive of DRG, is no stranger to acrimony in the boardroom having spearheaded a vigorous if ultimately unsuccessful defence of the UK paper and packaging group against Bermuda-based Pembridge Investments in November 1989. Since then he spent just over five months in the chair at fallen USM star Parkway, which was swallowed by pre-press service company Wace; then, no sooner had he been named non-executive chairman of part of Beazer than along came Hanson. 'We think Moger will make a very credible chairman, and he is not going to accept a string of non-executive posts,' says finance director Dennis Holt, although he was already non-exec chairman of Dolphin Packaging. API, which is also currently interviewing for a managing director, has been a bit thin in the upper management echelons since the managing director and chairman both resigned last March - leaving Holt, who had been at the company just 4 months, as the only executive director. The ensuing gap encouraged rival packager NMC in its bid - which was subsequently rejected by API's shareholders. Until now Peter Armitage, previously deputy chairman, has been standing in as chairman; 64-year-old Eric Holroyd, who was brought in from outside during the bid, will continue as temporary managing director until his replacement is selected.</p>

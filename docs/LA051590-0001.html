			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> And now for the view from Central California:  </P> <P> "There is good news for California agriculture," began a recent Fresno Bee  story. "The controversial Mediterranean fruit fly spraying program will  continue."  </P> <P> L.A. artist Dave Quick often celebrates the quirky and offbeat side of history  in his motorized works.  </P> <P> In "Watch Out, Vince!" he reenacted a 1985 incident in which a tarpaulin  machine ran over St. Louis outfielder Vince Coleman before a Cardinals-Dodgers  playoff game. As the roller heads toward the tiny figure, an instrumental  version of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" plays and a voice cries, "Watch out,  Vince!"  </P> <P> Quick will have several works on display Sunday at the Chiat Day ad agency,  which is one stop on the annual Venice Family Clinic Art Walk. The most  eye-catching of Quick's pieces may be his reenactment of one of Southern  California's most infamous crimes:  </P> <P> The theft of Dick Dale's first guitar from the Surf Museum in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The free-thinking Southland might be the capital of dual-interest groups,  offering such combinations as the Atheist Dating Service, Single Animal-Lovers,  and the California Freeway Singles Club.  </P> <P> Now comes the Altadena-based New Age Walkers, a group of physical fitness buffs  who believe in UFOs.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, it sponsored a Mother's Day and UFO Awareness Walk at Descanso  Gardens -- raffling off flying saucers, no doubt.  </P> <P> "In this market, you have to do something special," said real estate agent Gail  Woodruff, explaining the somewhat un-subtle approach she took with one piece of  property in Long Beach (see photo).  </P> <P> The City Council is considering whether to set aside part of L.A.'s bed-tax  revenue for the creation of videos and ads that would promote San Pedro as a  tourist's paradise. If the port community wants to go upscale, it may already  have one prerequisite: A snooty French restaurant.  </P> <P> When Only in L.A. dined at this spot the other night, we overheard a diner  point out that the lettuce in his salad was brown and wilted.  </P> <P> The waiter responded: "Would you like more dressing?"  </P> <P> Another diner complained that her cheese hors d'oeuvre contained no cheese.  </P> <P> "You ate it," the waiter charged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAny:  </P> <P> Some cities are content to celebrate Presidents and generals in their statuary.  For a different approach, try the piers at Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach,  which feature sculptures of George Freeth and Tim Kelley, respectively, in  bathing suits. They were surfers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Chen Jinhua, Minister of the State </F> Planning Commission, Views Commodity Price Inspection"]    [Text] Just as the people of the whole nation are actively  implementing various important reform measures, the State  Council has decided to launch a nationwide price inspection as  of the end of March, in a bid to use various comprehensive means  to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over prices  and prevent prices from rising excessively. What is the  significance of this? When interviewed by this reporter, Chen  Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, said it was a  positive measure taken by the party Central Committee and the  State Council to promote the establishment of the socialist  market economic structure with the overall situation of reform,  development, and stability in mind.  <H5>  Practicing Market Regulation Does Not Mean Letting Things </H5> Drift    Chen Jinhua pointed out: The general situation is fine, the  market is brisk, and the public feeling is stable. However, an  outstanding problem is the soaring prices. He said: This  chiefly manifests itself in chaotic market price order,  indiscriminate price increases, and indiscriminate collection of  fees. Some enterprises have taken advantage of the introduction  of tax system reform, exchange rates, and prices to drive up  prices. For the sake of local interests, some localities have  exceeded their own power in fixing prices and indiscriminately  collecting fees. Some businessmen, disregarding the regulation  on putting goods on sale with the prices clearly marked, have  asked for exorbitant prices, sought staggering profits, sold  fake and shoddy products, cheated people in the same trade, and  played the bullyboy. To a certain extent, all this has  disrupted the market order and affected normal production and  circulation. The party Central Committee and the State Council  have paid great attention to this problem. Since the second  half of last year, they have taken economic, legal, and the  necessary administrative measures to strengthen macroeconomic  regulation and control over prices. The current nationwide  general price inspection is aimed at pushing the implementation  of various regulation and control measures further ahead, to  create a better external environment for enterprises to develop  fair competition, promote the change of operation system,  improve operations and management, and raise economic efficiency.    Chen Jinhua stressed: In line with the requirement to  establish a socialist market economic structure, the prices of  the overwhelming majority of commodities and service fees are  now regulated by the market. However, lifting price controls  does not mean letting things adrift, still less does it mean  refusing to have anything more to do with it. No country in the  world takes a completely laissez-faire attitude toward prices.  Countries practicing the market economy like the United States  and Japan impose strict but effective controls over the prices  of important commodities which have a bearing on the national  economy and the people's livelihood and also over service fees.  It is the aim of our party and government to serve the people  heart and soul and it is the fundamental duty of our government  to be concerned with the vital interests of the masses. To  develop a nationwide price inspection and punish price violators  is an important action in protecting the interests of the  masses, stabilizing the people's livelihood, and maintaining  social stability.  <H5>  The Main Emphasis of the Inspection Is on the Prices of the </H5> Basic Necessities of Life and Service Fees    Chen said: The price inspection this time covers all  enterprises, small industrial and commercial businesses, and  administrative and public institutions which collect fees and  charges. It will inspect those price violations which have  happened since the latter half of 1993 while serious violation  cases will be traced back to the latter half of 1992. The main  contents of the inspection are as follows: First, the action of  taking advantage of tax system reform to arbitrarily raise  prices, increase the purchase and sales price differentials as  well as the wholesale and retail price differentials, and  increase the prices of goods or service fees by adding value  added tax rate to the original prices. Second, in violation of  the price control jurisdiction, the action of arbitrarily  raising commodity prices or service fees which should be fixed  by the state; the action of arbitrarily raising prices and  collecting fees in railroad, highway, and shipping  transportation and forcibly asking people to purchase insurance  when selling or handling tickets. Third, the action of selling,  without price ceilings or in excess of the stipulated price  differentials or profit rates, those commodities whose prices  have been liberalized and raising prices in disguised forms such  as giving short measure, adulterating, and using inferior goods  in place of proper ones. Fourth, the action of violating state  regulations regarding the system of putting on file and  submitting reports on price adjustments and the procedures for  controlling price differentials and setting temporary price  limits and also the action of failing to clearly mark prices.  Fifth, the action of arbitrarily raising the prices of  agricultural capital goods, such as chemical fertilizer, plastic  film for farming, farm chemicals, and diesel oil for farm use,  as well as electricity prices in rural areas, in violation of  the relevant state regulations. Sixth, the action of exceeding  one's authority in introducing new fee collection items,  enlarging the scope of fee collection, and raising the fee  collection standards at random.    Chen Jinhua demanded that all units and individuals under  inspection voluntarily accept inspection by providing actual  data. Those who find pretexts to create difficulties and refuse  inspection will be punished heavily. Inspectors and those who  report and inform against misconduct should be protected and no  retaliation against them will be tolerated. Those who shield,  are partial to, or connive at price violations will be held  accountable and seriously dealt with. Meanwhile, in light of  the problems discovered during the inspection, we should  strengthen management of those commodities whose prices have  been liberalized. At the same time, we should also help  enterprises to establish sound rules and regulations, promote  their change of operational mechanism, and strengthen their  ability for self-restraint.  <H5>  Investigate and Punish Illegal Conduct According to Law and </H5> Protect Consumer's Interests    Chen Jinhua said: The nationwide price inspection is based  on the following laws, regulations, and policies: The "PRC  Regulations on Price Management"; the State Council's "Circular  on Launching Nationwide Price Inspection" and "Circular on  Strengthening Supervision and Inspection Over the Prices of the  Basic Necessities of Life and Service Fees"; the "Stipulations  on Putting Goods on Sale and Offering Services With Prices  Clearly Marked" promulgated by the State Planning Commission  with State Council approval; the "Circular on Views on Verifying  and Handling Items Involving Peasant Burdens" by the CPC Central  Committee General Office and the State Council General Office;  the Finance Ministry's "Regulations on Bringing Unauthorized Fee  Collection Under Control" transmitted by the CPC Central  Committee General office and the State Council General Office;  the "Circular on Ensuring Price Stability After Tax System  Reform" by the State Planning Commission and the State  Administration of Taxation; the "Regulations on Punishing Cases  of Price Violations" by the former State Price Bureau; and a  series of other administrative rules and regulations and  normative documents.    During the nationwide price inspection, we should continue  to  carry out the policy of "being lenient toward those who check  themselves and severe toward those who are checked, seeking  truth from facts, and treating with appropriate leniency and  severity". The units and individuals who have violated relevant  price regulations will be ordered to return their illegal gains  to the purchasers or users. The illegal gains which cannot be  returned will be confiscated by price inspection institutions.  At the same time, the units and individuals concerned will be  fined according to the seriousness of their cases. When  necessary, the industrial and commercial administration will be  requested to revoke their business licenses. If they refuse to  return the illegal gains or pay the fines, the price inspection  institutions can instruct the bank wherein they have their  account to transfer the money in accordance with the relevant  regulations. If they do not have any bank account, or there is  no money in their bank account, the price inspection  institutions have the right to sell their goods to cover the sum  they should return or pay as a fine. The inspection  institutions can impose fines on those who assume direct  responsibility and those in charge of the enterprises and public  institutions according to the seriousness of their cases. It  can also suggest that the department concerned take disciplinary  sanction against them. Those who violate the criminal law, thus  committing a crime, will be investigated by the judicial  department and their criminal responsibilities affixed.    In conclusion, Chen emphatically pointed out: In the general  price inspection it is necessay to step up the study on drawing  demarcation lines in applying a policy and strive to solve new  problems, with new ways of thinking and new methods, in  accordance with the goal of establishing a socialist system of  market economy to ensure the implementation of the macroeconomic  regulation and control measures and promote the sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.</p>

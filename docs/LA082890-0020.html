			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER FENCES OFF FRYMAN CANYON TRAIL  </P> <P> Public access to a popular hiking trail through rustic Fryman Canyon in Studio  City has been blocked or sharply curtailed by the developer battling  environmentalists over his plan to build homes there.  </P> <P> "The Betty B. Dearing Trail is out of business," Benjamin M. Reznik, lawyer for  developer Fred Sahadi, said Monday. A fence, a "no trespassing" sign and an  armed guard were posted this weekend at the southern entrance to the trail to  block access, Reznik said.  </P> <P> Sahadi's plan to build 26 luxury homes in the 63-acre canyon is opposed by many  elected officials and a band of environmentalists. Last week, foes gathered  repeatedly at the site to monitor and sometimes heckle and harass Sahadi's  crews, which began minor work to prepare for construction in the canyon.  </P> <P> Reznik said the trail was closed to prevent the project's opponents from  creating problems. Reznik declined to specify what problems he envisioned. "I  don't want to give them any ideas," he said.  </P> <P> Until recently, it was believed the Dearing trail and 32 acres of Fryman Canyon  land around it had been deeded to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a  state parks agency, for public open space.  </P> <P> But it was discovered that Sahadi never transferred the title to the  conservancy. Sahadi's 26-home project is set to be built on the remaining  acreage. The conservancy is now requesting the state attorney general to sue in  order to gain the property at a time when the conservancy also is seeking to  buy the entire Fryman Canyon site from Sahadi.  </P> <P> There were conflicting reports Monday on whether the trail was totally closed.  </P> <P> Fausto Campobianco, an aide to Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said he  visited the trail Monday morning after receiving complaints from constituents  and was told by the guard there that his job was to prevent suspicious persons  from using the trail. "He invited me to go on ahead," the legislative aide  said.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, said he checked out similar complaints Saturday and was greeted by  a guard on the trail who tried -- but failed -- to serve him with a restraining  order against trespassing. "It's gross intimidation," Edmiston said.  </P></p>

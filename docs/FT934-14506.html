			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Leyland Daf ruling postponed NEARLY 2,500 former Leyland Daf van and truck workers dismissed when the company went into receivership will have to wait for an industrial tribunal ruling on compensation. The workers, from the Leyland and Chorley plants in Lancashire, the van plant in Birmingham and Glasgow's Albion works, say they were dismissed without the proper consultation period. The tribunal in Manchester was told yesterday that the company accepted that the 90-day period had not been entered into - but that the redundancies were forced on them because of excess capacity at the plants. The tribunal reserved judgment. Its ruling will be given in writing to the four unions involved.</p>

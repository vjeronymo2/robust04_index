			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MERCI TRAIN'  </P> <P> I am researching the French "Merci Train" of 1949, composed of 48 boxcars sent  to the United States from France after World War II.  </P> <P> The cars were filled with gifts and designated to be delivered in each state.  </P> <P> I am trying to locate people who remember the train, its arrival in the United  States and what has become of the boxcars and gifts. More important, I am  looking for information on the sentiment in France leading to the gesture of  thanks.  </P> <P> All credits will be given.  </P> <P> JULIE CHRISTINE  </P> <P> 417 Yorktown No. 6  </P> <P> Huntington Beach, CA 92648  </P></p>

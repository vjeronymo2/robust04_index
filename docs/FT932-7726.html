			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rumours spur Hong Kong rally as Nikkei wavers EQUITIES settled lower as weakness in futures and small-lot sales erased earlier gains in light volume. But the nation's revised industrial output data for March encouraged a minor rally in late trading, lifting the Nikkei average off its intraday low, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 50.40 easier at 20,330.39, after moving between 20,122.78 and 20,535.79. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 3.63 at 1,594.33. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.39 at 1,228.26. Volume contracted to 350m shares from Wednesday's 397m and falls led rises by 611 to 396, with 173 issues unchanged. Brokers said Japan's revised output growth rate for March of 2.5 per cent, up from 1.5 per cent, suggested that the domestic economy is improving and encouraged some investors to buy back futures contracts during the afternoon session. This, ultimately, aided the cash market. However, the day's lower level of trading activity left the Nikkei susceptible to waves of arbitrage-related sales, which put pressure on many large-capital issues, brokers added. Technical analysts predict that the market's weakness will pull equities lower in the short term. Without government support through public fund purchases, it is likely that the Nikkei would trade closer to 19,500, they said. Retreating gold prices in overnight trading prompted investors to take early profits from Sumitomo Metal Mining, the recent market leader. It ended Y40 lower at Y1,120. Mitsui Mining and Smelting eased Y8 to Y550. An appreciation of the yen against the dollar lifted regional power suppliers. Kyushu Electric Power rose Y60 to Y2,940 and Chubu Electric Power Y40 to Y2,920. Individual investors continued to support companies with good earnings results. Aiwa, the Japanese audio maker, climbed Y120 to Y1,490 on better than expected earnings. Some shipbuilding issues moved higher after figures from Namura Shipbuilding, Y10 up at Y1,270. Sasebo Heavy Industries gained Y35 at Y594. In Osaka the OSE average dipped 275.76 to 22,552.98 in volume of 17m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets put in a mostly firm performance. HONG KONG turned higher after rumours, later denied, of a resumption soon of meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group on handing over Hong Kong to China in 1997. Institutional bargain hunting helped the Hang Seng index to advance 25.08 to 7,118.96 in turnover down to HKDollars 4.28bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 5.43bn. SYDNEY felt the effects of positive results in the banking sector and the All Ordinaries index ended 1.6 up at 1,684.2 in turnover of ADollars 398.7m. National Australia Bank added 24 cents at ADollars 9.46 after announcing profits at the top end of expectations. Westpac Banking, which reported an ADollars 204.6m interim loss, held steady at ADollars 3.61. SINGAPORE retreated for the second consecutive session, with the market failing to maintain record intraday highs set in early trade. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 0.21 to 1,876.40, having peaked earlier at an intraday record of 1,883.25. Turnover was a record SDollars 847.46m, beating the previous high of SDollars 740.65m seen on April 15, with continued heavy demand for Malaysian shares. KUALA LUMPUR extended its record-setting run, posting gains for the fifth consecutive day. The composite index added 5.68 at 735.11. NEW ZEALAND finished fractionally below its high for the year in active trade, the NZSE-40 capital index gaining 11.54 at 1,627.45. Telecom put on 7 cents at NZDollars 3.02 - its highest ever close - in volume of more than 3.5m shares, in continued reaction to Tuesday's results. TAIWAN fell 2.3 per cent as a wave of late selling left the weighted index 99.91 lower at 4,336.63. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 25.07bn.</p>

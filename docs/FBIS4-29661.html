			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 June, the people and the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] cooperated in attacking and  completely dispersing the military and civilian state authority  of the puppets of communist Vietnam in Trapeang Kraloeng, Phnum  Sruch district seat, Kompong Speu Province.    After a battle lasting an hour, we fully controlled this  district township. Fifteen of the invading troops of the  puppets of communist Vietnam were killed and eight others  wounded. Ten army shelters and three district office buildings  were destroyed. We seized eight AK rifles, three AR-15's, and  three (BH) mines.    At the same time, 20 soldiers of the puppets of communist  Vietnam and 11 officials serving the communist Vietnam's puppets  surrendered and joined the people and the NADK. They said that  they will stop serving the communist Vietnamese, who are  continuing to attack and kill the nation. These compatriots  asked to join forces with the people and the NADK to fight the  military and civilian state authorities of the puppets of  communist Vietnam to quickly destroy them so that there will be  peace, without anyone forcing the compatriots to fight.    However, the people and the NADK suggested that these  compatriots return home and join forces with the people in their  localities to fight the warmongers in their dens. This way  there will be no one to force the compatriots to fight and die,  leaving their families behind, and there will be no one to force  compatriots to round up the people's relatives to serve as  soldiers --- an act which makes the people angry and causes them  to loath and hurl insults at these compatriots.</p>

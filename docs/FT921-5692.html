			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Dalepak Foods in takeover talks DALEPAK FOODS, the food manufacturer, said yesterday that it was in preliminary discussions to sell part, or all, of the company. The announcement was prompted by a 71p increase in the company's share price, which closed at 433p. Stockbrokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan have approached a number of possible buyers following the decision by Mr Jonathan Ropner, Dalepak's chairman, to sell his 20 per cent shareholding. .The five other executive directors own just under 30 per cent of the group. The sale is likely to make multi-millionaires out of the directors as the group is valued at about Pounds 50m. Although de Zoete &amp; Bevan stressed that the talks were in a 'very, very preliminary stage', the group is expected to be sold to one buyer. The rise in the share price was boosted by a bullish note published last Friday by Metropolitan Optima, a division of Metropolitan General Investment Company. It recommended the shares a 'buy', commending the group's management for its successful diversification into frozen baked products and chilled ready meats. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-April 1991 were Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 1.92m). Analysts were forecasting continued profits growth over the next two years.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 17  January on page 2 carries a 250-word TA SR report entitled  "Priority of the Finance Department: Introducing Clarity Into  Incomes." The report quotes an interview given by Finance  Minister Julius Toth to the TA SR on 16 January, in which he  discussed the "priorities of the Ministry of Finance this year."  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 20 January on page 2 carries a  600-word TA SR report entitled "Even Though There Is No  Agreement, They Are Doing It." The report quotes a statement  issued by the Slovak National Bank [NBS] in response to the Toth  interview.    The TA SR report in the 17 January issue of Bratislava  REPUBLIKA in Slovak includes the following passage: "In an  interview for the TA SR, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of  Finance Julius Toth said that introducing good order and  exactness into state budget incomes and expenditures was one of  the priorities of the finance department this year. According  to his words, it was precisely this issue that was causing  considerable problems in the first year of independent  Slovakia's existence. The NBS, which monitors expenditures, was  not able to carry out certain studies and analyses that would  show in which areas the budget management was getting into an  undesirable situation."    In its response in the 20 January issue of Bratislava PRAVDA  in Slovak, the NBS terms Toth's remark "a surprising assertion"  because "according to the legal system, it is the Ministry of  Finance of the Slovak Republic that is responsible for the  formulation and implementation of the state budget." The NBS  statement goes on to say: "Under the law on the NBS, monitoring  expenditures of the state budget is not among the duties of the  central bank, and no agreement on such activity has been  concluded between the NBS and the Ministry of Finance of the  Slovak Republic. In spite of this, central bank staffers  prepare regular reports on the development of the budget economy  and on the government's net position regarding individual items  and draw attention to key problems." According to the NBS, "in  the course of 1993, the NBS repeatedly notified the Ministry of  Finance of the Slovak Republic about the unfavorable development  of the budget and demanded that appropriate measures be adopted  to keep the budget deficit within acceptable limits. With this  in mind, an agreement had been reached to limit the drawing of  budget expenditures to a total 165 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]  by 31 December 1993. In the last days of December, it was  decided to exceed this limit, as a result of which budget  expenditures reached Sk167.1 billion. The NBS had not been  informed about this decision in advance." In concluding, the  NBS statement points out that the Ministry of Finance itself is  preparing monthly reports on the state budget fulfillment, which  detail the development of individual items of budget revenues  and expenditures.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HANDLING THE PRESSURE  </P> <P> When director Luis Mandoki ("White Palace") dropped out of the Steve  Roth/Universal production of "Mobsters" a few weeks ago, Michael Karbelnikoff  got the break he's been working toward for 15 years.  </P> <P> The veteran director of TV spots for Levi's 501 jeans, Bud Light and other  products was picked to step in, and now faces the pressure of directing a name  cast -- and his first feature.  </P> <P> Sources tell us that Christian Slater will play gangster Lucky Luciano in the  big-budget production, due to start shooting next month, with Patrick Dempsey  as Meyer Lansky, Richard Grieco as Bugsy Siegel and a female love interest yet  to be cast (sources say Emily Lloyd and Uma Thurman are among top contenders).  </P> <P> "It's more overwhelming than normal because I came into it late," says  Karbelnikoff, referring to his three-week pre-production time, "but I have a  great support system around me."  </P> <P> Karbelnikoff's feature-film directing experience is limited to an uncompleted  one-hour project that he financed himself, but he still expresses confidence.  </P> <P> "If I don't take this moment, and make it the best thing that ever happened in  my life, then I'm a fool," he says. "Getting scared and all that is not what  I've been in film 15 years to do." Kevin Koffler  </P></p>

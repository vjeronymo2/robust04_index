			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Letter: Suppliers offer as much real value as customers Sir, Although Messrs Furnham and Pendleton (Management: 'Seduced by the customer cult', June 7) make some intelligent remarks about the customer cult, they appear to have forgotten one important company stakeholder, the supplier. Suppliers invest considerable resources in the continuing good fortune of their clients, but are rarely treated as key contributors to a company's success. Exceptions such as British Airways, Marks and Spencer and the Royal Bank of Scotland are as scarce as they are enlightened. Suppliers treated as stakeholders will quickly become partners and will add real value to a company's bottom line.

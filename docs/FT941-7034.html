			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium hungry for more cuts The London Metal Exchange's aluminium market marked time this week as it assessed progress so far with the policy of multilateral production cuts and awaited next week's meeting of producing countries in Ottawa, at which the policy will be reviewed and, so traders hope, confirmed. The 12 per cent rally in prices since the policy was agreed last month in Brussels was more or less maintained, with the LME's three months delivery price closing yesterday at Dollars 1,314.50 a tonne, down Dollars 7 on the week. But it continued to appear somewhat fragile as prices tended to slide back on days when no further cuts were announced. An Dollars 18 fall on Monday was partially recouped the next day following news that a 39,000-tonnes-a-year cut was planned at Australia's Tomago smelter. But that rally was wiped out on Wednesday and the price dipped to Dollars 1,290 a tonne before the announcement by Pechiney of France on Thursday that it was cutting output by 120,000 tonnes, rather more than expected, lifted it to Dollars 1,314.50. The list of planned production cuts grew further yesterday with announcements from Alusaf of South Africa (4,000 tonnes), Kaiser of the US (40,000 tonnes) and Suriname Aluminium Company, an Alcoa subsidiary, (3,000 tonnes). These took the western total so far close to 850,000 tonnes, well on the way to the target of 1.5m tonnes set at last month's meeting. However, some analysts doubt that the target can be reached without contributions from countries not represented at the Brussels talks, which include Brazil and the Gulf producers. There is also some scepticism about the Russian authorities' ability to persuade its smelters to deliver the production cuts promised in Brussels - 200,000 tonnes by April and another 300,000 in the next three months. A senior official of the Aluminiy producers' group said on Tuesday that no additions to the 100,000 tonnes of cuts already announced would be made until it was satisfied that western producers were keeping to their end of the bargain. That, however, was before the announcement by Pechiney, whose earlier silence on its cutback plans had been cited by the official as 'an exact example of what we are displeased with'. Other LME contracts also ended lower. Three months copper see-sawed to Dollars 1,887.50 a tonne, down Dollars 19 on the week, while lead's price ended Dollars 10 off at Dollars 488.50 a tonne and zinc's Dollars 21 off at Dollars 973.50 a tonne. The big loser among the precious metals was platinum, which saw its premium over gold narrow from Dollars 20.50 to Dollars 12.90 as it fell Dollars 7.40 to Dollars 391.60 a troy ounce. Traders attributed the metal's weaker tone to reduced concern about the possibility of production being disrupted in the run-up to South Africa's April elections. The London Commodity Exchange's cocoa market began quite strongly in response to last Friday's late surge in New York. But gains were trimmed later in the week and the May futures position ended at Dollars 924 a tonne, up Dollars 5 on balance. News that the new, price stabilising International Cocoa Agreement had come into effect on Tuesday (although consumer signings were below requirements) came as no surprise and had little effect on Sentiment. Neither did the ICCO secretariat's forecast that this year's expected world production deficit of 110,000 tonnes, which would be the third in succession, would be followed by three more, totalling 375,000 tonnes.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium       +16,875  to  2,565,125 Aluminium alloy    -140  to  46,920 Copper           -2,025  to  558,950 Lead               +875  to  330,775 Nickel              -12  to  132,210 Zinc             +8,050  to  1,039,850 Tin                +375  to  22,015  --------------------------------------</p>

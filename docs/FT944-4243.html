			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / No evidence of growing skills gap There is no hard evidence that skills shortages are increasing in the British economy, according to the latest Employment Gazette, in spite of several published surveys which have cited increasing recruitment difficulties. The latest Skill Needs in Britain survey, funded by the employment department, finds that 21 per cent of employers this spring reported hard-to-fill vacancies over the previous 12 months, compared with 16 per cent in 1993 and 1992. The gazette says: 'The rise in recruitment difficulties can be partly explained by an in-crease in recruitment activity.' Although surveys by the Confederation of British Industry and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce have reported recruitment difficulties, the gazette says that this is not necessarily due to a lack of skills in the labour force. It says: 'Recruitment difficulties may be caused by several other factors: by employers making jobs unattractive (poor pay, poor conditions); by job seekers with unrealistically high expectations of terms and conditions; because the nature of the work is unpopular; or because potential recruits have little or no relevant work experience.' Occupational groups which contained large shares of hard-to-fill vacancies included sales and services, catering, nurses, engineers and technologists. This year 63 per cent of employers reported that the skill needs of their workforce were increasing - up from 60 per cent. However, the survey says this increase in needs does not always produce a skills shortage. Only 12 per cent of employers said that a skills gap existed among their employees, down from 17 per cent last year.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS' GROUP IS RELENTLESS IN URGING CHANGES AT SCHOOL  </P> <P> Martha Harvey thinks it's just a matter of setting a good example.  </P> <P> Harvey is president of the A. Phillip Randolph High School Parents Assn., and  it's a commitment she and her fellow board members take seriously. They meet  through the summer and at least two times a month during the school year. Some  even give up vacation time. And some stay on after their own kids graduate, to  help the next group learn the ropes.  </P> <P> "We feel that by doing, we exemplify what we expect our kids to do," Harvey  says.  </P> <P> This is not a group that runs bake sales. They press the school for real  changes, such as mid-term reports, which teachers resisted.  </P> <P> They also run political interference at the Board of Education for Lottie  Taylor, the principal, such as supporting her in cutting an administrator  instead of a classroom teacher.  </P> <P> Taylor encourages such involvement. To her, lack of parent participation is an  obstacle in obtaining her pet school reform: vouchers to let families shop for  schools.  </P> <P> Taylor is all for parental choice.  </P> <P> But she thinks the voucher lobby talks too much about choice and not enough  about responsibility.  </P> <P> "There is a broader obligation on the part of the parent once he chooses. The  parent has to be a real parent."  </P></p>

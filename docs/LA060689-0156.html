			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EDBERG, GRAF POWER WAY INTO SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, slicing steadily from the back court and volleying with the  confidence that swept him to last year's Wimbledon title, ended the French Open  hopes of rising Argentine Alberto Mancini with a crushing 6-1, 6-3, 7-6  quarterfinal victory today.  </P> <P> Defending champion Steffi Graf, unaffected by a 45-minute rain delay, powered  into the semifinals with a 6-0, 6-4 victory over Conchita Martinez of Spain.  </P> <P> The third-seeded Edberg, who saved two set points in the third set, reached the  semifinals at Roland Garros for the first time. He negated Mancini's fearsome  power in a match that began 45 minutes late and was interrupted in the second  set by a 55-minute rain delay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hottest Player on Tour  </P> <P> Edberg, who has attracted little attention during the tournament despite  dropping only one set, never let the Argentine -- the hottest player on the  tour coming into the men's event -- get into the match.  </P> <P> "He's a fast-court player but he didn't miss a ball," Mancini said. "His serve  has a very high bounce and it's very difficult to return. He reaches the net so  quickly. When you hit the return, he's already there."  </P> <P> The opening set, played in overcast conditions and a light drizzle, lasted just  24 minutes as the Wimbledon champion swept to a 5-0 lead.  </P> <P> He quickly pocketed the set two games later and led 4-3, with a break of serve,  in the second set when the drizzle turned to heavy rain.  </P> <P> When the action resumed, Mancini still was unable to turn Edberg's slices into  winners. The depth and power that had annihilated previous opponents just  wouldn't come.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sarcastic Shout  </P> <P> Edberg, after holding for 5-3, broke the Argentine for the set on his sixth set  point, set up for him by a double fault.  </P> <P> Mancini's cause wasn't helped by a spectator who sarcastically shouted out  "underhand," suggesting Mancini serve underhand in the way Michael Chang did on  Monday on the way to upsetting Ivan Lendl.  </P> <P> Mancini took a 5-3 lead in the third set, but Edberg, cool and composed under  pressure, held him off to reach a tiebreaker and win the match.  </P> <P> Graf's victory over Martinez means the defending champion and No. 1 seed now  has dropped only 13 games in five matches in her bid for a third straight  French women's crown and sixth consecutive Grand Slam tournament title.  </P> <P> In the 26-minute opening set, Graf lost only 14 points as she pushed  17-year-old Martinez, one of the world's rising young clay-court performers,  around the Center Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interrupted by Rain  </P> <P> Graf led 3-2 in the second set with a break of serve when a heavy downpour,  accompanied by thunder and lightning, sent the players racing for the safety of  the locker rooms.  </P> <P> When they emerged in the sunshine, the eighth-seeded Martinez broke straight  back, then became the first player in the tournament to win four games against  the West German.  </P> <P> The Spaniard was rallying well at this time, winning her share of the big  points with steady baseline play. But she couldn't keep it up, dropped her  serve to go down 4-5 and was finished off by Graf in the next game.  </P> <P> It was only the second defeat on clay this season for Martinez, who beat  Gabriela Sabatini in Tampa, Fla., earlier this year.  </P> <P> In the other half of the women's draw, Aranxta Sanchez made sure of one Spanish  semifinalist as she whipped Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> At Beckenham, England, torrential rain forced the second day's play in the  men's singles of the grass-court tennis tournament today to be called off  without a ball being struck. Spectators were hoping to see top-seeded John  McEnroe play a second-round match against West Germany's Patrick Baur.  </P></p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Foreclosure begun on Reichmann empire THE dismantling of the Reichmanns' Canadian property empire is moving ahead. The bondholders of First Canadian Place, the Reichmanns' former flagship property in Toronto, have begun foreclosure proceedings. Mr William Maclean, chairman of the bondholders' committee, said the move followed the rejection on January 15 of Olympia &amp; York Developments' financial restructuring plan by its creditors. O&amp;Y went into bankruptcy protection last May. Since the rejection of its restructuring plan, its creditors have been taking possession of the Canadian properties. Mr Maclean said bondholders for First Canadian Place, once valued at Dollars 450m, were acting with the Bank of Montreal and North American Life to ensure the 2.5m sq ft building would have a sound future.</p>

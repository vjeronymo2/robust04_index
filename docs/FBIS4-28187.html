			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in its  information published on May 31 branded the Kim Yong-sam group's  planned "monetary reform" as an out-and-out anti-popular one,  according to Radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul.    The information says:    The Kim Yong-sam group is compelled to force the "monetary  reform" because it has been driven to a blind alley by the  failure of its economic policy and political crisis. One of the  chief aims sought by it in this "reform" is to bind working  people to low wages and help raise the "international  competitiveness" of big businesses at their sacrifices.    Most of the money to be redeemed through the "monetary  reform" is not money of comprador businesses but of middle class  and other people, and the money will find its way into the hands  of comprador businesses, bringing benefits, not any losses, to  them.    A buyer will suffer a bigger loss when he buys a thing with  the newly issued money than with the former currency lower in  value, and wages will automatically be frozen on a low scale  and commodity prices again rise variably. It is only working  people, after all, who will suffer from it.    The anti-popular "monetary reform" will drive the "civilian"  regime now in the grip of a crisis into a hopeless pitfall of  destruction.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Pope denounces Mafia actions POPE John Paul II strongly condemned Mafia bosses yesterday, saying they face the wrath of God unless they forsake their evil ways, AP reports from Agrigento, Sicily. 'God once said, 'Don't kill.' Man, any man, any group of men, the Mafia, can't change and trample this most sacred law of God,' the pope said in a voice shaking with rage. The outburst at the end of his visit to this Mafia bastion was the Catholic Church's strongest condemnation of organised crime. The criticism, whose vehemence stunned observers, came in impromptu remarks at an outdoor Mass in the Valley of Temples, beneath a hilltop cluster of 5th century BC temples, Earlier thousands heard the Pope pay homage to law officers who have tried to clamp down on the Mafia. 'During this latest visit in Sicily, I can't help but recall, with particular emotion, those who, in affirming the ideals of justice and law, paid for their commitment to the struggle against the violent forces of evil with the sacrifice of their lives,' he told a crowd outside Agrigento's cathedral. Several hours later, the Pope met the parents of Judge Rosario Livatino, who was killed outside Agrigento in 1990. The Mafia allegedly ordered the judge's death after he refused to let the Mafia sway him in issuing a sentence. The murders of Mafia investigators Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino has also fuelled anger against the Mafia across the island. 'They are martyrs of justice, indirectly of the faith,' the pope said.</p>

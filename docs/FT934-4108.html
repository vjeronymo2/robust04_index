			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Warning on house negative equity More than a quarter of homes bought between 1988 and 1991 are worth less than the mortgages that were used to buy them, says a study published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The survey found that the proportion of owners with negative equity from those years had risen during the past 12 months from 21 per cent to 26 per cent. The Bank of England estimated the number of households with negative equity rose to 1.8m in the first quarter of the year. In October Woolwich Building Society said that figure had fallen to 1.36m.</p>

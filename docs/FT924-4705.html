			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Ciga to unveil debt restructuring CIGA HOTELS, the luxury international hotel group controlled by the Aga Khan, will unveil a new debt restructuring scheme later this week. Borrowing by the company rose to L820bn (Pounds 389m) at the end of June, up from L737bn in December 1991, after poor earnings and continuing heavy expenditure on modernisation. Ciga has grown from a predominantly Italian group into one of the world's larger hotel chains following a string of acquisitions. However, a bunching of purchases, expensive modernisations and declining profits owing to the Gulf war and recession have pushed it into the red. The group lost L58.8bn in the first half of this year after losing L98bn in 1991. The new restructuring plan, decided at a board meeting last Wednesday, will involve disposals and refinancings to improve the group's debt profile. In May, Ciga agreed with its bankers on a rescheduling programme which allowed for the suspension of interest payments. The company also plans to sell some of its best-known hotels. Although no names have been released, the hotels for sale are believed to include the Des Bains on the Lido in Venice and others in Milan, Rome and Florence. Mr Claudio Miorelli, a Ciga official, said no disposals had yet taken place. Further information may come later this week. He confirmed Ciga had more than L1,000bn of assets at the end of 1991 to counterbalance its debts. Although occupancy rates have improved from the depressed levels after the Gulf war, the group remains hit by the economic slowdown. Ciga hotels, many now lavishly restored, are among the most expensive in Italy. 'We have done relatively well compared with many other hotel groups,' said Mr Miorelli. At the operating level, Ciga's profits improved to L14.6bn in the first half of 1992, compared with an operating loss of L8.9bn in the same period a year earlier. However, he admitted that occupancy rates in the usually busy months of October and November were 'not as good as we would have liked'. Ciga is not the only part of the Aga Khan's Italian business empire to be feeling the pinch. Fimpar, the overall holding company, reported a loss of L65bn in 1991, up from L15.3bn the previous year, on sales which fell by 6.5 per cent to L461bn.</p>

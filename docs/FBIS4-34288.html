			<p>BFN     [Text] The Batllist Forum and the Party of the Government  by the People [PGP] on 8 June signed a historic programmatic and  electoral agreement at the Legislative Palace's Parties Hall.  List 99 leader Renan Rodriguez, whose position was never too far  from the Colorado Party and who opened the round of speeches at  the ceremony, said the agreement is the result of a natural  operation and "the soldering process will not leave rough edges"  because, as in the past, both factions will form a single  political entity.    PGP leader Hugo Batlle, who spoke afterward, did not talk  about a return to basics or to his Colorado Party origins. He  spoke about the importance of the agreement, stressing that it  was made between "two different political groups with a common  past" that are and will continue to be independent from each  other.    Renan Rodriguez--without hiding his satisfaction over the  agreement--compared former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti and  Jose Batlle y Ordonez. He said Sanguinetti was "a natural  candidate for the presidency of the Republic," just as Batlle  was the Colorado Party's natural leader in 1910. He mentioned  the difficulties each had during their first governments and  stressed that in Batlle's case the people "very much wanted him  to continue his work." Rodriguez said that something similar  occurs today with Sanguinetti.    Batlle, in turn, characterized the ceremony as something  that  could change the country's future, adding that the Batllist  forum as well as the PGP have given proof of their "deep civic  courage."    "We are doing what people expected us to do long ago. People  wanted to see leaders with courage to break the routine, the  prejudice, the past, heal the old wounds," the List 99 leader  said.    "Many things that happened in the past will not occur again,  and many things that never happened will start occurring now,  Batlle said [no end quotation mark as published]. The phrase was  received with long applause.    He said he trusted the agreement will serve to build a  better  country for all Uruguayans "seeking equality from the beginning."  <H5>  Sanguinetti: Count the Stones. </H5>   The Batllist Forum leader [Luis Maria Sanguinetti] closed  the  ceremony with a speech that began with a citation from a great  poet (Elliot) and was closed with a phrase that belonged to  another famous artist. "We will begin by counting the stones so  as to be able to finish counting the stars."    Referring to the agreement, Sanguinetti said the voices that  called for it from the silent past have said: "We want unity  among leaders so that unity can be possible among citizens."  Sanguinetti said this was the reason he had taken "this hopeful  step for unity."    "Today we have fewer rich people than during Batlle y  Ordonez's times. We also have fewer poor people. But the needs  and those in need have increased. A democratic society cannot  accept the duality of having groups that reach modernity while  other groups sink in degradation," Sanguinetti said, adding: "A  country's sensitivity cannot be measured only by its respect for  majorities but by its sensitivity toward minorities."    Sanguinetti said we cannot have "another irrational  confrontation between the state and the market" similar to the  confrontation between cities and rural areas. "The country needs  of all its citizens. A modern society needs us all," the leader  said.</p>

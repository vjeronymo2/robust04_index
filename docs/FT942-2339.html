			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Toyota plant's impact will extend beyond Midlands Sir, Your article, 'Toyota plant fails to boost Midlands economy' (June 15), gives a rather short-term view. It is important to stress that when our work was completed in February this year the first phase of the plant was only just moving to a second shift. The impact to date has been entirely in line with Toyota's own commitments. When the investment was first announced, it generated what were, perhaps, rather unrealistic local expectations and concerns. Our study was commissioned precisely because there was lack of reliable evidence from which to project the impact of such a development. However, it is important that we do not move from a position of unrealistic expectations to one where we are overly dismissive. The plant remains one of the largest projects to be attracted to the region, and the UK, in recent years. Only a limited part of its likely long-term impact has yet been seen. There is also the potential for the plant to exert a wider impact beyond the employment, income and trade links. It brings innovative training and recruitment policies which may provide useful models for other employers. On a wider basis, Japanese quality demands are having an important impact on the competitiveness of the UK components supply industry. It also has to be said that the arrival of the plant has provided a welcome boost to confidence at a time which the regional economy was at a very low ebb.

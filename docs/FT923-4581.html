			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Property: Beauty of the real Majorca MAJORCA'S image has much to live down in Britain. The Mediterranean island remains linked inextricably with 'fly and fry' package holidays and excessive lager consumption; the idea of actually buying a holiday or retirement home there brings visions of beach-side boxes or apartment blocks surrounded by discos. It is true that these are rather too plentiful, especially along the south coast around Palma. But Majorca remains a beautiful island and the government is making determined, if belated, efforts to up-grade existing resorts (notably, the notorious Magaluf). Also, it has introduced environmental laws to control further developments. What, then, are the choices for potential buyers in the 'other' Majorca? You could always try such trouble-free, sophisticated and exclusive developments as the golfing complex of Las Abubillas near Puerto Andraitx, or the Anchorage Club 8km west of Palma (with prices from Pounds 120,000 for a one-bed flat to Pounds 400,000 for three beds). But for a retreat from the mainstream tourist beat, turn your back on Palma. The north-western mountains shelter picturesque spots such as Soller, Deia and Valledemossa; it is not surprising the area has attracted artists and celebrities from Chopin, George Sand and Robert Graves to Richard Branson and Michael Douglas. But forget any dreams of an unconverted barn for Pounds 15,000. While old farmhouses (fincas) and villas can be had, they are not cheap any more; indeed, fincas are now very fashionable. 'People love to say they have one and they're getting smaller every day,' says Heather Langford of the Palma-based Agencia Hoz. For a restored property and some land, you are likely to pay at least Pounds 200,000. Simple stone cottages and 'town houses' can, however, be found for less. A few miles inland from Puerto Sollxer, the honeyed-stone farming village of Fornalutx perches among its olive groves in a verdant, terraced valley. A renovated stone house there, dating to 1700 and complete with orange grove, olive oil store and a ruined outhouse that could be converted, costs around Pounds 100,000. In the same village, a typical Majorcan town house - tall, thin and roomy but needing an estimated Pounds 25,000-plus to restore - is available at around Pounds 60,000. But the charms of Fornalutx are gaining recognition; according to one local estimate, 30 per cent of the houses already are holiday homes or permanent residences for expatriates, mainly Swedish and English. Thus, while there are interesting choices to be made, do not expect a cut-price bonanza for up-market property despite the market being depressed. While English trade (traditionally the backbone of second-home business on the island) has dried up in the past two years, house price levels have been maintained by rich Majorcans, well-off Spaniards from Madrid and Barcelona, and Germans and Swiss who still can afford a good thing when they see it. There are bargains to be had, of course, but these are mainly in villa and apartment re-sales rather than new developments or old properties. Indeed, Mintegui, a Majorcan estate agency which acts for Humberts, the UK agent, reports: 'Speculators are coming in, mainly from the UK, and making very low offers. And some owners do have to take them up.' Langford cites the Pounds 40,000-100,000 flat bracket as the hardest hit. Overall, though, she says: 'We thought the economic crisis in England would have had a bigger impact but prices aren't dropping, except in odd cases.' Many sellers, she adds, are prepared to sit back and ride the recession until demand picks up.

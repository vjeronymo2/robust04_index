			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Arts: Joshua Bell - Concert Over many years in the Festival Hall, the BBC Symphony has offered programmes for serious music-lovers - serious enough to know that they could listen free at home, with digital sound, instead of paying something close to the independent orchestras' prices for good seats. In the hall, audiences were often painfully sparse. This season, all seats for the BBCSO concerts cost Pounds 9, all unreserved - and the experience of live music-making, after all, is beyond price. Not enough people know that yet; but on Wednesday it was a pleasure to find eager listeners crowding the front two-thirds of the hall, instead of being thinly spaced by income-level gaps. If there was a specific attraction, it was hard to pin it down. Perhaps the young virtuoso Joshua Bell, in Prokofiev's Violin Concerto no. 1 - but virtuoso-groupies would not have warmed to Alexander Goehr's crypto-serial Little Symphony (1963) with the generosity of this audience. (Andrew Davis conducted it with lucid sympathy; it sounded not only serenely cogent but full of aural imagination, plain but telling.) Nor, surely, would sober Goehr fans have been enticed by the closing piece, Vaughan Williams' pictorial 'A London Symphony' from 50 years earlier, though I expect Davis did it equal justice. What was certain was that Bell gave a marvellous account of the Prokofiev concerto, superbly assured and fresh, even dewy - as if it carried no daunting virtuoso-history. It does have such a history, including a celebrated Isaac Stern recording that every concert violinist knows. Bell might have been deliberately refusing comparisons. Instead of mimicking Stern's strict-time raptness at the start and the close, he was teasingly hesitant and fanciful; the 'effects' - disembodied whistling in high harmonics, gypsy snarls sul ponticello (rough bowing near the bridge of the instrument) - sounded like spontaneous dramatic colour. All of it lived and breathed. Amid a generation of alarmingly gifted violin-players, Bell and the Siberian Maxim Vengerov (even younger) stand out by virtue of early discovery and precocious maturity. They make a fascinating contrast, a bit like Domingo v. Pavarotti: the one a conscious, self-effacing artist with an imagination and a technique equal to almost anything that musical ends could require, the other a 'natural', purpose-born phenomenon of instinctive musicianship - but those tenors were grown-up performers when they hit their stride, and these violinists are barely past adolescence. Should either of them be run over by a bus, you may spend years regretting that you didn't hear them live.</p>

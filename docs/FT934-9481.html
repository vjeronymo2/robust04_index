			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stone Container increases sale STONE CONTAINER, the Chicago-based international packaging group, will sell a larger than expected part of its newsprint business in its stock offer in Canada and Europe. Stone has added convertible debentures to the offer to bring the amount raised to about CDollars 450m from CDollars 300m. On conversion of the debentures, the public would own 40 per cent of Stone Consolidated, against about 25 per cent before the changes to the prospectus. The stock is being offered at CDollars 13 to CDollars 15 a share as part of a package of shares and debentures. Stone originally planned a straight Stone Consolidated equity offer. The new company takes in the Canadian newsprint and groundwood paper mills and the Ellesmere Port newsprint mill, near Liverpool. PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, says all 139 senior creditors have accepted its restructuring plan, including a CDollars 700m debt-equity swap. Junior creditors have already endorsed the plan. However, it can only go through when American Airlines completes a promised CDollars 246m equity infusion in return for 25 per cent ownership of Canadian Airlines. This, in turn, is held up over a dispute on a reservation system ownership between Canadian Airlines and Air Canada.</p>

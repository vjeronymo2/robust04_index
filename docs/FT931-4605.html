			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Kerry rise 19% to IPounds 28.7m KERRY GROUP, Ireland's fast-growing milk and meat processing company, reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992, from IPounds 24.1m to IPounds 28.7m (Pounds 29m), on turnover up 10 per cent to IPounds 826.7m, against IPounds 754.9m. The results incorporated the first full-year contributions from a series of 1991 acquisitions, Kantoher, Meadow Meats and Tunney Meats in Ireland, Dairyland Products in the US and Eastleigh Flavours, a UK food ingredients company. During 1992 the company acquired Buxted Duckling in the UK and Tuam Dairies in Ireland. Two thirds of the company's turnover is now from overseas. Meat processing now accounts for 50 per cent of the group's business. Turnover has nearly trebled since 1987, while earnings per share and pre-tax profits have more than doubled and risen 3 1/2 times respectively in the five years. Earnings per share for 1992 rose 9 per cent to 15.8p (14.5p). A final dividend of 1.47p (1.4p), is recommended making a total of 2.26p, compared with 2.15p. Mr Liam Igoe of Goodbody, the Dublin stockbroker, forecast 1993 earnings of 16.6p per share on pre-tax profits of IPounds 32.7m, although he said 'there could be some upside on that due to the strength of the dollar'.</p>

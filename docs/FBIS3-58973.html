			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dhimitris Petykhakis: "Who Lost and Who Won From </F> GATT"]    [Text] The question of who won and who lost from the GATT  agreement that was finally reached not only has no clear-cut  answer, but to find the right answer one must first define the  meaning of "good" and "bad." For instance, if one considers the  temporary "accommodation" of a certain sector or a certain  product a good thing, there is one kind of answer. Then again,  if delivering one sector or product to the depths of  international competition is bad, then the answer is different.    Let us take up first the issues of "strictly Greek  interest":    1) Textiles. It is certainly not good that we (and Portugal  as well) failed to secure from the Europeans the capital that  would help our textile sector better face the naked competition  to which it will be exposed after the agreement. While Portugal,  of course, will be even more affected, it did succeed in  securing ECU400 million in community funding, and 500 million in  community loans (under favorable terms). We accomplished nothing  of the sort. [GATT negotiator] Theodhoros Pangalos said that  "the programs aimed at strengthening the textile sector had not  been ready" to be submitted to the Community so as to ask for  the relative financing. According to information from reliable  officials, our country submitted to the EC three years ago a  five-year program for restructuring and modernizing the Greek  textile sector amounting to ECU1.9 billion. Community officials  had led us to believe there was hope "for at least some  assistance." It is also certain that our Portuguese competitors  will enjoy some advantages over us.    2) Maritime transportation. Our merchant marine will surely  be favored by the fact that agreement was reached and that as a  result, international trade will expand, thus increasing the  demand for the services our sector "sells." The protectionism  the United States demanded, which would have been unfavorable to  us because we have a more competitive and flexible merchant  marine, did not come to pass. However, it will again surface  very soon, as will also the cabotage issue. We are doing all  right for the time being in preventing foreigners from  interfering in the Greek sector by invoking mainly national  security, but let us not forget for one moment that the war  continues and that many battles will still take place.    3) Agriculture. Our olive oil, produce, and wine sectors  will  surely be affected. Especially with regard to produce, our  argument that production in the southern European countries does  not affect international trade was not accepted; as a result,  the reduction of supports and export subsidies agreed upon means  lost income for our producers. While the Community has more or  less undertaken to secure financial offsets from the CAP (Common  Agricultural Policy), restrictions in the Community budget are  such that some doubt the restrictions will actually materialize.  Others are more optimistic, citing the precedent of other  products that were handled in similar fashion last year in the  Blair House pre-agreement (tobacco, meats, dairy products, oil  seeds, cereals). We shall soon know who is right.    Let us now proceed briefly to a more general review. It is  indeed difficult to understand the French, who are claiming  victory in the audiovisual sector. If their films, broadcasts,  and songs are of lower quality and marketability than  Hollywood's, no national legislation will avert the shrinkage of  the Francophone culture's share of the world market. The same is  true for Greece and the other countries in the Union.    For the rest, the opening of international trade and the  increase of the worldwide production of goods and services will  surely be to the advantage of Greece and all others. However,  those possessing competitive national companies and good lobbies  to influence public opinion and, hence, consumer behavior, will  be most favored. It is thus up to readers to decide who are the  losers and the winners from the famous GATT agreement.</p>

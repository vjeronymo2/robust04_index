			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] </F>   [Text] Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus -- sentenced to  death for the assassination of SA Communist Party chief Chris  Hani -- are unlikely to qualify for amnesty in terms of new  legislation being drafted.    Justice Minister Dullah Omar told THE STAR yesterday: "I  don't think it should be assumed that the definition (of  politically motivated crimes) will cover them."    Justice Ministry sources indicated that the new amnesty  legislation should be put before Parliament when it begins  sitting again on June 20.    In terms of the Interim Constitution, the cut-off date for  legislation which will free those convicted of or being  responsible for politically motivated crimes should be December  6 1993. It is understood midnight on December 5 has been  pencilled into the legislation being prepared.    Although Hani was assassinated on April 10 last year, Omar's  comments appear to confirm that the definition of a "politically  motivated crime" will be drafted in such a way that Derby-Lewis  and Walus will not qualify.    There was no indication whether it will include others  involved in notorious cases such as the killing of Amy Biehl and  those responsible for various massacres -- such as Boipatong,  Bisho and the St James Church slaughters -- before December 5.    This week there were indications after talks between  President Mandela and CP [Conservative Party] leader Dr Ferdi  Hartzenberg that the right wing could benefit from amnesty for  politically related crimes.    It was not clear whether this would include the 32 men who  allegedly carried out a spate of pre-election bomb attacks as  this would require a change to the Interim Constitution by  extending the cut-off date, which appears unlikely.    After meeting Hartzenberg on Monday, Mandela said the  Government would apply the same criteria for amnesty to  rightwingers who committed offences of a political nature  between October 8 1990 -- the cut-off date in existing  legislation -- and December 5 last year. Hartzenberg and Omar  are to hold talks on the amnesty issue.    Deputy President de Klerk had allegedly seen the draft  legislation and approved it.</p>

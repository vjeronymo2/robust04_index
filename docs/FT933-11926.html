			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fog clears from Montedison loss  -The allegations surrounding the group SHAREHOLDERS crowding into the glass-topped ground-floor assembly hall of Montedison's Milan headquarters last month were shocked to discover their group, already rocked by revelations of higher-than-expected borrowings, had lost L435bn (Dollars 271m) more than previously revealed. No adequate reasons for the higher loss, revised upwards to L1,679bn from L1,244bn, were given. The only comment from Mr Carlo Sama, then Montedison's managing director, was that the additional figure stemmed from a credit by Financing and Investments, a hitherto-unknown Curacao-based subsidiary, which had proved to be 'irrecoverable'. In the four weeks since then, Mr Sama has landed in jail, accused, like three others arrested over the weekend, of falsifying company accounts and illegal political funding. Meanwhile, Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, and Mr Raul Gardini, the former head of the quoted Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, which controls Montedison, have committed suicide. The link is Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former senior Ferruzzi and Montedison executive who returned from hiding earlier this month to give himself up to Milan magistrates investigating political corruption. Mr Garofano has sketched a diagram of both political and corporate corruption, which in the case of the ill-fated Enimont joint venture between Eni and Montedison, clearly overlapped. His testimony, widely leaked and believed to be reliable, may have influenced Mr Cagliari's decision and almost certainly affected that of Mr Gardini, who would have been arrested along with Mr Sama and the others had he not apparently commited suicide. According to Mr Garofano, much of Montedison's extra L435bn loss stemmed from financial transactions designed to cover up heavy commodity trading losses incurred by the Ferruzzi group in 1989. That was when Ferruzzi, then run by Mr Gardini, was forced by the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's leading futures exchange, to unwind huge positions in 1989. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission demanded the operation as they claimed Ferruzzi had been trying to corner the market in soyabean futures. If successful, it could have forced other traders into making highly expensive purchases of soyabeans, whose price was already rising as a result on the cash market. The clash with the CBOT left Ferruzzi nursing a Dollars 2m fine and a Dollars 150m trading loss incurred from unwinding positions. The impact was reflected in Ferfin's 1990 accounts. However, Mr Garofano's testimony suggests the actual loss was actually about Dollars 350m to Dollars 450m. To hide its true size, Mr Gardini allegedly authorised a financial window-dressing by which the non-declared losses were shifted off Ferfin's balance sheet and parked with obscure, non-consolidated Montedison subsidiaries. The losses were masked by 'back-to-back' financial transactions with so far unnamed banks, which lent money to cover the gap in the accounts. The reason the loss suddenly appeared last month was because of Ferfin's mounting financial difficulties. In late May, the company and the controlling Ferruzzi family called in five big Italian banks to restructure the affairs of the group, now facing borrowings of about L31,000bn. One of the first moves by the banks, perhaps aided by tip-offs, was to pick through the group's accounts, leading to the discovery of the irregularities in Montedison's balance sheet. The Chicago debacle is only one, though perhaps the biggest - of a number of irregularities disclosed by Mr Garofano. His leaked testimony suggests the Enimont joint venture was a source of huge kickbacks to Italy's political parties. Magistrates unpeeling Italy's political corruption scandal over the past 17 months have increasingly suspected that Enimont lay close to the core. The doubts have focused on the circumstances surrounding the creation of the group, owned 40 per cent each by Montedison and Eni, with the remainder floating, and its termination in November 1990. Mr Garofano's allegations, published yesterday in a weekly news magazine after an extract was released last Thursday evening, focus on the creation of a L80bn to L100bn pool of off-balance sheet funds, created through undeclared capital gains on certain property transactions. These were allegedly used to finance donations to political parties via Eni as part of the deal by which Montedison sold its stake in Enimont to its public-sector partner. The allegations also suggest members of the Ferruzzi family may have been cavalier in distinguishing between moneys attributable to Serafino Ferruzzi, the ultimate family holding company, which owns about 48 per cent of Ferfin, and the accounts of the public companies. Though the sums involved are much smaller than those linked to the kickback allegations over Enimont, the allegations recall similar claims about other corporate collapses, such as the Maxwell group or Polly Peck in the UK, where a quoted group was dominated by a single family shareholder.</p>

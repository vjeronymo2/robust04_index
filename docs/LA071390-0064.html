			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> PITTING CAREER VS. LIFESTYLE;  </P> <P> AS FINANCIAL CLOUT SHIFTS FROM THE BAY AREA TO THE SOUTHLAND, MORE IN THE WORK  FORCE FACE A DECISION TO TRANSFER. SOME BALK, BUT OTHERS WHO DO MOVE FIND THEY  GET TO LIKE IT.  </P> <P> Deborah Dilley knew her promotion at First Interstate Bank was terrific, but  she wondered, "If this is such a great opportunity, how come I feel so rotten?"  </P> <P> It was simply because the new job required moving from the Bay Area to Los  Angeles, or, as she recalls feeling at the time, "from paradise to the pit of  the world," where smog is king, where commutes take four hours, where people  are flaky and where drive-by shooters menace at every corner.  </P> <P> She thought about declining, until her husband convinced her that it would be  an adventure. Now, after more than a year of living in the Encino hills and  playing golf whenever they feel like it, the couple have adjusted.  </P> <P> With the balance of financial power shifting southward from San Francisco, once  the West's undisputed corporate and banking leader but increasingly the town  that plays second fiddle, more people like Dilley are being forced to choose  between opportunity and lifestyle.  </P> <P> Hoping for career advancement, many employees are leaving their hearts in San  Francisco but moving their belongings to La-La Land. Some go with trepidation,  fearful of housing costs, crummy air and congestion. But they go nonetheless,  relocation specialists say, because the moving and shaking is occurring in  vast, dynamic Southern California.  </P> <P> "From a commercial point of view," says Leon A. Farley, a San Francisco-based  executive recruiter, "L.A. is becoming increasingly significant."  </P> <P> If San Francisco and its environs remain a top-rated spot for travelers and a  beloved home for residents, the fact is that in many ways the city is viewed as  a dying Athens overshadowed by its sprawling, brawny southern counterpart.  </P> <P> Although a number of large companies still call San Francisco home -- notably  Chevron and Bank of America -- many others have moved or been swallowed up in  takeovers. The Bay Area still reigns in high technology and has a thriving  amalgamation of small businesses and specialized service firms, but Southern  California whips it handily in financial services, international trade,  retailing and entertainment.  </P> <P> And even for companies with headquarters in San Francisco, Southern California  provides a far bigger market for their goods and services. With 14.5 million  people, Greater Los Angeles is more than twice as populous as the nine-county  Bay Area.  </P> <P> As a result, companies seeking to expand in the Southland, from architectural  firms to oil companies, routinely must seek candidates for promotions and  transfers. Their overtures can meet with emotions other than sheer joy, and  companies find that they often must sweeten the deal by throwing in a car or  money for housing.  </P> <P> After all, in the view of many Northern Californians, nurtured on Los  Angeles-bashing, it's quite a trade-off. Will it be quaint Victorian houses or  tacky mini-malls? The Golden Gate Bridge or tangles of freeway overpasses? BART  or gridlock? Fog or smog?  </P> <P> Joyce Sonner was initially glum at the prospect of leaving the Bay Area. She  and her husband, Leo, lived in an $800-a-month apartment in San Ramon and took  BART into the city each weekend to eat at Fisherman's Wharf or go to the  theater.  </P> <P> But when Dow Chemical asked Leo Sonner to become senior account manager for its  Dow Plastics division in City of Industry, with responsibility for a territory  five times larger than the one he had, the couple decided they couldn't pass it  up.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, they moved to a quintessentially Southern California house,  complete with white stucco and a red-tile roof, in the oceanside community of  Dana Point. From their sun-splashed deck they look out on the Saddleback  Mountains and wide, sandy beaches.  </P> <P> The $1,700-a-month rent is far more than they were paying, but Leo can do much  of his work from home and Joyce looks forward to owning a boat next year and  taking classes at a nearby college to qualify as a building inspector.  </P> <P> Not too shabby, Joyce freely acknowledges.  </P> <P> "This is really paradise," she says.  </P> <P> Others who make the leap have become converts for various reasons.  </P> <P> Architect Charles Wing, 41, received a big pay raise, an automobile and help in  buying a Santa Monica house when he agreed to manage the growing Brentwood  office of Kaplan/McLaughlin/Diaz. The San Francisco-based firm designed the  classy new mini-mall at Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> "The multicultural aspect of Los Angeles is something I'm very positive about,"  he says. "San Francisco is very provincial."  </P> <P> Although he finds the air here much worse than in the Bay Area, traffic, he  feels, is "really not that different." And there's the warmer weather.  </P> <P> Lisa Bottom, who spent her childhood in Southern California and returned last  year after living in the Bay Area, relishes the museums -- and the warmer  climate. She took some satisfaction in mothballing some of her San Francisco  wardrobe essentials.  </P> <P> "I'm making plans to root," says Bottom, director of interior design for the  downtown Los Angeles office of Whisler-Patri, another San Francisco  architectural firm. Many die-hard San Franciscans, she added, "don't realize  there are wonderful and exciting aspects of life here."  </P> <P> Many Bay Area-based firms with growing operations in Los Angeles find that the  best approach is to recruit volunteers.  </P> <P> "It's strictly voluntary, and, believe it or not, some have (volunteered), but  not many," says David Blatteis, chairman of Blatteis Realty Co., a 62-year-old  San Francisco company with a small but growing Southland office. "Talk to my  older brother, Daniel. He can tell you why he moved down there. It baffles me."  </P> <P> Opportunity, that's why.  </P> <P> The more progressive business climate "is the overriding reason why I moved,"  says Dan Blatteis, who plans soon to add staff to the three-person Century City  office. "Retailers are expanding at a much greater pace in Los Angeles. There's  more wealth."  </P> <P> Blatteis Realty chose to reopen its Southern California office two years ago  after finding that many of the retailers and restaurants for which it was  trying to find sites in San Francisco, such as California Pizza Kitchen, were  based in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Dan Blatteis, 31, acknowledged that it took him a long time to "learn to love  L.A." But now he prefers the warmth to San Francisco's chill, foggy nights, and  relishes the broader range of cultural activities. He even thinks the  restaurants are as good as those in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Another plus: Blatteis lives "two minutes" from his office and can walk to  work.  </P> <P> Chevron Corp., the San Francisco-based oil giant, finds its El Segundo refinery  the toughest place to sell to would-be transfers.  </P> <P> "Because it's a beach location, the cost of housing even an hour away is very  high," says Sue Osborn, Chevron's senior analyst for relocation policies.  </P> <P> Even for Bay Area employees accustomed to hefty price tags on houses, real  estate is the No. 1 concern when it comes to moving south, Osborn says.  </P> <P> Close behind is the cost of operating a car, more of a necessity in the  Southland. Many of Chevron's employees in the Bay Area live near BART and other  mass-transit lines and commute to facilities in the East Bay.  </P> <P> In moving as many as 40 employees a year from the Bay Area to operations in  Ventura, La Habra and El Segundo, the company often encounters what Osborn  calls the "Northern California syndrome."  </P> <P> "People up here tend to think the lifestyle is better," Osborn says.  </P> <P> Among Northern Californians, there is also a widely held notion that Los  Angeles is more expensive. But evidence indicates otherwise.  </P> <P> A family of four in a median-cost city could afford a 2,400-square-foot house  and two cars on an annual income of $60,000, according to relocation  specialists Runzheimer International. The same lifestyle would cost more than  $83,000 in the Bay Area and just over $77,000 in the Southland.  </P> <P> On a percentage basis, job growth in the two areas is projected for the 1990s  "to be roughly the same, about 1.8%," says Stephen Levy, director of the Center  for Continuing Study of the California Economy, based in Palo Alto.  </P> <P> In sheer numbers of jobs, however, the Bay Area does not hold a candle to  Southern California. The Southland is expected in the year 2000 to have a total  of 7.6 million paying jobs, compared to 3.6 million for the San Francisco area.  </P> <P> Despite the opportunities, some firms find it tough to draw from anywhere but  close by.  </P> <P> "We don't find people eager to go to Los Angeles," says Stephen A. Enna,  executive vice president and personnel director for Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "It's  less expensive to recruit from the local market. They're settled and happy. You  don't have to go through the enticement stage."  </P> <P> Executive recruiters also encounter resistance to Los Angeles from older  employees for whom a move would be an economic setback.  </P> <P> "An awful lot of senior people will take a lesser job or compensation to stay  in the Bay Area," says Bernard (Buzz) Schulte, San Francisco-based managing  director for the Northwest region for Korn/Ferry International, an executive  recruiting firm.  </P> <P> Jim Somerville, for one, couldn't be pried free.  </P> <P> While senior vice president of administration for Core-Mark Distributors Inc.  in South San Francisco, Somerville briefly considered a post at a large  Southern California food company but withdrew his name. That was despite the  fact that Core-Mark's business -- distributing tobacco and other products to  convenience stores -- is in a severe downturn.  </P> <P> "The smog was horrible the times I was there," Somerville says, adding that his  wife, Robin, has had respiratory pneumonia.  </P> <P> The Somervilles, who have a house with a pool in the small community of Los  Altos, south of San Francisco, also balked at moving because they found that  Los Angeles lacked the "sense of neighborhood" that exists on the peninsula.  For a time, Somerville considered commuting by air from the Bay Area but  ultimately decided the strain would be too much.  </P> <P> "It's really an issue of lifestyle," says Somerville, who has since resigned  from Core-Mark and is now concentrating his job search in Northern California.  </P> <P> For Dilley, vice president and manager of institutional trust sales and  marketing for First Interstate, life in Los Angeles has been a series of  adjustments. And, even though she and husband Ken Rosenberg enjoy the weather  and restaurants, some of the negatives she dreaded occasionally stare her in  the face.  </P> <P> Dilley was driving some Bay Area visitors around one time, trying to convince  them that "it's not that bad here." Within the next 24 hours, they saw police  arresting nine youths, a burglary and a car with bullet holes.  </P> <P> "I'm really enjoying my stay, but I view it as a stay," Dilley says. "I'd go  back in a minute to the Bay Area."  </P></p>

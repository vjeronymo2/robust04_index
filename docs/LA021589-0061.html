			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The U.S. Army has ordered a college student, who set off a nationwide search  when he ran off with his new wife to find "perfect love," to serve four years  as an enlisted man to work off his ROTC scholarship. Scott Swanson, 24, of  Naperville, Ill., will be permitted to finish college, delaying his induction  into active duty until as late as May, 1990, officials said. He violated his  ROTC contract when he and his wife, Carolyn, 23, disappeared last April 2. The  Swansons were secretly married a week before they disappeared. Their ransacked  car was found in a Chicago alley with the engine running, leading to fears of  foul play. The couple turned up unharmed July 27 in San Diego.  </P></p>

Mahmud Mohammadi, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry,  told IRNA today that his ministry categorically rejected such  allegations.    "It is a pity that at a time when the people of Iran are  mourning the death of the victims of this crash, such baseless  and false reports are broadcast by ITAR-TASS news agency,"  Mohammadi said.

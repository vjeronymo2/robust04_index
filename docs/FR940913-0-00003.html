			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We expect that the forthcoming legislative proposal would also allow agencies to determine the maximum duration of temporary appointments, subject to collective bargaining or consensus building procedures. In the meantime, however, we believe that stricter service limits are needed to ensure that employees who serve for extended periods are not denied benefits because of their temporary status. We note that the report of the National Performance Review recommended that temporary employees should serve no more than 2 years (24 months) without benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effect on Current Employees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters feared that tightening limits on temporary service could hurt, not help, employees, especially those who have limited skills, whose conversion to permanent or term appointments would be blocked by candidates on an agency's reemployment list, or who work in locations where there are few employment opportunities. We share this concern. We recognize that some employees may be terminated under the new limits. On balance, however, we believe that a greater number would be hurt if we withdrew these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees serving under temporary appointments_even those who have been reappointed or extended many times_have no guarantee of continued employment. Contacts with agencies and employees indicate that some installations are not renewing temporary appointments as readily as in the past because of reduced funding. Installations facing severe budget cuts or downsizing are likely to reduce their temporary workforce even without changes in regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In installations that do not face such severe difficulties, use of term appointments, which afford benefits, to fill longer-lasting nonpermanent jobs would provide more stability for both the agency and the employees. Some agencies expressed concern about losing their investment in training if employees had to be terminated after 2 years (24 months total service). Use of term appointments should reduce turnover and its attendant recruiting and training costs, partially offsetting the cost of providing benefits for the employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Converting Current Employees to Term Appointments Outside the Register <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To facilitate transition from temporary to term appointments, agencies are authorized to give their current competitive service temporary employees term appointments outside the register in accordance with the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Duration of Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This authority is effective  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> immediately upon publication  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of these regulations and will remain in effect for 6 months. (Please note that this is different from the effective date of the regulations.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This authority applies to any employee who is serving in the agency under a temporary appointment in the competitive service on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> publication  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> date and whose service is needed for more than 1 additional year. Several agencies expressed concern that some positions now filled by temporary appointments would not meet the conditions for term appointment. As long as the positions will last for more than 1 year, that is not true. OPM's current instructions permit term appointments to be used in the same situations as temporary appointments. The only difference is the service limit. (Those instructions, provisionally retained in the Federal Personnel Manual Sunset Document, will be incorporated in 5 CFR part 316 in a separate regulation implementing FPM sunset.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appointments under this authority are subject to the procedures set out in 5 CFR part 333, except for the public notice requirement in &sect;333.102. (Public notice is required by law only when jobs will be filled from outside the Federal Government.) An agency that will not convert all eligible temporaries holding identical jobs in the same location must apply veterans' preference in accordance with part 333 in selecting the employees to receive term appointment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Position to Which Converted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employees converted under this authority must be given term appointments to positions in the same series, grade, and location as their temporary positions. Thereafter, they may be reassigned or promoted to other term positions in accordance with their agency's merit promotion policies. The appointments may be made for any period of more than 1 but no more than 4 years, depending on the agency's need for the employee's services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC premier candidate for the Orange Free State,  Mr. Patrick Lekota, says the ANC victory in the province should  be seen as a victory for everybody. Speaking in Bloemfontein,  Mr. Lekota said that he would not be surprised if the result  surpasses all surveys and predictions.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Richard Newton] At a press  conference in Bloemfontein, Mr. Lekota said that although his  opponents had not done that well, they would still be involved  in decision-making.    [Lekota] I will consult with my colleagues, and I would like  to suggest to them that we should insist on close consultation  in whatever we do with the parties that exist in this region.    [Newton] Mr. Lekota added that support for his party had  come  from across the spectrum.    [Lekota] Many white Free Staters voted without regard to  color, and voted therefore for the African National Congress.    [Newton] In anticipation of the expected celebrations, Mr.  Lekota appealed to supporters not to misbehave.    [Lekota] I want to urge our members and supporters, and  well-  wishers to behave with utmost discipline and comeliness. [end  recording]</p>

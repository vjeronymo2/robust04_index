			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Reformist zeal tests the public's patience: Initial euphoria over Domingo Cavallo's economic reforms might be wearing thin IN A country where economy ministers are usually despised, Mr Domingo Cavallo is one of Argentina's most popular public figures. Twenty months into his stewardship of Argentina's inflation-prone economy, Argentina's economic prospects appear transformed. After a decade of slow growth and world-beating inflation rates, growth is healthy - perhaps 7 per cent this year - and inflation has collapsed. With President Carlos Menem allowing him political room for manoeuvre, Mr Cavallo continued and improved the programme of deregulation and privatisation started soon after Mr Menem assumed power in July 1989. But he has done more. He has boosted tax revenues, mainly through assertive application of a value-added tax, and has cut government spending, abolishing subsidies to state-owned industries and shrinking the bureaucracy. There are signs the government was in overall surplus for the first half of this year, for the first time in memory. His most controversial action was to fix, by law, the Argentine currency to the US dollar. The move forbade the central bank from issuing currency unless backed by inflows of foreign exchange. The law, which took effect on April 1 last year, also meant any devaluation required an act of Congress. Curbing the chronic deficit and reining in the central bank have been the key to lowering inflation. However, there are signs that the early euphoria which greeted Mr Cavallo's programme is wearing thin. After quadrupling investors' money in 1991 and surging ahead in early 1992, the Argentine stock market has collapsed, falling by more than 50 per cent between early June and late August. The fall does not yet appear to have shaken confidence in the economy. International reserves have continued to rise, signifying that inflows of private capital have not been choked off. These inflows are necessary to offset the country's worsening current account position, caused in part by a consumer boom which has followed the ending of import controls and reduction of tariff barriers. The current account has swung into deficit as the trade surplus has narrowed: the surplus for the first five months of 1992 was about Dollars 700m (Pounds 351.7m) against Dollars 2.4bn in the same period of 1991. Mr Peter West, economist at the Chartered WestLB merchant bank in London, says there are signs the import surge is levelling off, partly reflecting an easing in consumer spending. While that suggests some relief for Mr Cavallo's programme, its medium-term prospects for success will be determined in large part by whether the country can improve on its poor investment record. According to JP Morgan, the New York bank, Argentina's gross investment as a proportion of GDP fell to 8.9 per cent in 1990, a level at which it would barely be replacing depreciation. Last year the rate was 10 per cent. Morgan suggests the gross investment over the next five years needed to secure 5 per cent annual growth in Argentina is Dollars 125bn, against the Dollars 51bn actually invested between 1987 and 1991. Mr Cavallo has said the investment rate is rising sharply, perhaps to 18 per cent this year (although his figure may not be directly comparable with those provided by Morgan). However, as Mr West points out, it is important to know where that investment is going. If much of it is headed - as has been suggested - for the fast-growing services sector, it would not provide the platform for the export of manufactured goods or agri-products that Mr Cavallo must be hoping will stir growth. Service industries are more lucrative as, unlike the traded goods sector, profits have not been squeezed by imports. This is a potential problem for Mr Cavallo; the lack of competition in services explains why retail prices have risen about 19 per cent in the year to August, while wholesale prices have gone up only 3-4 per cent. He can argue that this is not affecting Argentine competitiveness because businesses pay wholesale prices, and inflation compares favourably with that in the US. But there are signs the inflation rate is causing rumblings in the labour market. If Argentine producers give in to wage increases, this will damage competitiveness and bring shriller calls for a devaluation. Mr Cavallo believes that the competitive benefits of devaluation will be dissipated in weeks through higher costs. However, sooner or later he or a successor will have to confront the issue of devaluation. By its own admission the government needs to do more to provide long-term balance to its finances. It has already reached agreement with provincial governments to provide a share of its tax receipts to the state pension scheme. This will allow the government to raise pensions to minimum levels. More fundamental reform, including a partial privatisation of the system, has been delayed until late in 1993. Privatisation of enterprises is going ahead, although some sell-offs have hit difficulties. The government's debt accord with international banks has also met a hitch, as banks have overwhelmingly chosen one option - which demands most in guarantees from the government. Few observers believe the deal will be allowed to fail over this. The central question, however, is whether the will of the Argentine electorate will hold out over the rest of the reform programme, likely to take at least 18 months to complete.</p>

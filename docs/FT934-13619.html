			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Cairns group warns France FRANCE will carry the blame if Gatt negotiations founder on its attempt to revise Europe's farm trade agreement with the US, according to Senator Peter Cook, Australia's trade minister and leader of the Cairns group of 14 food-exporting countries. Mr Cook, together with Thai and Argentine ministers, had a meeting yesterday with Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry minister, in an attempt to put the Cairns group's views directly to Paris. Later in Bonn, after talks with German ministers, the group's leaders said they were depressed about the prospects for a Gatt deal. They said they believed Germany was putting European unity, and relations with France in particular, ahead of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. In Paris, Mr Cook declined to comment on the possibility of Cairns countries boycotting French produce if France was seen to have wrecked the Round. But he warned that 'any further dilution' of the EC-US farm trade accord - the so-called Blair House deal - 'would be unacceptable' to the group. He said many in the group had 'only reluctantly' acquiesced in the Dunkel draft, which called for a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised farm exports over six years, while Blair House had already watered this reduction down to 21 per cent. The Cairns group would only decide to accept Blair House as the basis for a Gatt settlement when it had seen what offers the leading Gatt participants had made to open their markets. Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime minister, stressed that developing countries needed compensation in extra earnings from agriculture if they were to open up their service sectors.</p>

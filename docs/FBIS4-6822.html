			<p>BFN     [Text] ARMY Chief Wimon Wongwanit yesterday ruled out  separatist involvement in Saturday's bomb blast at Nakhon Si  Thammarat's railway station, and said the military has evidence  to support his claim.    "It is definitely not the work of separatists. We have  evidence. We are gathering evidence. We will know the motive  and the culprits in the next few days," Gen Wimon said.    The military knows there were two to three factors behind  the  bombing, be said, but he declined to elaborate.    Wimon said this kind of violence had not occurred in Nakhon  Si Thammarat before because separatists have never operated in  the province. Such incidents should occur only in provinces  where there is serious conflict.    On Saturday, a bomb went off at the busy southern railway  station killing three people and injuring at least 27 others.  No one has claimed responsibility.    Police said the bomb detonated in a mound of baggage in the  crowded waiting area near a food stall on the platform where the  Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok express train sat waiting to depart.    Witnesses said they saw a young man in his mid-20s place a  paper box amid the baggage and casually walk away about five  minutes before the explosion. A sketch of the suspect was  issued within hours.    But Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop said initial findings  suggested at least three people were involved in planting the  bomb. Police yesterday issued sketches of two more suspects.    Wimon denounced the bombing as "cruel and inhuman". He said  it would damage the country in particular its security and  economy.    A senior official at the Interior Ministry said that before  the explosion the ministry had ordered all southern provinces to  be well-prepared for terrorist acts.    The source who asked not to be named said Saturday's  explosion was not the work of separatists but a movement which  wants to destroy the Government and bring down Fourth Army  Commander Kitti Rattanachaya. The Fourth Army headquarters are  located in Nakhon Si Thammarat.    The source claimed that two lieutenant generals were  dissatisfied with Lt Gen Kitti, who transferred them from the  Fourth Army, and wanted to damage his reputation.    Nakhon Si Thammarat Governor Suchan Phongnua said the  province was warned beforehand that the provincial hall would be  a bomb target, and security had been tightened there.    He said police had provided round the-clock security for the  hall, but he had not expected a bomb would go off in the railway  station.    Officials are investigating whether the incident had  anything  to do with any separatist groups, Suchan said.    On Saturday, Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut also  said  police had received advance intelligence about the bomb plot.  He said police are hunting intensively for confirmation of  another report that there will be similar violence in Bangkok  next month.    Gen Chawalit believes the explosion was the work of a local  group of troublemakers who want to destabilize the government,  and not foreign terrorists.    Interior officials, including Deputy Interior Minister  Chamni  Sakdiset and Permanent Secretary Ari Wong-ariya, yesterday  morning were briefed by local officials.    Chamni, who is also an MP for Nakhon Si Thammarat, said the  explosion was the work of ill-intentioned people who want to  destabilize the government. The incident was linked to violence  in the southernmost provinces, he said.    He said the investigation has progressed since important  witnesses were questioned. The arrest of those responsible for  the explosion will lead to the arrest of those responsible for  other sabotage in the deep South, he predicted.    "We now see the shadow of the wrongdoers, but we have to  gather more information. I believe everything will be clear in  a short time," Chamni said.    He said he had ordered police to beef up security at crowded  places in the province to prevent a repeat of the bombing. He  had also ordered the setting up of two police special task  forces to hunt for suspects.    Ari said the Interior Ministry is preparing a major plan to  prevent sabotage in the South. Provincial governors and police  and military officers will be included.    Col Phathai Suthisi of the Fourth Army said the culprits  must  be experienced explosives handlers. The bomb was not a military  M-26 hand grenade as initially claimed by police. It was  home-made and consisted of about a quarter pound of high  explosive timed to explode only two or three minutes after it  was left at the station.</p>

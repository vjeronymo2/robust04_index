			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Books: Family feuds - Fiction OUR FATHER by Marilyn French Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 450 pages LOST CHILDREN by Maggie Gee Flamingo Pounds 14.99, 320 pages Relationships between fathers and daughters are at least as interesting, yet less frequently explored, than those between mothers and daughters. This is partly because of the long hegemony of Freudian theory, which restricted discussion to the girl's supposed penis envy and ignored the father's potential as a role model for daughters as well as sons. Now Marilyn French, author of the feminist novel of the late 1970s, The Women's Room, has plunged deep into the heart of this neglected territory with her new novel. Our Father brings together four very different women who gather round the deathbed of their dying parent, one of the richest and most powerful men in the US. The eldest daughter is unmarried, a fiftysomething economist and leading figure in the Reagan administration. The second is a professional wife, married three times but now husbandless and deeply in debt. The third is a housewife; the fourth the illegitimate offspring of the dying man's Mexican housekeeper. It should by now be apparent that French's novel is designer fiction, artlessly displaying a choice of female types with whom to identify. Each woman has a different mother and a different grievance, not enough attention from Daddy or too much of the wrong sort; inevitably, two of them were sexually abused by the patriarch and another turns out to be a lesbian. They sneer, feud and spring-clean the neglected mansion in which he spent his declining years, talking tough but entirely failing to conceal the novel's marshmallow sentimentality and moral slipperiness. Our Father cannot quite make its mind up where it stands on wealth and power, at one moment mocking the mores of the very rich and a moment later fawning on the very same people. It is the author who seems to be most in awe when someone takes a condolence call and announces improbably: 'Margaret Thatcher, deeply concerned'. The English novelist Maggie Gee has also put the family under the microscope in her novel, Lost Children. Everything falls apart for Gee's protagonist, Alma, when her teenage daughter runs away from home; Alma's reaction is to boot out her dreary husband Paul and take a job with an estate agent in the London suburb where she has lived all her life. She even toys, somewhat ineptly, with the idea of taking a lover. Like Marilyn French, Gee clearly wants her novel to be a warts-and-all dissection of the family. We hear about Alma's childhood, her inability to please her mother and her fear of her loud, exacting step-father. There is a hint of sexual abuse, which emerges when Alma and Paul attend a couples therapy session at Relate. The novel book is written in flat, dreary prose interspersed with quasi-philosophical ramblings which reveal that Gee, like French, has a heart of pure caramel: 'What if we are the kind of creature we dream of being, finding the grey defeated sister (so badly married, so beaten down) a child again, straight and slim, doing handstands in the dandelions down the green back garden?' Both novels have as their theme the idea that we are all, deep down, wounded children. 'We never stop being babies, do we?' demands a character in Our Father. Gee's authorial voice expresses much the same sentiment: 'Myself, yourself, my mother, my father. Still young, still potential. All the lost children'. Having waded through this double dose of treacle, what this grown-up reader wanted to shout was a loud 'count me out'.</p>

Letter from Michael Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated February 7, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to amend its rule establishing the maximum bid/ask differentials that may be created in making a market in options contracts. Rule 6.37(b)(1) currently provides, for example, that a Market Maker may bid and/or offer so as to create differences of no more than one-quarter of a point between the bid and the offer when the bid is less than $2. The current rule also provides, however, that the Exchange's Options Floor Trading Committee (``Committee'') <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  may establish maximum spreads other than those specified. Additionally, Rule 6.37(b)(1) also currently provides that in the event the bid/ask differential in the underlying security is greater than the bid/ask differential contained in the rule, the permissible price differential for any in-the-money option series may be identical to those in the underlying security market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee is comprised of the Exchange's 14 Floor Officials: (1) Seven Floor brokers, and (2) seven Market Makers or Lead Market Makers.

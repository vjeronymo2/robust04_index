Greeting the Russian minister, Li Peng stressed that the  visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Beijing at the end  of 1992 was an exceptionally successful one, that fruitful and  business-like conversations on all aspects of Chinese-Russian  relations took place. Ties between the PRC and Russia, Li Peng  noted, are developing successfully on the basis of friendship,  good-neighborliness and mutual advantage, in spite of the  changes in the world and in our countries.    Andrey Kozyrev, in his turn, said that the purpose of his  visit is not only to maintain the relations that currently exist  between the two countries, but also to further expand them, to  come out on a new, higher level of development in relations. In  this respect, he noted, we intend to discuss the forthcoming  visit to Moscow by PRC President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese  leaders.    The Russian minister conveyed very best wishes from the  Russian president and his words that Russia does not intend to  back down even a single step on reform, on foreign policy, a  priority trend in which is the development of goodneighborliness  and partnership with China.</p>

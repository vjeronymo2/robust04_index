			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (17): Threshold of new digital era - Mobile Telephony OVER the past decade, analogue cellular radio networks have ushered in the age of the mobile telephone, but now their digital counterparts promise a new range of sophisticated voice and data services. EMCI, the Washington-based market research organisation, has forecast that by 1996 there will be about 13m digital cellular subscribers worldwide, accounting for about a quarter of the total cellular market. The mobile telecommunications revolution began in the US in with radio technology providing the means to free the telephone from the tyranny of the telegraph pole and fixed-wire connection. In Europe, Britain led the way with telecommunications liberalisation measures which ushered in the first cellular radio services in 1985. Growth rates in the UK have slowed in recent years, however the number of subscribers to the two national networks, Cellnet and Vodafone, grew by about 13.5 per cent last year to around 1.4m - or almost a quarter of the 5.98m users in Europe. Although the vast majority of these subscribers are business users, both UK network operators have recently attempted to broaden the subscriber-base by launching low-user tariffs and services designed to make their existing analogue networks more appealing to a wider audience. These new analogue tariff structures have been introduced at the same time as a raft of new digital services is being rolled out across Europe. Some of these new services are likely to appeal to business customers willing to pay premium prices for flexible high quality voice and data communications, while others are designed to generate a real mass market for mobile communications. Most immediate interest is focused on the introduction of digital services based on the pan-European GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile) standard. Twenty-three operators in 16 European countries are committed to building GSM networks, and another 20 countries around the world have adopted GSM as the basis for the next generation of digital cellular services. The first GSM networks were launched last summer in Germany, France and Denmark, and similar services are now being rolled out across Europe. In Germany, which lagged behind in the introduction of cellular radio, the launch of competing GSM networks last year has al ready generated strong subscriber interest. Meanwhile in the UK Cellnet plans to launch a commercial GSM network next year while Vodafone launched a limited network in December and plans to have 90 per cent of its system in place by the middle of this year. These new premium-priced digital services will not replace the older analogue networks immediately. Indeed, it will be some time before many full national networks are in place and even then the existing network operators believe there will be a slow and gradual migration to digital services. However, for the business traveller in particular, they should offer some key advantages. Among these, digital services provide clearer more reliable connections which are also much more secure. By the mid 1990s, because it is a Europe-wide standard, international travellers will be able to use their GSM phones - and their GSM microchip-controlled 'smart' phone cards - anywhere in Europe. The GSM standard offers another important advantage over its analogue counterparts - it includes a mobile data facility, This will enable mobile terminals, like portable computers and fax machines, to communicate at speeds comparable to the best of today's fixed telephone data links. It is also compatible with the emerging integrated services digital network, or ISDN. GSM telephones equipped with small LCD screens will also be able to receive messages like pagers. Thus GSM may bring the long-awaited digital mobile office a step closer to reality. In the UK, Vodafone plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM called the Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, which will be a low-cost digital portable telephone service aimed at domestic customers. Local MCN call charges are expected to be significantly cheaper than GSM services putting the service in direct competition with fixed telephone networks. MCN is due to be launched in the south-east of England later this year in direct competition with another digital system aimed at the mass market called the personal communications network (PCN). When the UK government invited applications for PCN licenses in 1989, companies rushed to apply, buoyed by predictions of 10m customers by the end of the decade, and the belief subscribers would swap their ordinary phones for PCN's pocket-sized high frequency personal handsets. Since then, the recession and the need for the very heavy investment of around Pounds 1bn needed to build a PCN network has frightened away many of the prospective market players. Nevertheless, Mercury Personal Communications is pressing ahead with the launch of its PCN service later this year, while Microtel, a joint-venture involving Hutchison Telecom and British Aerospace, is believed to be looking for another partner to share the cost of its planned PCN service. Elsewhere in Europe, PCN networks are likely to be built in Germany and perhaps France. Some countries have also licensed call-only Telepoint services, such as Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK. This proliferation of analogue and digital networks, services and tariff packages will provide considerable customer choice, but may also lead to confusion. The disappointing uptake of other recently introduced radio based services, like public access mobile radio and mobile data services has already been blamed on customer confusion. Mobile data in particular has so far failed to live up to early expectations. Despite this, Mr Martin Bartholomew who is in charge of Mercury Communications Mobile Services (MCMS), an independent service provider, estimates that there are now between 60,000 and 70,000 mobile data subscribers in the UK and that this will rise to around 100,000 next year. 'It is part of the range of services that the larger service providers will offer as part of the mobile solution,' he says. The service providers do indeed have a key advisory role to play. Currently there are mobile data services offered by the cellular operators, dedicated mobile data networks, and data over private mobile radio networks - all using incompatible standards and equipment. Transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is considerably more difficult than over the public switched telephone network. One solution is to build the necessary specialist electronics into dedicated equipment or use a special cellular modem. Vodafone's mobile data service, which claims several thousand users and 90 per cent of the UK market, uses a special cellular data link control modem to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free data over the Vodafone cellular network which provides automatic standards conversion.</p>

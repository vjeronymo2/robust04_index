			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Leeds and N&amp;P propose biggest society merger: Opposition from some members likely as plan threatens 1,600 jobs THE LEEDS Permanent and the National &amp; Provincial building societies said yesterday they intended to merge to create the UK's third largest society. If approved by the societies' 3.3m members, it would be the biggest society merger. The merger would be the most significant since that of the Nationwide and Anglia in 1987, as societies try to increase in size to strengthen their sales of mortgages and other financial products such as life insurance. The plan, however, is likely to face opposition from some of the societies' voting members, after executives disclosed that it could cost 1,600 jobs. They also said it might not be accompanied by a bonus to savers paid out of reserves. The new society would be called Leeds Permanent. Leeds' current chairman, Mr Malcolm Barr, would be chairman of the merged society. Mr David O'Brien, who heads National &amp; Provincial, would be chief executive. The announcement followed an approach to the Leeds by National &amp; Provincial. Renewed discussions between the societies, which considered merging three years ago, were sparked by the departure from the Leeds earlier this year of Mr Mike Blackburn, the chief executive, to head Halifax, the country's largest society. The proposed merger, expected to take place next spring, is also subject to approval by the Building Societies Commission. But the plan is thought to have been raised already with commissioners, and securing approval is unlikely to be an obstacle. Moody's Investor Services, the debt rating agency, placed both societies under credit review yesterday. Leeds' long-term debt on wholesale markets is rated higher than N&amp;P's, at Aa3 against A1. The price of Dollars 6bn of debt securities issued by the societies could be affected. The Leeds is the UK's fifth largest building society, with total assets of Pounds 18.3bn while N&amp;P, the eighth largest, has assets of Pounds 12bn. The merged Leeds would be slightly smaller than Nationwide, second biggest with Pounds 34.1bn assets. Leeds currently employs 5,591 staff, while N&amp;P, which is based in Bradford, employs 4,231. Mr O'Brien said yesterday the maximum number of job losses would be 1,600. Part-time staff could be made redundant first. Both societies have strong branch networks in the north of England and would close those that overlap, although they may merge two branches into a larger new one. Mr O'Brien said the combined network of 769 branches would be cut to about 650. Mr Barr said the proposed merger was 'not a rescue, but a merger of substance'. Most recent society mergers have taken place when a smaller society has got into trouble from poor lending and been absorbed by a large society. Mr Richard Newton, currently chairman of N&amp;P, who is to retire, said that in an 'overcrowded' market the decision would bring benefits to the customers of both societies.

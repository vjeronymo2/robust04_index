			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts downgrade price forecasts as lead and zinc exports surge SHOCKED BY a dramatic surge in exports of lead and zinc from the former eastern bloc countries, some analysts have been revising downwards their price forecasts. Preliminary estimates yesterday from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group suggested that net imports of lead to the west from the eastern bloc last year nearly tripled, from 49,000 tonnes in 1991 to 120,000 tonnes. This pushed the lead market in the west into a supply surplus of about 85,000 tonnes compared with a 6,000-tonne deficit in 1991. On Wednesday the Study Group's statistics showed a similar situation in the zinc market - eastern bloc exports more than doubled last year, causing the supply surplus to rise from 86,000 to 238,000 tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said: 'This news is far worse than even pessimistic observers had forecast'. He said he was adjusting predictions he made at the end of last year and cutting the average lead price forecast for this year by 11 per cent to 24 US cents a lb. His forecast for 1994 is down 9 per cent to 30 cents. Mr Moore's zinc price forecasts for 1993 and 1994 are cut respectively by 10 per cent and 7 per cent to 54 cents and 65 cents a lb. The study group said preliminary estimates suggested that mine production of lead last year was down 1.8 per cent to 2.323m tonnes, and refined metal output also fell, 0.4 per cent, to 4.4m tonnes. Lead consumption slipped 0.8 per cent to 4.43m tonnes.</p>

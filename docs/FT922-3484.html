			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Simplicity becomes virtue at Worms - The French holding company's restructuring THE history of Worms et Cie, one of France's oldest holding companies, stretches back for more than a century. However, when Mr Nicholas Clive Worms, the present chairman, addresses his shareholders in Paris today, he will be talking about a completely new company. A year ago Mr Clive Worms outlined Worms' new structure to his shareholders. At today's meeting, he will be reporting on the company's progress in its first year under its new guise. Worms et Cie is one of the quintessentially French breed of holding companies, with an assortment of interests in different sectors often in the form of minority shareholdings that may carry controlling status. It began life as a trading company in 1848 and swiftly diversified into shipping. Worms et Cie retains the relics of the old shipping business, but it is also involved in insurance, luxury goods, property, banking, sugar and paper. It controls some companies, such as Athena, its insurance business, and the Financiere Truffaut luxury goods vehicle. But it does not control others, such as the Saint-Louis sugar and paper group. Until last year's restructuring, its interests were even more diverse and split between two companies, Pechelbronn and Simer. Such company structures are common in France, where the corporate sector is riddled with cross-shareholdings. Suez, the diversified industrial and financial group, is another example, as is Compagnie de Navigation Mixte. However, they tend to be incomprehensible to the international investors which are a prime source of capital for French companies. It was this concern that prompted Mr Clive Worms to restructure the group last year. He made his decision against the backdrop of a disagreement with Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of the large French insurers and a long-term investor which had wanted to increase its holding. AGF eventually agreed to sell part of its stake back to the company, thereby reducing its holding to 8.2 per cent. Mr Clive Worms wanted to bring in other minority investors, such as IFIL - the company controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, that two years ago bought a 7.4 per cent stake - to buy the old AGF shares. 'In France things tend to be very incestuous, with the same names cropping up again and again as investors,' he said. 'We thought it would be more exciting to go further afield. We needed a simpler structure to become more accessible to international investors and also because, after our expansion in the 1980s, we were a much bigger group.' Pechelbronn and Simer were merged into one company, Worms et Cie, and the group shed a string of its minority stakes. Truffaut, for instance, has rationalised its portfolio by selling its stakes in some companies, such as the Jean-Louis Scherrer fashion house, and reducing its holdings in others, notably Christian Dior. Other holdings, including Suez itself, are engaged in the same process. But they are doing so on a piecemeal basis, whereas Worms has acted quickly. Mr Clive Worms is convinced that he has achieved his goal of making Worms, which recently announced net profits of FFr1bn (Dollars 186.9m) for 1991, simpler and more efficient. Earlier this year he sold the rest of the AGF shares to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which now owns 5.5 per cent, and to Temasek of Singapore with 4.5 per cent. The jury is still out on whether Worms has succeeded in making itself more comprehensible internationally. One Paris analyst applauded it for the speed with which it had rationalised its interests. Another said that 'despite all the changes' it was 'still a mystery' outside France. So far, Worms' share price has sided with the sceptics. It closed yesterday at FFr341, well below FFr400 where it hovered immediately after its change of name.</p>

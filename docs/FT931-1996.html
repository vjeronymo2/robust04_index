			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Suter dips to Pounds 16.3m after European setback SUTER, the conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, yesterday blamed recession for lower sales and revealed a fall in profits for last year. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 16.3m in the 12 months to December 31. At the interim stage, profits were ahead 2 per cent at Pounds 9.4m. Mr Abell said trading conditions had been 'extremely difficult' and sales to continental Europe, especially France, declined rapidly towards the year end. The distribution division, which includes refrigeration and hair care sales, saw trading profits fall 30 per cent to Pounds 4.5m. Chemicals increased profits 19 per cent to Pounds 7.5m and benefited from improved productivity. In the industrial division, lower environmental sales were almost balanced by an improved performance from automotive components, partly due to work with the new Ford Mondeo. Mr Abell refused to comment on Suter's ambitions towards engineering company James Wilkes, in which Suter now holds 10.1 per cent. Neither would he talk about a possible libel claim against Channel 4. The action was delayed pending publication of the DTI investigation into share dealings by Mr Abell and Suter. The report found no evidence these and other parties acted in concert, but strongly criticised some of Mr Abell's actions. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 7.7m), incurred on writing down the value to zero of Hartons, a loss-making plastics distributor where Suter holds 22 per cent. Suter said adopting FRS 3 was inappropriate, but confirmed that earnings would have been lower because the extraordinary would be treated as an exceptional. Earnings fell to 9.6p (10.5p). A recommended maintained final dividend of 5.6p makes an unchanged total of 8.8p. A scrip issue of one warrant for every 10 ordinary shares held is also proposed. COMMENT It is almost a year since Mr Abell promised 'radical action', presumably through disposals, to improve Suter's share price. Yet nothing has been done. The shares are still languishing and yesterday fell 10p to 144p, mainly because of a downbeat trading statement. Shareholders have little else to celebrate either. Despite the criticisms of the DTI report, Mr Abell appears to have shunned all advice to split the roles of chairman and chief executive, and some of his unusual powers - for example being allowed to buy up to 15 per cent of a company without main board approval - remain in place. Full year profits are forecast at Pounds 19m, putting the shares on 12 times. While the only excitement on the horizon is the unexciting prospect of a bid for Wilkes, the shares remain unattractive.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICHOLLS HAS A FULL DAY AS KINGS WIN  </P> <P> Bernie Nicholls got four goals Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sort of.  </P> <P> He picked up one in the morning when he got up, one when he went down in the  evening and two more to help power the Kings past the Hartford Whalers, 5-2.  </P> <P> Confused? It gets worse.  </P> <P> Nicholls' goals were spread over two countries, four days and 12 hours. He got  two goals off his stick, one off his skates and one off a teammate, Wayne  Gretzky, who quietly tied yet another league record Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Totally lost now?  </P> <P> So apparently were the officials in Quebec.  </P> <P> That's where Nicholls' weird tale began last Sunday. The Kings beat the  Nordiques that day, with Nicholls slapping in a goal in the final second.  </P> <P> But after reviewing a tape of the game, Quebec officials decided that the puck  was deflected off the stick of Gretzky, who was standing by the net. So they  took the goal away from Nicholls.  </P> <P> But after a further review by NHL officials, Nicholls was given the goal back  Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> "It's always nice," he said, "to wake up in the morning and have a goal."  </P> <P> His second one, which came early Wednesday night at the Hartford Civic Center  Coliseum, he could have easily done without.  </P> <P> With the Kings ahead on Gretzky's first-period goal, his 14th, Whaler center  Ron Francis brought the puck up the right side in the second period on the  power play and fired it off goalie Kelly Hrudey. The puck rebounded and came to  rest just outside the goal line.  </P> <P> Nicholls, trying to get it out, stepped on it.  </P> <P> He went down as if he'd landed on a banana peel. And the puck went in.  </P> <P> Francis, really just an innocent bystander on the play, got credit for his 14th  goal at the 10:10 mark.  </P> <P> "I just stuck my skate out," Nicholls said. "I don't think it would have  counted if it had been at the other end."  </P> <P> But down at the other end, Nicholls got two that did count, his 23rd and 24th  of the season, temporarily moving him into the league lead.  </P> <P> Nicholls' first goal, a perfect slap shot from the left circle at 15:01 into  the upper left-hand corner of the net on the goalie's glove side, gave the  Kings a 2-1 second-period lead.  </P> <P> But the Whalers, winners of four of their last five games and six in a row over  the Kings in this building, came back to tie the game with 48 seconds to play  in the period.  </P> <P> Right winger Kevin Dineen, threading his way through King defenders, scored a  short-handed goal, delighting the crowd of 13,932.  </P> <P> Dineen raced down the ice on the right side, faked out Larry Robinson, cut  left, losing Nicholls, then got past defenseman Steve Duchesne near the goal  and flipped the puck in.  </P> <P> "Too bad," Dineen said later in the locker room, "that it went for naught." But  the goal didn't go unappreciated, even by the Kings.  </P> <P> "Wasn't that a beauty?" said King Coach Tom Webster. "I stood up and cheered  myself and I'm not supposed to do that."  </P> <P> The Kings came back on the ice and took just four shots on goal in the final  period, but connected on three of them to win comfortably, boosting their  record to 16-12-3.  </P> <P> Duchesne wristed in the first from the left post for his ninth goal at 3:20 on  a pass from Steve Kasper.  </P> <P> Nicholls got the second at 9:09 on a slap shot from the blue line.  </P> <P> And Luc Robitaille got the third at 15:32, to tie him with Nicholls at 24  goals, on an easy 10-footer at the left post after a perfect pass from Gretzky.  </P> <P> "You know if you get open, he's going to get you the puck," Robitaille said of  Gretzky. "He's the best in the world. He makes everybody's job easier."  </P> <P> Gretzky's assist gave him at least one in 17 consecutive games. That ties an  NHL record first set by Gretzky in the 1983-84 season and then equaled by his  then-teammate at Edmonton, Paul Coffey, two seasons later.  </P> <P> "If I get another one next game, great," Gretzky said. "If not, I'm tied with a  good friend of mine. I'm not going to loose any sleep over it."  </P> <P> Understandable. The greatest scorer in NHL history, he's already done  everything in hockey.  </P> <P> Well, not everything.  </P> <P> He's never had a day quite like Bernie Nicholls had Wednesday.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> Two King right wingers left the game in the second period with injures. Mikko  Makela, upended by Hartford's Adam Burt, suffered a bruised shoulder. The  Kings' Dave Taylor was sidelined with a pulled groin muscle. . . . Kelly  Hrudey, the Kings' goalie, faced 27 shots, stopping 25. The Kings took only 25  shots against Whaler goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz . . . The NHL career of center  Todd Elik lasted just one line shift. At least for now. Brought up from the  Kings' American Hockey League farm club in New Haven Monday to replace the  ailing Bernie Nicholls, the 23-year-old Elik made a brief appearance against  the Montreal Canadiens. But Elik was sent back Wednesday after it was  determined Nicholls would not miss any ice time . . . Nicholls has a bruised  ankle, bruised knee and pain in the lower back. But Wayne Gretzky, his closest  friend on the team, taped an aspirin to Nicholls' knee in practice and declared  him fit.  </P></p>

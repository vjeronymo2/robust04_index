			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Weak import growth sets a sales conundrum The annual shopping binge before Christmas has traditionally been good news for importers and bad news for the UK trade deficit. But heavy-duty shopping so far this year appears to have inflicted little damage on the trade gap. While consumer spending has risen steadily and retail sales have perked up, import growth has been virtually flat. The most recent complete trade figures - which admittedly warn of future revisions - show import volumes up only 0.5 per cent in the three months to September, compared with a year previously, and flat compared with the previous three months. Over the same period consumer spending rose 2.6 per cent, while retail sales in September, compared with a year ago, were up 3.8 per cent. This trend seems peculiar. Even during the worst years of the recession imports held their own, or grew, as a share of consumption. Now, with other European countries in the economic doldrums, the growing UK economy is a prime target for hard-pressed foreign manufacturers. So where are the goods in the shops coming from? The most optimistic reading of the figures is that retailers are substituting domestic goods for those from overseas. Mr James Barty, economist at Morgan Grenfell, said: 'I suspect that, even though the trade figures are dodgy, UK companies have actually taken a bigger share of the domestic market because they are more competitive.' Other economists are less generous about the UK's lust for foreign goods. Mr Doug McWilliams, head of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: 'I think some of the information we got last year was misleading. Imports probably have gone up, but it is the base that is wrong rather than the current level.' In spite of lack of faith in the trade figures - collected by a new system since the beginning of the year - evidence from the Confederation of British Industry points to some import substitution. In its November distributive trades survey, the CBI said the percentage of deliveries to retailers accounted for by imports had barely risen in the past year, suggesting that import penetration in the high streets was being held at bay. But is the trend as suspect as some economists believe? Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon Brothers, pointed out that although import growth had lagged consumer spending this year, it had increased slightly faster than total domestic demand, which included stocks and private investment spending. Balance of payments figures show imports 1.8 per cent higher in the third quarter than the same quarter a year ago. That compares with a 2.6 per cent rise for consumer spending, but a 1.4 per cent rise in total domestic demand. This, Mr Saunders said,was to be expected. 'Consumer spending should be quite strong coming out of recession, but you would expect private investment to lag. I think the balance will soon shift quite substantially.'</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Designers adopt a model approach Designers may love the flashy graphics and revolving images on their computers, but they still need models to display what their ideas will look like, writes Andrew Fisher. Vu Thru, of London, has come up with a novel way of showing designs in three-dimensional form. This is achieved by stacking printed information on optically clear film between Perspex layers. The film sheets are taken as slices of a computer-generated graphic and printed with a thermal plotter. The contoured slices, 20 or more, are bolted together to produce the image.

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A DECADE REVISITED;  </P> <P> ATHLETES WHO BEGAN THEIR CAREERS IN THE VALLEY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS HAVE GONE  ON TO WIN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS, CY YOUNG AWARDS AND WORLD BOXING TITLES. TEAM  ACHIEVEMENTS INCLUDED IMPROBABLE CHAMPIONS AND RECORD WINNING STREAKS. BUT  FIGHTS, STRIKES AND FIRINGS ALSO MADE THE NEWS  </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> Middleweight Michael Nunn and the Monroe High baseball team rose from obscurity  to become champions and CS Northridge also took a huge step.  </P> <P> As North Hollywood boxer Michael Nunn fought his way through the middleweight  ranks toward a title shot, criticism of his light-hitting style accompanied his  ascent. Nunn kept his record perfect but his failure to deliver a knockout  punch frustrated his supporters and provided ammunition for his critics.  </P> <P> But the 6-foot-2 southpaw silenced many of his critics with a big year in 1988.  He scored five victories during the year, including four by knockout. After  three defenses of his North American Boxing Federation title, he earned an  International Boxing Federation title fight against unbeaten Frank Tate. He  started the year fighting at the tiny Country Club in Reseda but by year's end  was a Las Vegas regular at Caesars Palace.  </P> <P> It was in Las Vegas that Nunn put himself in the national limelight with a  ninth-round knockout of Tate. The victory earned him $125,000 and increased his  record to 31-0 with 21 knockouts. In November, Nunn defended his world title  with his fourth knockout of the year when he floored Juan Domingo Roldan in the  eighth round of their bout in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Monroe High squeaked into the City Section 4-A baseball playoffs as the  fourth-place team from the Mid-Valley League with a 5-10 league mark (9-16  overall). In fact, the Vikings had to defeat Birmingham in a tiebreaker to  advance to the playoffs.  </P> <P> The Vikings seemed primed to serve as fodder for such traditional powers as  Chatsworth, which entered the tournament as the No. 1 team in the nation. But  Chatsworth lost in the semifinals and when the City championship was presented  at Dodger Stadium in June, the unlikely new champion was Monroe.  </P> <P> The Vikings registered three consecutive upsets -- two in extra innings -- and  then defeated San Fernando in the final, 3-2. In five postseason games, junior  Tim Costic was 12 for 20 with 11 runs batted in and five extra-base hits. Three  times he drove home the winning run in Monroe's last at-bat. As a pitcher, he  also won two games and saved another.  </P> <P> Despite formidable questions over funding, Cal State Northridge announced its  intention to petition the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. for a move up to  Division I in all sports except football for the 1990-91 school year.  </P> <P> Through the 1988 school year, the Matadors had won 33 national championships in  12 sports over three decades at the Division II level. The school cited  overwhelming community support as a primary factor in the decision, but that  support apparently came with few dollar signs in tow.  </P> <P> Plans outlined by President James W. Cleary called for the construction of an  8,000- to 10,000-seat arena, and plans for a 20,000-seat multipurpose stadium  had been approved. In order to field competitive teams, the annual price tag  for the move will be $1.3 million, according to school sources. Previously, the  most money CSUN had raised in a year was $150,000.  </P> <P> Notable: In a 41-21 loss to Servite in which he rushed for 162 yards, Crespi  High's Russell White ended his three-year varsity career as the state's  all-time leading rusher with 5,998 yards. He also scored three touchdowns to  push his state records to 94 touchdowns and 568 points scored. . . .  </P> <P> In the same week, two of the area's top high school athletes committed to  Pacific 10 Conference schools. Taft High's Quincy Watts, who won three  individual state track titles, committed to USC four days before Don MacLean,  who led Simi Valley to the Southern Section 4-A Division basketball  championship, committed to UCLA. . . .  </P> <P> Mitchell Butler, who has joined MacLean at UCLA, led tiny Oakwood School to its  first Southern Section title in any sport when the Gorillas defeated Hesperia  Christian, 61-60, in the Small Schools final. In the quarterfinals, he scored  50 points in a 55-47 win over Ribet Christian. . . .  </P> <P> Scott Sharts ended his three-year baseball career at Simi Valley as the  Southern Section's all-time home run leader with 32. . . .  </P> <P> Royal won the Southern Section 4-A boys' soccer title and Agoura won its third  consecutive Southern Section girls' soccer title with a 5-0 victory over Temple  City. . . .  </P> <P> Junior Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High won the 100 and 200 in the state track  and field championships to lead the Spartans to a share of the girls' team  title with Bakersfield. Burnham ran a national age-16 record of 11.28 in the  100 in the Olympic Trials later in the summer. . . .  </P> <P> In front of the largest crowd to see a CSUN soccer match, the Matadors fell to  Florida Institute of Technology, 3-2, in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  Division II final. As runner-up, the Matadors matched their 1987 performance in  what was supposed to be a rebuilding year for Coach Marwan Ass'ad's program. .  . .  </P> <P> CSUN volleyball Coach Walt Ker won his 300th career match to reach the NCAA  Division II tournament. The Matadors reached the final but lost to Portland  State in three games. . . .  </P> <P> Pierce won its second men's volleyball state title in three seasons with a  four-game victory over Long Beach City College.

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Medellin drug chief may surrender to authorities The flight of Pablo Escobar's family from Colombia has fuelled speculation that the Medelln drug chief is about to surrender again to the authorities. Escobar has been on the run since he escaped from jail 16 months ago. He has told reporters he wants to surrender but insists his family's safety must be guaranteed first. Last week the prosecutor general said official protection for Escobar's wife and children would be withdrawn. Recently an anti-tank rocket was fired at the family flat and there have been numerous attacks on Escobar's property and associates. Four family members - his wife and two children and a woman believed to be engaged to his son - flew to Germany yesterday, but were refused permission to stay. They were being held at Frankfurt airport until a flight was available. German police said they could go to any country which would take them. Some of them had valid visas to other countries, but it appeared they would be sent back to Colombia if none offered asylum. A recent attempt by other relations to find asylum in Chile also failed. Local television and radio in Bogota had said the family's departure to a refuge abroad was part of an arrangement with the government that included Escobar's surrender. With the discovery of dozens of his hideouts and the loss of so many of his henchmen following an extensive police hunt, it has become increasingly difficult for Escobar to stay ahead of the authorities. Although the Medelln cartel no longer has the structure to deal and transport huge volumes of cocaine, Pablo Escobar is still a powerful figure whose recapture, surrender or death would haved enormous symbolic importance for the government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan's overall wholesale  price index [WPI] in the first 10 days of February declined 0.2  percent from January 21-31, the Bank of Japan said Tuesday [22  February].    The February 1-10 WPI stood at 93.8 against 100 in the base  year 1990. It was down 2.9 percent from a year earlier.    The domestic WPI, on which the central bank keeps a close  eye, was unchanged from late January but fell 1.9 percent from a  year earlier. The index was 97.5.    The central bank said prices of steel and electric  appliances  dropped due to sluggish demand, while those of pork and eggs  rose because of a supply shortage and textile goods prices  increased due to higher costs of imported materials.    The export price index gained 0.1 percent from late January  and 4.7 percent year on year on a contract currency basis to  stand at 104.7. Officials said higher prices of electric  equipment pushed up the figure.    In terms of yen, the index dropped 1.2 percent from the  preceding 11 days and 3.8 year on year to stand at 84.2,  affected by the appreciation of the yen against major currencies.    The import price index on a contract currency basis gained  0.2 percent from late January but slipped 3.0 percent from a  year before to 93.2. Prices of food and miscellaneous products  went down, while those of primary aluminum and cotton were  higher.    In yen terms, the index fell 0.8 percent from late January  and 11.5 percent from a year before to 73.2.</p>

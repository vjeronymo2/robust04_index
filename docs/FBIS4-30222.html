			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, June 24 KYODO -- Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co. will set up two joint sales firms next month, one  each in China and Hong Kong, along with a Hong Kong enterprise,  the company said Friday [24 June].    The Chinese firm, to be based in Shenzhen, will be  Matsushita  Electric's first sales unit in China and will be named Panasonic  SH Industrial Sales (Shenzhen) Co.    The firm to be set up in Hong Kong will be named Panasonic  Shun Hing Industrial Sales (Hong Kong) Co.    The Hong Kong partner, Shun Hing Electric Works and  Engineering Co., is the electronic components and factory  automation-related equipment sales arm of the Shun Hing Group,  which, in turn, is the Hong Kong and Macao general agent for the  Matsushita Electric Group.    Both sales firms will be capitalized at 7.5 million Hong  Kong  dollars, of which 66.7 percent will be provided by Matsushita  and the balance by Shun Hing.    The two new companies will sell and service Matsushita  electronic components and factory automation-related equipment  in Hong Kong, Macao and China's Guangdong Province, starting  late next month.    Matsushita expects that the two firms will chalk up 10  billion yen in sales within a few years.    The Hong Kong firm will have a workforce of about 70, and  the  Shenzhen firm about 20.</p>

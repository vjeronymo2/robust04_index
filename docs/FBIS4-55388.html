			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- The ten accused Albanians on  the charges of "conspiracy in subversive activity" in the  Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] will continue to stay in detention, because their  trial planned for May 9 was postponed, reports Albanian TV,  according to the information from Skopje. The reason for the  postponement of the trial for the second time is the  continuation of attorneys' strike. The trial will start on May  23. In the Albanian opinion prevails the idea that this is a  fabricated case were facts are missing to verify their charges.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Minorco profits rise meets expectations MINORCO, the offshore investment arm of Anglo American, South Africa's largest industrial company, increased pre-tax profits by 1.5 per cent in the year to June 30 to Dollars 257.1m, in line with market expectations. Operating profits at the Luxembourg-quoted group, which on Tuesday announced a Dollars 1.43bn asset swap with Anglo, its largest shareholder, fell from Dollars 63.8m to Dollars 55.8m on sales up 4 per cent at Dollars 1.73bn. The fall was offset by an increase in treasury operations and the share of earnings from investments. Earnings per share rose from Dollars 1.22 to Dollars 1.25, before extraordinary items of Dollars 68.2m, principally from the sale by Charter Consolidated of its 38 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the UK metals group. At the time of the sale Minorco had a 36 per cent stake in Charter Consolidated. The group will be paying a 57 cents dividend, a rise of 6 per cent. The increase in sales was mainly due to the acquisition of ICI's Canadian fertiliser business by Terra, the agribusiness subsidiary, but sales in gold and base metals were hit by lower commodity prices. Minorco ended the period with net cash of Dollars 1.1bn and shareholders' funds of Dollars 2.83m. The asset swap effectively gives Minorco control of all Anglo's non-diamond investments outside Africa.</p>

This Was Theme of Routine Session of CIS  Defense Ministers Council"]    [Text] As we have already reported, the session was held  24-25 February. Delegations from the military departments of 11  countries, the general secretary of the Collective Security  Council of the CIS member states, and representatives of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the legislature,  and the Border Troops Command participated in it. A number of  organizational questions concerning the structure of the Defense  Ministers Council, the manning of the Staff for the Coordination  of Military Cooperation, and the preparations to celebrate the  50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War were  examined, as well as problems of the use of the collective  peacemaking forces and of military-technical cooperation.    It was pointed out at the session that the countries which  signed the Collective Security Treaty have at last gotten a real  opportunity to commence its practical implementation. As is  known, since Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Georgia subscribed to the  treaty, the composition of the Defense Ministers Council  virtually corresponds to the composition of the Collective  Security Council, which includes, in addition to the heads of  the states which signed the treaty and the foreign ministers,  the leaders of these states' military departments.    The two-day gathering of the military departments' leaders,  held under the chairmanship of Colonel General Boris Gromov,  Russian deputy minister of defense, ended with the signing of a  number of documents. They include the Statute on the Defense  Ministers Council of the CIS Member States, which defines its  functions, structure, and composition and the organization of  its activity under the new conditions. A decision was adopted  on the composition of the Military Cooperation Coordination  Staff and on the principles of its manning. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  reported (the issue for 23 February), the staff will be manned  on a coalition basis, and it will have a top limit of 250  members. At the same time the Russian contingent will be the  largest -- 120 people. The session participants' balanced  approach to problems of collective security enabled them to  reach agreement on additional measures to stabilize the  situation on the Tajik-Afghan section of the border. A decision  was also adopted on measures to prepare to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.</p>

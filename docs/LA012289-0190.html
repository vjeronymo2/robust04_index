			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPERFECTIONS  </P> <P> OK, there were a few gaffes in our Sneaks '89. It is Edward S. Feldman -- not  Ed Pressman -- who is producing "Wired" with Charles Meeker. The Francis Ford  Coppola-directed segment of "New York Stories" stars newcomer Heather McComb,  not Coppola's daughter, Sofia. Sofia co-wrote the script with her father and  also designed the costumes and titles. Merrin Holt and Ken Krauss are the  writers of the comedy "Buy and Cell," not director Robert Boris. And the  vampire picture "To Die For" -- which we labeled "distributor pending" -- will  be distributed by Skouras Pictures in March.  </P></p>

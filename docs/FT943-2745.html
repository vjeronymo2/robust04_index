			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Market placing puts Ryland at Pounds 22.72m Shares in Ryland Group, the family-owned vehicle distributor coming to the market through a placing, were priced at 80p yesterday, valuing the company as Pounds 22.72m. Following the placing of 10.94m shares, which will raise a net Pounds 7.48m, there will be 28.4m shares in issue. The Midlands-based group has 30 franchised operations based primarily in the West Midlands, the North West and northern Ireland. It has distribution agreements with BMW, Mercedes, Nissan, Vauxhall, Toyota, Honda and Renault. Mr Peter Whale, chairman and chief executive, said he believed the underlying demand for new and used cars was improving and that strong regional trends were emerging. Ryland would be looking for acquisitions to increase its franchise spread but remain geographically focused. 'If we remain geographically tight we can achieve some synergies,' he said. After the placing the directors and their families will hold 39.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Ryland was established in 1951 by Mr Whale's grandfather, Mr Harry Whale, who started the business by selling trucks in Birmingham. Ryland reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 773,000) in the year to April 30 on turnover ahead at Pounds 189.6m (Pounds 156.6m). Unit sales for the year stood at 7.6m against 3.73m. The shares are expected to begin trading next Thursday. The placing has been sponsored by Albert E. Sharp &amp; Co.</p>

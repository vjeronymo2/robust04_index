			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Management: Keeping ahead of trends More than 3,000 managers participate in short management programmes at Insead each year. So a big challenge for the school is to respond to changes in the executive education market. Arnoud De Meyer, associate dean responsible for executive education, identifies the following trends: An enormous demand for internationalisation, or developing managers with an international view. 'This doesn't just mean going on an international assignment, but being aware that the world abroad is not the same as the one you have at home.' A shift of interest away from 'grooming the directors of the future, improving individuals', towards programmes which 'transform the whole organisation'. It is this trend which explains the popularity of tailor-made or 'company specific' programmes at the expense of 'open programmes' (ie open to all-comers). De Meyer believes this is not necessarily a permanent change. The growing sophistication - and seniority - of people in charge of human resources in companies. One result is that companies 'are more demanding'. The need for action-orientedness. 'Looking at the old brochures, executive education used to be more about broadening the perspective. Participants want that today too, but they also want teaching which is relevant to what they will be doing next week.' The impact of delayering, or the thinning out of management tiers. 'Business schools have been preaching this, but in a way we are victims of our own success.' As well as fewer managers to train, schools have to find ways of helping managers who move horizontally across organisations. Partnerships. Insead has run a course for Hewlett-Packard and its dealers, and is exploring the idea of organising programmes for companies and their suppliers (the idea being that there could be more impact if individuals across the 'value chain' are involved).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- The Cuban Workers Federation  (CTC) expressed here today its solid support for the adjustment  measures to cleanse the country's public finances, adding that  its members have a starring role in the adoption of these  measures.    TRABAJADORES newspaper, mouthpiece of the CTC, underscored  that the recent decision by the National Assembly of the  People's Government (Parliament) reflects policies designed to  cleanse public finances, to eliminate excess money in  circulation, and to restore economic development.    The CTC added that the drafting of policies to end the  crisis  was achieved through the active participation of the workers in  a process of large meetings in which [words indistinct]  participated.    TRABAJADORES added: This is how the most difficult part of  the process began; it is a process that will require the  people's support and understanding, timely information, a great  amount of discipline, and rigorous control to implement the  policies.    The newspaper warned it is a long and complex process in  which other economic, organizational, labor, and wage measures  must be included.    The measures will be adopted amid an iron-clad U.S. economic  blockade, which has cost the country more than $41 million and  whose effects, according to several estimates, in 1993 alone,  prevented the country from obtaining 40 percent of the foreign  exchange that could have been attained with the same level of  production and investments, the newspaper noted.    The CTC mounthpiece maintained that another adverse factor  is  that workers are in dire straits because of the abrupt loss of  markets and the prices that Cuba was paid for sugar, nickel,  citric fruits, and other products in the now defunct Soviet  Union and other socialist European countries.    TRABAJADORES explained that the country has to resolve its  excess cash circulation problems with hardly 23 percent of the  resources it had four years ago for development. This also has  to be done without external financial resources, as well as  within the principles of solidarity and social justice.    TRABAJADORES concluded by saying that the Assemblies for  Economic Efficiency, which are to begin on 16 May, will carry on  the work begun in the parliaments in the workplace. They will  prove to be a worthy tool for reducing subsidies and costs,  applying strict control measures for material resources, and  systematically contributing to the economy.</p>

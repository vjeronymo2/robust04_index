			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Imro fines company for rule breaches Lancaster Hilton Investments has been fined Pounds 25,000 by Imro, the self-regulating organisation for the investment management industry, for breaches of rules related to safe-keeping of customers' money. While the amount falls far short of the high fines levied by Imro on Noble Lowndes and Invesco MIM, the regulator said yesterday that it should be regarded as 'substantial'. LHI must also pay Imro's costs of Pounds 65,000. The charges cover activities from late 1991 to 1992, and include failure to keep proper records of clients' money and to hold proper information about transactions carried out for customers. Imro said that it was satisfied that no client had suffered a substantial loss as a result of the rule breaches - which affected slightly more than a quarter of LHI's 100 or so investment portfolios - and that LHI had provided compensation where any minor loss had occurred. LHI's shareholders have put the company into voluntary liquidation, and its membership of Imro will soon end. Imro has supervised the return of customer funds.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Options market reassured on merger MR Geoffrey Chamberlain, chairman of the London Traded Options Market, yesterday reassured traders on the LTOM trading floor that the planned merger with the London International Financial Futures Exchange is to go ahead. This is in spite of the recent difficulties in finding sufficient firms to make markets in individual stock options. The merger, originally set for later this month, was postponed because of a lack of market makers and technical problems. Mr Chamberlain said that the revised date for the legal merger is March 20, and he confirmed that the provisional issue of 'D' shares (which will entitle holders to trade stock options on the new exchange) will go ahead on Tuesday. Yesterday was the deadline for firms to confirm to Liffe which stock options they plan to make markets in. Liffe declined to comment on the response. The large integrated houses, such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Smith New Court, have proved unwilling to act as marketmakers, as expected, but will act as principal traders. However, there has been some increase in the number of LTOM firms willing to commit to marketmaking. In addition to the four firms that have consistently underlined their commitment - City of London Options, O'Connor Securities (owned by Swiss Bank Corporation), James Capel, and Hills Independent Traders, two more firms came forward yesterday. Kleinwort Benson has agreed to continue to make markets in about 12 stock options, while an independent trading firm, JG Bolitho, is also believed to have committed itself to some stock option trading. In addition, some Liffe members may commit themselves to equity option marketmaking after the merger.</p>

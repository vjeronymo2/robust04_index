			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Greens show black flag at Monza grand prix: Cancellation of Italian motor race to spare trees has upset the locals Frantic shuttle diplomacy, riot warnings, conspiracy theories, resignation threats and emergency legislation: a normal holiday weekend in Italy. The subject of all this frenzied activity was not last week's turmoil on the bond, currency and stock markets, but Friday's decision by Fia, the world motor sport authority, to cancel the 65th Italian Grand Prix. The decision was supposed to end uncertainty caused by a row between tree-hugging environmentalists and road-hogging Formula One drivers over modifications to the venerable Monza circuit, set in an ancient royal park near Milan. Instead it has set off a new wave of controversy. Environmental groups are protesting against proposals to fell more than 100 trees and extend the gravel-filled safety lane at a fast right-hand bend of the track for the September 11 race. Drivers called for the improvement after the accident which killed Ayrton Senna at the San Marino grand prix earlier this year. Over several weeks, local and national authorities dithered about whether trees or turbos should have precedence, until Friday when Fia decided it had had enough. Environmentalists - standing guard over the trees lest fanatical motor sport 'tifosi' decided to take an axe to them - seemed strangely subdued by the decision. 'From the beginning we have always said that we are not against this year's grand prix,' said Mr Matteo Barrattieri of the Worldwide Fund for Nature on Friday, speaking from the other side of the fence erected by the Monza authorities to mark out the felling area. 'We're against the fact that instead of reducing the speed of the cars they want to damage the park.' While the greens are reluctant to declare victory, advocates of the grand prix are certainly not going to concede defeat. Mr Aldo Moltifiori, mayor of Monza, has resigned in protest, alleging, among other things, a conspiracy between Ferrari and Fiat (which controls the sports car maker) to take the grand prix to the company-owned track at Mugello in Tuscany. Other regional politicians, all members of the populist Northern League, have also threatened to step down. On Saturday, a delegation headed by Mr Gianni Letta, chief of staff to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, flew to Cannes to try to persuade Fia to change its mind. Meanwhile, Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, emerged from his all-night summit with Mr Berlusconi promising that an emergency decree would save the grand prix. According to Mr Moltifiori, direct and indirect earnings from the grand prix amount to L70bn (Pounds 29m) a year, with 100 jobs depending directly on the race, and a further 1,400 temporary employees helping on race day itself. He blames Mr Letta for ending Monza's hopes by asking Fia to agree to the installation of a new chicane before the bend, an alternative which the sport's authorities had already rejected. 'A government which can't manage to stage a grand prix ought to give up and go home,' Mr Moltifiori said on Friday. Fia has so far stood by its decision. One of Mr Moltifiori's last acts as mayor was to warn the local prefect of police that he could no longer be responsible for the actions of an angry populace. This holiday weekend, however, Monza was completely closed and almost deserted. A policeman on a bicycle, who was stopping cars from entering the historic centre on Friday, said he was disappointed: 'After all, Monza is known worldwide for its grand prix, not for its trees.' Only the gatekeeper at the Monza circuit expressed anything like an inflammatory reaction to the decision. 'There's only one thing for it now,' he said with a shrug. 'Revolution.'</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> PAPIER-MACHE  </P> <P> DON'T LET THE French name fool you; papier-mache was invented in the Orient,  probably by the Chinese; Persians and Japanese later used it for masks and  other ceremonial objects. But in Europe during the 17th Century, papier-mache  became not only a household word, but also household objects -- even furniture.  The craft became a large industry in England, but in America it survived in the  home, practiced by women who made boxes, lamps and other useful pieces.  </P> <P> Papier-mache shapes are made by mixing paper pulp (usually made from newsprint  and water) with glue or paste into a workable consistency; the goo is then  arranged into a three-dimensional shape, applied to a surface, placed over a  skeletal framework (called an armature) or shaped in a mold before final  painting or decorating. The finished piece is sealed with varnish or wax -- not  just to make it spiffy but also to keep water and humidity from turning it back  into pulp.  </P> <P> The technique is simple enough for children, but it is also flexible enough for  artists, many of whom continue to explore this craft in folk and fine art. In  Mexico, papier-mache is a respected medium for everything from museum-caliber  sculpture to pinatas.  </P> <P>  Most art schools do not offer classes in papier-mache, but a few colleges and  university extensions do: Santa Monica College Community Services recently  offered a class in papier-mache mask making and promises to have more in the  spring quarter. In lieu of classes, check the library and local bookstores for  how-to books.  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Timing of peace statement in balance: Obstacles remain as Major and Reynolds seek springboard for lasting Ulster settlement The British and Irish governments yesterday held on to the prospect of a joint declaration designed to secure a pre-Christmas end to 25 years of IRA violence in Northern Ireland. But after a fresh round of talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the two leaders were forced to acknowledge there were several remaining obstacles to an agreement which would usher in a new era in Anglo-Irish relations. Despite these difficulties, the two leaders hope to meet again in London before Christmas to pursue an agreement. During talks at the European Union meeting in Brussels, the British and Irish prime ministers agreed the statement should act as a springboard for an intensive round of negotiations on a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland. More immediately they hope it will coax the IRA, through its political wing Sinn Fein, into extending its traditional Christmas ceasefire into a permanent cessation of violence. Officials on both sides, however, admitted the two governments had yet to find the precise language for the most sensitive passages in the document. They also remained uncertain that the first attempt since the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement to balance the competing claims of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism could restore peace. After an hour-long meeting the two leaders issued a brief joint statement saying they had made further progress towards agreement on the text of the declaration. They would meet again before Christmas to bring the process to a conclusion. With Mr Major anxious to secure an accord before parliament breaks on Friday for the Christmas recess, one high-ranking British official commented: 'I very much hope we get there. I cannot guarantee that we will get there.' He then added: 'There is still some way to go.' The two governments will attempt to iron out the remaining differences during intensive contacts over the next few days, opening the possibility of a final summit meeting in London on Tuesday or Wednesday. Anxious to reassure the Ulster Unionists, British officials said the declaration would underwrite its guarantee to the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland that there could be no change in the status of the province without their consent. Mr Major had also won assurances from Mr Reynolds of the Irish government's commitment to drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of a comprehensive political settlement. The joint declaration will repeat the offer to Sinn Fein of a place at the negotiating table in response to a total cessation of terrorist activities. There were signs, however, of continuing disagreement over Dublin's demand for an all-Ireland convention open to all constitutional parties from the North and South.</p>

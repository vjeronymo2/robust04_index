			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lj.S.: "Needles Drill Phantoms"] </F>   [Text] The latest series of NATO air strikes (by F-16 and  F-18 aircraft) against Serbian positions around Gorazde was  probably yet another practical test of the potential of the  newest generation of U.S. Air Force equipment.    According to available data, U.S. fighter bombers carried  out  selective strikes against Serbian positions using modern laser  guided bombs. Their activity, accompanied by casualties, was  this time carried out under almost test conditions, like on a  test range since the army of the Srpska republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina air defense did not respond. It did not try  to prevent the two NATO air strikes.  <H5>  Two Sorts of Markers </H5>   As long as the military strategists of the Srpska republic  of  Bosnia-Herzegovina do not assess that an open conflict with the  UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and NATO is inevitable, no other  Serbian reaction can be expected. If it comes to an open  conflict, the destruction would be far more extensive, but NATO  and UNPROFOR would have to count on casualties and technical  damage, too.    One of the air strikes, in which the laser marking of  targets  was used, can be seen on the diagram. Before an aircraft with  laser- guided bombs reaches the target area, it is necessary to  mark the target (an armored vehicle) with a laser from another  aircraft flying at a very high altitude. Another possibility is  to mark the target using a ground marker, provided, however,  that there is good visibility. In this case this could have  been done by UNPROFOR military observers if they had the  equipment necessary for laser marking. After the target has  been marked, either from the air or from the ground, it can  easily be hit by a laser bomb or missile.    As far as the present generation of markers is concerned,  there are certain reservations in the world about their  operational efficiency. Aircraft which carry target markers  have to fly at dangerously high altitudes until the strike  aircraft have dropped the bombs and left the target area. On  the other hand, a marker on the ground can be very easily  detected.    In case of Gorazde, the action by the F-16 and F-18 aircraft  was not at all interrupted. If conflicts between the  peacekeeping forces and Serbian soldiers continue, it will be  necessary to activate the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  air defense. Western intelligence circles certainly know what  equipment the Serbian air defense has, just as they know that  this system has not been employed so far to attack NATO aviation.    It can be claimed without exaggerated self-confidence that  the aircraft that marked the Serbian targets on the ground with  lasers (if this option was used) could have been destroyed by  the ground- to-ground missile systems "Volhol," "Neva," or  "Drina." It is known that aircraft flying at high altitudes can  very easily be shot down. The aircraft that carried out the  strike could probably have been hit, too. The United States  knows that the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  possesses portable antiaircraft missiles (Stinger, Arrow, and  Needle), which have proved to be very successful in shooting  down low-flying targets.  <H5>  Once Activated -- No Return </H5>   Soldiers fire these missiles, which have a range of  approximately 3,000 meters, from the shoulder. They have an  automatic infra-red guidance system, which enables them to hit  their target with a 90-percent certainty. It must also be  considered that it is never the case that only one missile is  used. "The Needle" is the modified version of the Russian  "Arrow" rocket with built-in sensors for avoiding the infra-red  flares that the aircraft releases behind itself in order to  "deceive" the missile.    The Serbian army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has large quantities  of portable antiaircraft missiles, and according to some  information the missile system of the air defense troops has  been enhanced lately. The United States knows where the active  missile and radar centers in the Srpska republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina are situated. They also know that there are  "passive" systems at unknown locations that can be discovered  only when they are activated. Therefore it would be good if  they were never activated because in such a case there would be  no return.</p>

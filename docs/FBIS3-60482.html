They  are young sailors from a fishing vessel that returned to the  Illichivsk port from overseas. The disease was detected  accidentally: One of the sailors had been hospitalized  following an entirely different diagnosis. He was examined for  AIDS and tested HIV-positive. As a result, the entire crew of  the vessel was examined and another two carriers of the virus  were revealed. Medics are now conducting difficult searches for  those who had contacts with the HIV carriers.</p>

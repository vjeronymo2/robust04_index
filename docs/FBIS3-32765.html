			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Ghost of a Military Coup in </F> Guatemala"]    [Text] It was Sunday 30 January, day of the popular  referendum. For those who opposed the referendum, the decisive  vote was in the hands of the more than 900,000 members of the  Civilian Self-Defense Patrols (PAC). Obviously, however, to the  joy of some and disbelief of others who were close to the  government and who expected these men to cast yes votes, PAC  members did not vote.    The story on why PAC members did not exercise their right to  vote began many days earlier. Ranking Army commanders discussed  the topic at a very secret meeting. The room was heavy with  tension and uneasiness. Voices sometimes rose, and at other  times they dropped to a murmur. It was evident that many of  them were uneasy, angered more by the issue of peace with the  guerrillas than by the referendum over the legislative reforms.    A general with a great deal of influence within the military  ranks and respected for his past record told the gathering that  it was impossible to look on while a victorious Army was being  led to defeat. He was referring to the presidential decision to  accept the presence of a United Nations representative at the  negotiating table.    Although an attempt was made to disguise this representative  as a "moderator," the top UN representative -- according to the  results of the 10 January meeting in Mexico between the  government and URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] --  would be authorized to present peace initiatives, convene  meetings, observe, and offer advice. All of this, added to the  fact that the Guatemalan conflict would be placed on the same  level as the conflict in El Salvador with its truth commission,  international military verification, liberated areas for the  guerrillas, and so forth, prompted the exasperation of more than  a few officers.    This panorama finally unified the views of hard-liners and  officers who, following Serrano's fall, had been removed from  the Guatemalan Army and who under no circumstances were willing  to allow diplomacy to destroy the halo of the winners of an  internal war that has lasted over 30 years.    According to confidential information, the destabilizing  climate of the past few weeks is closely linked to this  uneasiness, although it is not known which military group is to  blame.    Meanwhile, there was talk of the return of General Ortega  Menaldo who many expected to be the new chief of the G-2.  Strings were pulled to place his people in certain key positions  within the institution and there was talk of isolating the  officers who aborted Serrano's dream.    Although the Army's granite-like unity is frequently  referred  to, everyone knows there are three factions: One is formed by  the soldiers who were removed following Jorge Serrano's coup  d'etat. The second is formed by the hard-liners, and the third  is the institutional wing that supports President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio.    The second group, although their hard-line inclinations  concerning the war against the URNG and their conditional  support for the De Leon Carpio administration are known, would  be willing to join with the officers who were removed in order  to regain the initiative in the sphere of armed actions if the  effort to further involve the United Nations in the Guatemalan  peace process continues.    The first group has taken advantage of this situation. They  have used this prevailing uneasiness to attempt to look after  themselves, eager as they are to see the system collapse and to  regain their positions within the Armed Forces.    This is the panorama that was under discussion at that tense  meeting prior to the popular referendum.    Despite their hard-line position, the second group did not  want to break away from the democratic system either and was  desperately seeking measures that would return the peace issue  to its proper level. They knew it was impossible for the  president to reverse his decision because the international  community had welcomed the decision to include the United  Nations in the negotiations.    That is why they adopted the drastic measure of "confining  the PAC's to their quarters" and asking them not to vote. As a  result of this, the PAC members' relatives also failed to  exercise their right to vote.    The plan's strategists wanted a low voter turnout to prove  President De Leon Carpio's weakness and fragility and to isolate  him from the popular sectors who opposed the referendum from the  beginning. They also wanted to exert stronger pressure on the  president. Furthermore, the URNG played a role in the overall  plan: It was supposed to pretend a military coup was being  plotted against the civilian president. The URNG sought to  emerge victoriously from a low voter turnout and, as an  embellishment, provoke concern within the Army with its  capricious interpretations -- very typical of the framework  agreement reached in Mexico, which the URNG pledged not to  reveal but ended up doing so anyway.    In addition, a coup d'etat at a time when subversion has  almost been annihilated would breathe new life into the URNG,  particularly at the international level, where its position was  weakened after Serrano's ouster.    (Prior to the 25 May 1993 events the international community  thought the URNG was the only one which had the right to talk  with the Guatemalan Government, but following Ramiro de Leon  Carpio's arrival those governments discovered there are other  groups in Guatemala, which, with due respect for the political  system and the rules of the game, sought to reform the state and  its institutions.)    Meanwhile, the military measure preventing the PAC's from  voting also sought to exert even more pressure on President De  Leon Carpio. His position within the Armed Forces was  considerably weaker without the people's support on the reforms  issue. Only a small step separated this from the coup d'etat  rumors.    Once the referendum results were known, rumors about an  imminent coup d'etat began to spread in editorial rooms, the  National Palace hallways, the Congress hallways, as well as the  political parties' headquarters. There was even talk about the  assassination of a public figure, a wave of assassinations,  kidnappings, and a chaotic situation that would provoke the  president's removal.    Everything seemed to indicate Vice President Arturo  Herbruger  would be De Leon Carpio's immediate successor, which would  greatly benefit not only Army hard-liners but also those who,  due to their actions during Serrano's administration, had to  fall back into the military ranks but were ready to return.    According to labor and popular leaders, a military coup  right  now would provoke a veritable bloodbath; it would thwart our  hopes of achieving peace; and it would place us among the most  backward Latin American nations in the social and economic  sector.    It seems the situation is returning to normal. Two of the  Armed Forces factions, the institutional faction and the  hard-liners, have understood that the only option for this  country is a democratic solution. They have closed ranks around  the process, setting aside the lowly attitudes of those who have  been forced out.</p>

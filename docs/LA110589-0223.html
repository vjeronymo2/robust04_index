			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME IS RUNNING OUT  </P> <P> For six months Congress has looked into allegations of multibillion dollar  scandals, waste, mismanagement and influence-peddling at the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development. But the one person who might help Congress sort  out the facts and shake out the truth, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., former secretary  of HUD, testified once before a subcommittee and has since stonewalled the  investigation by twice refusing to answer questions. His silence left little  choice. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have requested the  appointment of a special counsel to take over the investigation.  </P> <P> An independent counsel could pursue the inquiry into the activities of Pierce,  some of his top aides and a favored few who profited handsomely from some  operations at HUD. But that can happen only if Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh  overcomes his objections to the request as an act of "partisan" politics and  appoints counsel quickly. Time is running out.  </P> <P> Thornburgh is wrong about the request and his reaction illustrates perfectly  the reason that special counsels are essential in such cases. There is nothing  partisan about finally getting to the bottom of allegations of political  favoritism, pay-offs and fraud that may have cost taxpayers more than $4  billion.  </P> <P> The need for haste lies in the law that set up the procedure for appointing  independent counsel. The law provides that a special counsel has only one year  in which to investigate a former Cabinet member after he or she leaves office.  In Pierce's case, the deadline is Jan. 20.  </P> <P> Pierce, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, headed the federal housing  department for eight years. During his tenure, federal housing funds were cut  substantially; poor people in need of housing lost out. At the same time,  well-connected Republicans siphoned off millions of dollars in consulting fees  for arranging deals for certain developers. That money would have been better  spent on rehabilitating housing as the taxpayers intended.  </P> <P> There were other problems at HUD. Private mortgage brokers stole millions from  the sale of foreclosed properties. In the rush to privatization as a way to cut  costs, HUD cut too deeply into the ranks of government auditors, and the  stealing was easy. The Federal Housing Administration, the government's largest  real estate mortgage program, ran up billions of dollars in deficits.  </P> <P> Is Pierce to blame for everything that went wrong at HUD? Absent his full and  complete testimony, people may never know what exactly went wrong or how to  prevent its happening again. A special counsel could clear up the mysteries.  </P></p>

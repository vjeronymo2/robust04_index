			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Little sign of a sanctions dividend - Exporters in South Africa will have to remain resilient SOUTH Africa's renewed descent into political crisis is bad news for exporters facing the prospect of customers and markets more interested in the political, rather than the commercial, ramifications of doing business with the country. However, if the experience of the sanctions era is anything to go by, political opprobrium is something South Africa's exporters do not find too hard. Some is patriotic bluster, to tell the world 'you didn't harm us', but there is little expectation of an immediate sanctions dividend. Taking February 1990, when the African National Congress (ANC) was unbanned, as the start of the post-sanctions era, South Africa's merchandise exports grew by 8.4 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively during 1990 and 1991, whereas growth was 21-25 per cent in three of the previous four years. Although South African exports may have done well despite the sanctions, the figures do not reveal how much better they might have done under normal circumstances. The main products affected by sanctions were iron and steel, uranium, coal, fruit and textiles. Most of these found alternative markets, affecting prices, not volumes. About 65 per cent of South Africa's exports are precious and strategic metals - gold, diamonds, platinum, chrome and vanadium - which were virtually sanctions proof. Gold exports in 1991 were R19.7bn, or 26 per cent of the total. Even exporters of non-strategic goods, such as chemicals and steel, were able to sell all their product during the period. They were not consumer goods requiring conspicuous marketing, and their bulk form meant, if necessary, that their origin could be disguised. A spokesman for Iscor steel producer, which exports close to 50 per cent of total sales, says that even with US and EC markets closed, it was able to re-route sales to the Pacific Rim and South America. The figures also reflect the slowdown in world economic growth over the same period. Most South African exports are commodities and particularly vulnerable to such a slowdown being susceptible to both volume and price weakness. Finally, they disguise an important upward trend in manufacturing exports, especially in areas such as transport machinery and equipment. Reserve Bank figures show that manufactured exports, about 20 per cent of total exports, grew by an average 25 per cent per annum during the years 1984 to 1990, the height of the sanctions period. In 1991 they rose by a further 21 per cent. Initial reasons for this success include the sharp decline of the rand, an average increase of 5 per cent per annum in world trade over the period 1984-90 and slow domestic growth encouraging producers to look for export markets. It also reflects burgeoning trade with the rest of Africa. Johannesburg bustles with Kenyan and Nigerian businessmen and South Africans themselves are much more welcome, as a recent trade fair in Kenya testifies. Mr Bruce Donald, economist at the South African Foreign Trade Organisation (Safto) says that although only 6-7 per cent of South Africa's total exports (R75bn in 1991) are to Africa, 20-30 per cent of finished goods are exported to Africa. The main African export markets are Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland - part of a customs union with South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique. Continued growth is partly attributable to the success of the General Export Incentive Scheme (GEIS), introduced in April 1990, which offers more generous subsidies as products move up the value scale. The trend in manufactured exports needs to be kept in perspective. Many of South Africa's manufactured products are uncompetitive because the country lacks economies of scale and has low labour productivity. For exporters, this means finding niche markets, or selling to countries where South African goods can compete. Unsurprisingly, fruit products and wine, freed of marketing inhibitions, have probably been the main beneficiaries of the removal of most sanctions. Likewise, the discount of Dollars 3-Dollars 5 per tonne on South African coal has largely disappeared, though the depressed state of the market has overshadowed this benefit. For commodity exporters the benefits of sanctions going will be felt in lower distribution costs and in some cases through the removal of a political discount on their products. So far, most agree, there has been little direct financial benefit from the lifting of sanctions. Many companies hope to return to their traditional markets, but realise this process takes time. Relationships have to be developed, or renewed, and new entrants, such as Venezuela into the coal market, make competition fiercer. The beneficial impact of sanctions being lifted may be evident initially not so much in higher sales as in increased capital investment. Although current political uncertainty mitigates against fresh investment, past experience suggests exports will withstand renewed calls for sanctions.</p>

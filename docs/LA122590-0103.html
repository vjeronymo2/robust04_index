			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 2 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES FIRED AFTER INQUIRY  </P> <P> Two sheriff's deputies who face criminal charges in the beating of a Maywood  jail inmate have been fired from the Orange County Sheriff's Department, a  sheriff's spokesman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Lt. Richard J. Olson said deputies John Rice, 25, and Ivan Budiselich, 26, were  fired Oct. 15 after an investigation by the department's internal affairs  division, which looks into allegations of officer misconduct.  </P> <P> Olson declined to discuss the reasons for the dismissals because state law bars  the release of specific information about internal police investigations.  </P> <P> However, he did say the inquiry had been prompted by the Maywood incident.  </P> <P> Rice and Budiselich were ordered last week to stand trial in Los Angeles  Superior Court on assault charges stemming from the March beating of Marino D.  Martillo of Huntington Park. Martillo was in the Maywood jail on traffic  warrants.  </P> <P> Also facing charges is Michael A. Elliott, 31, a Maywood officer who was fired  from the force after the incident.  </P></p>

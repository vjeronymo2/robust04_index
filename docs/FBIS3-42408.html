			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel V. Belikov: "Remote Mine-Laying </F> Systems"]    [Text] We discussed the GMZ tracked mine-layer in  VOYENNYYE ZNANIYA No 10, 1991.    Our readers, including Yu. Tarasov (Serpukhov), M.  Feshchuk (Kamenets-Podolskiy), and others, request that we  continue this topic.    Remote mine-laying systems are understood to be the sum  total  of landmines, aircraft, rocket-artillery and engineer systems  that are used to scatter mines and deliver them to the  minelaying area and to disperse them on terrain. Remote  mine-laying systems have a morale and psychological impact on  the enemy and are utilized to reduce the mobility of enemy  troops, to inflict losses using landmines and to create  favorable conditions for destruction by other weapons.  Minefields, laid using remote mine-laying systems, are  characterized by their great depth, by the absence of precise  borders and by the placement of mines on the surface of the  ground (snow). The laying of minefields is carried out, as a  rule, during the course of combat operations or directly prior  to their initiation while taking into account other obstacles,  fire plans and the nature of the terrain.    At the present time, such systems as a universal mine-layer  and portable minelaying system that have been accepted into the  inventory in the 1990's have received widespread dissemination.    A ZiL-131 high off-road capability motor vehicle, in the bed  of which are installed six canisters with 30 canister rounds  armed with antitank or antipersonnel POM, PTM or PFM mines is  used as the base vehicle for the universal  mine-layer. Their number in the basic load depends on the  purpose and design and totals from 180 to 11,520 canister  rounds. The universal mine-layer conducts the laying of an  antitank or antipersonnel minefield at a distance of 30-60  meters from itself at an average minelaying speed of 10-40  kilometers per hour [kph]. After laying one basic load, it can  be reloaded by other crew personnel consisting of two men in  1.5-2 hours. One mine-layer using one basic load can lay a 3-row  minefield from 150 to 1,500 meters long, depending on the type  of mine used.    As a rule, it is utilized as a mobile minelaying detachment  consisting of from 1-3 vehicles during the course of a battle.  The mobile minelaying detachment commander receives the  minelaying order by radio after which the vehicle advances to  the minelaying point, moving along roads or virgin soil at an  average speed of 10-25 kph. When approaching a line after the  appropriate order, the operator selects the required direction  of the canister and, utilizing the control panel located in the  driver's cab, lays a one-, two-, or three-row minefield.    The portable mine system consists of a mount with  a launch tube, a blasting machine, and a wire communications  link. Canister rounds, armed with one of the types of  antipersonnel mines, are loaded in the launch tube. Having  installed the system on a trench parapet, you can lay an  antipersonnel minefield with dimensions of 10X20(40) or 20X10  meters at a distance of 30-100 meters (depending on the type of  mine). Scattered laying is conducted on the surface of the  ground by firing the mines from the canister. The system is  carried by a one-man crew, it weighs 2.63 kg, and preparation  time for employment is less than five minutes.    The universal mine-layer and the portable minelaying system  are employed for laying minefields that cover subunit positions,  their flanks and the boundaries between them, fire positions,  breaches in combat formations and paths in minefields and also  for building up mined obstacles on armor approach routes.    In the missile troops and artillery, remote minelaying is  carried out by multiple rocket launcher systems, the  munitions of which are armed with landmines. Here a Ural-375  high off-road capability motor vehicle is used as a base  vehicle. Sixteen launchers with projectiles equipped with one  type of mine (PTM, PFM) are mounted on the Ural-375's bed. Their  number in a single projectile depends on the type and totals  from several dozen to several hundred units. The dimensions of a  minefield which can be laid by one combat vehicle (one salvo)  depend on the type of system and the firing range (from 8 to 35  km) and can occupy an area of from 24 to 81 hectares.    As a rule, multiple rocket launcher systems are enlisted to  mine enemy targets that are located in the tactical depth and  permit minefields to be laid with a significant depth and length  directly at the targets.    Aircraft (fighters, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack  aircraft) and helicopters are utilized in aviation.  Bombers and fighter-bombers are enlisted to lay minefields in  the operational depth and ground-attack aircraft -- in the  tactical depth. Canisters armed with cluster submunitions  (cassettes) with antitank and antipersonnel mines are suspended  from aircraft and helicopters.    The capabilities of aircraft to lay minefields depend on the  type of aircraft, their combat operating range (from 100 to 500  km), optimal combat employment modes (a mining speed of 400-800  kph; an altitude of 50-200 meters), the number of suspended  small canisters, and the quantity and type of mine employed.    Minelaying employing helicopters is conducted, as a rule, on  friendly territory and in the depth of enemy combat formations  while supporting combat operations of airborne assault units.    The capabilities of helicopters also depend on the type of  helicopter (Mi-8, Mi-24), the minelaying system, type of mine,  and the optimal combat employment mode (a minelaying speed of  20-300 kph; an altitude of from 30 to 100 meters), and the  expenditure of mines (mines per kilometer).    Thus, a combined-arms commander has an adequately broad  selection of remote minelaying systems to support the combat  operations of friendly units and formations.

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Coal deal provides spark for results - A look at expectations as the electricity companies report IT IS a hard world when a 40 per cent increase in your pre-tax profits does not merit so much as a raised eyebrow. But the electricity industry has resigned itself to the fact that its results season, starting today, will attract less interest than its negotiations with British Coal. For the regional companies, which are due to announce pre-tax profits for the year to March 1992 up by an average of over 40 per cent, the diversion may come as something of a relief. As it is, the increases are bound to attract some political attention. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, is always quick to condemn the privatised companies for rewarding investors not customers. He has already pounced on the 15 per cent increase announced by Scottish Power last month, which he believes conceals a higher growth rate if exceptional items last year are discounted. The regional companies' dividend growth will also be high. It is expected to average between 12 per cent and 13 per cent nominal and about 7 per cent in real terms, considerably higher than last year. 'I think there may be a worry that over-egging the pudding could bring regulatory attention and worries for investors, especially if some companies go even higher this year,' said Mr Richard Leveritt, finance director at Eastern Electricity. However, the electricity regulator has so far shown little sign of being concerned about dividend levels. Meanwhile, the season begins with the two generators' results, which are not expected to be anything like as spectacular. PowerGen's pre-tax profit should be up by about 25 per cent to 30 per cent at Pounds 340m-Pounds 350m, giving earnings per share of 29.5p to 30.5p, with a dividend up about 10 per cent at close to 9.2p. National Power is likely to report pre-tax profits between Pounds 500m and Pounds 515m, for earnings per share of 28.8p to 31.5p and a dividend also up about 10 per cent to 9p. Operationally, the main issue is likely to be costs. Both companies have cut manpower substantially - National Power now has 11,400 employees compared with 17,000 when it was floated. But now that the row over whether the generators were manipulating the electricity pool or wholesale market has died down, attention is bound to return to the coal deal on the basis that it says far more about the electricity industry's future than last year's figures. That is partly because the regional companies' dramatic profit growth is due to a technical blip. The companies were unable to increase their prices enough in the year to March 1991, because of formulae put in place by the government at flotation which linked prices to inflation forecasts which turned out to be significantly too low. They compensated in the year to March 1992 by sharp price increases, which are largely responsible for this year's profits. Electricity sales have grown by only about 1 per cent on average, with far stronger growth in the south. And although the regional companies continued their cost cutting programmes, some, notably Eastern Electricity and Manweb, are expected to report losses in electricity supply, the low margin bulk purchase and sale of electricity. This is partly because 'uplift', the administrative charge they pay to the pool, increased sharply during the year. It is concerns about this supply business, and the regulatory issues that surround it, that underlie the regional companies' concern about the coal deal. The regional companies are the kingpin of the deal between British Coal and the electricity industry that the government needs before it can privatise British Coal. Although it is the two generators who buy British Coal's product, they have to be able to sell it on as electricity to the 12 regional companies, who are at present unwilling to take it. This is because they have been warned by the regulator, who protects customers, that they must supply power as economically as possible, or face penalties later. And in 1994 the regulator is due to review the basis of the regional companies' power purchases. At the moment, whatever they pay can be passed on to customers. But the signs are that after 1994 the regulator will not allow them to pass on costs which exceed an industry average or some other yardstick. The regional companies are thus nervous about signing a large, long-term coal deal without a nod from the regulator. And when there is no sign of any surprise in the core business, the extent to which the companies' long-term future is still overshadowed by regulatory issues is bound to attract more City attention. When it comes to the generators, the importance of the coal deal issue is more simple. 'Once the contract is settled the performance of the generators will be more predictable,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. The contract is likely to cover about half the generators' income, for a period of up to five years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' FORECASTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                Results      Pre-tax     EPS       Total                        due          profit                dividend                                     (poundsm)   (pence)   (pence)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PowerGen               June  9      341         29.4       9.2 East Midlands          June 15      145.6       48.5      17.1 Norweb                 June 16      128         48.8      17.7 National Power         June 16      510         28.4       9 Manweb                 June 18       95.2       59        18.2 London                 June 24      145.4       48.7      16.8 Southern               June 25      160         44        16.8 S Wales                June 25       72.2       49.6      19.2 Sweb                   June 30       83         51.4      17.2 Midlands               July  1      138.6       48.7      17 Northern               July  2       96.8       59.2      18.5 Yorkshire              July  7      139.2       48.3      17.4 Seeboard               July  7       98         54.6      16.8 Eastern                July  8      138.2       37.8      16.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Igrunov, state Duma deputy and </F> member of Committee on CIS; date and place not given: "Patriotic  Aims Are Unavoidable in Russian Policy"]    [Text] The incident involving the arrest of Russian  generals in Riga, the debates over Lithuania's chances of NATO  membership.... The tension in relations between Russia and the  Baltic countries is mounting. State Duma Deputy Vyacheslav  Igrunov ("Yabloko"), member of the Committee on the CIS,  answered OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's questions about the prospects for  the development of these relations.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Do you feel that the friction in Russia's  relations with the "Baltic troika" has grown more intense  recently?    [Igrunov] Yes, probably. Whereas the status of the  Russian-speaking minority in the new independent states was of  little interest to most people in Russia at one time, now there  is so much concern about this problem that it has even resulted  in the revision of policy guidelines. Politicians from the  "patriotic" camp and even those who are customarily called  democrats have displayed profound impatience with their  neighbors because of the status of their fellow countrymen.    In a certain sense the new round of conflicts in relations  with the Baltic countries was unavoidable. We are caught in a  vicious circle: The deterioration of conditions in Russia is  motivating the political class in the Baltic countries to seek a  place under NATO's protective umbrella. Any Western concessions  in this respect then evoke an unhealthy reaction from Russia. We  were too late to do everything possible for the Russian-speaking  minority during a relatively calm period, and now we have to  take extraordinary steps to keep the situation from getting  worse, and all of this is being done today, now that we have a  new parliament, where the absolute majority of deputies are in  favor of the restoration of the USSR or of dramatic measures to  protect Russian interests. Similar changes have taken place in  the agencies of the executive branch of government. This is  making a grievous impression on our northwestern neighbors, an  impression which will be exceptionally difficult to dispel.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] If the majority of Duma deputies are in  favor of restoring the USSR, then why did the number of deputies  signing up for the parliamentary committee on the CIS fall short  of even the number required by the rules of procedure for the  formation of a committee?    [Igrunov] There is no contradiction here. On the contrary,  the committee is supposed to find civilized ways of establishing  cooperation within the CIS for progress in integration, but most  deputies do not even acknowledge the CIS as an entity worthy of  consideration. They are not concerned about these matters and do  not feel that they warrant attention. They prefer simple  solutions--either economic pressure or the use of force in some  form. They are acting according to Zhirinovskiy's logic: "They  will crawl to us on their knees and beg to become Russian  provinces."    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Will the recent decisions of the Brussels  session of the NATO Council influence the leaders of the Baltic  states to give up their plans to join this military bloc?    [Igrunov] No, they will continue to seek membership. The  experience of recent years has shown that, despite the West's  cautious stance, the persistence of the Baltic countries has  always brought them success. Apparently, the leaders of those  states are now hoping for the exacerbation of the situation in  Russia, which could change the NATO stance.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Which are the problems that could  escalate  tension in the near future?    [Igrunov] One example is the military transit traffic  through  Lithuania to Kaliningrad Oblast, which is still part of Russia's  territory and one of its main military bases. Any attempt to  limit this traffic could evoke a regrettable response.  Furthermore, there is a Lithuanian minority living in  Kaliningrad Oblast. This ethnic minority has assimilated well  and has not displayed any particular interest in its historical  roots, but it still might be exploited for the escalation of  tension.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Are you saying, in other words, that  difficulties can be anticipated primarily in relations with  Lithuania?    [Igrunov] No, they are more likely to occur in relations  with  Latvia and Estonia. In my opinion, this will be caused primarily  by the deterioration of economic conditions. Russia is unlikely  to continue allowing the free re-export of its nonferrous metals  and fuel through the Baltic countries. These operations are now  being conducted with the active participation of the  Russian-speaking population there; the restriction of the  re-export operations could have an adverse effect on this  minority's economic status and cause ethnic and cultural  conflicts.    Besides this, there is the extremely acute problem of the  civil rights of our fellow countrymen. Latvian and Estonian  politicians are trying to exploit the tension resulting from  Zhirinovskiy's victory. A third of the Russian-speaking  population in Latvia will be ineligible to vote in local  government elections. There is little difference between this  and the situation that existed in South Africa until recently. A  legislative bill on the prosecution of individuals who were  engaged in anti-Estonian activity during the years of Soviet  occupation is being deliberated in Estonia. According to this  document, the laws of the Estonian Republic remained in force  during the whole period when Estonia was part of the Soviet  Union, and all of the people who violated these laws are  criminals and should be punished. It is true that there have  been verbal stipulations that these legal standards were not  completely in force at that time, but this does create the  possibility of judicial proceedings against any individual who  lived in Estonia during the Soviet era. Most of the  Russian-speaking population did not even know anything about  these laws. Obviously, the new law--if it is passed--will be  enforced selectively--on ethnic grounds. There are already some  suggestions of this.    Relations with the Russian-speaking population have been  relatively calm to date in Lithuania (just as, incidentally,  recent relations with the Polish minority). This could continue  if A. Brazauskas' economic policies do not fail. In all other  respects, Lithuania will be extremely active and is most likely  to be more persistent than the others in seeking NATO  membership. Nevertheless, if the Russian Government and  parliament behave prudently, Lithuania could serve as a bridge  to the two other Baltic states for the improvement of relations  with them.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Do you feel that Russian policy toward  the  new independent states is acquiring new aims?    [Igrunov] Patriotic aims are unavoidable in Russian policy.  In my opinion, Zhirinovskiy is not simply a Russian problem, but  a global one. Look at what is happening in Germany or the United  States. We can only wonder whether European civilization is  capable of a reasonable response to its own challenge. If we  view the matter from this vantage point, Zhirinovskiy is a  permanent factor, and not a temporary one, in our policy. The  alternative is politicians like Luzhkov, and not the democrats.  We are running out of time, we will have to make our move soon,  and now we must decide how we can preserve our own values in  this situation.</p>

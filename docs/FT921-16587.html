			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BICC lags the market BY FAR the worst individual performance of the Footsie constituents on New Year's Eve came from BICC, the heavy electricals-to-construction group. An initial rise to 314p for the stock was quickly eroded as a single trade of 958,000 shares at 312p triggered a widespread mark-down by marketmakers. The trade, however, was said by dealers to have represented the completion of a bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deal, one of many that were carried out first thing on Tuesday morning. The deal accounted for much of the total turnover in BICC stock which was finally 1.2m shares. Another reason for the stock's weakness was its impending departure from the FT-SE 100 index as from today. The shares closed 9 off on balance at 303p. A number of analysts, however, take a bullish view of BICC's prospects. In a recent review of the electricals sector, Mr Jim Ross of Hoare Govett said the shares are 'oversold' after falling 29 per cent in the past three months. The Hoare analyst added that BICC 'is well placed to benefit from an expected improvement in the cables market, and worries about the financial position have been overplayed'. Drug issues responded to a euphoria of buying interest triggered mostly by the steep gains on Wall Street. Wellcome, still buoyed by hopes that its new treatment for Aids will prove successful, were driven up 35 more to 1101p on keen turnover of 1.5m shares. Fisons, responding to the company's defiance in the face of US regulatory criticism, forged ahead 15 to 326p for a two-day gain of 33. Glaxo, one of the equity market's best performers over the past year, shot up 40 to 853p amid a flurry of Continental and US buying interest. SmithKline Beecham, heavily favoured by international pharmaceutical analysts over the past few months, jumped 43 to 896p. US funds were said to have been big buyers of ICI shares, which leapt 76 to 1210p on good turnover of 1.8m. Laporte, included in the Footsie index as from today, moved ahead 35 to 620p. The market delivered its own verdict on the outcome of the Christmas selling period in pushing most of the top quality food retailers higher, along with many of the general high street retailers. But it reserved judgment on Ratners, the troubled jewellery chain, whose shares came under more selling pressure and finished 3 lower at 27p. Of the leading retailers, Marks and Spencer drew strong support, closing 10 1/2 ahead at 278 1/2 p, while Kingfisher added 15 at 482p and Dixons 8 at 205p. J. Sainsbury raced up 12 to 377p and Tesco 10 to 227p, while Asda put on 2 1/2 to 34 1/2 p. Tottenham Hotspur returned to the market and touched 105p before closing at 100p, ex-rights, with the new nil-paid shares quoted at  1/4 p premium. The sharp rises in the market dragged up an oil sector still fretting about its recent decline and the poor outlook for crude oil prices. On Tuesday, Brent crude for February delivery came under renewed downward pressure, losing a further 20 cents to around Dollars 17.60 a barrel. However, stock shortages and the prospect of US investors pushing Wall Street even higher when it opened for Tuesday trading led London dealers to hoist share prices of the leading oils. Shell Transport rallied 17 to 498p on relatively good turnover of 3.5m shares, while BP put on 14 to 293p on 6m traded. British Gas, buffeted in recent weeks by worries about the regulatory regime, moved up 6 to 265p with 6.8m shares changing hands. RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, ran up 13 to 470p, shrugging off the effect of yet another profits downgrade. The latest reduction in earnings projections was reported to have come from SG Warburg Securities. Turnover in RTZ was a low 800,000 shares. The power generators, upset recently by regulatory concerns, attracted a flurry of institutional demand which left National Power 5 higher at 145p and PowerGen 4 1/2 better at 155 1/2 p. Bank shares shrugged aside recent worries concerning the possibility of exceptionally heavy provisons against bad debts, with dealers taking the view that most of the bad news is already in the share prices. Abbey National, virtually bad-debt free compared with the high street banks, rose 12 to 295p, but TSB, still burdened by bad debt worries, could only manage a gain of 2 at 119p. Composite insurers were pushed sharply higher but for the notable exception of Guardian Royal Exchange, which just managed to hold steady at 111p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (30).

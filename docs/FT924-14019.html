			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: SIA considers moving departments to India SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA) is considering transferring accountancy and computer departments to India to cut labour costs. The move would echo Swissair's shifting its accounts department to Bombay this year; SIA and Swissair have 5 per cent stakes in each other as part of a triple alliance with the US carrier Delta. SIA is studying Swissair's experience and said yesterday problems such as software compatibility had to be overcome. Other low-cost countries including China were possible sites, especially for data processing, SIA said. The airline is also facing rising staff costs because of Singapore's labour shortage. Mr J Y Pillay, chairman, said yesterday he did not expect resistance from the company's staff. The shortages are also forcing SIA to consider recruiting cabin crew from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. 'We plan 8-10 per cent annual growth a year until the end of the century,' Mr Cheong Choong Kong, managing director, said. This would entail doubling the fleet and cabin staff. SIA is considering raising the salaries of female cabin crew. New female cabin crew recruits earn about SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 737) a month. SIA has set up a pilot training school, but is still several years away from having all its co-pilots as Singapore citizens.</p>

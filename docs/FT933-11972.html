			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Sabotaging the rouble LAST WEEKEND'S charade, instigated by the Russian central bank, must finally have confirmed to the satisfaction of anyone who still doubted it that the bank is determined to subvert economic reform in Russia. Much more worrying is yesterday's decision by President Yeltsin to soften, rather than rescind, the terms of the central bank's monetary confiscation. At best, it suggests that Mr Yeltsin does not understand the outrage felt by the reformers in his cabinet. At worst, it suggests the reformers no longer have the president's support. The events of the last few days have combined tragedy and farce, both with a strong sense of historical irony. It is only a little over two years since President Gorbachev's prime minister, Valentin Pavlov, tried to solve Russia's inflationary problems by confiscating bank notes. Then, as now, the policy caused chaos and public outrage while achieving nothing of value. The government's gaping budget deficit has remained, while other republics have continued to emit rouble credits. Indeed, this latest act will only make things worse. By guaranteeing to exchange up to Rbs35,000 worth of old rouble notes for new ones up until August 7, the central bank has actively encouraged roubles issued in other republics to flow back into Russia. By extending the date until the end of August and raising the upper limit to Rbs100,000, President Yeltsin's compromise has only made this inflationary problem worse. The tragedy is that this policy shift will now, deliberately or mistakenly, undermine the fragile confidence in the rouble as a store of value that had grown over the past two months. Confidence in the currency had allowed the central bank to accumulate up to Dollars 1bn in foreign exchange reserves last month, essential if the government is to fix the exchange rate and stabilise inflation. Now, as the prospects for stabilisation recede, the bank's new-found reserves are likely to vanish just as fast. The farce is that this decision, to confiscate old roubles and thus violate the contract between issuer and holder of money in Russia, was taken by the central bank, at a weekend's notice without consulting, let alone seeking the support of, the finance minister. This is the nature of government in today's Russia. Thus the sad history of Russia's latest encounter with economic reform moves again to a climax. In Mr Yeltsin's hands, it has become a play without director or sense of direction. Only if President Yeltsin now acts decisively should aid continue to flow. He must publicly back the reformers in his cabinet, repudiate the misjudgments of recent days, sack the central bank officials responsible and allow the reformers to take control of monetary policy. Until he does so, the west should resist Moscow's urgent plea for a further tranche of western aid. Without such aid, Russia's reforms will not succeed; without presidential willpower, such aid will be worse than useless.</p>

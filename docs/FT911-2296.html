			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Moscow now observer on Gatt dumping committee THE SOVIET Union yesterday was granted observer status in Gatt's Anti-Dumping Committee, marking a further step to eventual membership of the world trade organisation. Last May, Moscow won observer status in Gatt itself. In March this year, it won a similar standing on Gatt's import licensing committee. Yesterday's approval means Moscow has access to two of the codes, to which Gatt members subscribe separately and which are meant mainly to lower non-tariff obstacles to trade. Observer status means Soviet officials can join talks, but not vote on decisions. Mr Evgeny Makeyev, the Soviet ambassador, said Moscow considered it important to be able to follow the anti-dumping committee's work because the Soviet Union had just passed a new law on customs tariffs, which could allow anti-dumping duties to be imposed. Gatt's anti-dumping code lays down the conditions under which governments may charge duties as a defence against 'dumped' imports. There are 25 signatories to the code, the EC counting as one. Moscow is expected to apply next for observer status in the customs valuation committee which aims at harmonising national valuation systems.</p>

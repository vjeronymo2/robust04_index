			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Barlow improves on forecasts by boosting net profits 47.8% Barlow Limited, the rump of South African conglomerate Barlow Rand, which was unbundled last year, has improved on initial forecasts by reporting after-tax profit of R412.4m (Dollars 117m) for the year ended September, a rise of 47.8 per cent from the pro forma figures of R279m for the previous year. In spite of the sale of several businesses during the year, especially in its troubled off-shore subsidiary, UK-based J. Bibby &amp; Sons, turnover rose to R12.87bn, up from R11.76bn previously. Operating profit rose by 72.6 per cent to R405.2m from R234.8m while interest paid dropped to R178.3m from R230.8m. The group's balance sheet remains sound, with the debt/equity ratio at a comfortable 13.4 per cent and cash in hand of some R707m. Barlow's successful launch of a Dollars 75m international bond issue also testified to the company's growing international profile. Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said the results reflected a stronger mangement focus in the reconstituted group. He noted that Barlow had also benefited from the upturn in the domestic trading environment during the second half of the year following the South African elections in April. The largest contributor to earnings was Pretoria Portland Cement, which benefited from increased demand for cement and lime products. Both PPC and construction subsidiary Federated-Blaikie, which also improved in the second half, are expected to achieve higher volumes over the coming year as a result of the government's large-scale, housing programme. At the same time, increased demand for earthmoving equipment helped Barlows Equipment to boost earnings while paint division Plascon also performed satisfactorily. But Barlows Consumer Electric Products continued to suffer from a depressed consumer appliance market, and J. Bibby's improved bottom line came only after a major restructuring, involving the sale of non-core assets to offset heavy losses in operations in Spain and Portugal. Mr Clewlow predicted that the coming year would see a continued improvement in group earnings given the reduction in overseas borrowings and the group's appointment as Caterpillar dealer in four additional African countries.</p>

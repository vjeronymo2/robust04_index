			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Schlesinger firesparting shots MR Helmut Schlesinger was in feisty mood when he met the press in Washington at the weekend. Making one of his last media appearances before stepping down as Bundesbank president at the end of this week, he lashed out at critics of Bundesbank policy, the European exchange rate mechanism, and particularly at the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook. The document was wrong to suggest that German unification had decisively hindered global recovery by forcing high short-term interest rates on other countries, he said. German union had not prevented countries with floating currencies such as the US from cutting their interest rates. It was the European exchange rate mechanism that was at fault. He gave short shrift to suggestions that German interest rates were too high. Capital market rates had fallen to their lowest levels in many years. But he reserved special scorn for the unknown author of the IMF outlook who had omitted to include any reference to money supply in its 200 pages. This, he said, was an extraordinary philosophical lapse for a monetary body such as the IMF.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRIGHT GIRL CAUGHT IN A MAD WORLD  </P> <P> Failure to Zigzag by Jane Vandenburgh (North Point Press: $16.95; 329 pages)  </P> <P> If you saw 14-year-old Charlotte and her mother, Katrinka, at the soda fountain  in Montrose, you'd think they were winding up a mother-daughter shopping trip,  but if you were within earshot, you'd soon realize that this was no ordinary  excursion. Katrinka is loudly insisting she's being pursued by teams of  psychiatrists from Camarillo; Charlotte is desperately trying to calm her down.  </P> <P> After the first few sentences, it's plain that Katrinka is no delightfully  madcap mom but a woman temporarily furloughed from the mental hospital; not  madcap but truly mad. From that point on, pleasure in the mordant satire and  witty dialogue is edged with guilt and pity for the child who so valiantly  attempts to understand and cope. "Charlotte had stopped listening. Instead, she  was thinking about the nature of paranoia, that it, like the color of one's  eyes and the shape of one's eyebrows and upper lip, might be a gene-linked  trait." In a just world, she should be worrying about the fizzies and geometry,  but there's no justice here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Runs in the Family  </P> <P> During the periods when Katrinka is incarcerated, Charlotte lives with her  maternal grandparents, Winnie and Lionel Ainsworth of Glendale. A short  acquaintance with them can persuade you that psychiatry may have been too hasty  in discounting heredity as a factor in mental illness, because Winnie and  Lionel seem almost as irrational as Katrinka, though in socially more  acceptable ways.  </P> <P> Charlotte's father is dead, presumably drowned when the Indianapolis was sunk  near the end of World War II by a Japanese torpedo. Moving under cover of  darkness with its cargo of uranium, the ship failed to zigzag -- standard  operating procedure during wartime. That phrase not only gives the book its  title but its leitmotif; "failure to zigzag" becoming the metaphor for  Katrinka's inability to accommodate to reality; for the elder Ainsworth's fixed  and rigid ideas and for the young naval officer's inexplicable behavior. Only  young Charlotte is able to zigzag in this particular sense, developing the  necessary resilience as a tot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shock Treatment  </P> <P> The structure of the book is also a zigzag; opening with an extended segment  delineating Charlotte's life with her eccentric grandparents, then backtracking  to 1955, when Katrinka is released from the hospital only to marry a  well-meaning red-neck who optimistically installs his new bride and her child  in his ramshackle Radiant Beach house. There, Katrinka attempts to play wifey,  a role for which her recent experience with shock treatment has clearly not  prepared her. Riotously funny, these scenes are poignantly tempered by  Charlotte's anguish.  </P> <P> Though we're relieved when the bizarre marriage ends, Katrinka's next remission  in 1962 has mother and daughter taking off in an Airstream to follow a  struggling circus. Temporarily able to resume her "career" as a ventriloquist,  Katrinka leaves with her parents' blessings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Coming-of-Age  </P> <P> By buying her the trailer, they hope to be finally free of their troublesome  daughter and to shift their burden onto 16-year-old Charlotte's capable  shoulders. In the course of this final section, we finally learn the truth  about Joseph Black, Charlotte's father, a mystery that has haunted the novel  from the beginning.  </P> <P> In the end, Charlotte is also free, though her liberation is more costly than  any in current fiction. As affecting as it is astonishing, "Failure to Zigzag"  succeeds in renewing that weary genre, the coming-of-age first novel.  </P></p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Poles queue to get their share: Christopher Bobinski on how ordinary people's savings have fuelled the stock market MR ARTUR Nagorka, one of many Poles attracted to the Warsaw Stock Exchange by several months of apparently endless share price increases, breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as prices resumed their upward march after a dizzying 20 per cent fall at the beginning of the week. It was only last week that the 27-year-old Mr Nagorka, who works as a bulk cargo forwarder for a western company, brought a wad of zloty notes worth the equivalent of Dollars 1,500 into the broking office of Warsaw's Food Economy Bank (BGZ). He invested the lot in shares in Wedel, the confectionery producer controlled by PepsiCo Foods International. Like thousands of ordinary Poles whose savings have been fuelling a six-month boom on Warsaw's two-year-old stock exchange, he took the decision to risk his entire savings after noticing the money that others were making. 'I did not come in before because I don't think I really have a gift for this kind of thing,' he said last week. 'But with the banks only offering 3 per cent a year for hard currency deposits and 30 per cent on zloty savings accounts it seems a sensible gamble to invest when stocks are rising by 30 per cent a week.' Last Thursday, the day Mr Nagorka bought his shares, the stock exchange's WIG index hit a new high of 7471.1 after rising 550 per cent since the boom began just before Easter. Turnover that day hit a record 1,227bn zlotys (Pounds 41m) for the 19 stocks quoted. At the next session, on Monday this week, turnover stayed high at 1,003bn zlotys, but most stocks fell to within a whisker of the 10 per cent maximum decline allowed under the WSE trading rules. The plunge continued on Tuesday and it was only yesterday that all but one stock bounced back close to the 10 per cent ceiling. This 'yo-yo' effect, says Mr Nagorka, is worrying him, but he's holding on to his stock and other new investors are continuing to bring their savings into the front offices of Poland's 30 licensed brokers. Mr Tadeusz Gacyk, the deputy head of the BGZ's broking office says his bank alone is registering more than 300 new investors a day and 'doubling the number of our clients every three weeks'. Overall, at the end of July there were 102,000 investors in the country with the number growing by 5,000 a month. Share investment under these circumstances has spawned some novel assessment techniques. 'I shall sell when I see the daily queue of new investors outside a nearby broker disappear,' says one investor who has long abandoned more traditional methods such as studying price earnings ratios, which now stand at around 18. The boom started when the banks lowered interest rates earlier this year and people began to look elsewhere for a home for at least some of their Dollars 14.3bn worth of household savings. At the same time foreign investors, including investment and pension funds as well as banks such as Creditanstalt, began to purchase shares, setting the upward escalator in motion. Official estimates put foreign ownership of stock at about 30 per cent of the WSE's current Dollars 1.5bn capitalisation. But small domestic savers have been providing the real momentum behind the market. The Polish authorities have even been asking foreign investors to hold off their purchases. 'We want them to wait and then come in when prices start coming down to stabilise the market,' says one senior financial official. The government, meanwhile, has failed to take advantage of the growth in demand for shares on the WSE to speed up the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. It has offered no more than a handful for sale through a public offering in the past six months. But private sector companies have been equally slow in coming to the market to raise funds through fresh equity issues. This reticence is partly caused by the time consuming application formalities of the Securities Commission, admits its chairman, Mr Leslaw Paga. But the main cause for hesitation is the reluctance of both foreign and domestic companies to subject their finances to public scrutiny, or suffer the partial loss of control a flotation implies. As for Mr Nagorka, the last few days have made him more fully aware of the risks. Last week he was confident of making a profit. This week's spin on the WSE's roller coaster has dented that belief: 'Originally I'd been planning to sell the shares when I'd doubled my investment, now I think I may sell sooner,' he says.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Euro-sceptics rush to seize high ground - An increasing number of British MPs are calling for a more combative stance on Europe BRITAIN'S so-called Euro-sceptics were last night on the offensive in the race to fill the policy vacuum left by last week's exchange rate turmoil, taking their lead from a belligerent Baroness Thatcher. Their campaign to pressure Prime Minister John Major to adopt a more combative stance on European issues was given a substantial fillip by two polls showing a marked shift against the Maastricht treaty. As the French went to the polls to give their verdict on the treaty, a survey in the Independent on Sunday newspaper showed a similar plebiscite in the UK would deliver a 47 per cent No vote and only 24 per cent would say Yes, with 29 per cent undecided. Before last week's sterling crisis, opinion polls had shown narrow majorities in favour of the treaty. Opposition is now shown to be strongest among Conserva- tive voters, though the NOP poll and soundings taken by Mori for the Sunday Times indicate that majorities do not believe that Mr Major or Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, should resign as a result of the exchange rate debacle. The tide of public opinion was, nonetheless, clearly in the minds of senior Tory politicians yesterday as Mr Lamont sought in Washington to cool fears of a rapid return to the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Conservative MPs in London, meanwhile, were absorbing the details of the polls and the impact of a blunt speech by the former prime minister in the US capital on Saturday. Welcoming Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, Lady Thatcher urged Mr Major to press ahead with interest rate cuts and to drop his commitment to an eventual return to the system when conditions allow. Pressing home her implicit criticism of the government's policy of seeking to be 'at the heart of Europe', she argued there would be 'chaos and resentment' if the government continued to pursue the goals of the Maastricht treaty. 'It is high time to make as complete a reversal of policy on Maastricht as has been done on the ERM,' she said. 'If the divergence between European economies is so great that even the ERM cannot contain them, how would they react to a single European currency?' Evidence that Lady Thatcher may have struck a chord came in a Mori opinion poll published in the Sunday Telegraph. It showed that 74 per cent of those Britons polled are discontent with the government's handling of the economy, two thirds back cuts in interest rates and 59 per cent believe the pound should be able to float indefinitely. Only 19 per cent of the 1,013 adults questioned on Friday and Saturday supported the government's aim of returning to the ERM. Last night Mr Lamont was returning to London from the Group of Seven meeting in Washington two days ahead of schedule to oversee the British response to the French referendum. Yesterday, Lord Parkinson, a former Conservative chairman, added his voice to the growing lobby opposing a return to the ERM. Describing the currency system as 'a dead duck', he conceded the recession had been deeper and more prolonged as a consequence of interest rates linked to those of the D-Mark. But he added Mr Major and Mr Lamont should not be particularly vulnerable as the Labour and Liberal Democrat opposition parties had both adopted similar positions to those of the government. Sir Teddy Taylor, the virulently anti-Maastricht Conservative MP for Southend, was more outspoken. He said that after the 'costly and humiliating shambles' of last week it was absurd for the Tory party to be talking about returning to the ERM. Other Conservative Euro-sceptics believe their numbers could be swelled by at least 100 when parliament returns for an emergency debate on the economy on Thursday. Forced on to the defensive, the pro-Maastricht faction in the party - until last week a majority - has been slow to react to the rapidly unfolding events. However, Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a Euro-enthusiast MP, underlined yesterday that the likely outcome of the break-up of the current ERM would be the creation of a two-speed Europe, with some countries pressing ahead with Germany towards a single currency.</p>

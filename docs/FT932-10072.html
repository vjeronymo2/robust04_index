			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Clearer picture for creditors - Legal briefs FOLLOWING a decision by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, the Registry of County Court Judgments has begun to register administration orders. Administration orders, like judgments, will remain on the register for six years. Mr Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of Registry Trust which runs the register for the Lord Chancellor's department, said the most frequent users of the register were creditors seeking information on loans applicants who were already in debt. The addition of administration orders to the register would improve the quality of information available to lenders, Mr Hurlston said. The trust expects to register about 11,000 orders a year compared with 2m judgments. No orders dated before April 1993 will be registered.</p>

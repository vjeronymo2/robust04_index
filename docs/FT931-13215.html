			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Observer: Done it A 23-year-old Hawaiian, nom de guerre Akebono and otherwise known as Chad Rowan, is apparently to be promoted to sumo's highest rank, yokozuna or grand champion, ending a curious debate over whether wrestlers imported from the US or elsewhere would be forever denied the exalted title. Having won the latest Tokyo tournament, which finished yesterday, Akebono, 212kg and just over 2 metres tall, was told by serious-faced sumo officials that a meeting later this week is likely to confirm his promotion. The same serious-faced sumo officials had last year told another Hawaiian, Konishiki, a not insignificant 261kg, that an important barrier to his promotion was a lack of hinkaku. Getting a precise definition of the all-important hinkaku was difficult, but it means something like gravitas and something more than mere technique. Whatever hinkaku is, Chad Rowan has it.</p>

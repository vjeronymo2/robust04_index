Podmarkov said that this amount is incompatible with the  total amount of debt exceeding a trillion roubles by now, but  shows that Ukrainian consumers make efforts to repay their debts.    Options for the full repayment of Ukraine's debt will be  discussed on Thursday with Ukrainian representatives, Podmarkov  said. The Ukrainian delegation which will negotiate the issue  is expected to arrive late on Wednesday.</p>

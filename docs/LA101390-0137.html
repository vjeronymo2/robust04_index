			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> A BLOOMIN' BEAUTIFUL EFFECT  </P> <P> When it comes to gardening, the English are contradictory blokes.  </P> <P> They meticulously file their hedges into poodle-like shapes. Then they let  their grass grow freely, daisies and dandelions welcome. They line their  cobblestone walkways with carefully arranged planters. Then they haphazardly  overstuff the surrounding soil with a potpourri of flowers.  </P> <P> The resulting effect is a blend of country and city, natural beauty and human  creativity.  </P> <P> Landscaper Nick Sutcliffe brought that British accent to Southern California  when he transplanted here 11 years ago. His Newport Beach-based business,  English Gardens, specializes in the style of gardening he learned while growing  up in villages outside of London.  </P> <P> He could persuade his clients to flood their gardens with a medley of colorful  blooms rather than confining themselves to only a few varieties. But unshaven  lawns were not their cup of tea; folks on this side of the Atlantic like their  front yards clean-cut.  </P> <P> "That took some getting used to," Sutcliffe said. "Americans are so precise;  we're not nearly as fussy in England. We use a combination of grasses mixed  with moss, because of the moisture. Daisies spring up, and we don't mind at  all."  </P> <P> So Sutcliffe compromised. He mows grass short -- his only concession to the  American way, aside from replacing plants that do poorly in this climate with  California-friendly substitutes.  </P> <P> His client Diana Sterling initially balked at the English affinity for a  hodgepodge of multicolored flowers. "I wasn't sure if I liked it at first -- it  looked overgrown to me," the Fullerton resident said. "But now I think it gives  the property such a jolt of color."  </P> <P> Frequent compliments from passers-by helped to confirm her reassessment of the  English approach. "What a beautiful yard!" gushed an elderly couple walking  their dog on a recent morning.  </P> <P> "People ring our doorbell to ask for our landscaper's telephone number," said  Sterling, who basks in the glory with her husband, Ed Sterling, a plastic  surgeon. "Sometimes I see people snapping pictures of our lawn."  </P> <P> When Sutcliffe took control of the Sterlings' yard 10 years ago, their front  lawn was a "jungle," he said.  </P> <P> "They had junipers and Hollywood twisters blocking the house, palm trees  everywhere -- it was too much," Sutcliffe recalled.  </P> <P> He cleared out some of the trees, instead making manicured hedges the lawn's  focus. Five-feet-tall bushes sculpted into perfect domes primly frame the  driveway and gardens.  </P> <P> The dark green plants, dotted with delicate purple flowers, look like dwarfed  trees. Actually, they are vines -- potato vines, although they do not produce  potatoes. "It's not the nicest name," Sutcliffe complained. He uses them in  place of the bushes native to England that founder here.  </P> <P> "It takes a number of years of training and pruning the potato vines every week  to get them like this," Sutcliffe said. "Originally, they are loose rather than  dense; gradually, they fill out."  </P> <P> A dedicated non-professional could whip the plants into shape, Sutcliffe said,  though the feat requires an eye for symmetry.  </P> <P> For do-it-yourselfers, Sutcliffe recommended perennial flowers, which survive  throughout the year -- as opposed to annuals, which are seasonal. "I can make  gardens that are fairly maintenance-free, but the more maintenance-free, the  more limited you are in the types of plants you can use," he points out.  </P> <P> The Sterlings include in their garden numerous annuals; Sutcliffe rotates them  every few months in accordance with the season. Pansies, ageratum, marigolds,  petunias, blue salvia and red salvia thrive during autumn. Impatiens, begonias,  vinca and stocks enjoy winter.  </P> <P> Sutcliffe's own home, in Chino Hills, is a good example of the English tendency  to binge on flowers. In his compact front and back yards, more than 75  varieties of perennials and herbs currently are in bloom -- among them, asters,  statice, white vinca, salvia, geraniums, roses, baby's breath, Spanish  lavender, honeysuckle and rosemary.  </P> <P> He boxes the flowers inside a serpentine "dry wall," typical in his home  country. The flat flagstones are sandwiched together with soil, allowing the  garden's overspill to grow through the layers of the wall. "It's a very natural  look," Sutcliffe noted.  </P> <P> The abundance of flowers and plants in his small, 45-by-25-foot back yard makes  the area appear more spacious, Sutcliffe said. And, he added, they provide "an  atmosphere of quietude."  </P> <P> Sutcliffe favors Marathon II grass, which has a finer blade than Marathon I.  "Its look is the nearest you can get to an English lawn," he said.  </P></p>

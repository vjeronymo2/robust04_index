			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Meeting fails to end Ulster deadlock: Pessimism deepens over 'round-table' talks about province's political future TALKS ON Northern Ireland's political future have descended into a fractious row, bordering on the farcical, over the venue for negotiations involving the Irish government. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, met Mr Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, for four hours in London yesterday to consider how to end the deadlock. Neither commented afterwards. Pessimism about the progress of 'round-table' talks has deepened to a new low, with goodwill rapidly disappearing. After two weeks out of the 11 set aside for negotiations, participants are stuck at the 'talks about talks' stage. One course appears to be for Mr Brooke to issue an ultimatum when the province's four constitutional parties reconvene on Monday with the threat of the talks collapsing if the participants do not accept his proposals. Unionists refuse to travel to Dublin for the talks about relations between the two parts of Ireland as long as the Irish Republic has a constitutional claim on the north. They have also blocked Belfast. Nationalists want talks held somewhere in Ireland. Mr Brooke has called on the nationalist and unionist leaders to 'reflect on their positions over the weekend'. He will be hoping the potential embarrassment of talks folding on a logistical detail, and the encouragement it would give terrorists, will concentrate minds. The question of who will chair discussions once the Dublin government becomes involved has raised further difficulties. It is believed unionists have objected to Mr Brooke and Mr Collins acting as co-chairmen. Unionists and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party provoked more antagonism yesterday by breaking the confidentiality which has so far surrounded the talks. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the Unionist leaders, published five alternative venues acceptable to them, including London, a 'neutral venue' outside the British Isles, and combinations of locations. 'While we will continue to seek a reasonable accommodation, the community will understand that we cannot indefinitely be expected to alter our position in the absence of a reciprocal measure of flexibility by others,' they said. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the SDLP, said he could not understand why the unionists would not negotiate within Northern Ireland. 'They are showing their weakness, their inability to stand on their own two feet, their absolute fear,' he said. Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, said on BBC radio: 'It is the first time in 16 years that people have had to come near a table, never mind get around it. I hope it is no more than a hiccup.'</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Union pledges pay fight as Timex plant shuts TIMEX UK faces a legal challenge from its dismissed workers after announcing at the weekend the closure of its circuit board production plant in Dundee. Mr Jimmy Airlie, national officer for the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) in Scotland, said yesterday that the union planned to take the company to court seeking redundancy payments and financial compensation for its dismissed workforce. 'It is an absolute scandal that a company can provoke a dispute to force its workers to accept vastly inferior pay and conditions and avoid the normal costs of a plant closure,' he said. 'It is time something was done about situations like this. Timex provides us with a test case.' The union intends to press the cases of the 343 Timex workers before industrial tribunals with claims of unfair dismissal. The existing pension rights of the Timex workforce were safeguarded but none of those dismissed last February will receive any redundancy pay. The AEEU has been taking legal advice throughout the dispute. Timex also went to court on numerous occasions to safeguard its legal rights against what it saw as intimidation and violence through mass picketing. But the union won a number of judgments during the often fierce legal battles. Timex was compelled last week to lodge Pounds 40,000 as security in advance of any compensation awards made by industrial tribunals. Timex said on Sunday it deeply regretted closing its production facilities in Dundee after 47 years. Local strike leaders vowed to continue their campaign against Timex by encouraging a global boycott of its products. Timex's decision to hasten closure reflects the bitterness surrounding a dispute that produced some of the worst scenes of picket line violence in Britain for years. The Timex workers were all dismissed on February 18 when they refused to support a management-imposed wage freeze and fringe benefits cuts which the company argued would secure their jobs and ensure competitiveness.

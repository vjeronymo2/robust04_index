			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> 4TH-QUARTER RALLY LIFTS N. HOLLYWOOD OVER DORSEY, 56-54  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Robert Hill sank an off-balance, four-foot jump shot with 34  seconds to play and reserve guard Duane Braxton added a free throw 17 seconds  later to cap a magnificent rally and give North Hollywood High a 56-54  nonleague victory Tuesday over visiting Dorsey.  </P> <P> The Huskies (7-0) trailed, 47-34, after Dorsey's Shaunde Fritz made a  buzzer-beating three-point shot to end the third quarter. North Hollywood,  however, began the final period with a 12-2 run and outscored Dorsey, 22-7.  </P> <P> "We were never beaten," Hill said. "No matter what happens, we never give up. I  think we were just a little intimidated at first."  </P> <P> North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller labeled the Huskies' performance both their  best and worst of the season. North Hollywood committed 13 turnovers in the  first half and trailed, 27-19, at halftime.  </P> <P> Dorsey (5-2), ranked 13th in the state by at least one publication, pressured  the Huskies into making bad passes and contained senior center Dana Jones with  a shifting man-to-man defense.  </P> <P> "They had good help, good rotation," said Jones, who scored only six points in  the first half but finished with a game-high 17. "(The points) came real slow.  But I knew we weren't beaten. We were just out of sync in the beginning."  </P> <P> Jones scored six points in the fourth quarter, including a slam-dunk and foul  shot to pull North Hollywood to within 54-51 with 2:05 to play.

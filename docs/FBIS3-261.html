			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria, March 1, SAPA--Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front -- AVF] leader Gen. Constand Viljoen on Tuesday  [1 March] said he seriously doubted whether many right-aligned  soldiers would be willing to collaborate with the government in  its efforts to suppress "their own people. Gen Viljoen was  reacting in a statement to State President F.W. de Klerk's  "continued threats" to clamp down on Afrikaners with the help of  the security forces.    Mr. de Klerk warned in Parliament on Monday that the  government would use every means at its disposal, including  security forces to prevent any party from hindering any person  in his democratic right to vote, or from hampering the  elections. The Freedom Alliance has indicated it will boycott  the elections.    Gen. Viljoen said problems should not be solved through  force  but through negotiations and, if necessary, the elections could  be postponed. "I would like to remind the state president that  the South African Defence Force [SADF] of 1994 is not the SADF  of 1984. Not in capacity, training or experience. Yet a very  competent part of the defence force, the most competent part,  consists of many of our supporters."    The government and the African National Congress [ANC] had  failed to grant the Freedom Alliance its right to self-  determination, he said. "Through their arrogance and complete  disregard for the just demands of the Alliance, they have  created anger and frustration which is bound to burst out in the  open. It is time they accept the responsibility for this anger.  The correct way to solve these problems is not through force  but through negotiations and, if necessary, to shift the  election date. It will be justifiable in the light of the  requirement for peace in this country."    Although the AVF's demands had not been accommodated by the  government and the ANC "we are now threatened with force if we  do not comply with the dictated political dispensation which  amounts to terms of surrender."    Although the AVF's demands had not been accommodated by the  government and the ANC, "we are now threatened with force if we  do not comply with the dictated political dispensation which  amounts to terms of surrender." The AVF's action thus far had  been directed against the interim constitution that could result  in a communist state, Gen. Viljoen said. "A soldier is loyal to  the values and norms of his nation, of which the constitution is  intended to be the product. Our people, being part of the  defence force of this country ... realise that it (the interim  constitution) does not represent their values. I sincerely  doubt whether many of our soldiers, under these circumstances,  will be willing to collaborate with the government in its  intended efforts to suppress their own people."    Gen. Viljoen wanted to know why the government was suddenly  so keen to act against Afrikaners while, he said, the ANC  continued with its "political cleansing campaign" countrywide.  "Why does the government threaten to bomb us into submission by  using our own security forces, while Azanian Peoples Liberation  Army terrorists are granted indemnity for terror acts such as  the St. James church massacre?"</p>

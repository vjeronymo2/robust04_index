			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (17): A clarion call in the wilderness MAVERICK, THE LIFE OF A UNION REBEL by Eric Hammond and Christopher Leake Weidenfield and Nicholson, Pounds 16.99, 214 pages AT A TIME when most trade union leaders struggled to be heard amid a hostile political environment, Eric Hammond encountered few such difficulties. When he stepped down this month as general secretary of the EETPU electricians after eight years, trade unions lost one of their most notorious, and arguably one of their most effective, leaders. Notorious because he challenged traditional views of what unions should do and incurred the wrath of colleagues in other unions as a result. Effective because his union suffered less than others in membership losses and he retained the loyalty of his members even though he led them out of the Trades Union Congress and the union mainstream. In his autobiography, he is typically unrepentant. Indeed, he inflames his opponents further by revealing details of secret talks held with News International a year before it moved its newspaper printing operations to Wapping in 1985. The talks, albeit on recognition at a planned publication rather than existing ones, contributed towards several thousand print union workers losing their jobs. Hammond, never one to undersell himself, clearly has his eyes on a wider readership than that which could normally be expected of a union leader's autobiography. Written in collaboration with Christopher Leake, industrial editor of The Mail on Sunday, the style is succinct and rich in anecdotes. Among these Hammond records a confrontation at 10 Downing Street with Lord Weinstock, GEC chief executive. The row, over whether Hammond was responsible for frustrating a 1970s nuclear programme, ended with Hammond asking Weinstock if he ever asked himself whether he might be wrong. According to Hammond: 'Weinstock paused briefly and then said, with all the vehemence I have experienced from my many enemies in the TUC: 'Yes, I was wrong. I didn't have you shot.' There was no smile.' The book is also readable because Hammond has a story to tell. In ten chapters, the book uses five to chart the EETPU's and Hammond's differences with other unions over: the pits strike of 1984-5; union acceptance of government cash for ballots; News International; no-strike deals; and Labour party policy. In these rows Hammond sustained himself with his belief, bordering on arrogance, in his intellectual rectitude. If he had doubts about his talks with Murdoch, he does not express them. The blame is placed firmly on the shoulders of print union leaders for their '19th century' intransigence in talks with Murdoch and for leading their members 'like lemmings over the precipice.' But in his adversities Hammond's state of mind - though not necessarily his cause - was also helped by his delight in verbal fighting and his sense of theatre. On the few occasions where he expresses regret it is usually to lament that he was deprived of the dramatic effect he had expected. In one passage he discusses his last speech to the TUC, in the debate prior EETPU's 1988 expulsion for failing to implement TUC rulings on inter-union rows. 'For the first time in years, I was able to make a speech without constant interruption. Norman (Willis, TUC general secretary) had issued orders the previous evening that there was to be no heckling. I tried desperately to bait them, but much to my chagrin it did not work.' The overall impression Hammond tries to give is that he faced up to reality faster than other union leaders over issues such as government cash for ballots and single union deals. Of his struggles in the Labour party, he writes: 'From being the odd man out all those years ago, (a reference to a row over ceremonial dress while a Labour councillor) I now feel like the odd man in. After all, they have all followed by lead.' Unions and Labour have indeed altered their policies. But what changed them was Thatcher and the Conservative party; Hammond's role was insignificant by comparison and he may even have slowed the process because of his antagonistic stances. And it is difficult to imagine any other union leader emulating Hammond's actions during the News International controversies.</p>

The  underground group, the Chinese League for Justice and Democracy, calls in the  manifesto for the removal from office of the current Communist leadership. The  statement -- being distributed over a worldwide network of facsimile machines  -- describes the league as "a nonviolent organization" seeking "the  establishment of a democratic political system" in China.  </P></p>

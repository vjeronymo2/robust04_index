			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The foreign ministers  of the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United  Nations will have their final say at a meeting in Geneva as  regards the framework of a political settlement for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, diplomatic circles in Belgrade said on  Thursday. This platform for the conclusion of the two-year-old  civil war among the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats could  include three major parts, the diplomatic circles said.    The first part is an unconditional ceasefire in the entire  territory of ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on  which the Bosnian Serb leadership has been insisting for months  and which, nevertheless, has invariably been rejected by the  Bosnian Muslims. The second part is the territorial delineation  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The prevailing opinion in diplomatic circles in Belgrade is  that the Geneva meeting will take as its point of departure the  map, previously proposed by the European Union, envisaging  virtually that Bosnian Serbs get 49 percent of the entire  territory, while the Bosnian Muslims and Croats should get 51  percent. The third part of the Geneva talks could concern the  U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), i.e.  their linking with the first two parts and consequently their  lifting as soon as these two parts are completed.    Bearing all that in mind, a decision to be later adopted by  participants in a summit on Bosnia-Herzegovina could be taken in  Geneva, the circles said. A deal on the `division of tasks'  should not, of course, be ruled out which means that in the  process of implementing that plan the United States would be in  charge of the Bosnian Muslims, Russia in charge of the Bosnian  Serbs and Germany in charge of the Bosnian Croats.    It is yet to be seen what the outcome of the latest meeting  in Geneva will be, where in the past two years many attempts  have been made to settle the Bosnian conflict. None of these  attempts, however, have been successful and, as it has been  announced in Moscow, Washington, London and Brussels, all  participants in the Geneva meeting are now resolute to bring  this issue to an end.    In such circumstances, the Geneva meeting could also be the  point of decision, the diplomatic circles said.</p>

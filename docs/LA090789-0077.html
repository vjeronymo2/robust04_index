			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO ACCUSES ENVOY OF BOGUS PASSPORT SALES  </P> <P> Authorities arrested a consul general who allegedly sold forged Mexican  passports and also broke up a gang in Tijuana that smuggled Central American  aliens into the United States, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The government news agency Notimex said Fidel Alvarez Lopez, the Mexican consul  general in Calexico, Calif., and two unidentified accomplices were taken  Tuesday to Tijuana under heavy police escort.  </P> <P> Notimex did not say when or where they were arrested.  </P> <P> All three face preliminary charges of forgery and abuse of authority, the  agency said. Alvarez refused to talk to reporters as he was escorted to jail.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the attorney general's office in Mexico City, which investigated  the case, confirmed the arrest but refused to give details, saying the probe  has not been completed. The spokesman spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $600 to $700 per Forgery  </P> <P> Notimex said a preliminary investigation showed that Alvarez was involved in  selling the forged passports for $600 to $700 apiece.  </P> <P> In a separate case, 10 people were arrested in Tijuana in connection with a  shakedown scheme that preyed on illegal aliens from Central America trying to  sneak into the United States, the attorney general's office said in a prepared  statement.  </P> <P> Six of those arrested were Guatemalan citizens, including a brother and two  sisters. The news release said Federal Judicial Police picked them up as they  tried to cross the border into San Diego.  </P> <P> Officials said the six will be deported to Guatemala.  </P> <P> Also arrested were a Mexican immigration service officer, a junior officer  trainee, a former immigration officer and a former judiciary police agent, all  of whom demanded bribes of about $100 to let the aliens travel through Mexico  into California, the news release said.  </P> <P> The four are being held on charges of abuse of authority, accepting bribes and  violating Mexico's immigration laws.  </P> <P> In recent months, Mexico has stepped up efforts to crack down on crime along  the border, particularly drug trafficking and illegal migration.  </P> <P> The crackdown and increased cooperation between U. S. and Mexican border  authorities was announced by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari after he took  office in December.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN'T COMPARE THEM -- OR CAN YOU?  </P> <P> Congratulations to Bob Oates on an excellent column regarding Al Davis and  Walter O'Malley.  </P> <P> It's pretty clear that Davis is the key to getting the Coliseum upgraded to a  modern playing facility. If he leaves, as Oates explained, the arena will  continue to deteriorate.  </P> <P> Let's press forward in a last-ditch attempt to keep the Raiders here. The city  will benefit in the long run, as will Southern California as a whole.  </P> <P> BILL HETHERMAN  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Rival consortia lodge bids for final piece of SME The final dismembering of SME, the state-controlled Italian foods group, came a step closer yesterday when two rival consortia - one Italian, the other Italo-Swiss - lodged bids for its supermarket and restaurant businesses. The offers should mark the beginning of the end of one of the messiest sell-offs attempted by Iri, the Italian state holding company, which promised investors a model privatisation when the break-up and sale of SME was launched in January 1993. Official details were not released yesterday, but it is understood that three companies have joined forces for the bid: La Rinascente, the quoted Italian retail group; Ferrero, the Italian confectionery company; and FinComit, the merchant banking arm of Banca Commerciale Italiana. Their offer is pitted against a joint bid from Pam, another Italian retailer; Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's holding company; and Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group. This consortium is advised by Credit Suisse First Boston. The consortia must first offer to buy 32 per cent of SME from Iri, which owns a 62 per cent stake. They will then launch a public offer for a further 32 per cent at the same price, and finally buy the rest of Iri's shares. At yesterday's closing share price of L3,779, SME is valued at just over L1,700bn (Dollars 1.08bn), but analysts believe the business could be worth as much as L2,000bn. Members of the winning consortium are expected to split the GS supermarkets and the Autogrill motorway restaurant operations between them, possibly bringing in other investors. Iri broke SME into three parts for the sell-off - Italgel (frozen foods and sweets), Cirio Bertolli De Rica (oil, canned vegetables and milk), and GS-Autogrill. Mr Michele Tedeschi, then Iri chief executive and now its chairman, predicted in late 1992 that the operation would be completed in six months. However, the sell-off has been dogged by problems. Italgel was bought by Nestle of Switzerland in July 1993. Initial attempts to sell CBD and GS-Autogrill last year had to be abandoned because Iri, advised by Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique, said the offers it received were inadequate. CBD was eventually acquired by an agricultural co-operative, which sold the olive oil business to Unilever last November. Control of the rest of CBD, renamed Cirio, has now passed to Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the former financier turned agro-industrialist. Mr Cragnotti is building an agro-foods conglomerate on the back of Cirio's milk and canned vegetable operations, and will today launch a formal bid for the 32 per cent of Cirio still quoted on the Italian market. The Italian government is hoping for a swift conclusion to the GS-Autogrill saga, so that it can get on with the privatisation of Stet, the telecoms holding company, and Enel, the electricity generator.</p>

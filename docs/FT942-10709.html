Bank of Africa The African Development Bank starts its 30th anniversary celebrations in Nairobi (to May 13) with a fundamental shake-up in the offing. The deteriorating relations between the president, Babacar Ndiaye, and the board of governors will be discussed, as will a critical report on the performance of the bank's projects, which have not been doing well. Leading member countries say they are holding back the replenishment of the bank's soft-loan fund. The AfDB is one of Africa's biggest sources of development finance, with a disbursed loan portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn. West goes east At a Western European Union meeting in Luxembourg, steps will be taken to consolidate the nine-member group's status as a defence association. Nine former Eastern bloc states will become associate partners, and Turkey, Norway and Iceland will be drawn closer into the group's embryonic military planning activities. UK education Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, will outline his proposals for simplifying the national curriculum in England and Wales. He will suggest which subjects and topics should no longer be compulsory. After a period of consultation, the changes should be ready for the school year beginning September 1995. Holidays Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (Victory Day). TUESDAY Mandela sworn in Mr Nelson Mandela is formally sworn in as president of South Africa this morning. More than 180 world leaders, including more than 40 heads of state, are arriving in Pretoria for the inauguration. The ceremony is to be attended by more than 150,000 people and is being televised live to millions around the world. Hata in the lions' den Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, enters the lions' den when he delivers his first policy speech to parliament, setting the tone for what is expected to be a short-lived administration. Crimea's pro-Russian parliament debates whether to hold a referendum in June on secession from Ukraine. Australian budget Ralph Willis, the treasurer, will unveil Australia's 1994/95 budget.

Gold Fields Mineral Services publishes its annual survey of the gold market. Traders will scan it eagerly for a price forecast - something not always included. GFMS, which is financially backed by two big producers, last year suggested that gold would range between USDollars 370 and Dollars 400 a troy ounce, which turned out to be remarkably accurate. Tilting at chessmen The Verenigde Spaarbank chess tournament is played in Amsterdam until 18 May. Short won this annual invitation for the world's top grandmasters in 1991, 1992 and 1993, but now faces Kasparov. Other entrants are Timman (Netherlands) and Ivanchuk (Ukraine). Karpov has refused to play.

A group from the collection of Meshulam Riklis, a US businessman, includes a picturesque Monet, estimated at up to Dollars 7m, and a Modigliani portrait with a Dollars 6m tag. From another private collection comes a Gauguin landscape of Pont-Aven, also expected to make Dollars 7m. If the sale goes well, the art market recovery will have been confirmed. Holidays South Africa. WEDNESDAY Yeltsin visits Germany Russia's President Boris Yeltsin (left) arrives for an official visit to Germany (to May 13). Among the items on the agenda will be the question of appropriate ceremonials for the departure of Russian troops from Berlin in the summer. Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to ask parliament to postpone the June presidential elections. Although Mr Kravchuk has registered as a candidate, he fears a 'vacuum of power' in the country if elections are held before the parliament - recently elected and politically divided - is well-established and a post-Soviet constitution passed. UK economy Attention will be focused on the pace of recovery again with the release of March's output data. Analysts predict the figures will show that the corporate recovery is still in reasonable shape, though continuing at a more moderate rate. Manufacturing figures are expected to show a 2.4 per cent year-on-year increase and a 0.2 per cent month-on-month rise - down from 0.8 per cent in February. Industrial production is expected to show a 0.2 per cent rise, down from 0.8 per cent in February.

Holidays Sweden (Eve of Ascension). THURSDAY Japan's bonsai government Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, is due to take parliamentary questions on Tuesday's policy speech today and tomorrow. His opponents intend to give him a grilling. They are determined to vote his minority government out of power soon after this year's budget is passed, probably in June. The Social Democratic Party, which recently walked out of the coalition over an attempt to squeeze it out of policy making, will seize on last week's debacle when Mr Hata's justice minister had to resign after saying that one of the worst Japanese atrocities, the 1937 massacre of Nanking, never happened.

The Silver Institute, a producer-backed organisation based in Washington, releases its annual survey of the world silver market. It is likely to suggest that silver demand outpaced supply by as much as 250m troy ounces in 1993, the fourth successive year that the market was in deficit. This has been possible because consumers have been able to dig into the huge stocks that have been depressing prices for many years. Cannes film festival The 47th Cannes film festival gets under way, though this year it may be more of a coterie spree on the Cote d'Azur (to May 23). Hollywood is keeping its big films away, in reported annoyance at flag-waving French protectionism during Gatt. In compensation, there are many fresh names from countries which have less developed movie industries, including Peru, Tunisia, Taiwan, Mexico and Romania - and a nation some think qualifies for its own place on a third-world movie map, Great Britain. Norway's prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, is to receive the Charlemagne Prize at a ceremony in Aachen in recognition of her efforts for social justice and the enhancement of European co-operation.

Major will try to rally the faithful for the European parliament elections on June 9, keenly aware that another catastrophic defeat could end his premiership. He will also want to put fresh heart into the demoralised Scottish Tories, who fared even worse in the local elections than their English and Welsh colleagues. Grenadian embassy The US Congress must decide by today whether to overrule a State Department plan to close the US embassy on Grenada. President Reagan sent 7,000 troops to oust a leftwing government on the Caribbean island in October 1983.

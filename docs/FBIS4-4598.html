			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Yi Mong-ho, head of the  DPRK Parliamentary Union delegation, speaking at the 91st  conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on March 25,  warned that the United States should be held entirely  responsible for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by  its war moves.    Recalling that although four steps of simultaneous action  were agreed upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York in  February, the U.S. side has fulfilled none of its obligations,  leaving its promise an empty word, he said:    "The United States frustrated the third round of DPRK-USA  talks with the far-fetched argument that the inspection of the  DPRK by the International Atomic Energy Agency was not  satisfactory, and decided to deploy Patriot missiles in South  Korea, threatening the resumption of 'Team Spirit' joint  military exercises.    "We will not regard it as our duty any longer to guarantee  the continuity of safeguards since the United States and the  IAEA intentionally distorted the results of inspection for the  continuity of safeguards and are abusing them as an excuse for  increasing pressure on our Republic.    "The attempt of the United States and some Western countries  to put pressure on us through the UN Security Council hampers a  complete solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  and compels us to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT).    "We will have no other choice but to carry into practice the  measures laid down in the March 12, 1993, statement of the  government of our Republic in order to defend the national  sovereignty and security of the country.    "A grave situation which may lead to confrontation and war  has been created on the Korean peninsula again, and it is our  stand to answer dialogue with dialogue, war with war under such  situation."    Speaking at the conference that day, a member of the DPRK  Parliamentary Union delegation said the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula must be solved through DPRK-USA talks because  it is the United States that introduced nuclear weapons into  South Korea and has threatened the DPRK and invented a fiction  of "suspected nuclear development" of the North.    "Pressure, threat and sanctions can neither be a solution to  the problem, nor will they work with our people," he stressed.</p>

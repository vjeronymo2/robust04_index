			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OFFSPRING OF TIAN AN MEN;  </P> <P> ALMOST A REVOLUTION BY SHEN TONG WITH MARIANNE YEN (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95;  342 PP.);  </P> <P> CHINA'S CRISIS, CHINA'S HOPE; ESSAYS FROM AN INTELLECTUAL IN EXILE BY LIU  BINYAN TRANSLATED BY HOWARD GOLDBLATT (HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $22.50; 150  PP.);  </P> <P> CHINA MISPERCEIVED; AMERICAN ILLUSIONS AND CHINESE REALITY BY STEVEN W. MOSHER  (BASIC BOOKS: $22.95; 245 PP.)  </P> <P> Shen Tong was at home in central Beijing, just footsteps from the stretch of  Changan Avenue that would see the heaviest casualties, when the shooting began  on the night of June 3, 1989. For a moment, like many others, he assumed that  the soldiers spraying gunfire were using rubber bullets. Then came the  intolerable recognition. "People who had been hit fell to the ground and lay  still. 'Those people are dead,' I thought to myself. 'The bullets are real.' I  couldn't believe it. It was as if this were all happening in a dream."  </P> <P> Shen Tong's impulsive response was to reason with the soldiers, one of whom  seemed barely 18 and disoriented. " 'You are on Changan Avenue. Do you know the  history of Changan Avenue? . . . You are the People's Liberation Army and  you're shooting your own people.' " An uncle interrupted his final effort at  dialogue and dragged Shen Tong away. Then a shot rang out from the officer's  pistol that seconds before had pointed at him. Shen Tong looked back to see the  girl who had stood beside him lying on the ground, a bloody hole where her face  had been.  </P> <P> Within days, Shen Tong was in the United States, his escape route necessarily  undisclosed. He began classes at Brandeis University in a daze. "I was free,  but I longed for home almost like a sickness." Writing "Almost a Revolution,"  with the help of Washington Post reporter Marianne Yen, provided one means of  expiating his grief and also of bearing witness to those left behind, the  countless students, workers and ordinary citizens who had similarly risked  their lives only to face months of fear and the threat of reprisals.  </P> <P> Shen Tong's gripping account of the tense but exhilarating 56 days that  preceded the democracy movement's bloody suppression takes us behind the scenes  of angry protesters and gaunt hunger strikes captured by Western television  cameras. The story is one of heroism but also of discord and disarray.  </P> <P> As head of the Dialogue Delegation attempting to wrest concessions from  Communist Party leaders, Shen Tong was central to the struggle that would  determine China's fate. He was at the same time a college junior, not yet 21,  uncertain of his own judgment, unable to achieve a consensus with a shifting  cast of student leaders, and under constant pressure from his parents to leave  for the safety of study abroad.  </P> <P> The tragic denouement of China's democracy spring has produced numerous  eyewitness reports but none as yet by a key student leader. "Almost a  Revolution" is compelling not just because of Shen Tong's inside knowledge of  the movement and its discontents but also because of its autobiographical  candor.  </P> <P> Liu Binyan's "China's Crisis, China's Hope: Essays from an Intellectual in  Exile," translated with characteristic grace and skill by Howard Goldblatt,  probes the roots rather than the unfolding of the 1989 democracy movement.  Forty years ago, Liu participated enthusiastically in the student movement that  led to the founding of the People's Republic. He eagerly joined the Communist  Party but refused to abandon his spirit of independent inquiry. Such failure to  conform to officially established modes of thought was anathema to the  revolution's leaders who, once in power, replaced the glowing ideals of a  promised "new democracy" with the repressive practices of a "democratic  dictatorship."  </P> <P> Branded an enemy of the people and expelled from the party in 1957, Liu was  sent to the countryside to reform himself through physical labor. Two decades  of persecution followed, but when political verdicts were reversed and  intellectuals rehabilitated in 1978, Liu was made a special correspondent for  the official mouthpiece, People's Daily.  </P> <P> His bold investigative reporting revealed abuses of power, inspiring readers  long accustomed to a press that concealed the arrogance, corruption and  mismanagement of their leaders. In 1987, Liu again was dismissed from the  Communist Party, and a year later, he arrived in the United States, the door to  his homeland closed as tightly to him as to those like Shen Tong who fled in  the wake of the Tian An Men suppression.  </P> <P> The publication of his essays, originally delivered as lectures at Harvard  University in 1988-89, prompts a reexamination for the post-Mao decade. During  the same years that scholars, businessmen and tourists from the West were  applauding China's discovery of the capitalist road, economic and social  problems spread with alarming speed. Inflation, corruption, unemployment,  bureaucratic profiteering, the destruction of the natural environment, the  pressure of an insupportable population and the disappearance of any shared  moral values had all become apparent by 1983, he asserts, and pervasive by  1985. This created a "puzzlement, pessimism and indignation felt by people all  over China . . . a phenomenon very much worth examining, for it is  unprecedented in recent Chinese history -- never have I seen this sort of  despair."  </P> <P> Out of such despair, Liu Binyan argued presciently in 1988, would appear the  seeds of hope. His description of the discontent that finally triggered  democracy demonstrations in more than 80 cities in 1983 resonates poignantly in  the midst of the post-Tian An Men repression. "They believe they are powerless  to improve the state of affairs or to exert any influence; they are helpless,  their hands are tied. The natural consequence of this state of helplessness is  that great numbers of people have sunk into despondence. But it can also be a  call to action for other people to reform the system."  </P> <P> "The life expectancy of this government cannot be long," he asserts in "Deng's  Pyrrhic Victory," one of two essays written after the Tian An Men tragedy.  "Party Central has found out that in nearly all its subordinate organs, party  cadres are covering up for activists in the democracy movement. As the leaders'  impotence has become manifest, they find fewer and fewer people to trust, and  they are resorting to increasingly fascist methods."  </P> <P> To expose Americans' persistent and willful ignorance of the Chinese Communist  Party's fascist methods is Steven W. Mosher's purpose in "China Misperceived:  American Illusions and Chinese Reality." For him as for Liu Binyan, the Tian An  Men tragedy confirms widespread "disaffection from the Communist system that  Mao had midwived." Otherwise, this ambitious and perhaps intentionally abrasive  survey of American attitudes toward China shares little common ground with the  books described above. In fact, Mosher's insightful catalogue of errors seems  as much the product of personal pique as of scholarly acumen.  </P> <P> The reason is not difficult to fathom. "China Misperceived" presents Mosher's  answer to the academic and journalistic community that spurned him. Criticized  in 1979 by the Chinese government for professional misconduct during a year of  anthropological field work, he then was investigated by Stanford University and  ultimately denied a Ph.D. degree. The insult has not been forgotten.  </P> <P> Mosher contends that from the time of the Nixon visit in 1972 and throughout  the 1980s, scholars and journalists, businessmen and tourists were gulled by  the Communist Party's stagecraft into a "charitable reading" of the Beijing  regime. Having recognized the true face of Chinese Communism himself long  before 1989, he cannot conceal his derision at those who discovered only after  the democracy movement's suppression that party leaders were capable of cruelty  and terror.  </P> <P> American reporters flocked to Beijing, he explains, and then, "from the  sanctuary of their hotels," described events in the streets as a blood bath and  a slaughter "without on-the-scene confirmation." This "sudden eagerness to  believe the worst of Beijing" shows that "the American media had switched  sides; or rather, it had discovered there was another side." Mosher's contempt  for such naivete is searing. The destruction of the " 'fantasy world' that had  been home to a large and flourishing population of China-watchers before the  massacre" is long overdue, he writes.  </P> <P> Mosher has contributed importantly to an understanding of the pendulum swings  in "America's intense and long-running emotional involvement with China."  However, his book is less successful in illuminating what he broadly terms  Chinese reality. The "revolt of the Red Guards," to take one example, is  dispensed with in two pages of generalizations about the decade-long Cultural  Revolution.  </P> <P> Mosher asserts at the outset that "the observer who recognizes and declares his  viewpoint up front is likely to produce a more unbiased account than someone  whose own position goes unstated." However, it is the substantiation of his own  guiding belief in the malevolence of communism, not the clarification of  historical inaccuracies, that seems Mosher's abiding goal. Thus while he  usefully unveils "the scholarly pettifoggery to which the absence of reliable  data about China drove even widely respected Sinologists," one cannot but think  that he may someday want to glance in his own mirror.  </P></p>

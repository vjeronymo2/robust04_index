			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Jochen Siemens: "Partnership for Peace"] </F>   [Text] Lasting peace and security in the European house  cannot be implemented without Russia's involvement and  cooperation. This is a fact. It is also a lesson of history  that remains valid in the current search for new security policy  concepts. We should not miss the opportunity to bear this  lesson in mind without surrendering to its -- currently utopian  -- implications. That is why at the NATO summit in Brussels on  10 and 11 January, the 16 members will not reproach one another  for having a "Russia first" approach to security policy and for  betraying the legitimate interests of NATO's East European  neighbors, or for pursuing the old way of thinking and intending  to isolate Russia by extending NATO to the Belarusian or  Ukrainian border.    Rather it is important to bring clarity into the discussion.  One should not promise more than one can deliver. The NATO  members, in particular the United States, are currently not  ready to extend the security guarantees of the NATO treaty to  new members. But this is what Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Hungary, and Lithuania mean when they ask for  membership within the alliance. It would not be serious to  believe that any promises to this effect could currently be  enforced in the alliance. What is important in a military  alliance -- if anything -- is dependability. A NATO that gives  guarantees it knows it cannot implement had better dissolve  itself.    It is equally hypocritical of the applicant members to  stress  that their planned NATO membership is not directed against  Russia. No matter how loquaciously and elegantly it is adorned,  the East Europeans -- historically misused by Russia, Germany,  and the Habsburg Empire -- are seeking protection against Russia  within NATO, because no one can predict today whether Russia  will be able to successfully continue its development toward an  open, democratic society.    That is why it is important in the present situation to do  one thing, without failing to do the other thing. Just as it  would be wrong to promise more than one can deliver, it would  also be wrong to offer the East European neighbors less than is  possible and necessary. That is why we must expect the NATO  summit to define the offers of cooperation with the East  Europeans, mentioned in the Partnership for Peace concept, as  specifically as possible. The core and value of NATO are its  military organization, its command structures, and its  logistics. The task in the next few years will be to further  this organization's cooperation with the military of the Eastern  neighbors, ranging from the exchange of ambassadors and staffs  and common military exercises, to the alignment of  communications structures. It is also conceivable to make  military reconnaissance facilities available to the East  Europeans. All this must be regulated by agreement, while  association with the Western European Union [WEU] must be pushed  and membership of the East Europeans within the European Union  [EU] must be kept in mind.    Given this large number of concrete options, it is possible  to meet the applicants' understandable wish not to get stuck in  a gray zone of promises that are intended never to be fulfilled.  At the same time, however, NATO also serves its own interests.  In a world in which the lion will never lie down with the lamb,  NATO must keep its own inner coherence in mind. Its members'  military budgets and troop strengths are drastically decreasing.  The alliance must cope with this and remain effective  nevertheless; it must also keep the relationship between Europe  and North America close and strong.    Binding the East Europeans more specifically to NATO, the  WEU, and the EU will strengthen the democratic processes in  these countries without dragging the West, through security  guarantees, into unpredictable minority conflicts and border  disputes. Human rights and border guarantees in and between  applicant countries must be settled prior to the enlargement of  NATO. The example of Turkey and Greece has shown NATO the  problems with which an alliance may otherwise be confronted.    Finally, a concretely defined Partnership for Peace will  also  meet the criteria of a policy that keeps options toward Russia  open. It can only be in the interests of NATO and the applicant  countries that Russia continues to develop as a democratic, open  society. It would be wrong to give the people and political  forces the impression that the West wanted to isolate Russia.  Russia can only isolate itself by once again getting on  imperialist tracks that threaten borders and neighbors. It is  right and legitimate for us to brace ourselves for such a  danger. This is accomplished by closer cooperation with the  East Europeans. Until such a danger emerges, however, we must  not create new bogeymen, but build the European house through  common effort.</p>

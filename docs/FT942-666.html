			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cortecs International shares to begin trading Cortecs International, the Australian registered biotechnology company whose operations are based in the UK, will see its shares start trading in London today after raising Pounds 10.6m through an international share placing. The company announced plans for a placing with UK institutions in March, but was caught by the downturn in the new issues market. It cut the offer price by about 15 per cent and widened the net to include international investors, who have taken up some 70 per cent of the new shares. The placing was handled by West Merchant Bank and Henry Cooke Corporate Finance. Mr Glen Travers, chairman, blamed the weak response on general market conditions rather than any problems with the biotechnology sector in particular. 'We had a good feedback from institutions, who liked the fact that we had current products generating cashflow to help fund our research programme.' Last week Cortecs launched a cheap and fast-acting diagnostic kit in the UK for the detection of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium now acknowledged to be a common cause of peptic ulcers. Cortecs incurred a loss of ADollars 10.6m (Pounds 5m) in 1993 on turnover of ADollars 11.6m after research and development spending of ADollars 7.02m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Fascism Ended With  Mussolini"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Guiglia] Silvio Berlusconi  [Forza Italia leader] has announced that a "guarantor" will be  instituted. Are we to have a guardian angel for the prime  minister?    [Fini] Absolutely not. The idea of having a "vigilante"  stems from the fact that there will be no professional  politicians at the Palazzo Chigi [government seat] and because a  Left unleashed is insinuating that private interests will be  intertwined with political activities.    [Guiglia] But who will guarantee the guarantor?    [Fini] Clearly one cannot think of making a law nor of  "coming to an agreement on" a sentry-candidate here. It is a  problem of political expediency; the leader of Forza Italia will  have to indicate a person who will be neither a loyal  collaborator nor a known adversary. However, the role of the  guarantor in effectively separating economic and political  acitivities will last a few days: from the formation of the new  government up to the vote of confidence in parliament. Then it  will be the government team that will guarantee [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi's "transparency."    [Guiglia] Berlusconi wants to open up to the People's Party  [PPI], the Pact for Italy, the autonomists. Do you not think  that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] is being a little too  ecumenical.    [Fini] He is right to open up to others, but he must not do  it in an indiscriminate way. There is only one central point:  presenting himself to the entire, not individual members, will  make opposition by certain moderate forces difficult.    [Guiglia] Andreatta [lower house floor leader] of the  People's Party is turning the issue upside down by saying to  Berlusconi: If we join, Fini must leave the executive. Do you  fear that the alliance will be overturned?    [Fini] I bought a calender and an abacus for Andreatta. If  he looks at the calender he will realize that he has 25 April  mixed up with 25 March when the election campaign was in full  swing. He will have an even more bitter shock with the abacus:  Even by putting together the whole of the PPI [Italian People's  Party], the Pact for Italy, the Republicans, Liberals,  Socialists, pensioners, and housewives, Andreatta will not  succeed in obtaining the number of parliamentarians that  National Alliance has. And he will continue to suffer through  this abstention from power.    [Guiglia] [Northern League leader] Bossi stated that  federalism can wait. Is this a joke or a "major turning point"  in the Northern League?    [Fini] I consider it to be a very wise move. I hope that it  will be confirmed over the next few days when we draw up  programs. The government must reconfirm its commitment to  reforming the model of the state without proposing a compulsory  institutional model. The whole of parliament must be called  upon to discuss the rules of the game. Also, there must be a  referendum in which the Italian people decide what sort of Italy  they want.    [Guiglia] Are you not afraid of being politically squashed  between Berlusconi and Bossi?    [Fini] Nobody can mistake National Alliance' responsible  attitude for -- how can I put it? -- docility. We have decided  not to raise controversies and push for this or that seat.  Those who voted for us must know that we are going to govern  and remain loyal to our commitments. Two in particular: the  unity of Italy and solidarity between north and south.    [Guiglia] Bossi is laying claim to the Viminale [Interior  Ministry]. What does Fini lay claim to?    [Fini] I lay claim to the right not to issue vetoes or  prejudicial ultimatums over one or the other ministry. Bossi is  wrong to do so because vetoes lead inevitably to the Cencelli  manual [former Christian Democratic power-sharing method]. The  prime minister will choose the ministers.    [Guiglia] How about [President] Scalfaro resigning: no, or  not yet?    [Fini] No. The president is showing that he is capable of  promoting the passage from the first to the second republic.    [Guiglia] According to Nolte, the German historian, you are  set to become "Mussolini's modern heir" by proposing  "nontotalitarian fascism." Do you subscribe to this analysis?    [FIni] That just shows historians do not always perceive  political events correctly. There is no fascism,  "constitutional" or otherwise, around the corner. Fascism was  born, grew, and died with its creator Mussolini. I will soon go  on a tour of Europe's capitals and the United States to explain  the great Italian innovation called the National Alliance.  Liberty and justice must be the cardinal values of the second  republic and democracy the only means of affirming them.</p>

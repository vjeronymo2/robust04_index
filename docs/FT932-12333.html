			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / New Aomori facility revives nuclear debate CONSTRUCTION of a controversial Japanese nuclear reprocessing facility began yesterday, prompting fresh debate over the government's ambitious plans to use large amounts of plutonium for a new generation of nuclear plants. After a traditional Shinto ceremony, ground was broken for the Y840bn (Pounds 4bn) facility at Rokkasho, in the northern prefecture of Aomori, adjacent to a nuclear waste storage site and a uranium enrichment plant which are the centrepiece of Japan's nuclear programme. The recent accident at the Tomsk-7 plutonium facility in Russia, and a confession by the Russian navy that it routinely dumped nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan, have heightened sensitivities. After the Tomsk-7 incident, the Japanese Science and Technology Agency sent officials to reassure the Aomori government, which is generally supportive of the nuclear development plans. The agency argues that Japan is resource-poor, and must build a reprocessing plant to safeguard long-term energy supplies. However, Japan has been quietly reviewing the plutonium policy since international outcry late last year over its shipment of a tonne of plutonium from France. About 30 tonnes are due to be shipped to Japan from the UK and France over the next 15 years. The imported plutonium, derived from the processing of Japanese waste, is intended for use in a fast-breeder reactor that is still under development. Anti-nuclear groups complain that the perfection of the reactor is not assured. On completion in 2000, the reprocessing facility will be able to handle about 800 tonnes of spent fuel annually from 30 nuclear plants and produce about 5 tons of plutonium for use in the fast-breeder plants. Japan has 41 nuclear plants, and wants to build 40 more by 2010, but that goal has been put out of reach by strong opposition from residents around the proposed sites. Mr Masaya Kitamura, Aomori's governor, said yesterday the plant would not harm residents, and would add to the wealth of the prefecture. But the Aomori Young Fisherman's Association said the government had ignored fears that the facility could endanger the farming and fishing industries.</p>

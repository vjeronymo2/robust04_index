			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michael Heseltine, British secretary of </F> state for trade and industry, by correspondent Nobuyuki Sakai in  London on 2 April]    [Text] [Sakai] The United States has been pressing Japan  to set numerical targets to rectify the trade imbalance.    [Heseltine] It is apparent that worsening relations between  the two economic giants will bring benefits to nobody.  Solutions to trade problems should be sought in GATT  multilateral trade negotiations. I rate highly Japan's  concessions in the GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  talks because they greatly contributed to the successful  conclusion of the talks.    [Sakai] How do you assess Japan's market-opening efforts?    [Heseltine] Japan is still a protectionist nation. It  should open its door wider to investments and trade. Its  discriminatory tariffs on Scotch whisky is a good example. It  is also very difficult for foreign companies to gain access to  the Japanese trading market unless they are associated with  major Japanese trading firms through capital participation.  Japan entered the world market in the 1860's and integrated its  more controlled society and culture with a capitalistic system.  I think the capitalistic system in Japan is different from  capitalism.    [Sakai] Do you meet opposition from bureaucrats to  deregulation?    [Heseltine] Yes, some of them are opposed to deregulation.  But we intend to keep intact regulations related to health care,  the environment, and social affairs. What should be abolished  are the regulations that prevent creativity and investments. It  is also important for the administration to have bureaucrats  constantly review their own structure according to changes.  What politicians should decide is whether the government should  promote deregulation while placing priority on the benefits of  manufacturers or those of consumers and markets.    [Sakai] Against the wishes of Honda Motor Company, British  Rover Group is to be acquired by BMW of Germany.    [Heseltine] I understand how Honda feels. But the future  success of Rover Group will be advantageous to Honda in auto  parts supply. I hope other parts suppliers also should not have  negative feeling. Forty-one percent of Japan's entire  investments in Europe are made in Britain. Japanese companies  are welcomed here. I think they are fully aware of their  capability to manufacture competitive products.    [Sakai] The sale of Rover Group to BMW means that Britain  entrusts automobile production to a foreign country.    [Heseltine] Britain has also a large share in possessions  and management of major European companies. Industrial  nationalism is now less important compared to the past.</p>

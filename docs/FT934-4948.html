			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sales gain at SHL fails to offset costs of revamp SHL Systemhouse, a fast-growing North American computer service outsourcing group, posted an 18 per cent gain in fourth-quarter sales, to CDollars 225m (USDollars 169m). However, losses continued and heavy special charges reflected a broad reorganisation. At the operating level, the loss for the three months to August 31 was CDollars 8.6m against a profit of CDollars 600,000 a year earlier. However, the final net loss after special charges was CDollars 149m, or CDollars 2.92 a share, against a loss of CDollars 7.4m, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. For the full year, the final net loss was CDollars 145m, or CDollars 3.09, on fewer shares outstanding, against a loss of CDollars 9.5m, or 25 cents. Revenues were CDollars 913m, up 24 per cent. SHL is moving out of mainframe-based systems to concentrate on network computing based on workstation technology. The special charge to cover the restructuring required totalled CDollars 135m. Delays in signing and starting work on several large new contracts also adversely affected results. The order backlog at August 31 was CDollars 1.5bn, double the year-earlier level, and including a large Canada Post outsourcing contract. SHL says it is now concentrating on building profitability.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Portfolio has a price - Briefcase, Q&amp;A In September 1993, I was given a considerable share portfolio. 1. What tax liability does this entail for the donor and myself? 2. What is the position regarding letting of rooms in a house which is being part-purchased by a mortgage of some 30 per cent of its value. Is it necessary to notify the mortgage company that some rooms are being let, and will the lettings have any implications for insuring the property and contents? 1. The donor is liable to pay capital gains tax as though he had sold the shares to you at their respective market values on the day of the gift. Correspondingly, you will be treated (for CGT purposes) as though you had bought the shares on that day at the market values. No doubt the donor will let you have a list of the agreed values after his CGT liability (if any) has been settled. There will be no inheritance tax liability unless the donor dies before the seventh anniversary of the gift. (This reply is based on the assumption that all the shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and that the donor is resident (and ordinarily resident) in the UK and domiciled in one of its three constituent countries). 2. You will find that your mortgage agreement obliges you to notify the lender of any intention to let part of the property; and you will find that your insurance policy (contents section) obliges you to notify the insurer before allowing any third party to live in the house. (We are a little puzzled, however, that you wrote to us, rather than simply reading the documents). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

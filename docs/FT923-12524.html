			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Renault and Peugeot in recycling venture RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, and Peugeot, its private sector rival, have agreed to join forces in car recycling. The pair are to co-operate in what will be France's largest car recycling plant at Athis Mons, south of Paris, based at an existing scrap metal crushing plant owned by Compagnie Francaise des Ferrailles, a federation of metal crushing and treatment groups. The plant will recover recyclable materials from 200 cars per day and produce a mixture of re-usable components - fluids such as oil and brake fluid, plastic and rubber granulates for the construction industry and plastic foam for insulation of buildings. However, this will be a small proportion of the 2m cars scrapped in France annually. Renault and Peugeot have agreed to share research into recycling methods and to study a joint waste collection scheme to collect recyclable materials such as used plastic bumpers from their dealer networks. Both groups have operated separate pilot recycling plants, where they have researched the most efficient ways of dismantling old cars to make the best use of materials. Peugeot claims to be able to recycle 95 per cent of the content of disused cars at a pilot plant near Lyons, operated with Compagnies Francaise des Ferrailles and Ciments Vicat, the Paris-based cement group. However, the plant capacity is 16 vehicles per day. Renault has a test recycling centre at its Flins assembly plant near Paris.</p>

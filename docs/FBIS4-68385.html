			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. I. Starikov, by CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY </F> correspondent Yu. Kormiltsev, Magnitogorsk, under rubric  "Economy": "Anatoliy Starikov: `Don't Patch Up the Holes, but  Make Decisions in a State Way'']    [Text] Five years ago the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical  Combine bathed in the rays of glory. The first-born child of  socialist industry continued to surprise people with its  record-breaking successes. Just think, it used to produce 16  million tons of steel a year! More than any European  country.    Today the world's largest combine, like the entire  metallurgical industry in Russia, is in a difficult situation.  Entry into the civilized market proved to be no simple matter.  In this situation nothing will help -- not the former merits,  not the decorations awarded, not the high-sounding titles. Every  enterprise is fated to take its own path in getting to the  market. The reform also required that the MMK [Magnitogorsk  Metallurgical Combine] administrators think about economics in a  new way, take different approaches than they had in the past,  and display new talents. This was the topic of a conversation  that our correspondent had with Anatoliy Ilich Starikov, general  director of the "MMK" AO [joint-stock company] and president of  the Chelyabinsk Oblast Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs.    [Kormiltsev] It is unusual to hear reproachful statements  directed at our metallurgists. Because your plans and production  orders always used to be fulfilled with enviable constancy. But  currently either the prices have risen unexpectedly, or the raw  materials have not been paid for promptly. Of course, everyone  is having a difficult time. But for such a giant as MMK, things  certainly should be a bit easier, shouldn't they?    [Starikov] Everything is not so simple. Let's recall  history.. At one time a very catchy jingle was born here: "We'll  run ourselves ragged, but we won't let down Magnitka" [rhymes in  Russian]. We ran ourselves ragged during the entire war. And  even later. Properly speaking, things never were easy. After  all, we operated on imported raw materials practically all our  life. Nevertheless we had the highest profitability level -- 28  percent. That was twice as high as, for example, the level in  Lipetsk at that time.    It is another matter that, while giving its all to the  Motherland, Magnitka gradually lagged behind with regard to the  qualitative specifications of the metal. The equipment was  wearing out, and the assemblies were getting old... Also, iron  gets tired. You cannot master the latest technologies just by  shouting "hurray!" And so, even if you were a three-time patriot  at your beloved enterprise, if you do not renew the technology,  sooner or later everything will begin to fall apart.    At one time a long-term program for the remodeling of the  combine was prepared. But certain events occurred, and we proved  to be "thrown overboard," outside the state programs.    Well, the market will not accept emotions, and former  enthusiasm will not save us. This is a stern and mobile conveyor  belt where, from day to day, there is a merciless struggle for  survival. But how can we survive if, all of a sudden, everyone  has proven to be debtors -- not only the producers, but also the  consumers? The unprecedented crisis of nonpayments, according to  certain pundits, is just a demand crisis. So they begin --excuse  me for speaking so sharply -- brainwashing everyone, telling  them, "You're producing the wrong kind of output, that your  partners just do not need." That's demagoguery! The reason for  the production slump is not the law of demand for our metal.    The combine's fixed assets today have been supporting a  workload of only 56 percent. But worldwide practice says that if  they have a workload of less than 80 percent, their use is  inefficient. We were forced to stop, for example, two  coke-chemical batteries: because of a shortage of coal we are  converting the remaining ones to an operational mode that  removes the graphite from the walls, and this leads to the  premature wearing out of the furnaces, so that, consequently,  their service life is reduced by half. What will this lead to?  To a disaster. Those are the conditions we are working in. Now  is it understandable why our combine does not always succeed in  being a reliable partner? And the fact that thousands of other  enterprises are in the same situation is small solace for us.    [Kormiltsev] Do you mean, then, that we are yielding our  positions?    [Starikov] We maneuver, and sometimes we retreat, but we do  not give up! We are not sitting idly by. The market has made  harsher demands on all the services, and has also new things to  worry about. Let me return again to history. To a certain  degree, things were not really too bad for us previously, before  the reforms. The ministry, Gosplan, and Gossnab assumed many  functions. The state used to provide us with raw materials and  production orders, and with equipment. There was an opportunity  to engage deeply in the development of technological innovations  and to experiment. It was for good reason that Magnitka used to  be called a nationwide school for advanced experience.    But then the centralized supply and distribution  disappeared.  The market arrived. Suddenly there appeared the acute need to  change the way we thought about the economy. Beginning with the  enterprise director and ending with the packer. We cannot  produce even a single ton of unordered metal! It is, essentially  speaking, a revolutionary task. There are no sales for the old  steel. And if there is no sale of the output, there is no money.  And the only people we can blame are ourselves. The consumer  psychology has to be changed as quickly as possible. We must not  run around in confusion, or act nervously, but we must calmly  analyze our own capabilities, of which I feel there are many.    [Kormiltsev] So where did you begin?    [Starikov] We begun from where we had been burned. With  economic independence. It is not a matter of a fashionable  slogan. We actually need economic independence. But who needs  it, and to what degree? You cannot understand what the market is  by analyzing other people's mistakes. It is necessary to feel  the market with your own hands, to experience it, because most  administrators have become accustomed to thinking and doing  something "from this point to that point," knowing that the  plant administration will be able to correct any distortion or  bad decision. But it is necessary for each of them to be not  only an efficient executor, but also an intelligent conveyor of  market ideology.    Putting it more succinctly, we have created a number of  daughter enterprises. We have written out their functional  duties. We attempted to provide for many things. But the  spontaneous situation in the market proved to be stronger than  our good intentions. The old psychology is like residual  magnetism. For that reason many of the subdivision  administrators felt that the market relations are built only on  buying and selling. Apparently their head was spinning from the  complete liberalization of prices, by the fact that today no one  from the top is requiring detailed reports, that everyone is his  own boss, and that you can turn any way you want to.    For a long time it was necessary to explain things and even  to spoil the relations with certain "market experts." It is  necessary to engage not in speculation, but in the organizing of  labor, in trade, and to learn how to live in the new economic  situation.    Management is not the primitive buying and selling of  output.  It is possible to be victorious over your rival in the market  not by asking a high price, but, on the contrary, by asking a  lower one. But in order to do this it is necessary to  construction all your work in a new way.    I will say honestly that we have not yet become completely  successful in breaking the market primitivism, or that peculiar  kind of self-seeking attitude. Although much has been done in  this direction: we have had the training of personnel,  familiarity with foreign practice, and we have invited foreign  specialists here. Nevertheless we have not yet succeeded in  bringing to a conclusion everything that was planned.    But since 1 April all the production subdivisions that are  linked with the production of metal have been united into the  lead plant on the basis of cost accountability.    [Kormiltsev] The daughter enterprises have forced you to  take  a different look at the process of managing the combine.  Currently there have been many discussions about the functions  of the plant administration, and about renewing them. What is  the significance of this?    [Starikov] We are opposed to a simplified understanding of  the sale of output. The combine is not a flea market where the  main slogan is "buying and selling" at any cost. We are in favor  of a civilized market that saturates society with the output  that it needs. And it is necessary to predict the market. For  five years ahead or even more. We are required to know what is  awaiting us tomorrow. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a  marketing service. A combine is a cumbersome thing. It is  difficult to rock it. But it is also difficult to stop it. The  forces of inertia can drag you down a blind alley.    That is why the work with personnel occupies absolutely the  first place with us. Previously we relied on professionalism.  We wanted the steelmaker to be able to pour the steel better,  more effectively, and the roller to obtain the necessary rolled  shape, etc. Now the emphasis is on market knowledge. It is  becoming a vital necessity to consider the expenditures.  Otherwise you will be burnt to a crisp. Previously the financial  service lived its own life, a paper life that was comprehensible  to only a few people. But now the financiers are becoming the  leading specialists. That is what the analysts must also be. And  it is our duty to organize the work of that service properly.    And what about credit? To tell the truth, prior to the  reform  we had a rather confused idea about credit. Why was that? The  party and the government make the decision, say, to build a  converter shop at Magnitka. The funds are allocated, the people  are sent out, and the contractors are designated. Today it's  different. You decide for yourself who you are going to call,  and to whom you are going to entrust the important project. You  yourself think what this will produce -- not only from the  production point of view, but also from the social and  ecological points of view. There is an entire range of questions  here, and each one requires careful study.    And questions of ownership? There continue to be unabated  disputes about the methods, means, and alternatives of  privatization. Some people assert that the managerial upper  layer is attempting quietly to grab as much as they can for  themselves, and to get rich at the expense of ordinary laborers.  Others feel that it is not worthwhile to hurry to buy shares...  It is obvious, however, that there has arrived for us a very  important period that previously was completely unknown to us  --it will be necessary for us to learn how to work with  securities, to penetrate more deeply into the wisdom of leasing,  trade, and cooperation with foreign companies. In each such area  it will be necessary to define one's position, and take a  cautious approach in planning a program of actions. Because once  the market has been declared to be state policy, it is necessary  to take a professional, state attitude toward it.    [Kormiltsev] Let's return to the real-life situation today.  Almost all the problems that you listed are linked with the  remodeling of the combine. Without that remodeling the  production of quality metal will not occur, and without metal  there will not be any decent wages, no social blessings, no  clean sky over Magnitka. The market is merciless competition.  Essentially speaking, the state has eliminated itself from the  leadership of the economy, and there will not be any sponsorship  of enterprises, such as we used to have. How, then, do you plan  to carry out the remodeling?    [Starikov] It is difficult to give any unambiguous answer. I  shall express my own point of view. The restructuring of  production in such a cumbersome thing as our combine requires a  tremendous amount of funds. Not a single enterprise of this kind  is capable of earning those funds independently. We shall not  speak about the historical debts that Magnitka has a right to  expect from the country, because Magnitka continues to "run  itself ragged." Let's see how similar problems are resolved in  the civilized countries.    The state there does not eliminate itself from large-scale  production. It is a subject of the market, its regulator. If it  is necessary to erect, for example, a one-of-a-kind mill or  shop, that question is resolved frequently not even at the level  of that state, but at the level of the European government. But  we suffer from an old disease: we rush from one extreme to  another. After rejecting total control of the economic sphere,  our state moved completely away from production. The enterprises  got unlimited freedom, and the economy remained all alone with  its own problems.    We traditionally consider ourselves to be monopolists in our  branch. But things are very, very difficult even for us. I feel  that only the state can introduce order in the rampant price  anarchy. Only the state can and must regulate the  interrelationships between the producers and the consumers. No,  I do not want to beg in a veiled manner to have the state give  us credit. I know that the Kremlin's treasury has been empty for  a long time. But the state can and must give a bank a guarantee  to cover the credit, because we are talking about the  restructuring of a base branch.    [Kormiltsev] Was the recent visit by a governmental  delegation headed by Oleg Soskovets reassuring in this regard?    [Starikov] I shall state outright that we attach fundamental  importance to that visit. We have prepared a program for the  development of the combine until the year 2000. There are two  directions in this strategy: the change in the technology of  production for producing only output that is capable of meeting  the competition, and, at the expense of that, diversification,  the creation of a machine-building complex and a construction  industry, and the further development of the production of  consumer goods. Understandably, these ideas require colossal  funds. Of course, we are earning some of them, by creating  joint-stock companies, and also at the expense of improving the  administration of production, the creation of more rigid demands  placed on the executors, the introduction of all kinds of  innovations, etc., in a word, by the expense of reducing all the  expenditures. But we are also counting on state support. And on  the attracting of foreign investments.    The governmental delegation visited very important projects  in the combine that are ready for activation. It was convinced  that we had undertaken a big task. The important guests saw with  their own eyes the condition to which the flagship in heavy  industry has been brought. Even the small balance-sheet profit  that was received last year was used not to develop the  enterprise, and not to implement the social program, but to  patch up holes, to assure elementary survival. It is necessary  to be realistic and understand that if, in the near future, we  do not build at the combine cold-rolling and hot-rolling mills  No. 2000, if we do not renew all of production, we will not be  able to withstand the competition with the West. And then,  alongside of the Snickers and Mars Bars, metal from Europe will  come to Russia's domestic market.    The state has allocated to us 11 billion rubles to complete  hot-rolling mill No. 2000. We have been promised assistance in  shifting the deadlines for paying part of our taxes and a  reduction in the customs duties on the bringing in of imported  equipment... In a word, the appropriate document concerning our  metallurgical combine is being prepared in Moscow.    Of course this is gratifying. But the same problems of  nonpayments, remodeling, and excessive taxes also confront the  metallurgists of Chelyabinsk, Zlatoust, and Asha, and the miners  and machine-builders. Consequently, it is necessary to resolve  them in a state manner, rather than on an individual basis, with  everyone taking his own chances of being successful.    [Kormiltsev] You have mentioned Western investments. Much  has  already been said about this in the press. Somehow it looks as  though the West is in no hurry to pull Russia out of its  economic blind alley.    [Starikov] Once again, everything is not so simple. I feel  that at the conference that, to state it outright, was very  important for us and that was organized at our combine by the  Moscow delegation, there were also shifts in this direction.  Foreign companies have their own well worked-out methods for  investing capital. Some of them are in no hurry to invest their  funds not only because the political situation in our country  still seems to them to be insufficiently stable, but also  because they need clear-cut guarantees that have been well known  for a long time in the West. For example, it is necessary to  give 25 percent of the shares to foreign investors. Naturally,  our economic managers immediately begin to think deeply about  this. There appears the fear that if foreign businessmen receive  the controlling block of shares, domestic industry will be  threatened by complete failure, all the social and ecological  programs will be discontinued, etc. But take, for example, the  Tulachermet joint-stock company. They have already sold a rather  large number of shares in their daughter enterprises to foreign  investors, and the people at the plant only won from this.    Incidentally, recently the president of a certain major  international company, speaking on behalf of an authoritative  foreign expert commission that had been studying the combine's  work, made a proposal concerning the sale to the company of a  block of our shares. I shall state outright that that was not  particularly to the liking of all of my associates. But I think  that it is time for us to make bolder use of the foreign  experience of privatizing major companies and enterprises. If  there are investments, the renovation will occur more rapidly.  Because, thank God, the metallurgists at Magnitka have always  known how to work.</p>

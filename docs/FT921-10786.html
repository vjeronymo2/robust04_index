			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GPG to send report and accounts late GPG, the investment company run by Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, will be sending its 1991 report and accounts to its UK and New Zealand shareholders three weeks later than the New Zealand Stock Exchange had stipulated. NZSE regulations required completion by January 31 and the London Stock Exchange by March 31. The company had intended to meet the earlier date but the preparation of the accounts on the basis of the new UK Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 1, as yet unadopted by the UK Accounting Standards Review Board, has taken longer than expected. The NZSE was informed of the likely delay on January 22 and a waiver was sought. It was denied.</p>

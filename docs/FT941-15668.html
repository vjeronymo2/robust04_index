			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pakhoed, Lambert Riviere in talks Pakhoed, the Dutch tank storage company, is negotiating to acquire Lambert Riviere, a French-based chemical distribution company with a market capitalisation of around FFr300m (Dollars 50m). The acquisition would give Pakhoed access to chemical warehouses and depots in southern Europe, expanding its geographical reach. Lambert Riviere, with turnover of FFr1.6bn and a workforce of 500 people, is also active in Italy, Spain and Portugal. The talks, expected to be completed by the end of March, are being conducted with the Halliez family and other shareholders who together own 80 per cent of Lambert Riviere's shares. Pakhoed said it would launch a public offer for the rest of the shares at the same price and conditions. Pakhoed, which is pursuing the acquisition through its associate company Univar, is already active in chemicals distribution in the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Singapore, Thailand and the US. The group's main activity is oil storage.</p>

Portov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok, 12 Jan -- A senior officer in the  Pacific Fleet Command in the Russian Far East revealed on 12  January that the Pacific Fleet Command plans to export four  Foxtrot-class submarines -- now deployed at Vladivostok Naval  Base -- to North Korea and that the contract on their sale has  already been been signed with North Korea.    The contract has been pushed on top secret instructions from  Navy headquarters in Moscow, and the price remains a secret.  Officially, North Korea says it will dismantle the submarines  and use the steel materials therefrom. But a source at Fleet  Command said North Korea could repair the submarines to create a  new submarine flotilla or use their parts to repair other  submarines.    The submarines were built in the 1960's. At present, they  belong to the Submarine Training Brigade and are docked in  Ussuri Bay.</p>

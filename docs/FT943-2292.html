			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Political uncertainty holds sway in Italy - Budget discussions may cloud the forthcoming results season The Italian stock market, like Italian newspaper headlines, sometimes seems to be just a noisy approximation of what is really happening. Milan's principal equity indices are no higher now than they were on the eve of the country's mould-breaking general election in March, in spite of the fact that Italy's quoted companies are about to publish evidence of real economic recovery in their half-year results. The main reason is that this year's Italian results season - although it will be the first for two or three years to bring predominantly good news - coincides with nervousness about the economic plans of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. Investors are preferring to focus on cabinet discussions of the country's budget for 1995, which must be completed by the end of the month. As one analyst puts it: 'The political uncertainty will prevail over the markets. It looks like any investment in Italian financial assets - lira, bonds or equities - has a precondition, and the precondition is: a good 1995 budget.' Privately, Italian entrepreneurs are frustrated by investors' emphasis on the fragile political situation. Whatever happens to the government, the news coming in from subsidiaries looks good, they say. Italian companies' half-year figures are difficult to forecast, and tricky to interpret. They are unaudited and usually published before tax, a notoriously unpredictable element in full-year results. There is room for some companies - financial and banking groups in particular - to exercise a certain amount of discretion about what they declare at the halfway stage. But there is a consensus among analysts that the big industrial companies will show in the next fortnight how they are reaping the rewards of restructuring, and, at last, making the most of a weak currency. 'Exporters are doing extremely well, and the recent weakness of the lira is helping this,' says Ms Sophie Blanpain, equity strategist with Credit Suisse First Boston in London. Four of Italy's biggest quoted industrial groups - Montedison, Fiat, Pirelli and Olivetti, for example - all recorded large net losses in 1993. But their interim results should demonstrate a marked improvement in trading, which is likely to be reflected also in the performance of smaller manufacturers, often dependent on the giants for their livelihood. Montedison, the chemicals, energy and agro-industrial group, has already announced a return to interim pre-tax profits for the first time since 1991. On Friday, the group, which came close to collapse last year, reported a pre-tax profit of L289bn (Dollars 185m) in the first half against a loss of L369bn in the equivalent period. The shares rose by 5 per cent immediately after the news was announced, although they slipped back later in the day. Fiat, the automotive and industrial group which last year recorded the biggest loss of its history, is expected to demonstrate towards the end of this month that it is on its way to making a profit in the full year, as forecast by Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman, at the group's annual meeting in June. The domestic market is still sluggish, in spite of the impact of the new Punto, now Italy's best-selling car, but the company has still managed to increase its market share in Italy and boost exports because of the weak currency. Recession has forced both Fiat and Pirelli, the cable and tyre manufacturer, to restructure. Pirelli, which should produce its results at the beginning of next week, reduced debt from L4,000bn in January 1992, to L2,000bn by June this year, closed 22 of the 102 factories in its core business and cut its workforce by 20 per cent to 40,000. Again, the half-year results should demonstrate that the group is on the way to its target of a return to net profit in 1994. The recovery at Olivetti, the computer group, is more fragile. Its half-year results, which will be published on Thursday, are likely to be marred by large trading losses on the group's investment portfolio. But although there is still some doubt about whether the company will take restructuring charges for 1994 in the first or second half, many analysts expect Olivetti to break even at the operating level in the first six months. The news is likely to be less good in the banking sector - hit by trading losses, particularly on the bond market - and for those construction and cement companies which are still suffering from stagnation in the building sector. But even here, analysts point out that companies such as Unicem - the cement manufacturer which is part of the Agnelli family's empire - have reduced their costs substantially during the two to three-year downturn. So far, the Italian business community has been notably cautious in its judgment on Mr Berlusconi, perhaps partly out of respect for an entrepreneur-turned-prime minister, partly out of residual optimism about what is, in effect, Italy's first pro-business government since the war. What they now want to see is a strong effort by the government to match their hard work in cutting costs and restructuring for a recovery, for example by keeping taxes down and pursuing its initial proposals on labour market flexibility and investment incentives. When the 1995 budget is tabled at the end of this month, it will not deliver Italy 'into paradise or hell,' as one analyst puts it, but it should provide the first indications of whether Mr Berlusconi is going to fulfil his part of the bargain with business.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENEM PICKS AIDE TO FIGHT ARGENTINE INFLATION  </P> <P> President Carlos Saul Menem on Friday put a trusted aide at the helm of  Argentina's troubled economy in place of a party outsider who had failed to  break inflation.  </P> <P> Health and Social Welfare Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez was named economy  minister after businessman Nestor Rapanelli resigned the post.  </P> <P> Rapanelli, 60, who was sworn in five months ago to tackle Argentina's worst  economic crisis, had been criticized for his business background by the  union-based governing Peronist Party.  </P> <P> Gonzalez, a longtime confidant of Menem, is held in esteem by rank-and-file  Peronists, and his appointment is an apparent move to defuse political  opposition to Menem's economic program.  </P> <P> Rapanelli resigned four days after announcing new anti-inflation measures which  drew strong criticism from business and labor leaders.  </P> <P> The austral currency plummeted 28.3% against the dollar after it was devalued  by 34.8% Sunday.  </P> <P> Economists estimate that prices will rise by more than 20% in December, much  higher than Rapanelli had targeted.  </P> <P> Rapanelli had brought monthly inflation down to 5.6% from a record of nearly  200%, but the trend reversed.  </P> <P> Aldo Ducler, an adviser to Rapanelli, told reporters the Cabinet reshuffle  signaled "the Peronization of the economy."  </P> <P> "The outgoing team's members were the only ones who stood up for economic  stability, while the Peronist party has remained silent these past five  months," he said.  </P> <P> Before becoming health and social welfare minister, Gonzalez was the Argentine  Central Bank's vice president.  </P> <P> Interior Minister Eduardo Bauza was named to replace Gonzalez, and another  strong Peronist, Julio Mera Figueroa, is the new interior minister.  </P></p>

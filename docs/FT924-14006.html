			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Chancellor criticises two reports in Financial Times AT THE Treasury committee hearing, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, criticised two reports that appeared in yesterday's Financial Times. The first referred to a meeting on September 13 between Mr Lamont and Treasury officials and said the officials had broached the possibility that sterling might devalue, along with the Italian lira. The report said that the issue was raised as an option by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury. The second report said Mr Lamont had told Treasury officials to put a more favourable gloss on official projections for the UK's public-sector deficit, published a month before the April general election. Mr Lamont was asked about both reports at the committee meeting. This is a transcript of the exchanges: Mr Giles Radice (Labour MP for Durham North): 'There's a report in today's Financial Times which says: 'It has emerged that, during the September 13 meeting at the UK Treasury, British officials briefly broached the possibility that sterling could join in the Italian devaluation. ' 'The issue was raised at the meeting by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury, as an option, according to UK officials, but any likelihood that sterling would follow the lira by devaluing was, however, immediately scotched by Mr Lamont.' 'So clearly there was a possibility that there could have been a devaluation and you were advised that there was a possibility by your officials, but you chose not to go down that route. Isn't that the case?' Mr Lamont: 'No. That is not the case.' Mr Radice: 'So it's wrong?' Mr Lamont: 'Well, I haven't actually had the benefit of reading that report.' Mr Radice: 'You don't read the FT?' Mr Lamont: 'I sometimes read the FT, but I haven't currently been reading it and I certainly think that many of the things that it has written on these events are highly inaccurate and intended to be so. They seem to be extremely out to create a bit of problems here and there. 'Mr Chairman, I will only say that at the meeting on Sunday morning . . . I haven't read this article . . . so I don't know which meeting it is referring to.' In a later exchange: Mr Brian Sedgemore (Labour, Hackney and Shoreditch): 'Can you respond to the serious criticism in this morning's Financial Times that perhaps neither this committee nor anybody else can take anything you say seriously on economic policy, because you are a dishonest person that gets Treasury civil servants to fake economic projections and statistics for political purposes, and I have the Financial Times here, if you would like to read it.' Mr Lamont: 'That is not correct. I'm afraid that's why I responded rather sharply about the FT earlier, no doubt unfairly on the FT. All I will say about that is that it is a very misleading article. 'All forecasts are discussed between ministers and officials. The forecasts obviously take into account the views of ministers and other senior officials who are not directly involved in the technical process of running the Treasury model. The final published forecasts are the responsibility of ministers, they reflect all the judgments made in the course of these discussions. 'I think earlier on we sent this committee a memorandum in July of last year about how the forecast was drawn up and we stand by everything that was in that.' Last night the Treasury declined to elaborate on Mr Lamont's comments. Mr Richard Lambert, editor of the FT, said: 'The paper stands by its reports.'</p>

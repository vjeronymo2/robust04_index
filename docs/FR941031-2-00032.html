Specifically, FGT is proposing to modify its FTS&hyph;1 and ITS&hyph;1 Rate Schedules to provide that FGT will charge Western Division forwardhaul shippers a fuel percentage based on the number of compressors utilized in providing the service. FGT states that it believes this modification is necessary to make FGT's Western Division service competitive with other transporters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT's FTS&hyph;1 and ITS&hyph;1 Rate Schedules provide that FGT may charge individual shippers for Western Division transportation service less than the maximum rates set forth on the currently effective Sheet No. 8B applicable to such service. FGT states that it has routinely discounted its maximum facility and service charges for Western Division transportation to compete with the large number of interestate and intrastate pipelines operating in the area served by FGT. Many potential Western Division transportation opportunities involve ``short hauls'' on FGT's supply area laterals and mainline that require the use of little, if any, compression. However, operation of the provisions of the Fuel Reimbursement Charge of Section 27 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions would result in FGT absorbing any discount of the Fuel Reimbursement Charge. These provisions would result in FGT losing money on almost any transaction where FGT discounted fuel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, FGT is proposing to modify its Fuel Reimbursement Charge to provide that Western Division transportation service will be charged a fuel retainage percentage on a per compressor basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, FGT is proposing a Western Division fuel percentage of 0.50% per compressor up to a maximum percentage not to exceed the effective maximum Fuel Reimbursement Charge as defined in Section 27 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

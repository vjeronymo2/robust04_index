			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Defiant outpost awaits the Armenian onslaught: Azeris are reeling before a military offensive from Nagorno-Karabakh COLONEL Eyvan Jafarov commands the last Azeri outpost in Nagorno-Karabakh. The army post is outside the village of Markara, 4km inside the Karabakh border and it is unlikely he will hold out for long. The colonel expects a push against his base this morning. A veteran of the Soviet army with service in Russia, Kazakhstan and east Germany, he has a handful of teenagers and big guns whose numbers he will not reveal. 'No matter if they send me more troops or not,' he shrugs, 'we stay here and do our duty.' In command of a sloppy and demoralised army, he tries to stick to the book. 'Do up your button,' he orders a lad clattering down the stairs with a Kalashnikov, and does it up for him. But Col Jafarov's last stand is an anomaly. At Agdam, 5km inside Azerbaijan itself, the town is all but surrounded by Armenian forces from Karabakh. On Sunday evening refugees streamed out of the town in trucks, farm wagons and carts. The flames from the villages burning to the south of the town were clearly visible from the road. In the administration building near the centre of the town, Mr Alsif Cherimov said the Armenians were only a few hundred yards away. On a map, his colleagues pointed to a crescent of villages to the south of Agdam taken on Saturday and Sunday in the Armenian offensive. The firing and shelling eased yesterday, only to increase around midday. A walk about the town, however, showed that the Armenians were close: the Azeri forces are holding a perimeter 1km or so out, just beyond the suburbs. But the town is demoralised and weak and the Armenians can fire at will on it and on the road out. Agdam is important. Mr Fakhredin Abusov, the deputy administrator of the border town of Ter-Ter, said that 'if Agdam goes to the Armenians, many say why should we stay in Azerbaijan. It will be the end of us'. More than that, Agdam has for the past two years been the main frontline base for the Azeris in their operations against Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenians came close to it early last year: the Azeri counter-offensive in the north of Karabakh relieved the pressure around the border. Then, from February this year the Azeris weakened and their foes surged back towards their eastern border. Mr Mario Raffaelli, who is acting on behalf of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), yesterday postponed a visit to the region after being told of the imminent collapse of Agdam. The CSCE is trying to broker an agreement between the warring parties in Karabakh. In both Agdam and Ter-Ter the hard-pressed commanders and administrators expressed only contempt for the lack of support they are receiving from Baku. Mr Ali Asadov, one of the leaders of the 2,000-strong population left in Agdam, spent Sunday night and yesterday morning driving to and from a base near Agdam to bring up shells to continue the struggle. 'The politicians in Baku, whoever they are, only fight among themselves for the chairs that will make them rich. We are alone here and will fall here with the town,' he said. On the road leading out of Agdam the refugees, mostly women, children and old men, camp under army tents or makeshift shelters from hay bales. The United Nations in Baku estimates that 40,000-50,000 refugees have been displaced by the fighting around the town. The authorities in Ter-Ter said yesterday that about 24,000 people had recently passed through the town or were still living there.</p>

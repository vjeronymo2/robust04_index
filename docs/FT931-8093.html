			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: All the news fit to hear THE VOICE from my bedside radio informed me: 'Wedding-related stocks seem likely to rise.' It was 5.45 am and the report came from Tokyo, where the engagement of Japan's crown prince had just been announced. I had discovered Dawn Traders, the 5.30-6 am weekday financial news programme on the London radio station LBC. There followed, in an intriguing variety of accents, the latest market reports direct from Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia - with footnotes on the 'Kiwi dollar' - New York and, in a suitably sepulchral voice, the latest on crude oil stocks and the prospects for the oil price from Chicago. Not so long ago, business and financial programmes were rare on the air. Now, they stream from our television and radio sets round the clock, offering much of value to the alert private investor. Hard on the heels of Dawn Traders now comes BBC1's substantial and wide-ranging Business Breakfast. A recent report on America's way offshore island Puerto Rico, the 'pharmaceutical capital of the world,' was a revelation. An earlier programme illustrated sharply the problems the European common market may bring to at least some branches of British industry by interviewing a veteran Midlands flower-grower, obliged to turn to poinsettias (because they do not travel well) while his Dutch competitors' flower-laden lorries were radiating all over Europe. The advantage of television is that it offers the big close-up. Investors who prefer the testimony of eyes and lips to faceless statistical 'indicators' will welcome the programme's Tamworth Barometer in which manufacturers, retailers and others from this sample town in Staffordshire are interviewed in situ on how things are going. No sooner have the last crumbs of the Business Breakfast been swept away than, for Greater Londoners, LBC is back shortly after 8 with the first company results and market indexes of the day, repeated at hourly intervals with the odd 'share on the move' and the prices of what they call 'the top 20' at 9.30 am and 4.30 pm. This leads to a round-up of the day around 6.35 pm. Listeners to BBC Radio Four, presumably excused Dawn Traders, have to wait for their 15-minute Financial World Tonight until the advanced hour of 9.45. The most useful feature of these evening round-ups is that, quite often, company chairmen or directors offer themselves for cross-examination when their annual results are announced. The questions are more pointed than at most AGMs and, in the intimacy of the studio, the voice gives away more than it says. You can pick out the men committed to their jobs. The enthusiasm of Whitbread's chief executive over the brewer's catering innovations was obvious in an LBC interview. On Financial World Tonight, shareholders in Airtours or Owners Abroad were able to hear both Airtours' chairman, David Crossland, and the retired package holiday champion, Harry Goodman, on the very eve of the bid that made so many headlines. Goodman pronounced the deal 'dangerous' for competition but said he admired Crossland for making it and would have done the same. Sunday has long been the day for BBC TV's old flagship, the Money Programme: 40 minutes, two or three topical items, and an economist talking head. Investors in locomotive engineers and train-makers no doubt took note recently when, in a report on privatisation plans for British Rail, they learned - from the horse's mouth - that these could well kill train manufacturing in the UK. ITV's rival Sunday City programme was scuppered by the management. But Channel 4 has produced a worthy Sunday rival in High Interest: 45 minutes devoted to a single subject, which gives great advantages in comprehensiveness and quality. A recent programme on the big three supermarket companies - Sainsbury's, Safeway and Tesco - amounted to a managerial seminar on this massive and central industry. Chairman David Sainsbury, standing in one of his supermarkets, explained frankly their shadow-boxing techniques. 'We watch each other like hawks, and the speed of response is such that no one is very much out of line.' But although he told us that market saturation would not come before the end of the century, the plans of the three giants seemed relentless and it was not difficult to agree with the analyst who warned that now was not the time to buy supermarket shares. The week that opens with Dawn Traders ends at 11.25 on Friday nights with Radio Four's The Financial Week in which Heather Paton, rising high above the market chatter, coolly consults two or three or four economists, analysts, bankers or financial journalists (they are always 'distinguished'). This is a programme that should carry a mental health warning. The private investor who over-indulges in it might never again be able to make any decision on whether to buy or sell.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NCR STOCK UP BUT DIRECTORS HIT AT&amp;T OFFER  </P> <P> NCR Corp. stock skyrocketed today, gaining more than $25 a share on news of a  $6-billion takeover offer by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., but NCR's  directors called the stock-swap bid, valued at $90 a share, "grossly  inadequate."  </P> <P> Analysts viewed AT&amp;T's proposed merger with NCR, the nation's fifth-largest  computer company, as a last-ditch effort to salvage AT&amp;T's ailing computer  business.  </P> <P> An NCR spokesman said today that the company's financial advisers "regard the  latest AT&amp;T offer to be grossly inadequate."  </P> <P> Chairman Charles Exley Jr. said NCR's board will review the offer and "advise  its shareholders accordingly."  </P></p>

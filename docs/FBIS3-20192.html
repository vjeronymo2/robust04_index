			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer </F> by Klaus-Peter Klingelschmidt and Mathhias Gels, place and date  not given]    [Text] [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Fischer, the coalition Greens  gained votes in the elections in Lower Saxony, yet despite that  they will not be able to govern any longer. What do the results  mean for your option of a red-green coalition at the national  level?    [Fischer] The election results in Lower Saxony mean a very  good outcome for Bonn because it takes away the fears of an SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany]-Green alliance and at the  same time demonstrates that the Greens are continuing to  consolidate their base. For the coalition Greens in Lower Saxony  it is bitter to have won and nonetheless not be able to  participate in governing any longer. To be sure, the question  remains unanswered as to how long the SPD's one-vote majority  will really continue to hold. The Greens in Hannover are a  governing party in waiting. The results are generating  incredible motivation nationwide and that seems to me to be the  decisive aspect.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Was it the Mannheim party convention that  made  possible this enormous thrust on the part of the coalition  Greens?    [Fischer] If I were to be ironic in my answer now, I would  say "Yes."    [TAGESZEITUNG] To ask in all seriousness: Did the Mannheim  resolutions and the harsh public reaction to the party  convention play a negative role in the outcome of the Lower  Saxony elections?    [Fischer] The Mannheim resolutions, taken as a whole, show  that the party has taken a gigantic step forward. I would have  liked the rhetoric to have been less agitated--then the signals  sent out from Mannheim would have looked better. But that is old  hat.    [TAGESZEITUNG] It is understandable that you now interpret  the Lower Saxony election results as a fine success for the  party as well as for the red-green project, but making the  appropriate projections for the Bundestag elections, the  increase would mean that the Greens would jump from 4.8 percent  to 6.6 percent. Yet that certainly is not the magnitude of  importance that the Greens want to achieve in the fall of 1994  in order to convince Rudolf Scharping that he cannot avoid an  red-green coalition, is it?    [Fischer] I am not among those who believe that whoever is  the winner in the opinion polls will be also be the winner in  the elections. The French Greens certainly taught us that  lesson: They traded at 20 percent and wound up at 7 percent.  Everything over 5 percent is good; everything over 7 percent is  very good; and everything over 10 percent would be sensational.  That is my hierarchy.    [TAGESZEITUNG] What results do the Greens need, in your  opinion, for there to be at least a chance of a coalition with  the SPD at the national level?    [Fischer] The Greens must first of all come in from the  cold.  I never tire of stressing that so arrogance and carelessness do  not take hold. If things go too well for the Green donkey, it  likes to dance on thin ice, and distress is then very great when  it falls through.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Can an SPD-Green alliance be created at all  with Rudolf Scharping? He had the choice in Rheinland-Pfalz and  decided in favor of the liberals.    [Fischer] Whether it is possible will depend upon the  participation of the Greens, the content of their programs, and  their people. One thing is certain for me: no coalition at any  price. If we cannot see Green policies reflected in a coalition,  I will advocate remaining in the opposition.    [TAGESZEITUNG] In May of last year on this same point you  informed us that the Greens would probably not be ready to  assume governmental responsibility at the national level in  1994--that they were still too much of a protest party.    [Fischer] For me the same principle continues to apply: I  would reject any coalition agreement that I was convinced could  not be lived up to. The Federal Republic is not something to  play games with. If we want to govern, it means that we must  strive for a successful coalition. If you do not think you are  capable of that, then you should leave it alone. It would be  worse than a disappointment if, after a year and a half, the  sole approach to reform on the democratic left were to be over  and done with for a long time to come.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Scharping is conducting an election campaign  with emphasis on classic SPD priorities; there are hardly any  issues in common with Green policies. Is that something more  than campaign tactics--that is, is it already a decision in  advance against an SPD-Green coalition?    [Fischer] If an SPD-Green alliance wants to achieve a  majority, the party of the people has to wage the battle for the  center and win it. During the last Bundestag campaign there was  obvious SPD-Green competition between the SPD and the Greens.  That proved to be unsuccessful for both sides. Nonetheless, I am  not advocating that the SPD pack in its red-green interests and  in the final analysis we negotiate with a modernized Hermann  Rappe by the name of Gerhard Schroeder. One thing, to be sure,  is clear: There will not be a national government with our  participation without vigorous ecological reform.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Hence, an election campaign as a kind of  division of labor without truly evident programmatic common  interests and a coalition after the election. That sounds rather  artificial.    [Fischer] He who wants a red-green coalition must vote for  the Greens, and he who wants a reform Kohl will vote for the  SPD--and together we will form a true ecosocial reform coalition.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Whether society is imaginative enough to be  able to conceive of that and is eager enough to experiment...    [Fischer] ...If this crisis does not invite experimentation,  it will not be overcome. Now is the hour of experiments! And  that is why I am no longer as pessimistic as I was maybe just a  year ago. Society is beginning to move in the direction of  fundamental change and basic policy changes--the reduction in  working hours, for example, proves this. The contention that  there is no climate of reform or "no experiments wanted" is no  longer valid.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Let us assume that the climate is really  better than its reputation, that the numbers are sufficient, and  that the SPD is willing to go along with the Greens...    [Fischer] ...Just the opposite--the Greens are prepared to  go  along with the SPD.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Fine. What will the new social contract look  like that you are talking about?    [Fischer] We will have to stop dumping the burdens of  unification primarily on the working classes. We need a new  distribution of burdens. The question will arise as to what  extent those who earn more will be willing to assume a greater  share of the burden for the restructuring of our welfare  state--whether they will be willing to bear, step by step,  greater burdens for ecological restructuring, for investments in  education, for German unification, and for basic security.    [TAGESZEITUNG] That is still just a description of the  problem rather than a solution. Thus far, it does not look as if  the renunciation of material benefits for the sake of  unification or of the environment can really be successfully  appealed to.    [Fischer] That is a matter of political conviction and also  one of mobilizing interests. The workers are faced with the  brutal issue of solidarity between those who have work and those  who do not and therefore the propertied classes must also ask  themselves whether they will increase their investments in  Germany's future. In this case I am for undogmatic  deliberations. Why should we not introduce municipal bonds? Why  should not the citizens of Frankfurt be able to purchase  city-owned enterprises? But we will also have to ask whether a  landtag member or an editor-in-chief should have everything for  free. The question of solidarity is to be formulated in a very  tangible manner here.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Will that not scare off the Greens' classic  middle-class constituents?    [Fischer] I like to be a Utopian in this case. If such  deliberations scare off the middle class, then things will  continue to go downhill until the point is reached where even  the middle class will realize that things cannot continue in  this manner. I am not advocating the expropriation of the middle  class. At issue here is the realization of one's own  self-interest that cannot be defined in a narrow-minded,  material sense.    [TAGESZEITUNG] A future national government will hardly be  able to do without tax increases. Will the Greens say in advance  how much more and for what the citizens will have to pay?    [Fischer] The issue here is not a policy of tax increases  but  rather an overhaul of the tax system. If we introduce ecotaxes,  we will have to back off on taxes pegged to incomes. If I demand  somewhat more from people in the way of taxes on petroleum, then  there must be tangible improvements in local public  transportation. Too, the creative phase for both parties will  not really get under way until the coalition negotiations--not  in party conventions held to develop platforms. Then things will  really get exciting. When it comes down to fundamental change,  when various elements of society with their ideas and demands  crowd their way into such negotiations as well, when a true  restructuring of policies is at stake, I think that the SPD  too--even Mr. Scharping--will get a kick out of it. Desire for  reform, frustration with stagnation, experiments at last: That  is the motto.    [TAGESZEITUNG] What are the core issues of emphasis for a  red-green government program?    [Fischer] We need a structural revolution in energy,  transportation, and waste management policy. The second area  will be a restructuring of the welfare state, the attempt to  stop social disintegration. The third project will be German  unity. Fourth: The Europeanizing of our society, the right of  immigration, and dual citizenship. And finally, we will deal  with a new definition of foreign policy while at the same time  retaining the tradition of the Federal Republic as a nation of  peace--that is, where is this Germany headed? Will we remain  oriented towards Europe or are we again going to chase old  illusions of power? Will Germany become a factor for stability  or a risk factor? Those are the fundamental questions for future  foreign policy.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Will you answer these questions on the basis  of the Mannhein resolutions on foreign policy? How much popular  support do the Greens expect for their demand for a gradual  abandonment of the Bundeswehr and the dissolution of NATO?    [Fischer] No one among us wants to dissolve NATO  immediately.  The question arises: How should a pan-European peace order look?  And this order will transcend NATO. The Greens' program  contains, by the way, a clear "Yes" to European  integration--that is, the manifest incorporation of everything  resolved in Mannheim as the Greens' vision into an overall  European process--including the linkage of the disarming of the  Bundeswehr to peace conditions in Europe that permit this. We  are not advocating a new adventurism here.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Does what you are explaining here so nicely  mean that our resolutions are one thing and real policy  something else?    [Fischer] That would amount to opportunism. That may have  been the case with one individual or another--the ringing party  convention speeches simply sound different than internal  statements. For the majority of the delegates and the party,  however, that does not hold true. It is not a question of  opportunism but a kind of ensuring one's own identity--precisely  because in many other areas a far-reaching step has been taken  in the direction of realpolitik.    [TAGESZEITUNG] What, in the final analysis, will still  remain  of the party's foreign policy resolutions in a red-green  coalition agreement?    [Fischer] We will have vigorous negotiations to conduct on  the issues of the Bundeswehr's mission and the reduction of its  troop strength; likewise on the issues of ending armaments  exports and effective measures for conversion. We will make  human rights a central criterion of foreign policy and we will  have to negotiate on a new, solidarity-oriented definition of  Germany's role in north-south issues.    [TAGESZEITUNG] What, in your opinion, do the  coalition-seeking Greens have to do this election year for a  red-green coalition to come about?    [Fischer] We must struggle and forego everything that will  result in dissention. If we were to succeed in formulating 20  salient points from the Greens' perspective on the basis of our  election platform and program of principles--and do so without  dissention and in a manner that transcends factions--I would  emphatically advocate that they be presented, debated, and  adopted at a one-day extraordinary party convention. That would  once again give a boost to our motivation.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you want to do a little retroactive repair  work on the current state of party resolutions?    [Fischer] No, make them more specific because our program of  fundamental principles and our election platform are jumbled  together in our Mannheim resolutions. What do we think we can  really take on in four years?    [TAGESZEITUNG] Is not a red-green coalition in essence only  a  playfully meant option that is being debated because the  conservative-liberal governing coalition has exhausted itself  without a majority in society having committed to a fundamental  change of policy?    [Fischer] No. A red-green coalition is the sole, seriously  intended reform option. If the conservative-liberal government  survives the elections, there will be no renewal--at most a  restoration in the direction of a more German  nationalist-oriented conservatism. A grand coalition means grand  stagnation and a socialist-liberal coalition would result in a  barely recognizable modicum of change with a Free Democratic  Party (FDP) that is only in the government for its own sake. We  are fighting to govern this country because we want to shape it.  That is the old dream of 1968. In those days, we dreamt it in  revolutionary terms, and today we dream it in terms of reform.    The historic mission of my party lies in ecological  restructuring--where critical and basic policy guidelines have  not yet been decided upon. And that is, after all, a great  challenge in one of the most important industrial countries of  the world. That will require all our strength.</p>

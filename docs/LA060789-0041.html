			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Paramount Communications Inc.: The entertainment and publishing firm, formerly  known as Gulf &amp; Western Inc., reported that second-quarter earnings rose  18% to $65.6 million. Revenue for the period, not including the Associates, the  financial services business it is selling, rose 13% to $699 million. The firm  said income from continuing operations included record contributions from the  entertainment business, due to sharp increases in Paramount Pictures'  operations and gains by Madison Square Garden. This performance was more than  offset by losses in Simon &amp; Schuster's educational publishing business and  declines in its consumer and professional information areas.  </P></p>

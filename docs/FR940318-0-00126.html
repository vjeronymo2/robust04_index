			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Environmental Fate and Transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where available, EPA requests information on the environmental fate and transport of substitutes. Such data shall include information on bioaccumulation, biodegradation, adsorption, volatility, transformation, and other data necessary to characterize a substitute's movement and reaction in the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Flammability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data on the flammability of a substitute chemical or mixture is required. Specifically, the flash point and flammability limits are needed, as well as information on the procedures used for determining the flammability limits. Testing of blends should identify the compositions at which the blend itself is flammable, and the changes in the composition of the blend during various leak scenarios. For substitutes that will be used in consumer applications, documentation of testing results conducted by independent laboratories (e.g., Underwriters Laboratories) should be submitted, where available. If a substitute is flammable, the submitter must analyze the risk of fire resulting from the use of such a substitute and suggest measures to minimize these risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Exposure Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The submitter must provide available modeling or monitoring data on exposures associated with the manufacture, formulation, transport, and use of a substitute. Descriptive process information for each substitute application, as required above, will be used to develop exposure estimates where exposure data are not readily available. Depending on the end-use, exposure profiles will be needed for workers, consumers, and the general population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Environmental Release Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data on emissions from the substitute application and equipment, as well as pollutant releases or discharge to all environmental media (ambient air, surface and groundwater, hazardous/solid waste) are needed to complete the risk characterization. Submitters should provide information on release locations, if known. Available information on pollution controls that are used or could be used in association with the substitute (e.g., emissions reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, wastewater treatment, treatment of hazardous waste) and the costs of such technology is also requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Replacement Ratio for a Chemical Substitute <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency requires information on the replacement ratio for a chemical substitute versus the class I or II substances being replaced. The term ``replacement ratio'' refers to how much more or less of the substitute chemical is needed to substitute for the original ozone-depleting compound being replaced. This ratio will affect the estimated incremental cost and environmental effects associated with use of the substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Required Changes in Technology <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data on any changes in technology needed to use the alternative are required. Such information should include a description of whether the substitute can be used in existing equipment_with or without some retrofit_or only in new equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Cost of Substitute <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency requires data on the expected average cost of the alternative. The cost of the substitute can be expressed, for example, in terms of  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> $/pound (for a chemical substitute) or as incremental capital and operating costs associated with a retrofit or new equipment. In addition, information is needed on the expected equipment life for an alternative technology. Other critical cost considerations should be identified, as appropriate. For example, it is important to understand the incremental costs associated with losses or gains in energy efficiency associated with use of a substitute relative to current experience with existing substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 15. Availability of Substitute <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency needs to understand the extent to which a substitute is already commercially available or the date on which it is expected to become available. The timing of availability is an important factor in assessing the overall health and environmental effects of the substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 16. Anticipated Market Share <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data on the anticipated near-term and long-term (over the next ten years) nationwide substitute sales are also required. This information can be presented in several ways, for example: a percentage of existing nationwide use of class I or II chemicals that would be replaced in a particular end-use; number of units/products to be produced; or pounds of substitute to be sold. This information is required to assess the potential effects of a substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to total consumption and environmental releases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Applicable Regulations Under Other Environmental Statutes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The submitter is required to provide information on whether the substitute is regulated under other statutory authorities, in particular the Clean Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and other titles of the CAA. The Agency will evaluate substitutes under the SNAP program subject to existing regulatory constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Information Already Submitted to the Agency <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Individuals may have already submitted information required in the SNAP Information Notice to the Agency as part of past regulatory and information-gathering activities. In this case, to minimize reporting burden, the submitter need not resubmit the data but instead should provide the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to help EPA locate the data already maintained at EPA: Type of information submitted; the date of submission; the EPA office to which the data were sent; description of the regulatory program under which the data were submitted; and a document-control number, if assigned (e.g., a PMN number). If the submitter cannot provide adequate references for data sent previously to the Agency as described above, all required information should be included in the SNAP notice. To facilitate review under SNAP, reports already submitted to the Agency as part of other regulatory submissions should be resubmitted if the original information was claimed as Confidential Business Information when previously submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

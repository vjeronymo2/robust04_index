			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: EIO plans to take up to 75% of St Andrew THE ECCLESIASTICAL Insur-ance Office is making a bid for St Andrew Trust, an investment trust specialising in smaller companies, which is managed by Martin Currie. However, the bid is a technical one designed to leave Ecclesiastical with a holding of more than 50 and less than 75 per cent. The move is designed to allow EIO to meet the EC's Third Council Directive on Non-Life Insurance, which was adopted on June 18. Regulations needed to implement the directive are expected to come into effect on July 1 1994. The impact of the regulations will be that, for capital adequacy purposes, Ecclesiastical will need to have a majority holding in the trust. It currently has a holding of 40.3 per cent, some of which was acquired as part of a similar bid in 1985. The Takeover Code requires Ecclesiastical to make a full offer for all the remaining shares of the trust. It is accordingly making an offer in cash, equivalent to 93 per cent of the trust's formula asset value (in essence, the net asset value minus expenses). At present, the bid is worth about 215p per share, and values the 59.7 per cent of St Andrew which Ecclesiastical does not own, at Pounds 44.1m. Ecclesiastical does not want to accumulate more than 75 per cent of St Andrew, as this would threaten its investment trust status. It wants Martin Currie to continue to manage the trust. St Andrew yesterday put out a holding statement noting the offer. The shares were unchanged at 211p.</p>

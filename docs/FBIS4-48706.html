			<p>BFN     [Text] Freetown, 24 May (AFP) -- At least 50 rebels in  Sierra Leone were killed recently in mysterious circumstances,  diplomats said Tuesday [24 May]. The incident occurred in the  town of Baomahun, 170 kilometers east of the capital. The town  was attacked and briefly held three weeks ago by the guerrillas  of the United Revolutionary Front. One hypothesis suggested by  diplomats was that the guerrillas died after drinking  cyanide-tainted alcohol they had robbed from a gold mine. The  mine personnel had fled ahead of the insurgent attack.    The rebels have been fighting the government of this small  West African country since March 1991. Since the beginning of  May, apart from the latest 50, 67 guerrillas have died in  clashes with government forces, the government says. Sixty-five  civilians and 10 soldiers have also died.</p>

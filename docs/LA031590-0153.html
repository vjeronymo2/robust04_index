			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> WAY APPARENTLY CLEARED FOR ELECTION  </P> <P> A preliminary order issued Wednesday by the state Court of Appeal appears to  support a controversial order by City Clerk Mary E. Wynn setting forth details  of the April 10 City Council election, according to Wynn's attorney.  </P> <P> Wynn's order last week followed a Superior Court judge's denial of her request  to order two council members to approve polling places and precinct workers for  the election.  </P> <P> Councilmen John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott, who oppose the April election,  voted against the resolution and have questioned Wynn's authority to issue the  order.  </P> <P> But in a preliminary ruling Wednesday, the appeals court cited an Election Code  provision that if precinct board members have not been appointed, the city  clerk shall appoint them.  </P> <P> Wynn's attorney, Robert Owen, said the ruling appears to give the city clerk  the authority to proceed with the election.  </P> <P> Prescott and Kelly, who contest the legality of the ordinance moving city  elections from November to April, have until Tuesday to respond to Wynn's  appeal of the Superior Court decision.

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Tarnish forms on the green image - Manufacturers which claim that their products will not harm the environment cannot always back this up. Peter Knight looks at the market for green products and considers why consumers have lost some of their initial enthusiasm The advertising man said he was going to beef up the campaign with 'the ozone thing'. The client stared in disbelief. The use of spurious environmental claims in simplistic sales campaigns was soundly discredited last year. Rover, for example, promised that its Metro would not harm the ozone layer because it used lead-free petrol. Saab claimed its catalytic converters removed 'ozone-punching hydrocarbons'. Both claims were scientifically unsound. Britain's Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints against these and other companies, including Ecover, a maker of washing powders. Friends of the Earth started The Green Con award especially for the creators of such outrageous and misinformed claims. The public, already confused by the complexity of the 'environment thing', grew wary and cooled their brief love affair with so-called environment friendly consumer products. These now get far less shelf-space in supermarkets than a year ago. The success of a new brand of detergent, Radion, which offered no environmental guarantees but promised to remove body odour from clothes, was partly attributed to the ineffectual 'green' washing powders. It also highlighted the difficulty in communicating complex scientific issues as opposed to simple messages about smells and stains. The debate about the alleged effects of zeolites, phosphates and optical whiteners on the environment did not stand a chance against the promise to eradicate body odours. 'Too many manufacturers thought that a little green slant was all that was needed. But the market moved on too quickly for that,' says Dorothy McKenzie, of Dragon International, a new Anglo-French marketing consultancy. Although the Green Cons and the ozone-punchers got most of the publicity, there were more intelligent and effective marketing campaigns which used people's interest in the environment to stimulate sales. Varta, for example, marketed its mercury-free, and later cadmium-free, batteries in this way. This German-based dry-cell battery maker holds third place with around 9 per cent of the UK market for alkaline batteries and 7 per cent of zinc-based batteries, according to market researchers Mintel. It is a long way behind the market leaders, Ever Ready and Duracell. For most of 1988 Varta sold zinc-chloride batteries which contained roughly the same amount of mercury as in competitive products. Its mercury-free 'green' batteries were on sale in some Continental countries which were more environment-conscious than the UK at the time. Varta saw an opportunity to improve market share and to differentiate itself from the main suppliers in the UK. It imported the 'green' batteries and sold them as such, eventually wrapping them in what was considered appropriate packaging (no plastic, recycled card) and promoting them heavily as batteries that 'don't cost the earth'. The campaign worked well but consumers were either unaware or did not care that throw-away batteries are inherently unfriendly to the environment. Their manufacture consumes more than 50 times the energy eventually delivered and they introduce hazardous chemicals into the environment when discarded. Varta prospered initially, however, by providing a product that the competitors did not offer. This achieved one of the company's aims - to get shelf-space in supermarkets. But the competition soon caught up and most throw-away chloride batteries are now free from heavy metals, or only contain traces. But this change was brought about by impending EC legislation and a battery manufacturers' agreement on heavy metals. Varta, aware that the markets have moved on rather swiftly, now concentrates on the rechargeable sector, which it sees as the next growth area. It offers to recycle its spent rechargeable batteries (which contain heavy metals) and gives a 50p voucher to customers who post their spent rechargeable batteries to the company. But the inadequacy - and sometimes rank stupidity - of some green promotional campaigns have overshadowed the fundamental shift that some observers detect in the consumer market. Green issues, it seems, will remain important because they are being joined by a set of complex social issues that are starting to influence consumer markets. 'Companies now have to regard issues like environmental performance, corporate standards of behaviour, trading policies and community involvement as a crucial aspect of business marketing,' says McKenzie. Some firms have taken this on board. Esprit, the US-based clothes retailer, promotes 'responsible consumption'. This idea is similar to that promoted so assiduously by the Body Shop. Its message is: buy only environmentally sound goods and buy fewer. By promoting reduced consumption (but not at their shops) and their particular version of corporate morality, companies such as Esprit and the Body Shop are trying to sell a vision of how businesses should behave in a threatened world. This, they argue, corresponds with the shift in consumer attitudes brought on by the environmental threat to the planet. Skeptics view this 'vision thing' as opportunistic because it merely provides a version of the 'unique selling point' (USP). But, say others, it should be seen as an example of how companies are being forced by a changing market to merge their brand and corporate marketing. These have been traditionally kept apart. Corporate affairs departments have been charged with massaging the company's image with soft sells, such as donations and sponsorships. The marketing departments have been responsible for selling the coarser benefits of the brand, such as the power to get rid of those horrible odours. But with USPs becoming more difficult to achieve, a supplier's corporate image is playing a bigger role in helping the consumer to choose between products that are largely identical - from computers and cars to hairspray. This goes some way to explaining why some companies outside the general consumer markets are dedicating considerable resources to greening their organisations worldwide. For example IBM, the computer and information services provider, is spending heavily on environmental improvements, from eradicating CFCs from its manufacturing plants to recycling plastic cups in its canteens. The 'ozone thing' might not have a direct effect on computer sales, but achieving environmental excellence is essential to bolster corporate image. And the marketing of that image plays a vital role in maintaining its leadership in world markets where the stability and acceptability of the corporation is becoming more important than its purely technical achievements. IBM is not alone in this. Companies such as 3M and Shell have long seen environmental excellence as part of their pursuit of quality. Success in both areas bolster their corporate image. Few multinationals are now without some form of written environmental policy, although the majority are still struggling with the complexity of reaching their aims. It will be some time before they can include their achievements in their marketing campaigns. Getting rid of those ghastly body odours from daddy's shirt will not be enough to win market share. But, it seems, neither will just being green. Previous articles in the series examined environmental audits, product design and manufacturing.</p>

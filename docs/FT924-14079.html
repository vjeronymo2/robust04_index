			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clark rebels under heavy fire THE ROW over control of C&amp;J Clark, Britain's biggest shoe manufacturer, grew increasingly heated this weekend with a letter to shareholders dismissing accusations by boardroom rebels as 'untrue and inaccurate'. In a scathing attack on the rebels, five directors - including two members of the founding Clark family - urged shareholders to vote against proposals to dismiss chairman Mr Walter Dickson and non-executive director Mr James Power. The letter claimed the four board rebels - all Clark family members - had 'misused confidential information and made untrue and inaccurate statements  . If they have done this as requisitionists, how would they behave if they controlled the company?' A company spokesman denied reports that the family was holding peace talks at the weekend. Some 500 members of the Clark family hold more than 70 per cent of the company. The letter to shareholders countered claims by the requisitionists that recommendations in a consultants report dated 1988 had been ignored. This was a 'red herring which disguises a straightforward attempt to gain board control', the letter stated. The company quotes the consultants, McKinsey, in 1991 as saying that Clarks had 'performed creditably' against a difficult market background. The five board members defended the corporate strategy directed by Mr Dickson. They predicted that by 1995 the company would achieve cost savings of Pounds 12m a year from rationalisation in its retail business - which includes Clarks, K Shoes and Ravel - and Pounds 25m in manufacturing. An extraordinary meeting has been called for this Friday to decide the issue. The rebels are proposing two new board members, Mr Hugh Pym, an ITN journalist and a member of the Clark family, and Mr Michael Markham, a businessman. It is believed that Electra Investment Trust, the venture capital group which is backing a possible bid approach by Mr Colin Fisher, a consultant, would hold back from any firm offer until the outcome of the egm.</p>

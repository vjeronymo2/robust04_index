			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Canadian fish companies to cut over 2,000 jobs CANADA'S two biggest fish companies have imposed drastic cuts, including over 2,000 immediate layoffs, in the wake of a two-year shutdown of northern cod fishery off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. Fishery Products International, based in St John's, Newfoundland, said the ban would cut its total groundfish catch by 35 per cent this year to 72,000 tonnes. This represents a drop in sales of about CDollars 55m (USDollars 45.8m). The company is immediately laying off 1,340 people at four inshore processing plants. National Sea Products, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, is cutting its payroll by about 20 per cent to just under 3,000 people. Nonetheless, Mr Henry Demone, National's president, supported the moratorium, saying it is 'an economic catastrophe for Newfoundland, but it is in the best interest of the northern cod fishery.'</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / People: They're all coming to Cymru All but one of the top jobs at the revamped Welsh Development Agency have been filled with the appointment of Derek Perkins (right) as head of its North American operation. Perkins replaces Ivor Simpson, whose three-year contract is not being renewed. North America is a crucial target in the government-funded agency's attempts to woo inward investment. There is a presumption that the new senior management has been dissatisfied with the US performance. The headquarters is to be moved from Princeton to Boston. James Turner, managing director for the WDA's international division, explains: 'Our research has shown that Boston and the north-east seaboard area is one of the best regions for potential inward investment to Wales. It contains the largest concentration of any US region of large, growth-minded companies in the high-technology field.' Turner himself is a recent arrival at the agency - he joined in May after a career which included working for Mars GmbH in Germany, Citibank and Prudential Assurance, where he was sales development director. Perkins, who was the WDA's regional director for south-west Wales and previously responsible for the North American inward investment team in Cardiff, takes the title of executive vice-president. His appointment means that the new brooms at the WDA, chairman David Rowe-Beddoe and chief executive Barry Hartop, who have the task of restoring the agency's damaged reputation, are close to completing a slimmer and more devolved structure. With the exception of Perkins, they have recruited from outside the agency for all the senior posts. About 60 of the 400 staff have been warned that they may lose their jobs. Among the confirmed casualties is David Farnsworth, whose job as director of the development projects division disappeared under the restructuring. Ian Rooks, formerly marketing director, who was disciplined after the Commons public accounts committee criticised the agency last year, has also left. Two of the three managing directors for the new regional structure in Wales  -which is intended to allow for the delegation of more responsibility from the WDA's headquarters in Cardiff - have been appointed. Elfed Evans, formerly district general manager for British Gas, has been made managing director of the west Wales division. Enid Rowlands, who was chief executive of Targed, the training and enterprise council in north-west Wales, becomes managing director for the north region. The post of the south Wales managing director has yet to be filled. Two other senior appointments have been made this week. Susan Hughes, from Shreeveport, a management and marketing consultancy, becomes marketing services director. Julie Banfield, business development manager at National Westminster Bank, becomes customer services director.</p>

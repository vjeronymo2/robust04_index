			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Fall in business failures predicted Business failures will fall by about 5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared with the second quarter according to Trade Indemnity, the specialist trade credit insurer, Jim Kelly writes. Compared with the same quarter last year the fall is predicted to be 33 per cent. The figures are based on businesses linked to Trade Indemnity's policyholders. The fall in the second quarter of 1994 was 19 per cent from the first quarter and 41 per cent from the same quarter last year. Total failures in the second quarter were 829 compared with a predicted 785 in the third. Mr William Simpson, chief economist with Trade Indemnity, said: 'The latest decline in business failures supports other evidence of recuperating corporate sector balance sheets.' He noted, however, that house price deflation, and attempts to control inflation in conjunction with tax increases, could combine to slow consumption.</p>

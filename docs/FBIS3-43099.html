R Tagalayev; UDC 621.372.85] </F>   [Abstract] Emphasis is placed on the development of a  higher quality of information processing based on existing  domestic hardware. In this case, a VHF or UHF radio signal is  used for processing in systems with t hree-dimensional  integrated circuits. The use of three-dimensional circuits  decreases size by 1-3 orders of magnitude and incre ases speed  by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The system consists of control  devices, phase shifters, attenuators, and various types of  transmission lines. New and improved wideband UHF and VHF  control devices are needed to foster development of these  systems. An application program package has been developed to  design control devices. Methods of increasing the bandwidth of  the system are discussed. Various types of control devices are  described. Equations are derived which may be used to analyze  the charact eristics of the devices. Various types of  trnasmission line junctions are discussed. Equations are  presetned which can be used to evaluate the amplitude-frequency  characteristic and phase-frequency characteristic of various  types of junctions. Synthesis of circuit junctions is  addressed. Figures show various junction topologies. Figures 12;  tables 2; references 10: Russian.</p>

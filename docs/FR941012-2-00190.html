			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For technical assistance purposes, the dollar unit values of data derived from the computations of the Urbanized Area Formula and Nonurbanized Area Formula Programs, and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula apportionments are included in this Notice on Table 10. To determine how a particular apportionment amount was developed, areas may multiply their population, population density, and Section 15 data by these unit values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> XI. Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research Programs (Formerly Sections 8 and 26(a)(2)) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Metropolitan Planning Urbanized Area Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fiscal year 1995 Metropolitan Planning apportionments to States for MPOs to be used in urbanized areas total $41,512,500. A basic allocation of 80 percent of this amount ($33,210,000) is distributed to the States based on urbanized area population for State distribution to each urbanized area, or parts thereof, within each State. A supplemental allocation of the remaining 20 percent ($8,302,500) is also provided to the States based on an FTA administrative formula to address planning needs in the larger, more complex urbanized areas. Table 9 contains the final State apportionments for the combined basic and supplemental allocations. Each State, in cooperation with the MPOs, must develop an allocation formula for the combined apportionment which distributes these funds to MPOs representing urbanized areas, or parts thereof, within the State. This formula, which must be approved by the FTA, must ensure to the maximum extent practicable that no MPO is allocated less than the amount it received by administrative formula under the Metropolitan Planning Program in fiscal year 1991 (minimum MPO allocation). Each State formula must include a provision for the minimum MPO allocation. Where the State and MPOs desire to use a new formula not previously approved by FTA, it must be submitted to FTA for prior approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. State Planning and Research Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fiscal year 1995 apportionments for the State Planning and Research Program total $8,475,000. Final State apportionments for this program are also contained on Table 9. This is the fourth year of a consolidated program which is apportioned to the States for the purpose of such activities as planning, technical studies and assistance, demonstrations, management training, and cooperative research. In addition, a State may authorize a portion of these funds to be used to supplement planning funds allocated by the State to its urbanized areas, as the respective State deems appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Data Used for Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research Apportionments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Population data from the 1990 Census is used in calculating these apportionments. The Metropolitan Planning funding provided to urbanized areas in each State by administrative formula in fiscal year 1991 was used as a ``hold harmless'' base in calculating funding to each State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that while the fiscal year 1995 apportionment amount remains unchanged from the fiscal year 1994 apportionment, an adjustment has been made to more accurately reflect the distribution of population within a particular bi-state urbanized area. This adjustment may result in a slight change to each State's individual apportionment from the fiscal year 1994 amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XI. Period of Availability of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The funds apportioned under the Urbanized Area Formula Program, Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula, Metropolitan Planning and State Planning and Research Programs in this Notice will remain available to be obligated by FTA to recipients for three (3) fiscal years following fiscal year 1995. Any of these apportioned funds unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 1998, will revert to FTA for reapportionment under these respective programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds apportioned to nonurbanized areas under the Nonurbanized Area Formula Program, including RTAP funds, will remain available for two (2) fiscal years following fiscal year 1995. Any such funds remaining unobligated at the close of business on September 30, 1997, will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States. Funds allocated to States under the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program in this Notice must be obligated by September 30, 1995. Any such funds remaining unobligated as of this date will revert to FTA for reapportionment among the States. Fiscal year 1995 Title 23 Interstate Substitute Transit funds are available until expended. The 1995 DOT Appropriations Act includes a provision requiring that fiscal year 1995 New Starts and Bus funds not obligated for their original purpose as of September 30, 1997, shall be made available for other discretionary projects. A similar provision in the 1994 DOT Appropriations Act required that fiscal year 1994 and prior year Bus and New Start funds that are not obligated by September 30, 1996, shall also be made available for other discretionary projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XIII.

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Management: The risks of sleeping with the enemy Like a one-person computer dating agency with himself as its main client, Robert E. Allen went stomping around Europe last week throwing out public invitations for all and sundry to climb into bed with him. In more seemly metaphor, the chairman of AT&amp;T went fishing: trying to net any telecommunications company, almost anywhere, that might wish to join the WorldSource venture that AT&amp;T set up in late May with Asian-Pacific partners to serve multinational corporate customers. What was so striking about Allen's expedition was not just his brazen behaviour, but that he made it quite clear that AT&amp;T would welcome with open arms companies with which in other markets it competes. Barely a month ago a similar declaration was made by the chairman of one of his smaller rivals, Iain Vallance, of BT. Announcing a far-reaching deal with MCI, one of Allen's main US challengers, the BT boss said he did not rule out future co-operation with AT&amp;T on non-competitive projects. This is not just a matter of a would-be Goliath and a real one jockeying for position in a particular industry. Similar behaviour is to be found elsewhere. Last month Pratt &amp; Whitney joined forces in small aero-engines with General Electric, its arch US rival, to fight a joint venture between Britain's Rolls-Royce and Germany's BMW. Yet Pratt has also been talking to Rolls about extending an alliance which they have had for some time in the upper reaches of the aero-engine market - against GE. The growth of such promiscuous relationships, in industries from telecoms to cars, aerospace to electronics, seems at first sight to support the argument of a new book called Collaborating to Compete (Wiley, Pounds 19.95), that 'sleeping with the enemy' tends to be good for your corporate health - that it enhances your performance. The metaphor is not mine. It is used repeatedly in the book by Joel Bleeke and David Ernst, who edited and co-authored the volume, with fellow McKinsey consultants. The use of 'sleeping with the enemy' was meant to make alliances sound exciting and attractive. But to many people it will underline their risks. As any Julia Roberts fan will know, the character she plays in a 1991 film of that name has long since ceased to be a willing party to the relationship with the enemy in question - her husband. He seems to be the ideal partner, but then begins to exploit, humiliate and assault her. She tries to break away from him but fails. In the end the only way she can escape is to kill him. That exit route is not available to an unfortunate company weakened by the stranglehold of a once-attractive partner-turned-enemy. All it can usually do is submit and get out of the business concerned - as countless alliance enthusiasts have been forced to do. The extent of the damage done to several large US industries by naive sleeping around with far eastern 'allies' was well charted in a recent article by David Lei and John Slocum in the California Management Review (CMR)*. They demonstrated starkly how a company 'which does not understand the risks inherent in such arrangements' can be 'de-skilled' by its partner. So what should you do to avoid such a fate? Steer clear of alliances entirely - turn celibate? Or sleep only with partners unlikely to become hostile? Neither is feasible these days. Some alliances are a 'must' for most companies, given the attractions of saving costs and time in at least one part of their 'value chain'. As with AT&amp;T, the need to leap political barriers to markets can also play a role. Nor is avoiding competitors always an option. You should usually link with the strongest partner, which often means with rivals; if you avoid them, they will only team up with others. The degree of danger in an alliance varies by its type, breadth and depth, and by its intended duration; by industry; and by each partner's particular situation, especially its degree of dependence on the relationship. So any shortlist of ground rules is by definition incomplete. But several are fundamental. As in sexual activity, they amount to 'take extreme precautions'. First, be sparing with your favours. Do not be as promiscuous, for instance, as IBM. Definitely do not measure yourself on 'how many alliances have we made this quarter?' - a foolish and unmanageable piece of machismo which obsesses far too many companies. Second, be clear that the main purpose of an alliance is to learn from your partner-rival, not just to fill a short-term product, service or market gap. Lei and Slocum are especially damning about US industry's record here. Third, avoid sharing any of your core competences (technological, managerial or whatever) with a partner unless absolutely necessary. This is easier said than done, especially if you have not yet defined properly what they are. Fourth, build barriers - internal as well as external - against the seepage of skills to your partner. Control carefully the boundaries of the alliance, even if they need re-negotiating from time to time. Creating such barriers is obviously easier when you have relatively few partners, when only limited parts of your organisation are involved and when such relationships are reasonably stable. That is a far cry from the all-permeable, 'borderless' company advocated by many US business gurus. In other words, by no means everyone should share their favours as liberally as Robert E. Allen. Monogamy may not be practical these days, but nor is constant coupling with a shifting set of multiple partners. * 'Global Strategy', CMR, autumn 1992.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Analysts upgrade Boots Results ahead of market expectations lifted Boots, the high street retailer, and prompted a series of profits upgrades from stockbroker analysts. The results also brought a measure of relief to the stores sector after disappointing remarks from Kingfisher at its annual meeting on Wednesday. Profits of Pounds 484.4m, up 19 per cent from last year, came against forecasts of Pounds 455m to Pounds 470m. Boots took an expected Pounds 68.5m in exceptional charges for its Manoplax drug and Do It All home improvement business. But strong cashflow transformed a Pounds 203.8m net debt position to a Pounds 69m cash balance at the year-end. Forecasts for 1994-95 were upgraded by around 5 per cent to the Pounds 550m mark. The shares jumped 22 to 527p on turnover of 3.2m. Kingfisher weakened 7 to 515p.</p>

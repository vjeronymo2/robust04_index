"I believe the resignation of Yegor Gaydar signals the end  of  the transfer of the (pro-Yeltsin) Russia's Choice bloc into  opposition", Baburin told TASS on Tuesday.    Now the communists and other opposition factions in  parliament will "take under patronage Chernomyrdin and his  government", he said.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose: The year's corporate successes and failures 'If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two imposters just the same ..'  - Rudyard Kipling There was a lot more disaster than triumph for the corporate world in 1992. But even in such a year, there were winners as well as losers. Here are 10 of the best of each. Winners George Soros. Surely the winner of the year - the man who spotted that if the UK government was determined to buy pound notes at Pounds 1.20 apiece, the trick was to borrow pounds in colossal quantities, hand them over and pocket the difference - in his case, well over Pounds 500m. Tiny Rowland. This was a good year for Mr Rowland, the founder and managing director of Lonrho (qv, under Losers). At 75, he showed himself still capable of inventive deals, such as bringing in Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, as part owner of the Metropole hotel chain. He ended the year with a flourish, selling half his Lonrho stake to an obscure German businessman at well above the price attainable by his fellow-shareholders. Essex Furniture. With Essex deep in recession and the house market frozen, the name of this company sounds like disaster squared. In fact, it increased sales and profits by half, opened new shops and talked about moving into a bigger factory. Asked for the secret, chairman Mr Michael Franks said enigmatically: 'It's the way you put the ingredients together.' Tomkins. Headed by an ex-pupil of Lord Hanson, this pushy young conglomerate took on Hanson in bidding for the bread-maker RHM. Hanson blinked and Tomkins won. Critics said it had paid too much. Its shares still ended the year a fifth higher than they started. Lord Weinstock. The head of GEC was pilloried in the go-go 1980s for his unwillingness to spend his cash mountain. This year, while the profits of the world electronics industry collapsed, GEC's went up. To rub salt in the wound, the company doubled its cash mountain as well. HSBC. Better known as the HongKong and Shanghai Bank, it successfully fought Lloyds to take over the struggling Midland Bank. The stock market had to think twice about this, but eventually decided it was a good thing. HSBC shares doubled in the year, making it the best performer in the FT-SE 100 index. MFI. As a furniture retailer carrying Pounds 500m of debt from a management buy-out, MFI looked for several years like a loser on a heroic scale. But in July it managed a stock market flotation, thus cutting its debt to Pounds 100m. The directors refused to sell their shares on the grounds that the price was too cheap. It has since gone up by a fifth. Rupert Murdoch. 1992 was the year in which Mr Murdoch showed that being a debt-laden international media tycoon need not be the end of the world. He not only placated his bankers, but he started talking about expanding again. The shares in his News Corp doubled. Wellcome Trust. The winning medical charity of the year. In the summer, this charity sold rather less than half its stake in the drug company Wellcome for a princely Pounds 2.3bn. Since then the share price has risen by a quarter, valuing the rest at well over Pounds 3bn. The liquidator. In a year in which going bust was big business, the grim reaper made hay. The UK's top 10 insolvency practitioners had fee income in 1991-92 of some Pounds 300m. This year, with bankruptcy still booming - to say nothing of plum long-term contracts such as Maxwell and Bank of Credit and Commerce International - the figure looks like rising sharply again. Losers Body Shop. Ms Anita Roddick's adroit combination of moral fervour and a soaring share price was one of the more striking features of 1980s capitalism. In 1992 profits ran out of steam and the shares slumped from 370p to 155p. As older City hands might say, it would take a heart of stone not to laugh. Clarke Foods. At the turn of the year, Mr Henry D Clarke of the US spent Pounds 12m buying the Lyons Maid ice cream business in the UK. He then ordered expensive new machinery, advertised heavily and crossed his fingers for hot weather. Early summer was wonderful, but the machinery played up. It reached full output just in time for the wettest August in 53 years. Clarke Foods went bust in October. Ratners. Last Christmas, the profits of the world's biggest jewellery chain had slumped and its share price had fallen 85 per cent in 12 months. Mr Gerald Ratner, the company's chairman, must have reasoned that things could scarcely get worse. Sure enough, they did. Ratners made a Pounds 122m loss, the shares fell a further 70 per cent and Mr Ratner resigned. Lonrho. This was the year in which the loyal army of Lonrho shareholders had their faith finally tested. Their shares halved in value, their dividend was slashed and some of their choicest assets were sold. Lonrho's debt mountain was scarcely dented. Mr Rowland meanwhile started cashing in his chips. 'Believe me,' he told his fellow-shareholders, 'it is only my age that occasions this.' Fisons. A year ago, Fisons announced that it could not manufacture some of its drugs to US standards. The chairman resigned on grounds of ill health. Interim profits fell by nearly 60 per cent. Fisons' market value collapsed from Pounds 3.5bn to Pounds 1bn. So much for the defensive virtues of drug stocks. BP. 'Because I am blessed by my good brain,' BP's chairman Robert Horton said in February, 'I tend to get to the right answer quicker and more often than most people.' In June he lost his job. In August BP announced a quarterly loss of over Pounds 700m and halved its dividend. Alan Sugar. Perhaps all the chairman of Amstrad wanted was to be alone. If so, hard luck. Shareholders were baffled by his bid to take Amstrad private and told him to stay on. Mr Sugar subsequently described his plan as 'just another business venture that was tried and then failed'. Barclays. In an almost universally lousy year for the banks, Barclays still managed to stand out. It took flak over its treatment of small business customers and the structure of its board. It made a loss for only the second time in its history. It ended the year by taking over Imry, a property company to which it had lent Pounds 440m, thus taking to new heights the notion of repossession. GPA. The world's biggest airline leasing company started the year with confident plans of a Dollars 1.5bn share flotation. By mid-year the plans had evaporated. By the year-end there were rumours that the company was in trouble. Since its directors include troubleshooter Sir John Harvey Jones and ex-chancellor Lord Lawson, the rumours must surely be wrong. Trafalgar House. For connoisseurs of disaster, perhaps the company of the year. Profits vanished, the shares plunged, Hong Kong Land moved in and the chairman and chief executive quit. The previous year's profits of Pounds 122m had to be restated as a loss after a run-in with the accounting authorities. In the summer, as a kind of symbolic grace-note, the group's flagship, the QE2, was holed below the waterline.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra - Concert If sheer machined efficiency and implacable technique were all that's needed, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra would qualify easily for the place among the world's great orchestras it claims for itself. But there was something utterly charmless, if not almost repellent, about the display it gave to a capacity Royal Festival Hall audience on Monday: a demonstration of prodigious strength in every department and seemingly inexhaustible reserves of tonal power certainly, but little feeling of individuality or even of corporate artistic spirit. Comparisons with the Philadelphia Orchestra, which played in the same hall two weeks earlier, are inevitable. Where that authentically great orchestra certainly gave ample proof of its collective virtuosity, it was used there as the starting point for wonderfully elegant musicianship, with beautifully fashioned wind solos and strings blended and refined into an infinitely malleable whole. The Pittsburgh suggests none of that; it leaves the impression of being no more than the sum of its formidable parts, parading a surface glare which wearies the ear on unrelieved exposure. Whether more humanity would have emerged under a conductor other than Lorin Maazel, the Pittsburgh's current Musical Director, is another matter. Maazel's approach to Mozart and Mahler at least had the virtue of consistency; both performances - of the E flat Symphony K549 and Mahler's Sixth - were hard driven and glossy, self-consciously expressive, interpretatively embalmed. If Mozart symphonies are still to be performed by a modern symphony orchestra perhaps they should go all the way like this, and be propelled by driving rhythms, shored up by heavily emphasised dynamics and smothered under a thick blanket of string tone. Certainly Maazel's Mozart seemed like an endangered species, unable or unwilling to adapt to a changed concert environment, and his Mahler too seemed to belong to a past age of over-interpretation, when Mahler's sense of symphonic architecture could not be allowed to take of care itself but had to be nudged and prodded along, with every passing event taken out of its context and grotesquely magnified. The Pittsburgh played it with great accuracy and tonal weight. It all made for an uncomfortable experience, not because the nerve-ends of Mahler's emotional journey were revealed, far from it, but because the parade of musical images was so coarse-grained, so hopelessly over-blown.</p>

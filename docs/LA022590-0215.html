			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY EXPECTED TO NAME NEW CONDUCTOR MONDAY  </P> <P> After a search process marred by public discord, the Pacific Symphony Orchestra  is expected to announce its new conductor and music director in a press  conference Monday morning.  </P> <P> Carl St. Clair, one of two assistant conductors of the Boston Symphony, has  been a leading contender for the position, but officials would not confirm  Saturday that he would be named.  </P> <P> St. Clair emerged as a top contender after leading a pair of critically and  publicly well-received subscription concerts Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.  </P> <P> The previous front-runner, Lawrence Foster, revealed this month that the  orchestra had offered him the music director job in December but later withdrew  the offer after talks broke down over salary and rehearsal demands and,  apparently, residency requirements.  </P> <P> St. Clair, 37, told The Times in an interview in January that he expected this  season to be his last as assistant conductor with the Boston Symphony, although  he will continue to lead children's concerts there.  </P> <P> Also music director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) Symphony, St. Clair has said he  would consider moving to Orange County if offered the Pacific Symphony job.  </P> <P> The orchestra has been auditioning guest conductors to replace Keith Clark, who  founded the orchestra in 1979 but was forced out in early 1988 after a bitter  dispute with the board of directors over artistic direction and control.  </P></p>

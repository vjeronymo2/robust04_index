			<p>BFN     [Text] Bulgarian Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov,  who is in Ankara on an official visit, has been continuing his  contacts. The guest minister met with State Minister Necmettin  Cevheri in the afternoon.    Cevheri pointed out to the importance of friendly and  neighborly relations between Turkey and Bulgaria in establishing  peace and stability in the Balkans. Stressing that Bulgaria has  views similar to Turkey's regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cevheri  noted that action should be taken in unison with international  organizations to eliminate this issue from being a sensitive  matter in Europe.    Aleksandrov, in turn, stated that they are following the  incidents in Bosnia-Herzegovina with great concern. He stressed  that Bulgaria opposes actions taking place in the region  directed toward ethnic cleansing and territorial acquisition  through the use of force.    President Suleyman Demirel received the Bulgarian defense  minister and accompanying delegation at the Cankaya Mansion.  Demirel conferred with Aleksandrov for some time. National  Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan also participated at the meeting.</p>

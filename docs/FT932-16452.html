			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Biggest fall in living costs for over 20 years LIVING COSTS have fallen more in the past 12 months than ion any year for more than two decades, a study published today indicates. The Reward Group, a consultancy specialising in pay and consumer studies, calculates that in February a family with average needs in terms of housing and consumer purchases required an income 5.1 per cent less than a year previously to maintain its standard of living. The year-on-year fall in living costs is the biggest since Reward started its twice-yearly studies in 1972. There was a year-on-year decline of 0.7 per cent last August. The findings support other indications of low inflationary conditions as a result of the recession. While the muted level of price rises for many consumer goods played a part in the overall fall in living costs, the biggest factor was that housing costs for home owners fell by 19.7 per cent in the year to February, mainly due to lower interest rates. For the relatively small number of people who rent their homes from local authorities housing costs rose 12.1 per cent because of higher rents. Reward bases its results on a survey of average costs for a group of eight hypothetical four-person families with different spending habits. The annual income needed to support the families - each including one adult in employment, a girl aged 10 and a boy aged eight - works out at between Pounds 11,728 and Pounds 71,215, depending on lifestyles. In terms of the incomes needed, Greater London, Woking and Welwyn Garden City are the dearest places in Britain while Northern Ireland, Peterhead, Thurso and Doncaster are the cheapest.

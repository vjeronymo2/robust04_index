			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy tries to limit foot and mouth restrictions THE ITALIAN agriculture and health authorities were yesterday attempting to limit the scope of restrictions imposed with effect from today by the European Community on the export of live cattle, sheep and pigs as well as processed meats following the discovery of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The outbreak occurred in the southern region of Basilicata but has spread to four other provinces including to important cattle centres in the Veneto. Livestock exports earn little more than L15bn (Pounds 6.5m) a year; but if restrictions on processed meats (hams, salamis etc) are extended beyond the March 31 deadline the damage could being serious as these earn L400bn a year. The main effect is already being felt in the domestic market. Since the outbreak was first discovered on March 10 3,921 animals have been slaughtered, including 2,000 sheep, 1,121 cattle and 652 pigs. The net loss is put at about L2.5bn. But at Monday's market at Modena in northern Italy, the most important in the country, there were fears the eventual losses could be high. In particular it was feared that lamb being reared for Easter would be badly affected. Farmers also said they feared the EC would take a tough line and use the outbreak of the disease as an excuse to force Italy to reduce its dairy herd in order to conform to the community's new milk quotas. Italy risks having to kill more than 400,000 head of cattle to conform with the quotas; and one scheme floated was to export this quantity to Albania as aid under an EC grant. The cause of the outbreak has still not been formally identified. However, magistrates are thought to be investigating purchases of cattle from Croatia. They were shipped via Greece through Italy's southern port of Bari.</p>

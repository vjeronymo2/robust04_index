			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips to 17-month low THE DOLLAR dipped to a 17-month low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday due to technical trading and continuing bearish sentiment over the US economy, writes James Blitz. With few economic indicators due out of the US this week, the currency continues to be overshadowed by last week's cut in interest rates and a feeling that the economy is into a triple-dip recession. That poor sentiment was compounded yesterday by the lack of any supportive comment from the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich. Indeed, Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary, said that the final communique, due out today, will contain no 'detailed language' on foreign exchange rates. 'There's nothing coming out of G7. That's why the dollar's been coming down for these last 48 hours,' said one trader at a leading US bank in London. The dollar closed yesterday at DM1.4980 from a previous close of DM1.5130. In late American trading, it was at a new low of DM1.4956. The question now is whether the dollar will sink to its all-time low against the German currency of DM1.4430 set on February 11, 1991. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London sees the dollar at the centre of a battle between two groups. 'On one side they are saying that the dollar is cheap and now is the time to buy. On the other side, the feeling is that the US economy is not recovering, that political uncertainty is increasing and that the thing to do is sell.' The lack of comment at the G7 meeting also had a negative effect on the Japanese yen. Investors had assumed that the G7 would openly support the yen to reduce the huge trade deficit that Japan has with the US. In the absence of this, the yen lost ground to the D-Mark yesterday, closing at Y83.02 from Y82.25. However analysts remain bullish about the yen, expecting the Japanese authorities to introduce a mixture of a fiscal boost and an interest rate cut. Sterling was again the principal loser in the European Monetary System. With no indicators issued in the UK, it was again dragged down by the dollar's weakness and finished at DM2.8850 from a previous close of DM2.8900. The currency is firmly at the bottom of the EMS grid and some dealers fear that it may soon reach its permitted lower limit against the Portuguese escudo, the strongest currency in the system. Although the Portuguese authorities hinted strongly at an interest rate cut on Monday, there is a 5.97 percentage point divergence between the two currencies, compared to the permitted divergence of 6.18.</p>

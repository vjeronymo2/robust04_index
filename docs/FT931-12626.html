			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris surges to Dollars 4.93bn PHILIP Morris, the large tobacco, food and beer manufacturer, yesterday reported a 17.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits last year, before the effect of accounting changes, to Dollars 4.93bn. The result was scored on a 4.7 per cent rise in operating revenues, at Dollars 59.1bn. In the fourth quarter alone, Philip Morris posted after-tax earnings of Dollars 1.2bn. This compared with Dollars 767m last time, but the previous year's figure was depressed by a Dollars 455m charge to cover restructuring in the food division. Operating revenue in the final quarter rose from Dollars 13.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 14.9bn last year - an 8.9 per cent improvement. Philip Morris's earnings per share last year stood at Dollars 5.45, up by 20 per cent over the 1991 (again, before accounting-related charges). The company had already signalled that it expected a rise of one-fifth in earnings per share, and the shares edged ahead only Dollars  1/8 on the news to Dollars 73 5/8 before the close. Mr Michael Miles, Philip Morris's chairman, said the group was 'optimistic' about prospects for 1993. He based this view on 'our growth and productivity initiatives, increasing volume momentum, and a narrowing of price gaps in a number of our key categories'. Philip Morris surprised the stock market at the time of its third-quarter results when it revealed that US cigarette shipments, in volume terms, had fallen slightly, and were expected to dip further in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, it said that cigarette volume for the full-year was down by 0.5 per cent, mainly due the previously-announced stock adjustments in domestic shipments and lower level of Russian exports.</p>

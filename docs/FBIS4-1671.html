These implementation measures are formulated in  accordance with the "Land Administration Law of the People's  Republic of China," and in light of the practical situation in  Zhejiang Province.    Article 2. Land is a valuable resource of the state. The  land in Zhejiang Province, which has a large population but  limited land resources, is especially precious. People's  governments at all levels must implement the guiding principles  governing rational utilization of the extremely valuable land.  An overall plan should be made, and efforts should be made to  strengthen the management, protection, development, and  utilization of land resources, and to curb wanton occupation of  arable land and indiscriminate use of land.    Article 3. According to legal provisions, land in urban  areas belongs to the whole people, which means it is owned by  the state. Land in the rural areas and city suburbs, other than  that owned by the state in accordance with legal provisions, is  collectively owned. Residential land, self-reserved land, and  mountains fall under collective ownership.    In accordance with the law, land under collective ownership  is collectively owned by rural peasants. Land which is already  owned by various collective economic organizations in villages  may be claimed to be owned collectively by peasants under their  respective collective rural economic organizations. Land which  is already owned by peasants' collective economic organizations  in townships and (towns) may be claimed to be owned collectively  by peasants in townships (towns).    Article 4. Land under collective ownership and state land  used by units owned by the whole people, or collective ownership  units may be contracted by collectives or individuals for  operations in agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry and  fishery production.

The right to contract land for business operations is  protected by law.    Article 5. All state-owned or collectively owned land  (inclusive of residential land, self-reserved land, and  mountains) shall not be occupied by any unit or individuals; nor  shall it be purchased and sold or transferred by other illegal  means.    Transfer of the right of use of state land and collectively  owned land shall be conducted in accordance with the relevant  provisions of the state and the province concerned.    Peasants shall enjoy the right to use contracted land,  residential land, self-reserved land, and mountains for specific  purposes in accordance with the relevant provisions.    Article 6. Ownership of collectively-owned land shall be  registered in a book, issued with a title in confirmation  thereof by the people's government at or above county level.    State-owned or collectively owned nonagricultural land  designated for construction purposes and used by units or  individuals shall be registered in a book, issued with a title  in confirmation thereof by the people's government at or above  the county level.

Approval  from urban planning departments is required if the construction  site is in an urban planning zone; when the construction  involves communications, environmental protection, cultural  relic protection, and fire fighting, approval from relevant  departments is also required.    (2) Following selection of a construction site and approval  of the initial design of the construction project, units which  use land for construction shall formally report land for  construction use to the local county-level land management  department by presenting approved relevant documents, a general  construction layout, and a topographic map. The land management  department shall preside over the signing of a land-requisition  compensation and settlement agreement between land-use units and  units whose land has been requisitioned, and report to the  people's government higher than the county-level for examination  and approval according to the power of examination and approval  stipulated in Article 25 of these procedures.    (3) Following the approval of the application for land-  requisition, the local county-level land management department  shall either make a one-time land allotment or make allotment of  land in several stages according to the progress of construction.    Except for requirements for disaster relief and for meeting  a  military emergency, units are forbidden to use the land first  and requisition the land later.    Article 25. The power of examination and approval in land  requisition:    The county-level land management department shall examine,  county-level people's government shall approve and report to  provincial and city land management departments for the  recording of the requisitioning of arable land (including  gardens and ponds for aquaculture -- the same applies for the  following) that is under 3 mu and the requisitioning of  nonarable land that is under 10 mu; the land management  department under the city which is directly under the  administration of the provincial government shall examine, city  people's government shall approve and report to provincial land  management department for the recording of requisitioning of  arable land over 3 mu until 5 mu and the requisitioning of  nonarable land over 10 mu until 20 mu; the provincial land  management department shall examine and the provincial  government shall approve the requisitioning of arable land over  5 mu and nonarable land over 20 mu; and the provincial people's  government shall examine and report to the State Council for  approval for the requisitioning of over 1,000 mu of arable land  and for over 2,000 mu of nonarable land.    When the need arises to make unified requisition of land for  comprehensive development of urban and rural areas and to carry  out supplementary infrastructure construction, urban and rural  construction departments shall, in line with approved  construction plans and construction projects as well as with the  power for examination and approval stipulated in the previous  clause, apply for land use and proceed with land-requisition  procedures.    A one-time instead of piecemeal application of and approval  for use of land for construction purposes should be made in line  with the general project design. Land requisition should be  carried out in stages for construction projects requiring  several stages for completion. Prior requisition of land for  future use is forbidden.    City and county people's governments shall not exceed the  province's set annual quota for construction-use land when  reporting, examining, and approving land for construction use.    Article 26. Units using requisitioned land shall pay the  following land compensation fee, green sapling compensation fee,  and ground appendix compensation fee:    (1) Land compensation fee: The standard of compensation for  requisitioned crop land shall be five to six times its annual  output value in the case of suburban areas of cities directly  under the provincial government; and four to five times in other  places. The annual output value shall be the average of the  three years preceding the requisition. Compensation for the  requisition of noncrop land shall, in general, not exceed 50  percent of the standard for crop land.    (2) Green sapling compensation fee: The standard of  compensation for green saplings on requisitioned land shall be  the output value of crops of the season.

Units using requisitioned land shall pay  relocation allowances in addition to various compensation fees.    The number of people to receive relocation allowances for  land requisitioned shall be based on the ratio between the area  of the land and the existing per capita crop land of units whose  land is requisitioned. The standard of relocation allowances  for every farming population shall be two to three times of the  crop land's average annual output value of the three years  preceding the requisition. The total of relocation allowances  per mu shall not exceed 10 times of the crop land's average  annual output value of the three years preceding the requisition.    Relocation allowances for requisition of noncrop land shall,  in general, not exceed 50 percent of local allowances for crop  land.

The following methods may be used if the land using unit is  required to arrange employment for surplus labor: (1) The land  using unit shall give priority to hiring workers who meet its  employment qualifications; (2) employment service agencies may  be entrusted to find employment; and (3) other methods.  Relocation allowances shall be paid to employment agencies.  Individuals who are seeking jobs for themselves shall be paid  relocation allowance. The number of jobs to be arranged shall be  calculated on the basis of the ratio between the requisitioned  land and the original size of the farmland, and its agricultural  households should be shifted to nonagricultural fields in  accordance with relevant regulations of the province.    Article 31. After the taxable land of a unit is  requisitioned, the land administration department of county  people's governments shall be responsible for adjusting its  agricultural taxes and contract grain purchasing quotas.

Article 35. Unless permission to postpone its use has been  granted by the original organ which approved the requisition,  land which has remained idle two years after its requisition  shall be recovered by the local people's government at the  country level. The matter shall be reported to the approving  organ for the record. Arbitrary disposal of the land by the  original land using unit shall not be prohibited. No other unit  or individual is permitted to seize the land.    Article 36. When land is temporarily needed for project  construction, storage of raw materials, transportation, or other  facilities, this problem shall be solved by using the  requisitioned land. If land must be borrowed for temporary use,  the land using unit shall submit an application stating the  amount of land to be borrowed and the time limit for its use.  If the amount of land to be borrowed is below 10 mu, the  application must be submitted to a county-level land  administration department for approval; if the amount of land to  be borrowed is between 10 and 20 mu, the application must be  submitted to a city land administration department for approval;  if the amount exceeds 20 mu, the application must be submitted  to the provincial land administration department for approval.

Land requisition shall be permitted when a jointly run  enterprise established through joint investment between an  agricultural economic organization and a unit owned by the whole  people or an urban collective unit wishes to use rural  collective land. The agricultural economic organization may use  the land use right as a condition for participating in the joint  enterprise, but it must submit a land use application to a land  aministrative department together with the construction project  documents and the agreement signed by both parties approved by a  planning department or a competent department at or above the  county level. The application shall be handled in accordance  with the examination and approval authority stipulated in  Article 25 of these Measures.    Article 38.

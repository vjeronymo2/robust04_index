			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 May (EFE) -- Today, Acting Prime  Minister Robert Malval described as illegal the appointment of  Emile Jonassaint as Haiti's provisional president and stated  that he does not recognize "this act, which is contrary to the  Constitution." He added that a situation has been reached  whereby "those entrusted with the mission of safeguarding  national sovereignty are the persons who endanger it."    Jonassaint was appointed provisional president by a group of  senators headed by Bernard Sansaricq and with the support of the  Armed Forces and Army Commander Raoul Cedras.    Malval, who resigned in December but who remained as acting  prime minister until constitutional President Jean Bertrand  Aristide appoints his replacement, called on "patriots and  responsible people to oppose this forceful coup, which is  against the Constitution and the Governor's Island agreements  signed" in New York. This agreement establishes Aristide's  return to power, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a  group of military officers.    Meanwhile in Washington, President Aristide's spokesman,  Jean  Claude Martinau, said Jonassaint was president of an illegal  supreme court, therefore his presidency is illegal. Martinau  upholds that this government will have the same fate as previous  governments appointed by the military and that he will be used  as a puppet.    Victor Benoit, leader of the National Congress of Democratic  Forces party, condemned the action and called it "illegitimate  and illegal." Benoit said he will stay home and stop going to  the Ministry of National Education, Youth, and Sports.    Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the extreme right Mobilization  for National Development, backed Jonassaint's appointment as  acting president. De Ronceray believes the Senate carried out a  patriotic act by designating Jonassaint and that the decision  will "put the house in order." He added that "we must prepare  to successfully face all international community challenges."    U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing sent Jonassaint  a  letter requesting that he respect the Haitian Constitution, in  which the judge took part. [sentence as received] Swing  described the act as illegitimate and called on Jonassaint to  join those who wish to defend that Constitution.    Likewise, the union sector condemned Jonassaint's  appointment  and said this will facilitate U.S. diplomatic games to occupy  the country. A Haitian Workers Central leader said Sansaricq,  Jonassaint, and those who back this maneuver will be the persons  primarily responsible for a military intervention. The labor  leader believes that all Jonassaint's acts as president are null  and without a future. The labor leader also said that  Jonassaint's appointment is a coup within a coup d'etat against  Aristide.    The National Federation of Popular Organizations  [Confederacion Nacional de las Organizaciones Populares],  through its Secretary General Banes Cherestal, described the  appointment as a new coup d'etat that will worsen the situation  of extreme poverty the people of Haiti are in. Cherestal asked  himself who does Senator Sansaricq work for and what is his true  goal. The union leader made several proposals to resolve the  crisis and mentioned among them that Gen. Cedras resign, as he  promised within the framework of the Governor's Island  agreement. He also proposed amnesty for the military members,  that Aristide appoint a prime minister, Aristide's return in a  reasonable time period, and that UN sanctions be lifted.</p>

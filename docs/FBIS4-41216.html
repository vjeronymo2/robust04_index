			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Our television agency received interesting  information today from the public relations center of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, which we give almost in full.    On 21 June, operatives from the Moscow city directorate of  internal affairs--with the support of 20,000 men of the  Dzerzhinskiy Motor Rifle Division of interior troops--carried  out a citywide preventive operation code-named Hurricane. In 24  hours, the special service visited 689 sites. Of these, 14  hotels, the offices of 232 commercial structures and banks, and  four markets were inspected. At 27 parking lots and 43 main  vehicle inspectorate checkpoints, 1,053 motor vehicles were  inspected.    A total of 2,251 people were detained for investigation.  Administrative proceedings have been instituted against 759 of  them. The operations of 193 commercial structures have been  suspended. A total of 292 crimes were registered, and 219 were  solved. Twenty-three previously stolen vehicles were found.</p>

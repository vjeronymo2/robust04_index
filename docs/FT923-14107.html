			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Competition policy 'lacks deterrent' CURRENT competition policy fails to deter business from adopting or considering anti-competitive behaviour, according to the former senior economics adviser to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Writing in the Consumers' Association's Consumer Policy Review, Mr Robin Aaronson says most UK companies look at competition policy in the wrong way and do not plan rationally around the constraints it imposes. As evidence, he quoted Tate &amp; Lyle, a company with nearly half the market for a product, which bid twice for the company with the other half. Both attempts were rejected after referral. He says that all the evidence suggests a failure by the corporate sector to balance regulatory risk against commercial advantage. Competition policy in the UK is effective only when the authorities make a direct intervention in a particular case. Its deterrent effect is much weaker. The costs of such lack of knowledge and understanding to the economy are severe, he says. Large sums are spent on planning mergers and complying with the Takeover Code and wasted when mergers are blocked. Small businesses damaged by anti-competitive behaviour may go out of business before the authorities have time to take action. Consumers suffer directly by paying excessive prices for longer than they should. Mr Aaronson suggests that policy changes could encourage business to take more account of competition issues. In particular, the system of guidance to companies offered by the Office of Fair Trading could be improved. The authorities could also help if they gave clear explanations of their decisions. Mr Aaronson says the proliferation of competition authorities also causes confusion, and combining the roles of the MMC and the OFT might provide a solution. Writing in the same issue of Consumer Policy Review, however, MMC chairman Sir Sydney Lipworth says the OFT and MMC should not be merged.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Veldina: ``AIDS: Not Yet an Epidemic, </F> But...'']    [Text] It's not my habit to read newspapers in  the metro. So, having eyed the tired, ordinary faces opposite  me, I raised my gaze to an advertisement inviting us to be  tested in the AIDS diagnosis office of the Institute imeni  Sklifosovskiy. I liked the invitation. Not in the sense that I  had any apprehensions about myself but because the entire  procedure cost three ice creams--150 rubles.    We don't see huge columns of tragic numbers at the  Sklifosovskiy Institute's laboratory of clinical immunology and  AIDS diagnosis yet, thank God. This year only six persons were  registered with a positive HIV test, two of them being  foreigners. (Let's compare with previous years: eight persons in  1991, five of whom were foreign students, and 13 in 1992, to  include 10 of our fellow countrymen).    Approximately 85 percent of all tests represent those  carried  out officially and mandatorily prior to surgical operations, or  those necessary for travel abroad. The rest are anonymous, from  60 to 100 persons a day.    Sergey Kudryashov, a doctor and a lab technician, can't say  yet that AIDS has reached epidemic proportions. But there are of  course no grounds for reassurance. If the figures of this  laboratory may be considered to be not entirely indicative, here  are data from the Russian AIDS Control Center: 650 Russian  citizens infected with immunodeficiency virus have been  registered, and 81 persons have already died as of the beginning  of this year. Foreigners make up an extremely substantial  number--421 (since 1987). In this case 82 infected former Soviet  citizens were registered in 1991, 85 were registered in 1992,  and this year just 38 have been registered as yet. There were 13  foreigners in 1991, 26 in 1992 and three in 1993.    As you can see, while the number of infected persons is  steadily rising, an abrupt increase has not yet occurred. Vadim  Pokrovskiy, the director of the Russian AIDS Control Center,  feels that this is associated with the effectiveness of certain  measures, as a result of which the natural transmission pathway  has now been practically closed off. Thus, since 1987 not a  single case of infection with the virus during blood transfusion  has occurred. Infections arising as a result of the use of dirty  syringes have not occurred since 1990. However, sexual  transmission of the infection is gaining momentum. Of the total  number of adults possessing the immunodeficiency virus 30  percent are women. Homosexuals are not far behind. Their share  is 30-40 percent. What is surprising is that not a single case  of infection associated with drug use has yet been registered.    ``What we need first of all is effective  prevention--training  and education,'' said Vadim Pokrovskiy.    It wouldn't be bad for the government and the Supreme Soviet  to remember this. After all, a state AIDS control program still  hasn't been adopted.</p>

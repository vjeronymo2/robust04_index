			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Rank sells advertising business THE RANK Organisation yesterday sold its screen advertising business to RSA Advertising, a new company backed by Schroder Ventures, in a deal worth about Pounds 21m. Rank Screen Advertising, founded in 1938 as a subsidiary of Odeon Theatres, is the dominant company in cinema advertising with an 85 per cent share of the market. In 1990 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that the company had a monopoly position but that it did not operate against the public interest. Rank decided that screen advertising did not fit in with its main film distribution business. The company will be run by Mr Keith Shepherd, a former senior executive of Thorn-EMI. Mr Peter Howard-Williams, managing director of Rank Screen Advertising, decided not to stay. Finance for the deal is being provided by a syndicate led by NM Rothschild and including the Bank of Scotland. Rank Screen Advertising has turnover of about Pounds 20m a year and revenues have been increasing at an annual rate of 20 per cent partly because of increasing cinema audiences. Its only significant rival is Pearl &amp; Dean.</p>

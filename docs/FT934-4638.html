			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (11): Lobster might creep off the plate  -A close look at two of the best restaurants in the city The best restaurant within the city of Zurich these days is, by general consent, Tubli, a small establishment in a narrow street in Niederdorf behind the city's leading fishmonger's shop. Lights strung along the wall of the restaurant twinkle brightly, providing a warm welcome in an otherwise dark alley. The warmth continues inside, where the small staff seem genuinely pleased to see you and seek throughout the evening to sustain a quietly festive atmosphere. The restaurant is in a small room, with low vaulted ceilings and probably only a dozen tables. The walls are bare white, but for a few pictures of pigeons (Tubli means little pigeon in Swiss German). The menu is utter simplicity. There is a single daily fixed price seven-course programme, with the option to take fewer courses for reduced prices. The menu consists of pasta and salad courses alternating with two fish courses and ending up with pigeon, all for SFr145 (about Pounds 65 or Dollars 96) per person. For vegetarians or others who insist on something else, Mr Martin Surbeck, the enthusiastic young chef, aims to please. We both had the menu, and found everything fresh and pleasantly presented, but nothing particularly memorable. We also felt slightly cramped under the vaults and found ourselves whispering to each other. No such inhibitions emerged at Petermann's Kunststube, a roadside restaurant cum contemporary art gallery in the lakeside suburb of Kusnacht, a 10-minute drive from the city centre. This restaurant, too, is quite small, but the high ceilings, warm dark panelled wainscotting, immense vase of fresh flowers by the entry and well-separated tables give a sense of relaxed spaciousness. The clientele seemed more the comfortable suburban horsey set whereas at Tubli one felt among the earnestly upwardly mobile. And from the arrival of the complimentary duck pate on tomato aspic hors d'oeuvre, one has an expectation of something special. As at Tubli, there was a set six-course meal, complete with cheeses and Creme brule, for SFr160, but there is also a substantial a la carte selection, which we also sampled. As befits a restaurant attached to an art gallery, the presentation of many of the courses was outstanding, usually on delicate Paloma Picasso plates. The lasagne lobster looked as if he might just creep off the plate; a course featuring a slice of veal pate was composed in such a way that it could be admired from every angle. The seafood consomme was delightfully tangy and the beef in a light balsamic vinegar sauce a discovery. The cheeses were mainly standard Swiss and French, but very fresh. A chocolate glazed pear on a bed of fruit and praline sauces was more memorable - and not only visually - than the creme brule. Alas, although the restaurant was not full, the service occasionally flagged, and we ended up waiving coffee rather than extend our visit beyond four hours. Tubli, Schneggengasse 8, tel 251-2471.

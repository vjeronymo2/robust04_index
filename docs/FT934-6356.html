			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shares in Caledonia Investments rise 33p as profits reach Pounds 25m Shares in Caledonia Invest-ments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family, rose 33p to close at 568p as a dull market welcomed its 27 per cent increase in net asset value per share at the half way stage and interim pre-tax profits up almost 30 per cent. Net asset value rose to 625p (491p) after the cumulative write off of some 40p per share in goodwill on acquisitions. Pre-tax profits, which reached Pounds 25m (Pounds 19.3m) in the six months to September 30, included a Pounds 3m profit on the sale of operations and investments. Mr Peter Buckley, deputy chairman and chief executive, conceded that Pounds 128m (Pounds 140m) in cash and near-cash was not ideal against a background of low interest rates. He could envisage the company one day having gearing: 'We have received Pounds 427m since 1987 and we have been making selective purchases with an emphasis on finding our way into more trading situations since then.' Profits from trading subsidiaries increased to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.4m), reflecting an improvement in nearly all sectors. Income from associated companies also rose strongly to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 5.9m) on the back of a good performance by Bristow Helicopters and the inclusion of a full six months profit from Exco, the money broker. Income from investments fell by Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 6m because of a one-off dividend related to the flotation of the Telegraph received in the comparative period and a decision to book dividends at ex-dividend date rather than at cash received. Earnings per share rose to 18.9p (14p) and the dividend is lifted to 5.4p (5p). COMMENT The company's recently-announced Dollars 44m (Pounds 29.5m) move into leisure overseas via a joint venture with some old business partners looks bold. But Caledonia's record for astute deals includes its sale of a controlling stake in British and Commonwealth Holdings just before the share price peaked and subsequent mopping up of some of B&amp;C's businesses from administrators. The Cayzer caution means the net asset value per share is probably still less than what could be realised. Mr Buckley, himself a Cayzer, hopes there is more value in the unlisted associated companies which posted good results this time. If so, shares are trading at a discount to a net asset value which understates the worth of the company. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 49m for the full year.</p>

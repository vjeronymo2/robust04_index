			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Carrefour lifts profits 10.6% CARREFOUR, one of France's largest retailing groups, yesterday announced that it had overcome its problems in the first half of last year to produce a 10.6 per cent increase in net profits for the full year to FFr1.33bn (Dollars 287m) in 1992 from FFr1.21bn in 1991. The group which, like other French retailers, has been affected by the sluggish economic environment saw net profits fall in the first half of 1992. The news of the decline triggered the resignation of Mr Michel Bon who, as chairman, had orchestrated the company's expansion in the 1980s. Carrefour continued to face difficult trading conditions in the second half of last year. However, it managed to increase sales by 16.7 per cent to FFr117.14bn in 1992 from FFr100.38bn in 1991. Euromarche, the hypermarket group that Carrefour acquired in 1991, made a full-year's contribution to the 1992 figures but contributed for only six months in 1991. The board proposed raising the dividend for 1992 to FFr35, against FFr32.5 in the previous year. Carrefour benefited from a profit of FFr287m on the sale of its Pyrca subsidiary but also made a special charge of FFr291m for writing off goodwill on the Euromarche deal. Mr Jacques Fournier, who succeeded Mr Bon as chairman last autumn, has continued to sell off peripheral interests to raise capital for the group which is now investing heavily in new technology and stock control systems.</p>

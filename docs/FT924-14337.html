			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE STRONG rally on Wall Street late on Thursday along with continued talk of a cut in interest rates provided the spur for the first half of trading in Friday's session, before the early decline on Wall Street and dimming rate hopes led to a retreat in the afternoon, writes Joel Kibazo. The December contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,583 and was soon carried forward by the speculation on interest rates, reaching the session's high of 2,608 at around 11am. The lack of further news on that front led to a tail off in buying. The 11.30am release of the inflation figures for September in line with expectations had no significant impact on trading. Arbitrage activity mid-afternoon, as the contract traded at a discount, led to a reversal in the fortunes of December and it closed at 2,575, just two points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was 9,316 lots. Traded options were dull with turnover falling to 26,520 contracts by the close and the FT-SE 100 option trading a mere 6,984 lots. Barclays Bank was the most actively dealt stock option at 4,030.</p>

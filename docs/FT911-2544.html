			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Prague cuts taxes to boost output CZECHOSLOVAKIA is lowering company turnover taxes and relaxing credit controls in a supply-side attempt to stimulate flagging industrial production. Output fell nearly 12 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period of 1990. The largest decline was in the building industry where output fell 35 per cent. From May 1 the highest rate of turnover tax will drop from 32 to 29per cent. The middle band falls from 22 to 20 per cent and the lowest from 12 to 11 per cent. The government will also loosen bank lending restrictions to help stimulate investment, according to Mr Ivan Svitek, an advisor to Mr Vaclav Klaus, the finance minister, who advocates radical economic reforms. An IMF team in Prague has told the Finance Ministry that it regards economic indicators other than output favourably. The balance of payments deficit of Dollars 250m in the first three months was considerably better than anticipated. The deficit fell to only Dollars 29m in March. A current account deficit of Dollars 2.5bn had been expected for the entire year. The government has responded to the lower deficit byreducing a surcharge on imports from 20 per cent to 18 per cent, also starting tomorrow. Further reductions will follow and the surcharge, strongly criticised abroad, will be eliminated shortly. Inflation, which soared to 37 per cent in the first quarter because of a sharp cut in subsidies and resulting higher prices in January, eased to 4.7 per cent in March, when food prices dropped 2per cent as a result of greater competition. The inflation rate is expected to be even lower this month but will rise again in May when subsidies are removed on domestic electricity and heating, Mr Svitek said. Subsidies on rents,which typically cover half the amount paid, are to be removed this summer.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Motoring: Go for a spin in safety Cars are getting so much smarter than the people who use them that they will soon be equipped with electronic systems taking decisions out of the driver's hands. It all began some years ago with ABS (or anti-lock) brakes that allow drivers to stamp on the pedal and then steer round obstacles without losing control - whereas panic braking on wet roads in cars without ABS often causes accidents. The reason is that a car slows down much better when the tyres are just revolving than when they are sliding. And as sliding tyres have no sideways grip, the front ones cannot steer the car and the back ones cannot prevent the tail from swinging out of line. But ABS works properly only if you slam on the brakes as hard as you can and keep trying to push the pedal through the floor until the car stops. Research by Lucas and Mercedes-Benz has shown that seven out of 10 drivers of ABS-equipped cars get it wrong. In an emergency, they slam on the brakes quickly enough but then ease off slightly. This means the full benefit of the servo mechanism, which boosts braking power, is lost. Stopping the car takes longer than it need. So, Lucas and Mercedes-Benz have evolved an electronically controlled brake booster that senses emergency braking. It then keeps the brake-boosting servo fully on even if the driver is no longer pressing the pedal as hard as possible. The system will start to appear on Mercedes-Benz cars from the 1996 model year. Ken Maciver, managing director of Lucas Braking Systems, describes the electronic actuation system (EAS) as the biggest advance in braking since ABS was introduced more than 20 years ago. EAS not only allows ABS brakes to work with full efficiency - it also prevents a leaden-footed driver from spinning the drive wheels during acceleration, and even helps prevent a car from drifting off line in a bend taken too fast. There has been a lot of emphasis recently on passive safety: on things such as air bags, crumple zones and side intrusion bars to protect occupants when a car crashes. All of this is well and good - but it must be better not to have a crash in the first place. This is where active safety systems such as EAS come in. Also under development by Mercedes-Benz, although some way off production, is an intelligent cruise control system. If fitted to cars as routinely as heater / demisters and stereos now are, it would get rid of those motorway menaces, the tail-gaters. They are a prime cause of multiple crashes because they follow so closely that, when the traffic slows suddenly, they cannot help running into the car in front. The Mercedes-Benz system uses infra-red transmitters integrated into a headlamp to monitor the traffic in front. A computer calculates the safe headway for the car and maintains it by operating the accelerator and brake. It is, of course, only a thought - but if drivers were half as intelligent as the Mercedes-Benz cruise control, they would always keep a proper distance from the car in front and reduce speed on slippery roads. Then, none of these clever electronic devices would be necessary.</p>

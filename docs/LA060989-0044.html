			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'THE MORMONS' AT HIGHWAYS  </P> <P> Two lanky, sultry Mormon missionaries mince and moan in "Meet the Mormons," a  piece of outrageous camp starring Curtis York and Robert Daniels. Performed at  Highways in Santa Monica this week (and repeating Monday and June 19), the  evening is sui generis. The duo's eccentricities are frequently charming, but  the pace and tone sometimes go slack and voices too often zoom from purr to  scream when a lower decibel level might be more effective.  </P> <P> York, who looks surprisingly plausible in lipstick, dangling earrings, black  skirt and high heels, offers a memory of being 7 years old and attending a  church-sponsored Mother's Day ceremony in which potted geraniums were passed  down the rows of children to each mother. The day had an ugly ending -- a  violent and only dimly remembered sexual assault. "It was like I had to start  covering something up," he says, working his nylon-encased legs as if an itch  wouldn't stop.  </P> <P> At 13, the glowering bishop (York does this role too) questions him  suspiciously about his sex life to determine his worthiness for special church  work. A terrible feeling of "airlessness" had begun to descend again, York  says, whereupon he sheds his top, revealing a black bustier, and segues into a  graceful blue boa-waving number called "Goddess's Rage."  </P> <P> Daniels, transformed into the Trailer Park woman via a wig, metallic red  fingernails and rubber breasts, has a dulcet-toned telephone chat with a  girlfriend interrupted by an interminable call from her daughter, who has run  away and gotten into all kinds of trouble. Daniels has this woman down pat,  including the hair-adjusting gestures and the S-curved body. But she's such a  cliche ("They told me all I had to do was take Home Ec!" she cries) that one  soon wearies of her.  </P> <P> The heart of the evening is the place where the Mormon religion and  homosexuality meet -- the intersection of childhood wholesomeness and terror,  of being a missionary who is supposed to deliver the word of God and being a  performer compelled to deliver the truth about himself. Although it's fun to  see York as the skipping, wand-waving Pink Goddess -- and tolerable to indulge  Daniels as a singing Dinah Shore -- we often seem far afield from the deeper  issues these guys have introduced.

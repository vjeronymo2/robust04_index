			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Globex backers split over withdrawal of Liffe from talks THE LONDON International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange's exit from discussions to join Globex last week has split the three backers of the electronic after-hours futures trading system. The Chicago Board of Trade's refusal to let Liffe list its German bund contract on Globex has angered its Globex partners, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, the electronic information group, prompting speculation that Reuters may seek other exchanges to become primary partners in the system. Although the CBoT and the CME control Globex's content and development, Reuters has invested an estimated Dollars 78m in the system, which it intends to recover from transactions fees. Liffe, with its lively trade in bund and Euromark futures would have added much-needed volume to Globex. The CBoT intends to trade bund futures on its own trading floor sometime in the future. Describing the current situation as 'volatile', Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the exchange was ready to re-open negotiations with Globex if the issue of listing Liffe's bund contracts were resolved. In letters to Mr Patrick Arbor, the chairman of CBoT, Reuters and Mr Jack Sander, CME's chairman, have suggested that the CBoT's action was self-interested and at odds with Globex's goals. 'We believe the position on bund contracts you have taken with Liffe is inconsistent with the Globex agreement,' a Reuters executive wrote in a letter to Mr Arbor on August 2, a week before the Liffe discussions were terminated. In a reply to Reuters, Mr Arbor, wrote: 'In considering the best interest of the Globex system, the Board of Trade is not required to ignore its own best interests.' Mr Arbor could not be reached for comment yesterday, but Mr Thomas Donovan, CBoT's president, said the exchange remained committed to Globex. During its first year of operation, which ended in June, Globex had volume of 1.294m contracts, far below projections. Half of that volume originated on Matif, the French futures exchange. The CME generated two-thirds of the remaining volume, with the CBoT the smallest contributor. It is unlikely that the North American exchanges will be able to meet a contractual agreement with Reuters to produce 50,000 or more in volume per night by April 1994. If that goal is not met, Reuters or the exchanges will be free to terminate the contract. If so, Reuters could seek other partners in the system.</p>

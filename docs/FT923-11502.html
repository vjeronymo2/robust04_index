			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: US chemical unit advances 39% to Dollars 170m RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned chemicals group, yesterday reported a 39 per cent rise in net profits for the first six months of this year. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's net earnings rose from Dollars 122m in the first half of last year to Dollars 170m in the six months to the end of June. This was on sales up by 6.7 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, excluding currency changes and the disposal of non-strategic product lines. The group, formed two years ago from the merger of Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceuticals division with Rorer, the US drugs company, plans to invest more than Dollars 500m on research and development in 1992. Sales growth was generally spread across the group's main markets, although US sales were affected in the second quarter by destocking by wholesalers. However, demand for the group's main prescription drugs continued to grow. Mr Robert Cawthorn, chairman, was satisfied with this performance in a 'challenging environment'. The group was on track to meet its earnings objectives in the current half, he said. Earnings per share rose from 89 cents to Dollars 1.24.</p>

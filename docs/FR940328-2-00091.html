			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has historically been concerned that book orders get bypassed when stock is stopped, especially in a minimum variation market. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  Based on the NYSE's experience to date, the Commission believes that additional data is necessary before the Commission can determine whether there are sufficient grounds to conclude that this long-standing concern has been alleviated. Thus to ensure that Rule 116.30, as amended, does not harm public customers with limit orders on the specialist's book, the NYSE should provide detailed facts supporting its arguments about the impact of the pilot procedures. The Commission therefore requests that the NYSE conduct another review of this issue. At a minimum, the NYSE should determine how often limit orders against which stock is stopped in a minimum variation market are executed by the close of the day's trading. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Further, the NYSE should conduct, on a date to be selected by the Commission, another one-day review of all book orders in the ten stocks receiving the greatest number of stops, and should submit to the Commission both raw trade data for, <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  and a description of the final disposition of, <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  each such order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., SEC, Report of the Special Study of the Securities Markets of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 95, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. Pt. 2 (1963). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the NYSE would first calculate the total number of shares of limit orders against which stock is stopped in minimum variation markets (including book orders on the opposite side of the market from stopped orders which do not receive price improvement). The NYSE would then determine how many of those shares actually are executed by the close of the day's trading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, the Commission requests that the NYSE submit the documentation the NYSE is relying upon to support its conclusions about the final disposition of these limit book orders. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Infra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 18. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the NYSE report describes its compliance efforts ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> automated surveillance, review of Floor Official records, information memos, continuing education). The Commission believes that these programs provide specialists with adequate notice of their responsibilities. Similarly, the Exchange has sufficient means to determine whether a specialist complied with the amendments' order size and aggregate share thresholds and, if not, whether Floor Official approval was obtained for larger parameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the NYSE will continue to monitor closely specialist compliance with Rule 116.30's procedures. As before, the NYSE should determine how often orders requiring Floor Official approval to be stopped do not receive such approval. In so doing, the NYSE should distinguished between instances where the specialist did not ask for permission and those where it was denied (and, if so, on what grounds). The NYSE should gather and report information about the market conditions prevailing at the time of each instance of specialist non-compliance with these procedures and the action taken by the Exchange in response thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission requests that the NYSE submit a report describing its findings on these matters, specifically (1) the effect of Rule 116.30, as amended, on limit book orders and (2) specialist compliance with the pilot program procedures, by December 31, 1994. In addition, if the Exchange determines to request an extension of the pilot program beyond March 21, 1995, the Commission requests that the NYSE also submit a proposed rule change by December 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds food cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue on an uninterrupted basis. In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are the identical procedures that were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received in connection with the proposed rule change which implemented these procedures.

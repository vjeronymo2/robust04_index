			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Nightmare before Christmas on the QE2: The trials and tribulations of passengers Early last Sunday Andrew Lennox was cold, stiff and fed up. After sleeping for three hours in a corridor, he got up, adjusted the hard hat he had put on for safety, and set off to find somewhere more comfortable. A sign saying Purser's Office reminded him where he was. This was not an unfinished Spanish hotel but the Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's most famous passenger liner and what the chief executive of Cunard, its owner, would later call a 'national heritage monument'. As Mr Lennox wandered deeper into the ship, it hardly resembled a monument. Cables and pipes protruded from holes in the ceiling, building equipment was strewn everywhere, and cabin furniture stacked in open spaces. Some passengers without cabins were sleeping on mattresses, while some of the 400 workers still on board were making themselves comfortable as best they could. Later this week, as news of conditions on the QE2 filled the newspapers, what started as an inconvenience for passengers turned into a public relations disaster for the liner and its operator. The reputation of the British ship outfitting industry was also threatened as tales of the 'Horror Cruise' emerged. For Mr Lennox, the priority was getting to sleep. Spying an empty cabin on 3-Deck which at least had a bed in it, he lay down. Not the ideal start to his 30th birthday. It was also not the way Cunard executives had planned the QE2's Pounds 30m refit. Twenty-five years after the liner's maiden voyage, the refurbishment was supposed to prepare it for the 21st century. 'We had to invest in the vessel or take another course,' said Mr Robin Wilkins, Cunard's commercial director. The 'other course' was building a new liner. In addition to structural alterations, all 963 cabins - 720 with en suite bathrooms - were to be re-equipped; three restaurants, the casino and the library rebuilt; and two new nightclubs and a pub constructed. To save on the costs of keeping the liner in dry dock, the refit was to be attempted in just a month. Although workmen would be on board from July, the ship would be out of service only from November 14 to December 14 - leaving it ready to sail on its Christmas cruise on December 17. That meant thousands of workers from more than 50 companies being flown to Hamburg's Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard to work to a complex timetable. Cunard admitted the programme was ambitious but said it was achievable. 'All the contractors knew what they were undertaking and were prepared to tender for it. They convinced us they could finish on time,' said Mr Michael Gallagher of Cunard. By late November, the QE2 was in dry dock and virtually unrecognisable, buried under a mass of cables, cranes, ladders and workers. On December 13, as planned, it sailed for Southampton, the vast majority of the work complete. But inside, a small number of contractors had fallen behind. When the ship docked in Southampton the next day, Cunard officials were alarmed at the state of the cabins and neighbouring corridors, but said they were assured by contractors that hundreds of men working round the clock could transform the ship in just a few days. On Friday December 16, further inspections convinced Cunard officials that not everyone due to sail on the QE2 the next day could be accommodated. Determined not to cancel the cruise, Cunard decided to contact some of the passengers and offer compensation if they abandoned their trip. 'We felt we had a duty and obligation to fulfil the holiday requirements over the Christmas period. We felt it was very important to stick to that schedule,' said Mr John Olsen, Cunard's chief executive. Only 300 passengers could be contacted. Several hundred others arriving in Southampton the following day faced an unpleasant shock. Most passengers knew nothing of the problems. They checked in about 2pm and settled down in the passenger lounge to wait for the 5pm departure. At 4.30pm Cunard announced there had been a short delay and the ship would sail at 6pm. Boarding began, with round-the-world cruise passengers escorted on first. Two hours later, stewards entered the lounge where almost 300 passengers were still waiting and made an announcement: owing to delayed completion of refitting work, insufficient cabins were available and no more passengers could be taken on board. 'That was perhaps the worst moment of all,' said Mr Lennox. 'There was absolute chaos.' The next few hours passed in confusion, as 190 passengers agreed to go home in return for a full refund, and a free cruise next year, plus Pounds 250 spending money. Added to the 300 whose holidays were cancelled the day before, that made 490 passengers left behind. Another 80 insisted on boarding the ship anyway, knowing their cabins would not be ready. The ship sailed six hours late at 11pm, with many still looking for somewhere to sleep. Many of the public areas, as Cunard claimed, had been finished to a high standard. But in some areas, especially towards the rear of the ship and on 3-Deck, conditions resembled a 'building site'. Mr Andrew Coad, a Briton living in Montclair, New Jersey, said: 'The higher up the deck, the less dissatisfied people were. The predominant problems appeared to be on 2-Deck and 3-Deck.' Mr Coad, who ended up on 3-Deck, said he and his wife were originally given a room that had water slopping in the entrance, no carpet, and builders' materials in the middle of the floor. 'Eventually we went to the purser's office and they told us the ship was about to sail.' He demanded that the ship did not sail until they had satisfaction. Mr Coad and his wife were taken to another cabin that at first seemed acceptable but had no running water. 'It was three days before we got running water and 3 1/2 days before the toilet would flush,' Mr Coad said. Mrs Katherine Justice, 70, and her friend Mrs Megan Taverner, 73, said they were both suffering from sickness and diarrhoea, but their cabin had no water, no air conditioning and no flushing toilet. 'We washed in a carafe with two flannels,' Mrs Justice said. 'They gave us a wine carafe - they put that in there, with ice - and as soon as the ice melted, we used our flannels to wash: her flannel first, then mine after, for two days. 'It's horrific what happened to us. We are not the nouveaux riches. It's a dream, isn't it, the QE2 - somebody kind and loving to look after your every need. We couldn't even get water.' Mr Stewart Manville, a 67-year-old museum archivist from White Plains, New York, said: 'I think the basic problem was that the plumbing job was done in too much of a hurry. Several times a day you would hear the announcement 'Niagara] Niagara] Niagara]' which meant that the special team that was there to stem the leaks would come running. 'When I first got on, my toilet worked, thank God. But I was helping a contractor find bedrooms for some of his workers, and we tried several cabins where the toilets weren't working. Eventually we figured out that if you took the douche spray from the bath and sprayed it into the toilet, you could make it flush.' To cap everything, the QE2 ran into force nine gales shortly after leaving Southampton. Seasickness among passengers and workers caused further delays to refitting, and on Tuesday another 158 UK passengers due to join the cruise in New York had their holidays cancelled. Cunard's nightmare was worsening. Back in London, Cunard found the spotlight trained on its handling of the affair. Industry observers believe it made many mistakes. The first was going ahead with the cruise. A hotel company executive aboard the ship said: 'The best option would have been to cancel the cruise, apologise and give everyone their money back.' A second mistake was the failure to take on public relations consultants, but rely instead on Cunard's two beleaguered press spokesmen to handle hundreds of calls from the world's media. 'They should have taken on a good agency and begun a massive damage limitation exercise as soon as the problems began last Saturday,' said a PR consultant. Perhaps the biggest mistake, having allowed the cruise to go ahead, was to fail to make any apology or compensation offer to passengers as they crossed the Atlantic. 'That was what really irritated us,' said Mr Lennox. 'We never got any kind of apology from Cunard. But we knew people left behind had already been offered compensation.' 'We have no complaints about the crew, who were absolutely marvellous,' he added. 'But Cunard's attitude was terrible.' Disgruntled passengers met the liner's captain, Ron Warwick, last Tuesday and asked him to secure an apology and compensation offer from Cunard. On Wednesday, at an angry meeting with about 250 passengers, Capt Warwick reported that Cunard had simply advised passengers to write to their nearest Cunard office when they arrived home. Some passengers were incensed. About 150, of whom Mr Lennox emerged as leader, threatened a sit-in in New York until Cunard directors came on board with offers of compensation. Not all passengers agreed on the action to be taken, however. Speaking from the ship on Wednesday, Mr Peter Ludlow, a passenger travelling with his girlfriend on a Pounds 7,500 cruise to the Caribbean, remarked: 'It's all getting quite factional here, among the passengers. It's getting a bit like Bosnia.' The next day Cunard began its fightback. Mr Olsen gave a press conference in New York to confirm he would meet the ship. As the QE2 docked in New York on Thursday night, 11 hours late but in a better condition than it had left Southampton, Mr Olsen was waiting with soothing words, an offer of reimbursement for the transatlantic leg of all passengers' journeys and 25 per cent off another Cunard cruise. The threatened sit-in was averted but yesterday passengers faced further delays in sailing after the US Coastguard refused to give the ship a safety certificate. US passengers were reported to be planning a class action suit which, if successful, could cost Cunard millions of dollars. In total, the company already faces the cost of reimbursing about 1,000 passengers who had paid between Pounds 500 and Pounds 5,000 for transatlantic cruises and of providing many with free cruises next year. There may also be longer-term effects, both for Cunard and other cruise operators. 'The cost in terms of consumer confidence in the company could be high,' said Mr Keith Betton of the Association of British Travel Agents. However, Mr William Gibbons, director of the Passenger Shipping Association, did not believe the QE2's problems would damage the image of the cruise industry. 'People perceive the QE2 as a one-off, prestige vessel,' he said. 'Generally people have a high opinion of cruise holidays and they have short memories. They will have forgotten about this in a few months.' Those who travelled on the ship might not forget so quickly.</p>

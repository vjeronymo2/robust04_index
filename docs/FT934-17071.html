			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Pension law: are the reforms Goode enough? - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Debbie Harrison consider its implications ROBERT MAXWELL's theft of Pounds 400m from the Mirror Group pension schemes raised serious questions about the ownership and safety of pension funds. The government-appointed committee, headed by Professor Roy Goode of Oxford University, to investigate the legal framework for occupational pensions, made its recommendations public on Thursday. A bill may be introduced in the 1994-95 parliamentary session. If you are in an occupational scheme, how would Goode's recommendations affect the security of your pension? Much depends on how much meat is put on the bones of the proposals. Pensions Regulator 'The root of the problem is that there is no comprehensive legal framework governing occupational pensions,' according to the report. At present pension schemes are based on trust law which is complex and ill-defined. Goode proposes to strengthen trust law with a Pensions Act to protect the scheme member's 'pensions promise', namely that rights will accrue the longer the employee contributes to the scheme, that these accrued rights will be protected and that the benefits will be provided. The rights enshrined in the Act will override a scheme's trust deeds. The trustee's role is to act solely in the best interests of members and beneficiaries. If the trustee or one of the professionals the trustee appoints - auditor, actuary, legal adviser or fund manager - is found in breach of the new rules, they could be punished under criminal law. A Pensions Regulator would be appointed to see that the law is implemented and to draw up a code of conduct for trustees. Alan MacDougall, managing-director of Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, says much depends on what the code contains. 'We need to know what power and resources will be given to the regulator to know if he will be able to do the job properly or if he will be a toothless tiger.' Compensation scheme The report recommends that those deprived of pension rights should be entitled to compensation but only in cases of fraud, theft and other misappropriation. Compensation would be capped at 90 per cent of the value of misappropriated assets. The scheme will be funded by a levy on all schemes after a disaster. But there is uncertainty about the ability of members to prove theft or fraud. Robin Ellison, partner with pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp, says: 'Members need more protection than this. Even now a case for fraud has not been proved against Maxwell.' Member representation. It should not be the sole right of employers to appoint trustees, nor should they be able to veto any trustee selected by scheme members. Goode proposes that, for earnings-related schemes, at least one third of the board should be members and for money-purchase schemes, active members should be entitled to appoint at least two thirds of the trustee board. However, MacDougall, says that since there will be majority voting, the member trustees will always be in a minority. Unfortunately, the member representation proposals do not apply to small schemes - schemes with no more than 50 active members and pensioners. It is often in schemes of this size that problems arise. More powers to Ombudsman The Pensions Ombudsman, who arbitrates in disputes, and the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, which deals with queries and complaints from the public and acts as a screening mechanism for the Ombudsman, are to have their powers extended. The report also recommends an extension to existing dispute channels by introducing internal procedures to settle disagreements between members and the scheme. Alan Pickering, pensions consultant with actuarial consultants Watsons, said: 'The internal dispute procedure is a welcome improvement and puts pension benefits on a par with pay - which of course already can be negotiated and resolved through the appropriate internal channels. 'A logical extension to this is the addition of paid conciliation officers at OPAS who can intervene before it is necessary to incur expensive litigation. In the more complex cases, the Pensions Ombudsman would have power to take the lead in an investigation and would be encouraged to name names - a much more effective deterrent than the current system which only allows the publication of anonymous case studies.' However, Ellison said: 'It would be far better to have a tribunal rather than a single ombudsman. A tribunal would provide a balanced investigation whereas under the proposed system too much power would rest with one individual.' Minimum solvency requirement Schemes should have enough money to meet their obligations to scheme members. The report introduces an important minimum funding requirement for all schemes so that they would be able to fulfil all liabilities if they were to be wound up. A margin is allowed and a scheme will only be in violation of its obligation if assets fall below 90 per cent of the proposed level. If a shortfall of less than 10 per cent is discovered, the employer will have three months to make it good. Two weeks after that the trustees must tell scheme members if a shortfall remains, and try to recover the money from the employer. The regulator may also take steps to force the employer to make the necessary payment. The trustees, the scheme actuary and auditor would issue an annual certificate of solvency and report shortfalls in funding to the Regulator. Some experts believe that these solvency margins are too low. Moreover unapproved arrangements, such as funded unapproved retirement benefits for employees affected by the earnings cap, would not be subject to these new rules. Pension fund surplus The report does not recommend imposing restrictions on an employer's ability to use a pension-fund surplus to finance a contributions holiday provided the fund meets the solvency standard. A big disappointment is that the report does not force employers to fully inflation-link pensions before ceasing contributions. Winding up When a scheme is closed the winding up process can take several years because of the difficulty in tracing or redeeming assets. Many scheme members have complained to OPAS about these delays in receiving pensions or transfers. The report recommends that trustees should make interim awards to avoid these cases of hardship and to settle any balance of payments once all the assets have been recovered. Employer contribution checks Some employers fail to pay their agreed contributions and sometimes checks are not made until the company has gone into liquidation. Under a money purchase scheme - where the pension depends on investment returns and is not linked to final salary - the report recommends that trustees should set a time limit for the payment of contributions by both the employer and employee and that they ensure this requirement is met. Where a contribution is three months overdue the trustees would inform scheme members. After six months' delay the regulator would be called in. The ability of the proposals to protect scheme members hinges on the competence of the trustees to implement and monitor the new controls. Many experts believe that a big drawback of the recommendations is that trustees are being given enhanced responsibilities and while they offer enthusiasm, they often have little financial expertise. Richard Malone, of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, pensions consultants, said: 'There is nothing here to stop another Maxwell-type situation in its tracks. What would have helped would have been to require trustee training and the appointment of a professional trustee. All that's happened is a recommendation to increase the number of amateur trustees on the Board - a situation Robert Maxwell would have welcomed.' Nevertheless, a framework has been proposed that should prevent the majority of pension scheme abuses. Much depends on the scope of the Pensions Act and the strength of the Regulator.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): When words fail you  -Business books / A quick look at summaries Now you can read the best business books of 1992 - in just 15 minutes each, screams the advertisement. This is not another speed reading course. The idea is that you pay other people to do your reading for you. Tucked away in Bristol, Vermont, are teams of experts who grind their way though thousands of business books each year. They reject more than 99 per cent and turn the remaining 30 or so into eight-page summaries. Hey Presto] Busy executives can save both time and money. The summaries 'slash hundreds of hours off reading time', and cost around Dollars 100 a year - buying the books might cost eight times as much. It is an offer that some 25,000 managers in the US have been unable to resist. Now the company, Soundview Executive Book Summaries, is hoping to reach a wider audience through its full-page advertisments in the Economist magazine. The scheme may not catch on. To the British eye, at least, the invitation looks odd. The 30 summarised books are called 'outstanding', and readers are warned that missing out on the ideas and insights could be a 'serious and expensive mistake'. Yet if the books are as good as that, the prospect of a summary is an affront; executives should read the book themselves. Not a bit of it: Soundview recalls a 'scientific study' that has shown the busy executive is more likely to remember the ideas in a summary than in the book itself. Moreover, it claims that the summaries will make executives look intelligent by giving them a 'talking knowledge' of the titles that are on everybody's lips. One thing seems certain: the service will reassure anyone who feels that a rich literary world is passing them by. Of the 30 'outstanding' books last year, one was 'Business Protocol' by Jan Yager. This tells executives not to eat with their mouths full and not to pretend to be someone else on the telephone in order to get through to an influential person. The book says that business gifts are fine so long as they are not too expensive. It recommends a photo album or coffee mug. For readers who do not have the time to read the eight pages, the message is summarised on the front cover: 'Like Your Mom Said: Good Manners Count'. Alternatively, companies in crisis may be helped by the summary of 'The Turnaround Survival Guide' by A David Silver. 'Like day-hikers who start out in the warm sun and find themselves shivering in an ice storm 10 hours later, you never know when you'll need survival skills.' One shudders to think what the unexpurgated version is like. However daft the idea might seem, it initially attracted competition from Macmillan, the publishers, who subsequently switched to business book summaries on tape instead. Now there's a good idea for businessmen who have no time, and who can't read either.</p>

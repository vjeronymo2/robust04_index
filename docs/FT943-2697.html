			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: I really hate to complain, but . . .  -So you think you've had a raw deal but don't know what to do. Debbie Harrison provides a guide If you think you have a problem about an investment, pension or life assurance product, you need first to find out to whom - or what - you should complain. Unfortunately this is no easy task during the present regulatory shake-out. The Personal Investment Authority (PIA) has taken over from Fimbra, the regulatory body for advisers, and Lautro, which regulated life offices and unit trust groups. During the transition, you could end up dealing with any of them. Complaints about company pensions are tackled by the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), but several ombudsmen continue to squabble over territorial rights for personal pensions. The box below provides contact details and telephone helplines for bemused investors. Second, you should consider if your grievances are justified or simply a case of bad luck. The following common complaints received by regulators and ombudsmen will help you assess the merits of your case. 1. I don't know which product to choose. Nor do the regulators and ombudsman. Their job is to correct mistakes and deliberate mis-selling - not to give investment advice. 2. The benefits are abysmal. Provided you knew what they were at the start, and the provider or trustees were/are acting in accordance with the scheme or plan rules, there is nothing you can do about it (but see point 4). 3. The investment returns are poor. The likely response to this is 'tough', assuming you understood the nature of the risks when you took out the plan. If you did not, see point 4. If you think your fund was miscalculated, see point 6. 4. The investment is unsuitable. You are on better ground here. Salesmen must examine your financial circumstances and requirements before recommending an investment product. They must also ensure you understand its nature and associated risks. If your adviser failed to do this, you should complain. Moreover, you should not lose out by abandoning an existing arrangement in favour of a new product. An adviser almost certainly is mis-selling if, for example, he recommends a pension transfer plan to replace a good company pension scheme. 5. The charges are outrageous. Find out what they are before you sign up. Until January 1995, providers are not obliged to reveal their true charges, but good advisers are doing so now. Ask how much commission the adviser will make on the sale, since this will eat into your fund in the early years. 6. The sums do not add up. Always query a significant shortfall, since this might be a simple miscalculation. Early retirement pensions are classic cases. But the final pay-out on a unit-linked or with-profits endowment, for example, might be less than expected if the markets have performed poorly in the period between your last statement and the date the plan matures. The provider/adviser should have explained the risks at the outset (see point 3). 7. Something fishy is going on. Fraud and malpractice do occur - for instance, where the salesman or adviser has not passed on your premiums to the provider, or where the employer has deducted your pension contributions from your pay cheque but has not sent them to the pension scheme. If you suspect this is happening, contact the regulators immediately. 8. I've only just found out . . . and the complaint relates to an event five years ago. You could be out of luck here. The pensions ombudsman, for example, usually slaps a three-year time limit on eligible cases so, if you suspect skulduggery or plain incompetence, act quickly. The PIA handles only cases that arose after April 29 1988. 9. The matter is confidential. You might be saving for early retirement and do not want your employer to know - or saving for divorce and don't want your spouse to know. Whatever the circumstances, your case stays confidential. 10. My friend has a problem . . . but he is too nervous/ill/old to complain himself. You can act on behalf of relatives and friends provided you explain the position clearly to the regulator or ombudsman. You should check whetheryour investment is covered. If you are not sure, use one of the enquiry numbers in 'Where to go' on this page. The PIA handles life assurance (including endowment policies), personal pensions, unit trusts, personal equity plans, guaranteed income bonds, investment trust savings schemes, offshore funds (eg, gilt and bond funds), share dealing, portfolio management, broker funds, business expansion and enterprise investment schemes, and traded options In some cases, you could be referred to the investment ombudsman via the Investment Managers' Regulatory Organisation (Imro), the overseer for investment managers, or to one of the other regulators. Company pensions and certain aspects of personal pensions are covered by Opas and the pensions ombudsman.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Retailing If the stock market is any guide, Britain's shopkeepers have shrugged off tax rises and are expecting consumers to carry on spending with abandon. Since February, the stores sector has been among the market's most resilient. That may partly reflect negative reasoning: investors have viewed stores as a safe haven as storms have raged in other markets. Marks and Spencer, Boots and GUS, which account for 60 per cent of sector capitalisation, are dependable stocks with cast-iron balance sheets, high quality earnings and marginal overseas exposure. But the other great appeal of shops is they are seen as a good hedge against inflation. That was undoubtedly true in the 1970s but it might not prove to be the case today. In mature competitive industries, modest inflation is hard to pass on to customers - as the grocery industry has already shown. Retailers' earnings will be squeezed by other pressures, too. Many groups have announced big investment plans, threatening to add capacity in excess of sales volume growth. Landlords will also become less generous with rent discounts while foreign entrants to the market are turning up the competitive heat. The stores sector undoubtedly has great potential for generating surplus cash. That raises the possibility of dividend increases or special pay-outs. But the sector would have to raise its collective yield substantially to match the market average. It is also somewhat quirky for retailers to stand on both earnings and dividend premiums at the same time.</p>

The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that Kim's  speech would help provide momentum and encourage industry since  it presented a policy direction aimed at expansion of  infrastructure, relaxation of administrative regulations and  improvement of industrial structure for ensuring  cost-effectiveness.    The Federation of Korean Industries [FKI] said it was proper  for the government to relax administrative regulations, boost  investment, increase exports through industrial peace and revive  the economy. FKI said it was waiting for concrete follow-up  measures to boost industry.    The Korea Foreign Trade Association said that the target for  improving competitiveness was timely because this is in an age  of internationalization and openness, but it sought concrete  measures for continual growth of exports.    The Korea Federation of Small Business said the government's  strong will to increase competitiveness was encouraging for  small companies but it hoped more substantial measures would be  taken to boost the competitiveness of small companies as they  are the roots of the national economy.    It expressed satisfaction that the government will form a  committee on development in rural and fishery areas to advise  the president how to support farmers and fishers, who may suffer  the largest loss because of the Uruguay Round trade accord.    The Korea Employers' Federation said President Kim had given  economic activists confidence by showing a direction for the  economy to follow, but called on the government to pay more  interest in industrial harmony.</p>

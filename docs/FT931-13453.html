			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Charity begins in the boardroom: Alan Pike looks at the successors to the Victorian philanthropists The Central Statistical Office does not publish a National Generosity Guide. There is therefore no league table of philanthropy in which to measure this week's donation by David Sainsbury of Pounds 200m-worth of shares to the Gatsby Charitable Foundation. Not all donations like the Sainsbury shares become public knowledge through their declaration to the Stock Exchange or publication in trust accounts. Some benefactors adhere strictly to the biblical injunction to avoid announcing their good deeds with a flourish of trumpets. By all standards, however, the Sainsbury Pounds 200m is breathtaking for a single donation: it is at least four or five times the annual income from all sources of many large household name charities, such as the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the Spastics Society. The figure is Pounds 11.5m more than the combined expenditure on fund-raising of Britain's 400 biggest charities during 1991. It eclipses the amounts raised by the most high-profile national broadcast appeals - in 1991 the most successful, the BBC's Children in Need campaign, produced Pounds 26.8m. It even cuts down to size the Pounds 32m given by financier George Soros in December to aid organisations in Bosnia-Hercegovina, believed to be the largest single donation by an individual to a humanitarian cause, and derived from the money he made from currency speculation. Charitable activity by successful business figures, of course, is not new. Most Victorian industrial cities have libraries, universities, art galleries, housing or hospitals that originated from the contributions of local industrialists. Philanthropy was closer to the ground in those days, when industrialists lived in the towns and cities they endowed and had their factories there. One of the present difficulties with efforts to generate business support for deprived urban areas is that most companies now have their head offices in London, and senior directors do not have the same strong links with provincial communities as they did a century ago. But the spirit of philanthropic employers like Joseph Rowntree continues in charitable trusts bearing their names today, while the establishment of trusts by more recent business figures continues. Gatsby is one of several Sainsbury family charitable trusts. It was set up by David Sainsbury in 1967 and, even before his injection of the Pounds 200m worth of shares this week, had become one of Britain's largest grant-making trusts. It supports health and social welfare projects, technical education, industrial and economic programmes, scientific research and development of the third world. Support by British companies remains modest in relation to the charity sector's Pounds 16bn total annual income. Last year, 48 companies gave more than Pounds 1m each in cash or in kind to charity. Far more of it was in kind - staff secondments, free use of office space and equipment - than in cash, with only 22 companies making financial donations of Pounds 1m or more. This is no indication of how much individual directors give out of their own pockets. The government's Gift Aid scheme provides tax advantages on one-off donations in excess of Pounds 400, and the average individual gift is just over Pounds 2,000. There are, however, much bigger gifts than this awaiting collection by charities, if they know how to solicit them. Since Oxford University launched its Campaign for Oxford to strengthen its finances in 1988, it has raised Pounds 237m of its Pounds 340m target. Although the Pounds 237m contains income from sources such as research funds, it also includes 24 donations to the campaign of more than Pounds 1m each. The university does not simply telephone wealthy people and ask if they can spare Pounds 1m. Researchers work carefully on the business background of potential donors and offer arrangements of mutual interest to their companies and the university - the going rate for the permanent endowment of a professorship is Pounds 1.7m. As well as providing an example of carefully planned and targeted fund-raising, Oxford's campaign also highlights the issues at the heart of an increasingly anxious debate about the proper function of charity. Some dons were apprehensive about the campaign, because they believed it implied acceptance of the view that universities need not be adequately supported from public funds. Charity managers are even more apprehensive, as universities, trust hospitals and other public sector institutions increasingly compete with them for limited funds. Envious outsiders say the Oxford campaign has been helped by the university's ancient, establishment image - corporate donors frequently shy away from unpopular or controversial causes. A survey by the Charities Aid Foundation, one of the main sources of information on the voluntary sector, shows that educational charities do best from corporate donors - receiving 35 per cent of total cash donations - followed by medicine and health. Civil rights organisations do least well, coming below animal welfare to pick up only 0.08 per cent of corporate financial support - a total of just Pounds 34,000 last year. There are, however, some interesting attempts to redress the balance. In 1985 J Paul Getty II, the millionaire US citizen who lives in Britain, set up a trust with Pounds 20m, as one of his many charitable activities. The policy of the J Paul Getty Charitable Trust is to support unpopular causes that would otherwise have difficulty finding finance. Drug and alcohol projects, the mentally ill and handicapped, ex-offenders and Aids victims have been among the beneficiaries. 'The trust funds so many interesting things that adjectives to describe them become a bit redundant,' enthuses the Directory of Social Change, the voluntary sector specialist publisher, in its Guide to the Major Trusts, published this week. 'The new thoughts about prisons give more opportunities to encourage imaginative schemes,' says the Getty trust in its annual report. 'Hard-pressed estates with high unemployment and poverty can be revolutionised by dedicated people . . . There is also concern about the number of very young women having babies without support.' A trust such as Getty's, at a time when public-sector support for voluntary organisation working is such fields is being cut, shows that there are true contemporary successors to the Victorian philanthropists.  ---------------------------------------------------- TOP UK FUND-RAISING CHARITIES  ---------------------------------------------------- Name                                      Voluntary                                        income total                                      1991 (poundsm)  ---------------------------------------------------- National Trust                                 63.0 Oxfam                                          51.5 Royal National Lifeboat Institution            46.6 Imperial Cancer Research Fund                  44.1 Cancer Research Campaign                       40.2 Save the Children Fund                         38.7 Salvation Army                                 35.2 British Red Cross Soc                          32.6 Help the Aged                                  31.6 Barnados                                       31.5  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Charities Aid Foundation  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

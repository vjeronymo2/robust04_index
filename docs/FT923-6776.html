			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Telecom NZ falls 18% to NZDollars 73.3m TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand suffered a 18 per cent fall in profit to NZDollars 73.3m (USDollars 39.5m) for the first quarter to June 30, against NZDollars 89.9m last time, but said it was on track for an increase for the full year. The profit fall came in spite of more than halved tax payments to NZDollars 178.6m against NZDollars 89.9m. Pre-tax profit was down 30 per cent to NZDollars 91.9m on revenue 6 per cent lower at NZDollars 597m. Telecom said its earnings were achieved in a highly competitive environment which did not exist in the comparable period last year. As expected, redundancy costs soared from NZDollars 13.2m to NZDollars 36m while staff costs were down 5.1 per cent as numbers fell by 1,861 to 12,882. National calls revenue fell 13.9 per cent with volumes 4.1 per cent lower and international revenue 2.5 per cent down. But there was a 33.3 per cent growth in the cellular market. Revenue from directories rose 9 per cent, and from other services by 123 per cent to NZDollars 25.8m. Baring Brothers, Burrows, in its full report on National Australia Bank's takeover offer bid for Bank of New Zealand, has valued BNZ at between NZDollars 1.37bn and NZDollars 1.56bn. This compares with the NZDollars 1.48bn being offered. In its report, accompanying a recommendation by independent directors to all shareholders that they accept the offer, the Sydney firm said its valuation, on a discounted cash flow basis, valued the bank in a range of between 74 cents and 84 cents a share. The NAB offer is 80 cents. The recommendation comes amid growing restlessness among some minority shareholders over the terms of the deal. A number have claimed that they are being disadvantaged. Writing on behalf of independent directors, Mr Sid Pasley, chairman, said that in their view the offer of 80 cents is fair to minority shareholders. Directors are accepting the offer in respect of their own shares.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 4 May -- Prospects for the development of  Armenia's power engineering were the center of attention at the  second National Conference on problems in this sphere, which  ended its work here today. Its organizers -- the Armenian  Ministry of Energy and Fuel along with the U.S. Department of  Energy, International Development Agency, and the U.S. energy  association. About 400 delegates including representatives of 65  power engineering firms and companies from a number of countries  discussed a broad range of problems concerning power saving,  power engineering, heating supplies, electrical systems and  networks, alternative energy sources and prospecting for fuel  deposits.    The results of the forum exceeded our expectations, said  Sepukh Tashchyan, Armenian state minister. Speaking at a news  conference here today, he said 30 proposals had been received  from various foreign firms which, with serious development and  financing, could produce good results.    Susan Olds, director of the Caucasus regional section of the  U.S. International Development Agency, said the U.S. Government  was prepared to grant Armenia $26 million in aid to be spent on  the development of energy saving and raising the efficiency of  power usage, on the development of hydro-power, alternative and  renewable sources of energy. The European Union is giving  Armenia a certain amount of aid.    U.S. President Bill Clinton regards as very important the  process of democratization in the former republics of the USSR,  stated Richard Williamson, representative of the U.S. Department  of Energy. Therefore, he said, the U.S. Government supports and  encourages the activities of those firms that may be useful to  Armenia in carrying out reforms, in implementing the course of  democratization. Armenia has all the technical and intellectual  potential for our further cooperation in the sphere of power  engineering, the U.S. representative stressed.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE QUEST FOR NORIEGA;  </P> <P> ORD GIS PROUD OF PANAMA MISSION;  </P> <P> MILITARY: A SMALL CONTINGENT RETURNS. 'THEY LOVE AMERICANS. THEY LOVE WHAT WE  DID,' A SOLDIER SAYS.  </P> <P> A small contingent of the 14,000 U.S. troops who invaded Panama returned home  to California on Tuesday, saying they had accomplished their mission of helping  to install a democratic government.  </P> <P> Fifty-six Army soldiers of the 7th Light Infantry Division based at Ft. Ord,  the first uninjured troops to leave Panama since the U.S. invasion on Dec. 20,  landed aboard a C-141 transport at 6:45 a.m. after a brief stop at Kelly Air  Force Base in San Antonio.  </P> <P> The soldiers, among 141 that left Panama on Monday, said they were well  received in Panama.  </P> <P> "Now they have a democratic government -- it's what they want. They love  Americans," said Sgt. John Grauer, 29, of Fresno. "They love what we did."  </P> <P> Spec. 4 Ralph Santos, a 19-year-old from Los Angeles, said the reaction of  Panamanians boosted the spirits of the troops.  </P> <P> "Overall, the morale of the soldiers was greatly increased. The infantry guys  were treated like heroes by the Panamanians," said Santos, who speaks Spanish  and was called on at times to interpret for military police.  </P> <P> "In some ways I was expecting more of a negative reaction," he said."  </P> <P> Most of the returning soldiers were from field artillery and air defense  batteries that provided protection for infantrymen in Panama City, at a  Panamanian army base at Rio Hato on the Pacific coast and in the city of David  on the Costa Rican border.  </P> <P> "Their military mission is finished," said Pentagon spokesman Maj. David Super.  "It's just a continued tailoring of the military force in Panama as the need  for combat troops is diminished. The growing mission down there now is for  nation-building and civil affairs."  </P> <P> Because they are artillery defense units, many of the troops carried M-60  machine guns as well as the standard M-16 automatic rifles.  </P> <P> Second Lt. John Jaskwhich said the artillery units were called in to assist  infantry troops but did not have to fire any weapons other than flares to light  up the sky for attacking troops.  </P> <P> Some of the artillerymen, however, flew into the Rio Hato area while fighting  was still intense, and the sound of gunfire made them nervous, the soldiers  said.  </P> <P> "The flight crew told us it was pretty hot. The plane was getting shot at when  we were coming in," said Jaskwhich.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad to be back to celebrate a little Christmas," he said.  </P> <P> As the C-141 flew into Monterey, soldiers breakfasted on bologna and cheese  sandwiches, chips and sodas. Some played cards, while others touched up their  camouflage makeup.  </P> <P> The hulking, gray-and-green four-engine jet landed at the Monterey airport  about three hours after it had lifted off from the Texas base. The plane was  taxied to the tarmac opposite the terminal, several hundred yards from a small  group of civilians who had gathered to watch.  </P> <P> The soldiers, still in full battle dress, left the plane and boarded buses for  the short drive to Ft. Ord.  </P> <P> Jim Davis, a spokesman at Ft. Ord, described the mood there as "very up, very  up."  </P></p>

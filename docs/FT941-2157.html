			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: HK checks share-buying mania - The colony's authorities are curbing investor zeal Just six months ago, investors would have fallen over themselves to buy shares in Chaifa, a small Hong Kong company planning to expand its business  -making and selling clothes embellished with the Playboy bunny logo - into mainland China. Now, however, with stock market sentiment battered and the China tag no longer the gilding it once was, new issues are a different ball game. Chaifa's modest HKDollars 54.1m (USDollars 6.9m) offering was just 1.86 times subscribed, and on its first day's trading, the shares closed at 99 cents, 7 cents under the issue price. Nor are H shares - China enterprises listing in Hong Kong - immune. Yizheng Chemical Fibre, China's biggest producer of polyester, saw its HKDollars 714m public offer close last week 20 times subscribed. In December, Kunming Machine Tool's HKDollars 128.70m offer was 627 times subscribed. While the chief reason for the lacklustre IPO market is undoubtedly the poor sentiment and volatility in the Hong Kong stock market (now down almost 25 per cent from its January peak), it also highlights different attitudes towards new issues. Regulators have been monitoring oversubscriptions in the IPO market since 1992. And investors themselves, no longer counting on turning round one or two-day profits, are casting a far more critical eye over the listing prospectuses before diving in. Last year, discretion was often sacrificed. Investors descended on the lending banks in hordes, at times forcing the Exchange Fund to step in with cash injections to stabilise interbank rates and general liquidity. Share prices invariably roared upwards on the first day of trading. Denway Investment, a company from China making and selling cars, earned itself a place in the colony's history books when it saw its HKDollars 402m offer some 657 times subscribed. The offer, just over a year ago, pulled in about HKDollars 264bn - almost one-third of Hong Kong's gross domestic product that year. Since then, the Monetary Authority has implemented a seven-point plan to curb bank lending for new issues - insisting, among other things, that financial institutions take a 10 per cent margin from all customers. Prior to this, certain institutions were settling for 5 per cent: in certain cases, where issues were widely believed to be hugely oversubscribed, no down payment was required. Earlier this month, the stock exchange launched its bid to rein in the new issue market by banning multiple applications and applications that exceed the total offer. In the past, it was not uncommon to receive applications for HKDollars 500m worth of shares for a HKDollars 60m offering. Underpinning the regulators' steps is a growing disenchantment with the IPO game. In the past, stagging was an easy road to riches regardless of the company fundamentals. Rumours of 100-fold subscription levels became self-fulfilling prophecies, and there were plenty of buyers to push the price up when trading started. Now, however, with short-term gains no longer guaranteed, investors are looking further ahead. Not all the companies which floated in a blaze of hype and met their promised profits in year one went on to turn in surging earnings in the second year. Many brokers believe the quality of companies coming to market has deteriorated. It is partly this feeling which has prompted many to advocate a second stock market board - a concept rejected by the stock exchange in 1990, and again in its latest strategic plan this month. Proponents of a second board argue this would be a more natural home for many of the smaller and poorer quality companies coming on line. Out of this year's 17-strong IPO league, more than half have raised less than HKDollars 100m. These smaller capitalisation stocks, which seldom merit much broker research, are almost exclusively bought by retail investors. In this sense at least, brokers judge the dwindling interest in the IPO market as healthy: the market will support the quality companies and allow them to raise funds for further expansion, while shunning the weaker offerings. At the same time, underwriters - who now face being left with stock - will be forced to take a harder look at potential clients. Pricing mechanisms also came under attack during last year's oversubscription mania. However, as yet there has been no marked increase in price earning multiples: Yizheng Chemical Fibre is on a fully diluted p/e of 13.8 times, making it broadly comparable to last year's H share issues. Mr Kevin Westley, chief executive of Wardley Holdings - one of the colony's most active underwriters - reckons IPO pricings this year have only risen in line with the blanket re-rating of the Hang Seng Index. However, Mr Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Monetary Authority, believes p/es still tend to be quite low on issue. The lull in investor frenzy and the curbs in place do not mean Hong Kong's IPO market is clean of anomalies yet, he warns.</p>

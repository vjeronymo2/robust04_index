The conclusion of the world trade talks last month has made  section 301 "a more effective tool", U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor told a hearing of the House Ways and Means  Committee.    The section 301 trade law, effective since 1974, is the  legal  basis for Washington's unilateral trade actions, such as  sanctions against foreign countries which it says engage in  unfair trade practices.    Sanctions usually go into effect in one year, during which  investigations are conducted to prove if the unfair trade  practices are true or not.    Kantor denied that the final agreement of the Uruguay round  of the global trade talks sponsored by the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had adversely impacted U.S. trade  sovereignty.    "As far as dispute settlement is concerned," Kantor said,  "we  believe (section 301) is even more effective, and helps our  sovereignty and makes us stronger, not weaker."    "We can assert our rights effectively and on multilateral  context, and make (section) 301 even a more effective tool," he  stressed.    The trade representative argued that except for the changes  in the time length of investigation against the alleged unfair  trade practices, section 301 was virtually left unaffected by  the Uruguay agreement.    Under GATT, the U.S. is required to go to the GATT before it  enacts section 301 trade law and unilaterally imposes trade  sanctions against a GATT-covered trade item and a GATT member.    Almost all of the areas not covered by GATT are still not  covered by the world trade organization, which is to replace  GATT, U.S. officials said.    Kantor, meanwhile, cited anti-competitive behavior and  violation of bilateral trade agreement as possible reasons for  Washington to use section 301 trade law.    "We have a better dispute settlement mechanism to go to in  the new world trade organization to enforce it in those  circumstances where we would have to go to GATT," Kantor said.</p>

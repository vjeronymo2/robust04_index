			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> It was a year that seemed to have everything from A to Zsa Zsa.  </P> <P> Well, almost.  </P> <P> The late Jimi Hendrix failed to materialize at a rock guitar seance in  Hollywood. The homeless march on Malibu didn't transpire despite Honorary Mayor  Martin Sheen's invitation. And actor James Garner declined to run for governor,  despite the urging of Democratic state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, who said his  party didn't have any exciting candidates.  </P> <P> But there were so many memorable events that did materialize: A doggie ice  cream made its debut in Hollywood, a Topanga group started the first nudist pen  pal's club, lawyer Thomas White opened an office inside the Valencia Car Wash,  and a snooty billiards parlor featuring valets and a no-smoking section was  launched in West L.A.  </P> <P> It was, perhaps above all else here, the Year of the Fax, with the machine's  uses ranging from press releases and restaurant orders to wooing members of the  opposite sex. West Hollywood business executive Anita Gittelson even received  one assistant's resignation via a fax machine from Syracuse, N.Y. "It was a bit  strange," Gittelson said. "In fact, it's strange that she was even in  Syracuse."  </P> <P> Pay-telephone lines also proliferated. An investigation of City Hall found  $8,000 in worth of phone calls had been made to a dial-a-porn service with such  offerings as "Call Me, I'm Michelle -- Live."  </P> <P> Cultural life, as always, was active here. Long Beach held a skateboard art  show, the Max Factor Museum in Hollywood was nominated for landmark status, and  pianist Sandra Tsing Loh, backed by the Topanga Symphony Orchestra, serenaded  the grunion on the beach at Malibu.  </P> <P> Alas, the rock group Poison, known for the hit album "Open Up and Say Ah," was  forced to cancel a concert at the Sports Arena. The lead singer had bruised  vocal chords.  </P> <P> Inevitably, there were some bruised feelings too.  </P> <P> L.A.'s new federal Metropolitan Detention Center surrendered its distinction as  the world's first no-smoking prison after the inmates trashed their cells in a  mass nicotine fit. (One problem: The ban hadn't applied to guards or other  personnel.)  </P> <P> Temple City officials objected to a quip by broadcaster Paul Harvey that an  army of wire-eating ants who knocked out some traffic lights in the city had  enjoyed a "power lunch."  </P> <P> The Hell's Angels, contending that their ghoulish trademarks were used without  their permission in the movie "Nam Angels" responded in full force. They sued.  </P> <P> Physical fitness guru Jake Steinfeld took Cable News Network to court in L.A.  over an underground tape allegedly produced by CNN employees that spliced  segments of Steinfeld's fitness show with the purported sex tape of actor Rob  Lowe.  </P> <P> Southern California's most celebrated driver, Zsa Zsa Gabor, was convicted of  slapping a Beverly Hills police officer who pulled over her Rolls-Royce. A  Melrose Avenue eatery saluted her and a fellow defendant, New York hotel queen  Leona Helmsley, with "Lobster Zsa Zsa" and "Lobster Leona" -- shellfish served  with tiny handcuffs.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, actress Jane Fonda and Assemblyman Tom Hayden agreed to divorce,  prompting someone to quip that Fonda's next fitness tape could be titled: "It  Didn't Work Out."  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce courtroom tensions, an L.A. lawyer on the state Bar's  Board of Governors proposed a "Code of Professional Courtesy" for attorneys  including these vows:  </P> <P> * "I will return telephone calls."  </P> <P> * "I will not be late for court or for appointments."  </P> <P> * "I will never take cheap shots."  </P> <P> Naturally, there was some fine print in the code: It would be voluntary.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the usual tensions were present on the roadways -- and even spilled  over into the parking lots.  </P> <P> Two chauffeurs exchanged gunfire after vying for the same spot outside a  supermarket in Redondo Beach. Then there was the screenwriter who sued Clint  Eastwood, claiming that the actor-director rammed her car after finding it  parked in his space at Burbank Studios. Visitors to Ronald Reagan's offices in  Century Building found to their surprise that he doesn't validate.  </P> <P> Traffic was slower than ever. Some of the notable hindrances were a shipwreck  on Culver Boulevard, a spill of 864,000 cans of vegetables on the San Gabriel  River Freeway, a fallen load of catcher's masks on the Ventura, Rolling Stones  ticket scalpers standing on the Harbor Freeway, 27,000 pounds of almond shells  on the Foothill, a surfboard on the Artesia, and a body that fell out of a  coroner's van on the Hollywood.  </P> <P> The roads could have been even more unsafe. But a woman who plowed into the  wall of a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Glendale during her driver's  test was denied a license. "We didn't even get to the parking part," her  stunned examiner said later.  </P> <P> There were other wrong turns too.  </P> <P> Irwindale celebrated Mexico's Independence Day by flying Hungarian flags. TV  Guide magazine placed Oprah Winfrey's head on Ann-Margret's body in a cover  illustration. The Long Beach Unified School District advised students to avoid  wearing Natas clothing because the name "spelled backward is Satan"; the notice  was rescinded after it was learned that Natas is the first name of a famous  skateboarder.  </P> <P> After numerous parents' protests, a Paramount businessman halted the nationwide  distribution of "Chilly Bang! Bang!" a pistol-shaped juice container imported  from the Philippines.  </P> <P> One citywide disruption drew few protests from Banning High students in  Wilmington. In the senior class poll, "Best School Activity" of the year was  judged to be the L.A. teachers' strike.  </P> <P> Pepperdine University students did some instructing themselves while visiting  Germany. They scaled the Berlin Wall and taught the natives to do "The Wave"  cheer.  </P> <P> The L.A. City Council also drew some cheers when it voted in February to cut  back the time that a member can speak on one issue from five minutes to three.  In October, the council reinstated the five-minute limit.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, one County Board of Supervisors meeting dragged on so long that, at  5 p.m., the county's security guards delivered a subtle message. They removed  the metal detector at the entrance to the chamber and left.  </P> <P> This year's Lincoln-Douglas Debate Award goes to Supervisors Pete Schabarum and  Deane Dana for this angry exchange, which followed Dana's turnabout on one  vote:  </P> <P> Schabarum: "Some guy calls you up this morning and says, 'Holy cow, dabba dabba  dabba dooo. . . .' "  </P> <P> Dana: "Some people call up you and dabba dabba dooo."  </P> <P> The debut of still another oldies' radio station plus innumerable  retrospectives on the Beatles, Woodstock and other nostalgia led to the  formation of a protest group, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Time  (NAFTAT). Its slogan: "We want to end the 60s in your lifetime."  </P> <P> OK, so maybe this is the right time to say goodby to the 60s.  </P> <P> And, hello to the 70s!  </P> <P> Dabba dabba dooo!  </P></p>

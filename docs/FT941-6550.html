			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper rallies after early fall - Market report COPPER prices recovered early losses at the London Metal Exchange yesterday while the ALUMINIUM market remained nervous as the second round of inter-government talks on the industry got under way in Ottawa. The three months copper price drifted down to Dollars 1,880 a tonne in the morning, but support at that level held once more and the price bounced to Dollars 1,982 before closing the after hours 'kerb' session at Dollars 1,888, up Dollars 8 on the day. Dealers thought, however, that another test of underlying support was likely soon unless further headway was made on the upside. Aluminium prices were depressed initially by an indication by Comalco of Australia of reluctance to cut output at its 'efficient' Boyne Island and Piwai point smelters. But later news that Alba of Bahrain was discussing possible output cuts with other Middle Eastern producers, a change of tack from its previous position, gave prices a lift. The three months price, which had dipped to Dollars 1,305 a tonne at one point, ended the kerb session at Dollars 1,309, down Dollars 7.50 from Friday. The ZINC market was hit by Japan's trade and industry ministry showing domestic stocks sharply up in January and the European Zinc Institute releasing similar data for world smelters' stocks. Traders said this once again underlined the problem facing the world's zinc industry and the three months price fell to Dollars 969 a tonne, down Dollars 7. Dealers noted that zinc trading was subdued, with many participants attending an industry conference in the US At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA futures extended morning retreats, last week's failure to break through key resistance causing the two markets to slide towards technical support, traders said. By the close May delivery coffee, further depressed by a weak opening in New York, had fallen Dollars 23 on the day to Dollars 1,212 a tonne. Traders said there was little fresh news to help the market out of the current doldrums and some predicted a test of support at Dollars 1,200 or even the chart gap between Dollars 1,185 and Dollars 1,190 later this week. Cocoa fared little better, the May position ending Pounds 16 down at Pounds 910 a tonne. Dealers said, however, that there had been pockets of trade buying around and they expected the slide to run out of steam before May reached the psychologically-important Pounds 900-mark. 'The market has stalled under a bit of switching pressure but I don't think we're into a reversal yet,' one said. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World nickel output registers sharp decline Nickel production fell sharply in the first ten months of this year, mainly because output in Russia, the biggest producer, dropped by nearly one third compared with the same months in 1992, according to the International Nickel Study Group. Consumption of the metal also slipped back but was still well ahead of output. The study group's statistics show nickel output fell by 85,000 tonnes or by 11.7 per cent to 639,000 tonnes in the ten months. Much of the drop was accounted for by Russia, where production was down by 64,000 tonnes or 31.5 per cent at 139,000 tonnes. Nickel consumption in the ten months fell by 1.68 per cent or 11,200 tonnes to 652,400 tonnes. Again the Commonwealth of Independent States was mainly responsible - consumption there was down by nearly one third or by 33,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes. Meanwhile, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group estimated yesterday that in the first ten months of this year mine output of both lead and zinc outside the former eastern bloc countries was falling fast but production and consumption of refined metal continued to hold up well. Mine production of lead was down by 10.7 per cent or 205,000 tonnes to 1.7m tonnes and mine output of zinc fell by 9.3 per cent or 439,000 tonnes to 4.29m tonnes. Canada was mainly responsible - in the ten months its mines produced 48 per cent, or 139,000 tonnes, less lead and 24 per cent, or 267,000 tonnes, less zinc. Production of refined lead slipped by 1.1 per cent to 3.68m tonnes while consumption was down by 1 per cent to 3.67m tonnes. Output of refined zinc eased up by 0.7 per cent to 4.55m tonnes and consumption showed a stronger, 2.3 per cent, rise to 4.58m tonnes. The study group said zinc consumption was down by 1 per cent in Europe and by 7 per cent in Japan but this was more than compensated for by a 7 per cent increase in the US and strongly rising demand in Korea and Taiwan.</p>

Workers are picketing -- primarily  workers from [words indistinct] municipal, Eugenia Espejo  Hospital, and Isidro Ayora Maternity Hospital, who are blocking  normal traffic and transportation.

Pedestrians  [words indistinct] groups of workers also are walking through  the capital's streets to demonstrate. In general, operations of  most businesses and commercial outlets are limited.    We have statements by workers from Quito Electric Co. who  say  that so far, in the first hours of the strike, the strike by the  FUT [United Workers Front] has been absolutely successful.    [Begin unidentified worker recording] [words indistinct] we  must protest [words indistinct] because this kind of measure  adopted by the government adversely affects the people.

We are  going to adopt more radical measures, just like the government  is applying radical, terrorist, and criminal measures against  the people and against the working class.

Now, Jorge Ivan Melo has this news bulletin:    [Melo] Greetings to Radio Quito and Ecuador Radio  Information  System listeners throughout the country.    We are here near the Central Ecuador University, where  students and police have clashed in recent days. We see very  few university students in the area or nearby streets. They are  burning tires and logs, and they are chanting slogans against  the government for increasing gas prices by 70 percent.    On 10th of August Street and Carrion Avenue, where the  Foreign Relations Ministry is located, there are some students  accompanied by workers burning tires and logs. They have  blocked traffic, and all vehicles have disappeared from this  part of town. We can also report that only some stores in areas  near the university are open.</p>

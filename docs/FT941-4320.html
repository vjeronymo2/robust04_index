			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil hits Pounds 95m despite falling prices Enterprise Oil, the largest UK exploration and production company, yesterday reported an 8.9 per cent rise in 1993 net profits to Pounds 94.7m despite the sharp slide in crude oil prices. Record production of 158,914 barrels of oil equivalent a day (including natural gas) boosted turnover to Pounds 546.1m, compared with Pounds 524.4m last time. The company also benefited from a sharp fall in tax from Pounds 57.9m to Pounds 5.1m. That was because of changes in the petroleum revenue tax regime in the UK and lower Norwegian taxes. Earnings per share fell by 1.5p to 17p but a final dividend of 6.5p holds the total at 16p. The enhanced scrip dividend alternative to the interim dividend was taken up by 98 per cent of shareholders, saving the company Pounds 44.3m in cash. It also reduced advance corporation tax liabilities by Pounds 12.9m. Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said Enterprise was better placed than most exploration and production companies to weather low oil prices because of its 'rising production and cash flows.' These were boosted last month by the start-up of the Pounds 1.1bn Nelson field, the first field of which Enterprise is the operator. Analysts generally welcomed the results and Enterprise shares closed at 421p, up a penny. But there were warnings that future performance could suffer if oil prices stay low. Mr David Basham, at brokers Kleinwort Benson, noted that the 1993 results were boosted by a high sterling oil price in the first half of the year of Pounds 12.39 a barrel. This fell to an average of Pounds 11.58 for the whole year, and is down to Pounds 9.40 for the first two months of 1994. The company is responding by cutting costs and curtailing exploration. Capital expenditure last year fell to Pounds 329.4m (Pounds 450.4m), while spending on exploration and appraisal was down to Pounds 67m (Pounds 89.9m). But the company added 60.3m barrels to its reserves, equivalent to 104 per cent of total production last year. COMMENT The fact that Enterprise managed to maintain its dividend in the face of real oil prices at the lowest level in 20 years showed its financial strength. But even the strongest independent must tremble at the prospect that prices will continue to hover around Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel. For an exploration and production company there are only a few ways to find relief from low prices. In Enterprise's case diversification appears to have been ruled out. Cutting costs helps, but the quickest way is to curtail exploration, and the critical test for such companies remains their ability to replace reserves over time. The remaining alternative is one which must be looking increasingly attractive - the acquisition of low-cost assets with future potential at knockdown prices.</p>

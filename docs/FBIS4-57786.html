			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Panamanian President Guillermo Endara </F> with unidentified reports upon arriving at Toncontin Airport in  Tegucigalpa; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] [Endara] ...the future discussion. My case is unique  because I am attending the preparatory meeting, but another  person will attend the summit. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who  will be president then, will attend the summit in December.    [Reporter] What is Panama concerned about specifically?    [Endara] We are basically concerned about what concerns all  Central Americans. We want to be treated equally, as friends of  the United States.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] for example the pressures of  international organizations on these countries. Do you think  those pressures should not exist?    [Endara] I think there should be equality. We should be  given  the same benefits given to Mexico, for example. That is what we  think.    [Reporter] The canal treaty with the United States concludes  in 1999. Will it be renegotiated?    [Endara] As far as I am concerned, from the start of my term  I emphatically said there would not be a renegotiation. I think  that the political position of Perez Balladares.... [pauses] I  know he should be the one to express it, but in any case, I  understand that his position is the same as mine on this topic.  There will be no renegotiation, the canal treaty will be  fulfilled, and at noon on 31 December 1999 the canal will be  turned over to us.    [Reporter] Southcom [U.S. Southern Command] continues in  Panama?    [Endara] Southcom continues in Panama, but I must say that  next week I will attend a ceremony that I have never attended  before. Military events are frequently held on the canal bases,  and the only one I have agreed to attend is one next week during  which the first brigade is pulling out of Panama for good. It is  the first withdrawal of troops from Panama, and I will be very  happy to attend this event because as a Panamanian it is a very  important moment.    [Reporter] What base [words indistinct]?    [Endara] It is not a base. It is a brigade, an infantry  brigade.    [Reporter] Is Panama interested in joining Central America  to  be part of NAFTA?    [Endara] I, President Endara, only have three months left in  office, and I think this is how it should be. The best way for  Panama to join NAFTA is through Central America. This is  advisable for Panama and for the Central Americans.  Unfortunately, I have heard a different opinion from my  successor. I think President-elect Perez Balladares believes  that, because Panama has had such an important bilateral  relationship with the United States throughout its history,  perhaps better results could be obtained individually. I think  he is mistaken, but, in any case, he is the one who is going to  be president of Panama. Let us hope he will change his opinion,  because I think he is mistaken.    [Reporter] Is your opinion, which is different from your  successor, dangerous in Panama?    [Endara] No, [laughs] I hope not. One of the greatest  achievements of my administration is the establishment of full  freedom of opinion in Panama. In Panama, there is full freedom.  You should see what reporters say about me. They have every  right, and I support them 100 percent. I think this situation is  irreversible. No one can change that. Perez Balladares has  promised to maintain the same situation. I will continue to give  my opinion with full freedom, as all Panamanians do now and, I  am sure, will continue to do so in the future.    [Reporter] Are you going to bring up the canal issue with  Vice President Gore?    [Endara] I do not know whether we are going to have time to  discuss bilateral topics. Above all, we are going to address  multilateral topics. We have to study some recent remarks by  President Clinton regarding the provisional organization that  will exist in the canal until 2000, when the canal is turned  over to us. I do not want to negotiate or discuss this at this  time because President Clinton has just issued the statements. I  have my foreign affairs advisory commission and the Panamanian  representatives in the Canal Commission analyzing Clinton's  opinion about the new organization of the canal until 2000. I do  not want to issue an opinion until I receive proper advice on  what position Panama should adopt. Panama's position has to be  thoroughly studied.    [Reporter] Who will guarantee the security of the canal  after  2000, because there will be no gringos or Panama Defense Forces?    [Endara] Look, the canal is defenseless. It is like a  newborn  baby. Any world power that wants to destroy it can do so even if  the gringos and Russians are in the canal together. Therefore,  the canal is defenseless. Now then, whatever must be defended in  the canal can very well be protected by a police specialized in  terrorist attacks. That is all that must be done. A police force  can protect the canal perfectly well.</p>

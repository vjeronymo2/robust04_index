			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swedish gold miner aims to up the stakes - A small but profitable business that is coming to market THE UNLIKELY site for Europe's largest gold mine is a place called Bjorkdal only 300km south of the Arctic circle in northern Sweden. Until now it has enjoyed an obscurity to match its remote location, but that will change next month when the mine's operator, Terra Mining, comes to the Swedish stock market, with a range of international institutions among its new owners. The company says it will be Europe's only listed mining group concerned purely with gold. Bjorkdal claims its status as Europe's leading gold mine with 1992 production of 2,310kg (74,250 troy ounces) and expected output of 2,475kg this year. Since it started production in 1988, total output has amounted to 9 tonnes. On the scale of the world's biggest gold mines, such as those in South Africa, this is insignificant, representing a mere one-tenth of 1 per cent of total annual gold output worldwide. But Terra Mining prides itself not on scale of production but on the efficiency and profitability of its operations. Its production costs are lower than 90 per cent of its western world rivals, with mine site cash costs dropping to Dollars 145 an ounce in 1993 from Dollars 209 last year. The improvement will help the company to achieve a pre-tax profit of SKr71m (Pounds 5.75m), a 35 per cent margin on sales of SKr202.3m and a level of profitability that will match the very best in the Swedish corporate sector. Part of the reason for the low cost base has been the dramatic strengthening of the US dollar against the Swedish krona from an average of SKr5.83 in 1992 to SKr7.75 this year - a significant boost for a company that has virtually all its expenses in krona and all its revenues in dollars. But it is also lean in terms of staff numbers - it employs just 45 people - and it has benefited from the efficiency of both its exploration and its mining techniques. The company prides itself on the effectiveness of its exploration technique, which uses modern data-processing methods and an understanding of the movement of glaciers during the last ice age to find commercial ore deposits. Analysis of the glacial till, the layer of terrain that collected small fragments of minerals as they were scraped off the underlying bedrock by glaciers, is at the heart of the process. Modern data processing allows huge numbers of deposits from many different areas to be analysed systematically. In this way Terra Mining has tested 150,000 samples for 30 different elements (a total of 4.5m analyses) from a grid covering nearly all of Sweden and parts of Finland, Norway and Ireland. The company has spent SKr100m on exploration since it was founded in 1980, and had spent only SKr30m by the time it identified the potential of Bjorkdal in 1983. It took just five years from the moment a claim was first lodged on the mine to the time production started - a short lead time by industry standards. The fact that the mine is open cast, rather than underground, helps to keep operating costs down. It has also modified its mining methods, changing bench height, blast size, and drilling patterns to enhance metallurgical recovery. The result has been a steady improvement in the ore grade from 2.56 grams of gold a tonne in 1990 to 3.31 grams this year, although this is still lower than a typical South African mine. Further efficiency has been achieved by tripling the amount of ore treated annually from 300,000 tonnes in 1988 to 900,000 tonnes today. The amount is not likely to rise any further, as the company is restricted under the terms of its concession to a maximum production of 1m tonnes of ore a year. Even when the gold price plunged to the equivalent of SKr56,000 a kilogram in July 1992 Bjorkdal remained profitable, with a break-even level of SKr51,000. When the gold price soars to SKr107,000 a kilogram - as it did this year, with a built-in benefit from the krona's devaluation - it is highly profitable, and remains so at the SKr92,000 level which prevailed at the end of September. Perhaps Terra Mining's biggest problem, from a potential investor's viewpoint, is that it has just one mine in operation at present, and one with only seven years of proven and probable reserves at that. The mine's president, Mr Torsten Borjemalm, is sensitive to this, but he brushes the criticism aside. 'How many other industries have an order stock of seven years? We know we have material to sell - it's only a question of price,' he says. Not only is the company confident that Bjorkdal's 'possible' reserves will extend its life further, it also has 60 other prospects on its books and expects to have at least one more mine, and possibly two, in operation by the year 2000. The most important exploration project is at Pahtavaara in Finland, which has proven reserves of 695,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.33 grams a tonne. A final decision on whether to develop this mine will be taken next year. Another interesting deposit is at Barsele in Sweden. It is partly because of the need to fund new mining developments that the company and its owners now want to broaden Terra's ownership base when it is listed. They will sell up to 1.3m shares at SKr140 a share. Norsk Hydro, the majority shareholder with 61 per cent, is to sell about 30 per cent of its stake as are the other two big shareholders, Euroventures Nordica and Mr Christer Lofgren, one of the company's founders. Presentations have been held in London, Paris, Stockholm and Edinburgh as part of the campaign to attract new owners from the Swedish and international investment community.</p>

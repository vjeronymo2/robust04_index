			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  BOOKS FOR LOOKS: MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY REVEALED IN VOLUME ABOUT HOT DESIGN  FIRM  </P> <P> Esprit, The Comprehensive Design Principle, by Doug Tompkins (Robundo: $95,  currently at Esprit Superstores and in bookstores in July).  </P> <P> Here is a delightful romp through one of the late-20th Century's hottest design  firms -- its products, its stores, its advertising, even its distinctive  hang-tags and sales signs. But careful observers will find far more here than  stunning color photos, ebulliently laid out and printed on an intriguing  selection of strangely coated papers.  </P> <P> In the book's short text, Esprit founder Tompkins also reveals some unexpected  clues to the esprit de corps management philosophy. He's not too precise about  solutions, but he writes thoughtfully about a firm's responsibility, for  instance, "to encourage a consumer to develop style and not be consumptive for  consumption's sake."  </P> <P> And consider this refreshing bit of honesty on hiring policy: "We try, above  all else, to find people who fit into our culture, whose value system is  compatible with ours; that socially, politically, aesthetically, professionally  and even athletically (!) think fundamentally like we do."

On January 26, 1973, notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (38 FR 2421) of the approval of the Washington plan and the adoption of subpart F to part 1952 containing the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington plan provides for the adoption of State standards that are at least as effective as comparable Federal standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. Section 1953.20 provides that where any alteration in the Federal program could have an adverse impact on the at least as effective as status of the State program, a plan change supplement shall be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated June 24, 1987, from Richard A. Davis, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State, on its own initiative, submitted an amendment to WAC 296&hyph;24&hyph;165, Fixed and Portable Power Tool Requirements, to change the scope and application of the standard from wood and woodworking tools to all tools. The State standard is comparable to the Federal standard at 29 CFR 1910.213, Woodworking Machinery Requirements. The State change was adopted on July 13, 1983, effective September 13, 1983, under Administrative Order 83&hyph;19. National Office review revealed that the State standard was not at least as effective as the Federal standard, and the submission was returned to the State for correction. On December 20, 1991, by letter from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, the State submitted a corrective amendment which deleted the changes submitted under Administrative Order 83&hyph;19, and incorporated the suggested language from the National Office. The State's original Fixed and Portable Power Took standard received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval (41 FR 22655) on June 4, 1976. The State's corrective amendment was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective December 24, 1991, under Washington's Administrative Order 91&hyph;07. The corrected State standard reduced the 1983 scope, but is still different from the Federal: The standard applies not only to wood, but also to wood products that contain plastic materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated February 8, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State, on its own initiative, submitted an amendment to its Machine Guarding Code. The State's original Machine Guarding Code received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval (41 FR 22655) on June 4, 1976. The amendment was adopted on January 10, 1991, effective February 12, 1991, under Administrative Order 90&hyph;18. The amendment added WAC 196&hyph;24&hyph;16531(6) to incorporate the coverage of public school woodworking shops. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated December 20, 1991, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, the State, on its own initiative, submitted an amendment to its Portable Powered Tools Code. This housekeeping amendment changed a reference in the standard. The State's original Portable Powered Tools standard received  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approval (41 FR 4687) on January 30, 1976. The amendment was adopted on November 22, 1991, effective December 24, 1991, under Administrative Order 91&hyph;07. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a Federal standards change, and on its own initiative, the State submitted by letters dated December 30, 1988, and April 24, 1990, from Joseph A. Dear, Director, to James W. Lake, Regional Administrator, a State standard comparable to the Federal Benzene standard, 29 CFR 1910.1028. The State's submission was in response to the Federal standard, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (52 FR 34562) on September 11, 1987, and amended in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 24334) on June 7, 1989. The State standard was adopted on July 29, 1988 as an emergency temporary standard, with permanent adoption on October 6, 1988, effective November 11, 1988, under Administrative Order 88&hyph;23. The State amended Appendix D on May 15, 1989, effective June 30, 1989, under Administrative Order 89&hyph;03. A State-initiated amendment to Appendix D was adopted on April 10, 1990, effective May 25, 1990, under Administrative Order 90&hyph;01. The State's Benzene standard, located at WAC 296&hyph;62&hyph;07523, contains these minor differences: The State specifies an alternate analytical method for determination of Benzene in air and bulk samples in Appendix D, and in the Detection Limits Section the State broadens the sampling rate from the Federal standard statement of 0.2 L/min to ``0.05 to 0.2 L/min''. Other corrections are administrative or typographical adjustments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RJR NABISCO RESTRUCTURES TO CUT DEBT  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco Inc. said today it is beginning a $6.9-billion refinancing that  will retire the debt-ladened company's most troublesome junk bonds and leave it  with a more conservative balance sheet.  </P> <P> The food and tobacco giant said $4.45 billion of its high-yield, high-risk junk  bonds, issued to help finance its record $24.9-billion leveraged buyout last  year, and $2 billion of other costly forms of debt will be replaced with  lower-cost bank debt, preferred stock and new equity.  </P> <P> Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said the program is expected to leave the  company with total debt of less than $20 billion and total equity of about $4  billion.  </P> <P> The company estimated its debt-to-equity ratio would drop to 5-to-1 at the  completion of the restructuring as compared to 23-to-1 last March.  </P> <P> "This comprehensive recapitalization initiates the second major phase of our  rebuilding program for RJR Nabisco," Gerstner said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> While the first phase included the divestiture of $5.5 billion in assets and  strategic changes to increase cash flow and improve profit margins, Gerstner  said the second phase will increase equity in the company by more than $3  billion, significantly reduce high-cost debt and eliminate all remaining  temporary bridge loans used to help finance the buyout.  </P></p>

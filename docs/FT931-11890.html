			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Mieno finally gives in to the political pressure MR YASUSHI MIENO, the Bank of Japan's governor, popularly known as 'stonehead' for his determination and discipline, seems to have finally succumbed. After months of pressure, which rose to a crescendo last week, the BoJ is expected to deliver within days its sixth cut in the official discount rate since September 1991. The rate, which has stood at 3.25 per cent for the past six months is likely to be cut to either 2.75 per cent or 2.5 per cent, the low it reached during the height of the bubble economy of the late 1980s. The fiercely independent Mr Mieno (left), promoted to governor with a mandate to burst the speculative bubble, has become increasingly troublesome to his political masters who desparately want a cure for the ailing economy. The economic case for a further rate cut has become overwhelming. Consumer confidence remains depressed, while corporate investment is still falling sharply. Inflation is likely to fall to close to 1 per cent this year. As the economy has declined so the political pressure on Mr Mieno has mounted. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is concerned that the 1993 budget may be delayed in the parliament. That could set back plans for another spending package later in the year. So an interest rate cut has become vital to maintain the momentum of expansionary policy to lift the economy away from recession. The bank's lack of independence from its political masters in the LDP was spelt out early last week, when Mr Yoshiro Mori, industry minister and vocal advocate for a more expansionary policy, indicated a rate cut was on the way. A European central banker familiar with the Bank of Japan remarked: 'At the end of the day the ministry of finance can get the Bank to do what it wants.' But it has also become clear that Mr Mieno has acquired some powerful enemies who have been prepared to go to considerable lengths to discredit him. The speculation flowed from an unprecedented article two weeks ago in a weekly magazine, which alleged that influential former finance ministry officials now in senior positions in banking and politics were plotting to replace Mr Mieno with a less independent governor. The conspiracy theories were fuelled last week by more strange goings on involving the BoJ. On Tuesday Mr Tsuneo Wakai, president of the Federation of Bankers' Associations, head of the powerful Mitsubishi Bank and the figurehead of the Japanese financial establishment, threw his weight behind calls for a more expansionary policy. The following day, a national newspaper published details of a highly confidential Bank of Japan report on Mitsubishi Bank's corporate strategy, which named banks Mitsubishi was keen to take over. That day Mr Mieno cancelled a press conference blaming a cold, but there was little trace of this when he gave evidence to parliament the day after. For the past few months Mr Mieno has been playing pass the parcel with the LDP. The BoJ has insisted it will not cut rates until public spending shoulders more of the burden for stimulating the economy. A cut may give the politicians enough breathing space to enable them to finalise plans for a emergency spending package later in the year. But the lull could be shortlived, for the spotlight will swing inexorably onto the LDP's plans for tax cuts and public spending increases to save the economy from outright recession. The politicians will then be the ones on the spot.</p>

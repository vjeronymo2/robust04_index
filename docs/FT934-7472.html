			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Experts top up their pensions in time for the Budget ON THE principle of following what the experts do and not what they say, people should get their pension contributions up to date before the Budget speech at the end of this month. In anticipation of what they believe the chancellor will announce on November 30, leading tax practitioners are accelerating pension payments - and even taking out loans to do so. Partners at the UK's largest accountancy firms, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand and KPMG Peat Marwick, are being urged to top up their pensions before the Budget statement. Price Waterhouse is considering similar action. Their action reflects concern that the government has decided to remove tax relief on pensions. Mr Peter Wyman, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'We are suggesting to partners that they think very seriously about getting up to date before the Budget.' The chancellor may remove upper-rate tax relief on pension contributions or eliminate tax-free lump sums when a pension matures. A third and more likely option - which would have a less immediately visible impact - would be to impose capital gains tax or remove advance corporation tax relief on pension funds. As self-employed taxpayers, many partners in professional firms would normally not pay their contributions for the last tax year until next April, but may now try to pay both last year's and this year's before the end of this month. Mr Ian Barlow, a tax partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said yesterday: 'We are certainly taking precautions.' He had urged corporate clients to do the same. The gamble is that if the chancellor does not remove tax concessions but instead raises the rate of income tax, they will not be able to claim the additional tax reliefs generated at this higher level of tax. But Mr Wyman said that this option was unlikely, and that the additional interest on accelerated contributions would in any case partially partly compensate. Call to limit state pensions, Page 13</p>

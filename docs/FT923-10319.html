			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Observer: Harmony brewing While blood is thicker than water, it's said, ale could be thicker than either. Or so it may prove, at least, in the case of Yorkshire brewing family the Theakstons, of the picturesque village of Masham, near Ripon. Blood-ties did not prevent them from being riven in twain 10 years ago by a boardroom battle, leaving cousins Paul and Michael Theakston on opposite sides of the divide. What caused the split was a Wars of the Roses bid for the family company by Lancashire brewer Matthew Brown, which eventually succeeded. Then in 1987 the company, with its Old Peculier brand, was acquired by Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Despite the continuing bad blood, both cousins joined the new owner. But Paul soon quit, declaring himself 'unable to function' as an S&amp;N executive. Next month, he expects to begin production at the Black Sheep Brewery he has set up over the past two years in Masham, a stone's throw from the old family plant, and so compete with S&amp;N where Michael Theakston is now a director. Far from widening the rift, however, the move seems to be bringing the cousins together as friendly rivals with the shared aim of making the village the real ale capital of north England. 'I admire what Paul is doing, and think there's room for both of us here,' says Michael. 'This is a great opportunity for us to try and establish Masham as the home of cask-conditioned ale.' Paul agrees, explaining that despite being a competing company, his brewery will produce a different beer. 'The last thing I wish to do is to clone Theakstons,' he adds. 'I simply didn't want to leave Masham, and brewing is in the family blood.' Nice to think it's now running mild instead of bitter.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Mr Mugabe lets slip an unsettling aside: The whites' seizure of Africa's wealth is too recent for blacks to ignore It was just one phrase in a four hour debate about 'indigenisation of the Zimbabwe economy', but Robert Mugabe may come to regret it. Some Zimbabweans, he suggested at a conference this week, are 'more indigenous than others'. When he went on to draw a distinction between what he called 'the indigenous indigenous' and the merely 'indigenous', Zimbabwe's president made no mention of colour. But the delegates knew perfectly well what he meant. The former are the 11m black Zimbabweans. The latter are the 100,000 or so whites, some of whom proudly boast of being third generation 'white Africans', but most of whom go back no further than the wave of immigrants from post-war Britain. Nearly 15 years after independence in 1980, the economic imbalance has barely begun to be redressed. The numbers of whites has fallen from the pre-independence peak of 275,000, but those that remain still control most of commerce and industry, and about 80 per cent of the 4,000 commercial farms. Judging by his wry smile, Mr Mugabe was fully aware of the Orwellian undertones to his comment. Nothing he said, before or after, suggested that he was threatening the white minority with second class citizenship. Indeed, on several occasions, Mr Mugabe cooled emotions, arguing at one point that the post-independence generation of whites would be more integrated than their parents, and repudiating a speaker who - partly in jest, it should be said - suggested it might be necessary to return to the bush to win the battle for black control of the economy. Furthermore, many of the speakers seemed not so much resentful of whites' dominance of the economy, as critical of what they saw as the government's failure to provide sufficient venture capital and management training programmes for black entrepreneurs. But Mr Mugabe's aside could nevertheless prove dangerous. Whether he sanctions it or not, there is a danger that in the run-up to next year's election, officials of the ruling Zanu-Zapu coalition may be tempted to play the populist card in an attempt to divert attention from the government's shortcomings. Widely regarded as corrupt, with many senior army officials, ministers and senior civil servants known to have enriched themselves through business and property deals over the years, the ruling coalition is expected to win the poll by default, such is the calibre of a fractious and poorly led opposition. It is a tactic that may well appeal to the hundreds of thousands of frustrated youngsters in a well-nigh hopeless search for work, in an economy where the pain of structural adjustment is more apparent than the benefits. At least 20,000 workers have been laid off since economic reforms started in 1991. Every year more school leavers join the ranks of the unemployed. Black resentment goes deeper than this, however, and goes to the very heart of the country's creation. The foundations of white economic power were laid barely a hundred years ago, consolidated by victory in what the white settlers called a 'rebellion' and what their adversaries saw as the first 'chimurenga' or war of liberation in 1896-7. In 1890 Cecil John Rhodes' British South Africa Company acted on its belief that what is now known as Zimbabwe contained gold reefs as rich as South Africa's Witwatersrand. Promising each settler 15 gold claims and 1,200 hectares of land, it recruited what most historians would call an 'invasion force' but which white 'Rhodesians' to this day refer to as 'the pioneer column'. Two hundred whites enlisted, and the expedition set out in June that year from northern Bechuanaland (now Botswana), in the direction of what is today Zimbabwe's Mashonaland province. Three months later the British flag was raised on the site of Salisbury, now Harare. Thus Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was born - but not without a fight for supremacy. The first of two battles between the settlers and the African people was soon to begin. On March 20, 1896, the Ndebele began their war ('umvukela') against white rule, rising in the south; in June, the Shona people in the north followed suit, launching their campaign, or 'chimurenga', and in one week killing 100 settlers. But by the end of 1897 it was over, African spears were no match for Europe's rifles. The last defenders held out in caves. Some were starved into submission. Others died when sticks of dynamite were tossed into the caves. The first chimurenga was over, but it was not forgotten. After the first war for independence, the victors seized the spoils in a process which continued into the 1950s. Between 1908 and 1915 the company put 1.5m acres of the country's best land into settler hands, establishing the pattern for today's white-owned commercial farm sector. Later, under the pretext of preventing overstocking on land designated for 'natives', cattle were impounded, more than a million head between 1946 and 1950, with many resold cheaply to white farmers. The whites obtained mining concessions of questionable validity for themselves. The whites who negotiated them may well have misled the local chiefs about the significance of the concession documents they signed. Meanwhile Africans were effectively coerced to provide the labour to develop the concessions through the imposition of a compulsory hut tax, which most were only able to pay if they worked in the mines. As recently as the years after the second world war, more than 100,000 people were evicted from white-owned farm land. Notwithstanding this background, the government has moved cautiously. But Mr Mugabe, referring to the government's programme of land redistribution through purchase of white farms (only a handful so far) can be forgiven if there was an undertone of anger in his comment to the conference this week: 'We have to pay those those who seized it from us, though they did not pay us.' Some 70 years after the first chimurenga, the spirit of the time and the leaders of the day were evoked when black Zimbabweans again went to war. Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence in November 1965, an assertion of continued minority rule in defiance of Britain, was to prove the signal for the second chimurenga. This time the settlers were defeated, and deeply apprehensive about their fate as it became clear Robert Mugabe had won the 1980 independence elections. But the man vilified for years as a 'communist terrorist' was magnanimous and compassionate in victory, appealing for racial reconciliation in a speech that rescued the country from the risk of post election turmoil. But the political victory has done comparatively little to alter the structure of ownership of the economy. Nor, given the government's limited resources, and the constraints of today's world, can the government do much about it. As Mr Mugabe wryly remarked during Wednesday's debate, times have changed since the days of the first chimurenga: 'We are behaving like gentleman, and acting gradually,' he said. Zimbabwe's whites may not see it that way. Nor, one suspects, may foreign investors. And as for the impatient black Zimbabweans, particularly the disgruntled youth, they might argue that it is time their government stopped behaving like gentlemen. Either way, Mr Mugabe may be reflecting, he cannot win.</p>

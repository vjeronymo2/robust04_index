			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): A flexible friend when you retire - Annuities / But strict regulatory controls are needed to avoid abuses THE MEASURE: Flexible annuities, which allow you to draw a regular income from your pension fund while keeping the rest invested fully, will be available by mid-1995. WHAT IT MEANS: If you have a personal pension, retirement annuity or executive plan, you can now take about 25 per cent of your fund at retirement as tax-free cash and must use the rest to buy an annuity from a life office which guarantees to pay a regular (taxed) income for life. The annuity rate - that is, the guaranteed income you secure with your investment - is determined by your age (the older you are, the better the rates); sex (women tend to out-live men, so their rates are lower to reflect this); and prevailing annuity rates, which are determined largely by yields on long-term gilts. As gilt prices fluctuate, so also do annuity rates. In January, these were up to 40 per cent lower than in May 1990. Moreover, once you hand over your money you cannot change anything and, in most cases, the whole fund is forfeited on death. The flexible version, if used wisely, will help you avoid the annuity troughs and allow you to defer the annuity purchase until rates improve, or by age-75 at the latest. Brian Hurl, marketing director of independent adviser Lexis, explains: 'At retirement, you can still take your tax-free cash. The rest of the fund acts like a bank account, from which you draw your taxed income. You can invest the remainder in a range of insurance company pension funds which allow you to spread the risk according to your circumstances.' During the deferment period, any growth in the fund will continue to build up tax-free. Simon Philip, director of personal finance with chartered accountant Binder Hamlyn, says: 'The investment of the fund must be geared to provide the right amount of income at the right time. Pensioners hoping to lock in to annuity rates when these improve should keep the fund in relatively low-risk assets to avoid the impact of stock market volatility at the time they want to buy their annuity.' Sophisticated investors should be able to run their own portfolio or appoint a stockbroker for this function under a 'self-invested' flexible annuity. The amount of income you can withdraw will be based on what you could get under a conventional annuity. The Revenue will check the income level every three years to make sure you have sufficient assets to cover your later retirement years. But if you are to retire shortly and want to consider a flexible annuity, you might have to fall back on savings to cover income requirements between now and next summer. On paper, the flexible annuity looks good. In practice there are several important cautions. First, conventional annuities offer a rock-solid guarantee. Once you move away from this, you enter a risk zone. Second, when you buy a conventional annuity, you pay a one-off charge to cover all its costs. But the annual administration and investment charges associated with running a flexible annuity will be much higher in the long term. As a result, it will be a viable option only for those with a minimum of Pounds 100,000 in their fund at retirement. Third, this product represents a lucrative new market for advisers and life office salesmen. Instead of losing clients at retirement, there is a chance to keep them on their books for another 10 to 15 years. Moreover, the flexibility appears to apply only to personal pensions. So, there might be a temptation to switch clients out of occupational schemes and into personal pensions just before retirement. The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulator, is now dealing with thousands of cases where personal pensions were sold wrongly to those with company scheme benefits. The message is clear: strict regulatory controls over sales procedures for flexible annuities are essential to prevent another pensions scandal. High earners The ceiling on pension contributions and benefits for some high earners will rise in line with price inflation for the 1995-96 tax year to Pounds 78,600 (Pounds 76,800 in 1994-95). The earnings 'cap' affects company pension schemes set up after the 1989 Budget and those who joined a scheme after June 1 1989. For the 1995-96 tax year, the maximum contribution for capped employees will be Pounds 52,400, while the maximum tax-free cash will be Pounds 117,900. The contribution limits (but not the benefit limits) apply to personal pensions. High earners planning a change of job should examine the pension implications. Even if they are not caught by the cap now, the act of leaving an old scheme and entering a new one will trigger the earnings cap rules.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CAN WE GO HOME AGAIN?'  </P> <P> Last year, Lynwood commissioned Hintz &amp; Balvin Communications to create a  video history of the city so that youngsters and newcomers could appreciate  where they are living. In the process, we got to know Lynwood as a city of  people who are friendly and care about their city.  </P> <P> The camera crew created curiosity and people on the street were terribly  pleased to be the focus of a positive piece on their area. The video gathered  together Lynwood old-timers and newcomers in a project that they could all be  proud of -- The City of Lynwood.  </P> <P> We concluded that Lynwood seems to have a special sort of strength and staying  power. It lives strongly in people's happy memories of its past but even more  strongly in the current residents' determination to create there a new  All-American City.  </P> <P> BARBARA BOYER WALTER  </P> <P> Hintz &amp; Balvin  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

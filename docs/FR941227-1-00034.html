			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that the requirements of the standard will necessarily be modified. NHTSA has undertaken to investigate this issue more carefully and, after the conclusion of this investigation, will decide whether it should propose any modifications to the test procedure. In the meantime, manufacturers must continue to certify their vehicles for compliance according to the existing requirements of Standard No. 216 unless and until some modified requirements are in place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that NHTSA agrees with all that is said in these petitions. For instance, the RVIA petition asks that Standard No. 220 test for roof crush resistance be substituted for the current Standard No. 216 test for roof crush resistance. NHTSA is concerned that such a substitution could result in a less stringent test over the front seating positions, or may not be appropriate to evaluate the strength of the pillars for crush resistance. Standard No. 220 was developed for school buses and it assesses the roof crush protection afforded for the entire seating area. It does this by using a test procedure that loads the entire roof structure, including A-, B-, and any other pillars in the vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By way of contrast, Standard No. 216 is applicable to smaller vehicles. Front seat occupants experience the vast majority of deaths and injuries in these vehicles. To address this, a test procedure was developed to assess the roof crush protection afforded to front seat occupants. The test procedure concentrates the load in the vicinity of one of the A-pillars to simulate the most severe impact condition that a pillar would experience in a rollover crash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It appears, then, that substituting the Standard No. 220 test for raised roof vehicles instead of the Standard No. 216 test, would trade off increased roof crush protection for rear seat occupants in those vehicles, with diminished protection for front seat occupants. However, there is no supporting information in the RIVA petition that quantifies either how much protection front seat occupants might lose or how much protection rear seat occupants might gain from this substitution. The agency will examine this carefully in its research before deciding whether to consider any change to the current test requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, RVIA suggested that the strength of the A-pillars in the vehicle that is converted by its members would be demonstrated by the original vehicle manufacturer's certification for the vehicle that complied with Standard No. 216. The agency is not convinced at this point that this conclusion is valid because the agency has no data to prove or disprove that the roof strength in the area of the A-pillars is affected by raised roof conversions. RVIA provided no such data in its petition in support of their claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its petition, Ford did provide some test data, although they were very limited. Ford provided roof crush test results for two prototypes of a new vehicle design. In one, the test plate was positioned according to the current Standard No. 216 procedures. In the second, the front edge of the test plate was positioned 100 mm behind the front corner of the roof (closer to the A-pillar structure). The test results from the latter procedure produced a peak force that was 49 percent higher than the peak force produced using the current positioning procedure, within 5 inches of crush. When following Standard No. 216 test procedures, the test plate was positioned 150 mm behind the windshield opening, completely missing the A-pillar and leading edge of the roof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

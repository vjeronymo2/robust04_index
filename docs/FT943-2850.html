			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize set-aside of 5% expected Faced with a near-record crop and mounting grain stocks, the US Department of Agriculture is expected to ask farmers to set aside, or lay fallow, 5 per cent of the land they ordinarily would plant to maize in 1995. Grain analysts say that, if the current US maize harvest balloons to a record, the set-aside apportionment could rise to 7.5 per cent by mid-November. The USDA is required to announce its preliminary set-aside requirement for maize by September 30 and can make adjustments until November 15. US farmers follow set-aside guidelines to be eligible for price support. US farmers are set to harvest about 9.257m bushels of maize this autumn. Farmers have known since May that they will not have to set aside any land for next year's wheat crop, a factor they see tied as much to the US government's desire to remain competitive in the world wheat markets as to any domestic supply management needs. They have not been required to make idle wheat acres under the so-called Acerage Reduction Program since 1992, when there was a 5 per cent set-aside. US wheat stocks have risen steadily from 472m bushels in 1991 to a projected 581m bushels this year.</p>

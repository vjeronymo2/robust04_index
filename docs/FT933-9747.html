			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Japan finds favour in Far East funds  -The potential for growth now a Pacific superpower is emerging from the doldrums THE Far East investment trust sector incorporates some of the world's most dynamic emerging markets, but it also includes the more mature market of Japan. That country's presence has at times seemed to act as a drag on Far Eastern funds. Over the last seven years to August 1, Far East funds which excluded Japan grew almost twice as much as those which included it. However, at present fund managers in the sector are generally positive on Japan's investment potential. Foreign &amp; Colonial's Pacific fund is about 41 per cent invested in Japan. Ian Wright, manager of the fund, says: 'It is quite difficult to argue the fundamental case that the market is particularly cheap in terms of investment criteria, but the scenario we have is that the new government coming in under Hosokawa will want to stimulate what is a very, very depressed economy. Our view is that there will be further cuts in interest rates and also income tax cuts. We think both those things will be good for the market.' The Drayton Far Eastern fund is also keen on Japan, with about 41 per cent of its investments there. 'Our strategy has been to shift more of the portfolio into Japan. It has paid off,' says Julian Pickstone, a manager of the fund. Hong Kong, with the second largest stock market in the region, has an important place in the portfolio of most funds. Managers are concerned about the Chinese economy, and action being taken by the new economic tsar, Zhu Rongji, to cool it down. If the slow-down were too abrupt, it could have a harsh impact on Hong Kong and other markets with a China link. 'The current belief is that China will go through a soft landing, but I don't think anyone knows that,' says Wright. 'There are more risks in Hong Kong than there were six months ago. We are not putting any new money in, we are watching and seeing rather than being terribly optimistic.' 'We are less negative on Hong Kong than a lot of our competitors,' says Drayton's Pickstone, pointing out that Hong Kong's ties with the US are keeping interest rates low at present. He sees potential for further growth. Michael Watt, manager of the TR Far East Income Trust, has reduced the fund's exposure to Hong Kong from more than 30 per cent to just over 22 per cent. 'That has been pulled back because of some nervousness about the overheating in China and the continuing political impasse between Britain and Hong Kong. The feeling was that we had had a very good run in Hong Kong for a while, and we ought to be increasing our exposure to Australasia,' he says. The TR trust has a very different portfolio from other funds in the sector, as it picks stocks for their income rather than just growth potential. The fund is expected to yield around 5 per cent this year, compared with less than 1 per cent for the other five funds in the sector, which aim for capital growth. The proportion of TR's investment in Hong Kong is similar to other funds, but it has only 1.4 per cent in Japan. Other relatively large exposures are to Thailand, with 17.8 per cent, Australia, 25 per cent, and New Zealand, 8.3 per cent. 'You can get good high-yielding stocks, quality companies in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, but it is very hard in most of the rest of the region to generate high yields,' says Watt. 'The beauty of high yields is that you find them in cheap markets, almost by definition.' Singapore is seen as a good, fairly safe bet by several managers. The government is expected to keep the market on an upward trend in advance of the flotation of Singapore Telecom later this year, which could increase the market's capitalisation by about 20 per cent. 'They are not going to let the market fall before Telecom goes, probably in September,' predicts Pickstone. One problem with developing markets is investment restrictions. 'The other market we like is Korea, but that is quite difficult now because something like 100 stocks are closed to foreign investors,' complains Wright. South Korea imposes a 10 per cent limit on foreign ownership of a company's stock, which has been reached in most popular ones. The limit is expected to be raised, but until then foreigners have to wait. These investment trusts all operate savings schemes with a minimum monthly investment of Pounds 25. Minimum lump sum investments are Pounds 250 for the TR and Foreign &amp; Colonial funds, and Pounds 1,000 for the Drayton fund. Pep schemes are available with TR and Foreign &amp; Colonial, but a maximum of Pounds 1,500 can be invested in these funds through a Pep.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FAR EAST INVESTMENT TRUSTS INCLUDING JAPAN  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Growth over                              -------------------------------- Fund name                     1 year     3 years     5 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Govett Oriental                104.5        37.8       101.3 F&amp;C Pacific                     93.6        63.1       125.7 Drayton Far Eastern             93.3         6.5        96.0 Fleming Far Eastern             77.8        32.9        70.3 TR Far East Income              72.2        74.8           - Martin Currie Pacific           71.7        60.7       139.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures to August 1, mid-market to mid-market, net income reinvested on payment date.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hardwick Stafford Wright StatsPack  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

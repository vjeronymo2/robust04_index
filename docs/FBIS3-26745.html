A high-ranking government official said it is a top priority  to unify China's trade policies this year in line with the  demand of Gatt, the world trade body.    Over the past few years confused foreign investors have  complained about the discrepancies between central and local  government policies.    Because of this uncertainty, a number of potential investors  have shied away from the Chinese market. On the other hand,  many foreign businesses have taken advantage of generously  preferential local policies to make piles of money.    "We wouldn't like to see either of these cases in the  future," said the senior government official, who asked not to  be named.    China is expected to resume its contracting party status in  Gatt by 1995, but when it does it will be barred from allowing  policies to vary from region to region.    The government official said China is prepared to unify  policies soon for the same industries, but not for regions.    "We will convert a certain amount of special economic zones  to free trade areas, which are accepted internationally," the  official said, adding that all other regions will enjoy equal  treatment in the same commercial sectors.    The change will most benefit China's vast inland regions,  which have trailed behind the coastal areas in attracting  foreign investment.    Wu Yi, Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation,  noted that although foreign investment last year grew faster in  the hinterlands, the bulk was still concentrated in the coastal  regions.    Wu said more than 120 countries and regions had invested in  China by the end of 1993. They focused on energy, light  industry, electronics, machinery, textiles and garments,  metallurgy, building materials and real estate.    Foreign businesses have also sought a larger share of  China's  service markets, which are nowhere near as developed as those in  the West.</p>

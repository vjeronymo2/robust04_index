			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Golembiovskiy and Sergey Agafonov : </F> "Moscow Cast in Role of Extra in Economic Ties With Seoul"]    [Text] Seoul -- This year marks the fourth anniversary of  the establishment of diplomatic relations between Moscow and  Seoul. This is an absurdly short period in historical terms, but  is long enough for us to take stock.    The results of our stocktaking will depend on our mood,  since  there are not very many indisputable statements to be made -- it  is beyond dispute, for instance, that a normalization of  contacts is better and more civilized than a lack of contacts  for ideological reasons; it is beyond dispute that the  establishment of ties between Moscow and Seoul has helped to  stabilize the situation in the region; and it is beyond dispute  that new prospects have opened up for the development of diverse  and mutually advantageous partnership ties with great potential.  That is probably everything on the "obvious" list. In our  subsequent assessments of any problem or aspect of our bilateral  "baggage" everything will depend on interpretation.  Particularly if it is a question not of an amorphous or  hard-to-calculate "political dialogue" but of specific economic  matters, which sometimes set the entire tone of our relations.    Judge for yourselves. Previously there was no direct trade,  while deals done through intermediaries in third countries  barely amounted to $10 million. Now mutual trade turnover has  surged to $1.5 billion, and the advantages of direct contacts  are obvious. Is that an achievement? Certainly, but on the  other hand, statistics show that the trade turnover growth rate  is slowing with every passing year, certain sectors are marking  time, and the development of contacts is being held up by a lot  of objective and subjective factors. We are doing worse than  other countries "new" to Korea -- for instance, Seoul's trade  turnover with China is several times more than its trade with  Russia, and the Koreans even have more investments in Uzbekistan  or Vietnam than they have here. What is there to be complacent  about there?    Another illustration is the talk about opening a new market  for Russia -- virtually a "gateway to the Asia region." Is this  correct? Once again, on the one hand, it is (if you are  thinking of the market for sales of raw materials and  semimanufactures), but obviously it is not if we are talking  about the market for finished goods and products. The Koreans  would be quite right to credit themselves with having made a  breakthrough into the Russian commodity market, but the reverse  is not true -- there is not even any hint of reciprocity.    Our relations, which seem to be developing but have at the  same time managed to get really bogged down, moving from a  galloping beginning to a "middling" rate as we end our first  four years, essentially consist of such "pros" and "cons." And  although, on the eve of the Russo-Korean summit, there is a  strong temptation to talk about what has been achieved in good  terms and to proclaim our present situation as active and  dynamic, we should not deceive ourselves.    Calling a spade a spade, it has to be admitted that our  contacts lack any systematic, well-thought-out approach and are  motivated -- at least on the Russian side -- by an inescapable  sense of drift, occasionally interrupted by various sporadic and  impromptu leadership demarches designed, as a rule, to mark  trips and diplomatic tours. When the tours end, these demarches  are mutually forgotten.    However much we may want positive news, in their years  together Moscow and Seoul have not seen through to a successful  conclusion or even begun any of the major projects devised and  proclaimed at top level. Korean official statistics, for  instance, put the number of joint undertakings with Russia at  the modest figure of 28, and the size of Korean investment at  $26 million. The only memorable large-scale actions have been  the operation for massive deliveries of South Korean soap and  washing powder during the Soviet "soap crisis" and the $1.5  billion in loans which Gorbachev's Moscow obtained as a reward  for its forced march toward the establishment of diplomatic  relations.    Incidentally, twice as much had been promised, but Seoul  froze the second half, since no payments on the first half had  been forthcoming. This debt hitch, as far as the Koreans are  concerned, has turned into a sore point that will not go away.  Admittedly, in actual fact the problem is small in money terms,  but very convenient for Seoul tactically. And although Moscow  is offering in payment raw materials, weapons, or land in the  Russian capital for Korean use for 99 years, there has been no  progress on the debt issue, which serves as a major and  excellent argument in altercations with Korea's Russian partners  when the latter complain about the shortage of investment or the  Korean side's reluctance to develop Siberia's resources or  tackle other major projects.    But we should not grumble at the Koreans for their  intractability and formal approach -- they have their own  interests, and this is not the main problem. The problem, it  seems to me, is that Russia has no interests, and over the past  four years of regular contacts Moscow has still not decided  where it stands on the main issue -- just where does the  Republic of Korea rank in the system of Russian political,  diplomatic, and economic priorities? For instance, the  beautiful formulas about complementary economic potential that  can be heard from time to time are not the goal of the process,  just a slogan and another line in official documents. In other  words, Russia is suffering from diplomatic and economic anemia,  totally vague ideas about its own future interests, and a lack  of consistent action.    Conversely, Seoul is using Moscow skillfully and with  pleasure, obtaining visible and tangible benefits for itself.  Through diplomatic relations with the USSR a bridge was built  toward the normalization of contacts with China; Korea's  position in the region was strengthened; a new point of support  [tochka opory] emerged, as it were; and its room for maneuver  was increased. South Korea is now freely and exclusively for its  own benefit siphoning off Russia's "gray matter," transferring  our scientific personnel very cheaply and without any great fuss  to its own laboratories; the Koreans are gradually opening up  the Russian raw materials market and taking what they need in  the amounts they need. Translated into the language of  priorities, this means that Korea has, as it were, set aside  three "niches" for Russia -- the political niche (the function  of providing a balance and counterweight in regional policy,  which is very important for Seoul, hemmed in as it is by giants  such as the United States, Japan, and China); the technological  niche (neither the Japanese, the Americans, nor the Europeans  are making new technology freely available to the Koreans, nor  will they, and without this technology the "engine" of the  Korean economy -- exports -- will rapidly grind to a halt); and  the raw materials niche. Seoul is "trawling" through these  three areas in line with its own needs. Current Korean interests  make no provision for a close alliance with Moscow politically  and are not prompting them economically to make major financial  investments or to implement giant projects -- something, quite  apart from anything else, for which the creaky Korean economy  (which urgently needs fundamental restructuring) is itself  objectively unprepared.    As a result we now have the kind of relationship with Seoul  that Seoul wants. The common references to Russian musical  chairs and vagueness are of little importance in this instance.  The objective difficulties caused by market and semimarket  reforms, the sad nature of Russian economic reality, and our  political instability are all not so much a cause of delays in  our bilateral relations, rather they are the background against  which these delays occur. The reason is that the existing volume  and structure of relations satisfies South Korea, it simply does  not need any more from Moscow. And Moscow is cast in the  unenviable role of an extra engaged in its own domestic  squabbles.    Russian "traders" are currently the only people at the  moment  who are really deriving any professional benefit from contacts  with Korea. However much they may be looked down upon by  officials, there is no denying the obvious fact that these  traders are investing tens of millions of dollars in Korea, they  are organizing trade specialization with whole areas of Korea,  and, finally -- unlike the Russian Government or Russian regions  -- they have access to Korean private credit (something which  Russian official structures can only dream about).    These "trader diplomats" can be accused of anything you  like,  but you cannot deny that they clearly target end results and  certainty in their intentions and choice of goal. These small  wholesale-market hustlers are, regrettably, sometimes better  known and better respected in Korea than many official  representatives of the country that produced them.    This is a paradox, but it is natural, since the invention of  slogans and the search for ways to show that Russia is great and  influential do not produce any real returns. Eloquent evidence  of this is the simple fact that the Russian Embassy in Seoul is  housed in a gloomy barrack-like building surrounded by street  drains and with a frontage hard up against a dirty fence covered  with garbage. The two-headed bird on the embassy plaque is  facing away from the fence, but both the heads gaze on an  unedifying scene, while St. George the Conqueror's lance is  absurdly pointing at a dent in the roof in which a dirty pool of  water has formed. Where is your pride, great Russia, and what  is the point in puffing out your official cheeks if even this  trivial matter of economic representation cannot be properly  resolved? After all, it is not the "harmful Koreans" who are to  blame, but Moscow alone which has permitted itself to be  humiliated and has lost all face in its quest for a "new face."    And this wrong note, incidentally, applies not only to  Russo-Korean ties, but also directly to Russia's positions in  the entire Asia-Pacific region. It is high time that our  leaders gave this some thought. Moscow's foreign policy in the  socialist era was a high-profile appendage of the system -- it  cost a pittance, but it carried out its ideological tasks. Now  the regime is different, and it is not the function of an  appendage that is important in foreign policy, but the function  of safeguarding genuine national interests. There should be  fewer declarations and initiatives -- nobody will shed any tears  for them. But we simply must sort out our priorities and decide  what our aims and tasks are.    As people like to say, we can do anything we set our minds  on. But just when will we finally set our minds on doing  something?</p>

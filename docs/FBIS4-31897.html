			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- The Government of  Romania approved in its Tuesday, 14 June, meeting a resolution  for the reorganization of the national news agency ROMPRES. The  reorganization of ROMPRES is required by the need for a clearer  definition of its objectives and for the improvement of its  activities; for the need to provide it with the necessary  juridical status and functional pattern in tune with the  importance of a public institution of national interest.    The government resolution spells the importance of the role  and duties the national news agency ROMPRES has in ensuring a  prompt and objective conveyance of information to both the  Romanian and foreign press, and its provisions pursue to  stimulate the agency's participation in the information flow in  Romania and to enhance its cooperation with the national and  international press agencies.    The resolution defines the national news agency ROMPRES as a  public institution of national interest, financed by the state  budget and operating at the legal and financial standards valid  for all budget-subsidized institutions.    ROMPRES carries out its attributions free from any  ideological, political, or economic influences or partiality  likely to impair the accuracy of the information it releases.    In order to adequately fulfill its attributions, ROMPRES is  authorized to request press information from state institutions,  ministries, and other bodies of the central and local public  authorities.    ROMPRES staff are entitled, in the exerting of their duties,  to legal protection, in similar conditions with any civil  servant. The specialized staff engaged in activities specific  for the press have the rights and duties as devolving upon them  from the profession of journalist, and, as such, are entitled to  the protection of the law.    The general director of the national news agency ROMPRES is  appointed by the prime minister, his position being equivalent  to that of a secretary of state.</p>

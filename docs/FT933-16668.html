			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / People: Chamberlain's guide Geoffrey Chamberlain (right), formerly chairman of the London Traded Options market before its merger with Liffe, London's successful futures market, is pursuing his aim of bringing stock options to the UK private investor through other channels. Yesterday, he launched a bi-weekly guide called The Option Trader, which seeks to persuade private investors of the 'exciting and potentially rewarding opportunities offered by the medium of traded options'. The magazine includes analysis, recommendations and a back-to-basics educational section. Under the same parent company, Financial Publications, Chamberlain also runs a retail client broking firm, Durlacher &amp; Co., formed in January 1992 by the merger of two existing companies. His publishing company, Throgmorton Press, plans to launch further publications, or to buy existing subscription-based magazines aimed at the retail market.</p>

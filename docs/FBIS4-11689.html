			<p>BFN     [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal says there will be  joint patrols between Palestinian police and the Israeli  security forces in Hebron. In an interview with Amy Rhodes,  Shahal said the move can be implemented immediately, and he  hopes it will promote understanding between Israelis and the  Palestinians.    [Begin recording] [Shahal] This was needed to give a  feeling of security to the Palestinians living in Hebron after  what happened on 25 February. The major issue, and the most  important one is to have progress in the peace process.    [Rhodes] According to the compromise, there will be some 100  Palestinian policemen in Hebron. How will it work?    [Shahal] Well, first of all, the Palestinian police who are  members of this police force....[pauses] It's going to be a  municipality police force. They are going to be responsible for  the institutions of the Palestinians in Hebron, they are going  to be responsible for the Palestinian inhabitants. They will  have joint patrols together with Israeli security forces,  including Israel Police officers. They will be entitled to have  light arms -- the same that the Israel Police forces have, and  those arms are going to be for self-defense of the police  officers, and only when they are on duty. So, I think that it  is very clearly defined what are the limitations, what is the  jurisdiction. I hope it will promote understanding between the  Israeli security forces and the future Palestinian police force.    [Rhodes] How soon until something like this can be  implemented?    [Shahal] Immediately. [end recording]</p>

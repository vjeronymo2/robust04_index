			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Observer: Home truths Out-of-work intellectuals need worry no more. Singapore wants you. George Yeo, Singapore's minister of information and arts, has just unveiled his ambition to create a cultural and intellectual habitat in the island republic. Interesting minds, said Yeo, would be attracted to live and work in Singapore. Men and women of ability would be welcomed, including those without jobs in the former Soviet Union. 'We are tolerant and cosmopolitan because that is in our very essence, not by choice but by necessity,' said Yeo. 'No matter the land he hails from, every visitor finds a little of home in Singapore.' Former Soviet citizens may well agree. Thanks to a ban on satellite dishes, Singapore citizens cannot watch foreign TV. Films and videos are carefully censored. The press is most polite to the government. There's a ban on the sale of foreign publications, such as the Far Eastern Economic Review and Cosmopolitan magazine, which might offend Singaporean political or moral sensibilities. Oh yes. Former Soviets should also remember to leave their chewing gum at home. It too is prohibited.</p>

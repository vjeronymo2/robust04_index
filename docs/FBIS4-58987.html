The comrade secretary of the al-Sulaymaniyah Branch of the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party told an INA correspondent that leader  President Saddam Husayn's generous contribution will be  distributed to poor families to ease their suffering as a result  of the continuation of the unjust blockade imposed on the  unyielding Iraqi people.</p>

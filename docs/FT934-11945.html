			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (8): Nightmare for harmonisers - Regulation THE international capital markets are a regulator's nightmare: responsibility is split not only between different geographical jurisdictions, but also between banks and securities houses. However, the spread of EC-wide regulation is forcing greater standardisation of Europe's financial markets. 'Regulators are not targeting the Euromarkets but are targeting certain activities,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Wellens, chairman of the International Primary Market Association. 'EC regulators are trying to set a standard for financial transactions in the EC, and international regulators like the Bank for International Settlements also impact on the market.' Recently, the European Community's directives on Capital Adequacy (CAD) and Investment Services (ISD) - the cornerstones of EC law on the investment markets - have been the centre of attention. The revised regulatory framework is seen as opening the prospect of a single capital market throughout the EC, providing financial institutions with a single EC passport to exploit opportunities. The ISD is designed to harmonise regulation of financial services across Europe, and the CAD is designed to provide a common basis for determining the capital banks have to put aside to support certain activities; the goal is a level playing field. Both directives have been adopted and member states need to translate them into local law, by January 1, 1996. Unfortunately, the revised framework is also seen as possibly putting EC-based banks and securities houses at a disadvantage with non-EC competitors who do not have to adhere to international standards; the pressure for the level playing field is less in the US and Japan than in Europe. The debate might be over but that does not mean an end to uncertainty and anxiety. The focus has shifted from the contents of the two directives to the possibility of misinterpretation, deliberate or otherwise, by member states clinging to cherished protectionist ways. The main concerns of the International Primary Market Association (IPMA) are that artificial and inappropriate obstacles could be erected that would reduce the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of the 'immensely successful' markets. It is vital, it says, that institutions are not artificially put at a cost disadvantage to competitors in other markets. On the other hand, the increasing scale of government borrowing means it is obviously in the interests of European governments to be able to raise funds locally on competitive terms. Success in winning mandates from outside the European time zone also makes the markets an important source of foreign earnings for Europe. 'European regulators understand that this is a market which lives by competition, and that it is of vital strategic importance to the European economy,' says Mr Dirk Hazell, secretary-general of IPMA. Other concerns are that regulators will be unable to resist the temptation to impose regulations over and above the CAD/ISD requirements. 'Regulators' objectives, one of which must be to permit the markets to work efficiently, are more likely to be achieved if regulators work with the grain of the market and having consulted leading practitioners, than if rules are suddenly imposed from an ivory tower; in this case their practical application may well prove uncertain,' says Mr Hazell. Deliberate misinterpretation is thought unlikely, if politicians have learned anything, that is, from the ERM experience. 'Market forces cannot be resisted indefinitely,' says Mr John Langton, chief executive of the International Secondary Market Association (ISMA). 'Markets smell unsustainable financial policies pretty quickly.' Mr Christopher Cruickshank, principal administrator at the European Commission's DGXV, the directorate-general responsible for internal market and financial services, puts less emphasis on the possibility of misinterpretation. 'We would like to organise continuing discussions aimed at ensuring harmonised implementation,' he says. National supervisors, for their part, will be watching each other like hawks.</p>

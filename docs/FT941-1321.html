			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expanded Malaya cuts losses to Pounds 378,000 Malaya Group, the fast expanding USM-quoted motor retailer, reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 378,000 for 1993, down from Pounds 982,000. During the first full year of a planned expansion in the London and the home counties, the group grew from two franchises at the start of 1993 to 10 by the end of the year, with eight new and used car outlets. The group has also been appointed the concessionaire for Bugatti in the UK. The board said the restructuring and development, initiated by its new management in the latter part of 1992, 'progressed wholly in line' with its expectations. Reflecting the expansion, turnover increased sharply to Pounds 49.7m (Pounds 8.35m), including Pounds 38.5m from acquisitions. At the operating level losses fell from Pounds 692,000 to Pounds 331,000. The reduced pre-tax loss was struck after a Pounds 43,000 profit on a property disposal and reduced net interest costs of Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 290,000). Losses per share were cut to 0.54p (4.93p). In view of the loss, which the company said was in line with expectations, no dividend is recommended. In June Malaya raised Pounds 9.7m net of expenses through a placing and open offer. The group said the remaining planned acquisitions in London and the home counties would be funded from existing resources. It added that it had experienced improved trading conditions since the start of 1994 and 'looks forward to a return to profitable trading.'</p>

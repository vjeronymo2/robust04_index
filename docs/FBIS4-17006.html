			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- The Russian Government  defined as the main goal of its social policy for 1994  "stabilisation of living standards of Russian people with their  subsequent improvement as the economy develops". This goal was  formulated in the social policy guidelines of the Russian  Government for 1994, a document which was adopted by the  Presidium of the Russian Government at its meeting on Thursday.    The document stresses that "The Russian Government is guided  by the premise that a fruitful and balanced social policy is a  necessary condition to continue reforms, to consolidate their  social basis and to improve the social and political situation  in the country".    The main directions of the social policy for 1994 provide  for  creating economic and legal conditions which will stimulate the  able-bodied part of society to ensure its well-being with highly  productive labour. They also provide for supporting optimum  correlation between the incomes of the able-bodied part of  population and disabled citizens, for ensuring the main social  guarantees and for preventing mass unemployment.    To realise these aims in 1994, the government plans to  concentrate on preventing a drop in real cash incomes of  population, ensuring a weighted balance of economic interests  and material possibilities of hired labour, businessmen and  disabled citizens as well as reforming the public health and  public education systems, culture and housing. The government  will also concentrate on creating new jobs for population and  stepping up work to retrain labour.</p>

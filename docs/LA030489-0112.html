			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A table accompanying a story on minority contracting at Southern California  utilities contained 1987 and 1988 spending figures that were in error. The  numbers shown should have been expressed "in thousands." For example, 1987  spending on white-male owned firms would be $4,040,136,000, not $4,040,136 as  shown.  </P></p>

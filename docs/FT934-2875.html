			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Labour wins first battle in MPs' war of attrition Labour yesterday won the first skirmish in the war of attrition it has declared against the government - though the general who had sounded the battle cry late on Thursday night, Mr John Smith, was away in Ulster and missed the action. Leftwing hardliners succeeded in halting a Commons debate on a Tory motion on business and industry, giving a measure proposed by Mr Ken Livingstone, the hard-left MP for London's Brent East, some unexpected debating time. This small but morale-boosting victory came only 12 hours after the party announced it was breaking off all relations with the government. The move was in protest at government plans to curtail debate on bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National Insurance contributions. Under Labour's protest even non-contentious legislation is being obstructed and the practice of 'pairing' will end. Pairing permits MPs to miss a vote by being linked to a member in an opposing party who agrees to be absent as well. The system is often used late at night and on relatively uncontentious issues. It means in practice that hard-pressed government ministers and MPs in distant constituencies can get away with less time in Westminster than would otherwise be needed. Government business managers believe the cushion provided by the government's 17-strong overall majority means that Labour's gesture will be an inconvenience rather than a serious problem. Senior government ministers will almost certainly not have to be bundled out of important international meetings and into Concorde to register a vote on relatively humdrum matters. Managers believe there will be little effect on next week's proceedings  - which include the two guillotined bills - since much of it is subject to a three-line whip, meaning that pairing would not be permitted. MPs are in any case due to depart at the end of next week for their Christmas recess, returning on January 11. While Labour's declaration of war is not time-limited, government business managers think hostilities are unlikely to be extended far into the new year  -not least because the new situation will also inconvenience Labour. One Scottish Labour MP said last night that the additional hours in Westminster would not enable him to cut his constituency workload but would mean he would be more 'worn out' than usual when he undertook it. Another Labour MP said the decision to sever relations was 'a pain in the backside'.</p>

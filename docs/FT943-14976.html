			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: British Land Such is the overblown reputation of Mr George Soros that when his Quantum funds sell down their stakes in British Land and Berkeley Group then half the market seems to run around trying to read the runes. Whether it is significant that Quantum is exchanging British Land paper for a greater exposure to direct property at this point in the cycle is a moot point. On the face of it, Quantum's approach contrasts with that of other investors, such as PosTel, which have been busy swapping properties for shares. But that difference may owe more to both parties' respective portfolio needs than any striking divergence in investment strategy. Quantum's move may simply reflect the fact that it can sell its British Land shares for 35 per cent more than it bought them a year ago. British Land's shares are unlikely to match that performance over the coming year. After the mini-bounce of the past few weeks, property shares have narrowed their discount to net asset values. Yet growth in rental income is proving hard to achieve. There must also be some uncertainty about what the financial implications of British Land's longing for Broadgate Properties will turn out to be.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dhaka, June 21 (AFP) -- A bomb attack early Tuesday  [21 June] at the home of a Bangladeshi magazine editor was the  latest strike in a campaign by Muslim fundamentalists, media  sources said. Three powerful homemade bombs exploded at the  gate of the Dhaka home of Shafik Rehman, editor of the popular  Bengali language weekly JAI JAI DIN, or PASSING DAYS. No one  was hurt in the blast.    Rehman faces a blasphemy charge for publishing a column by  fugitive feminist doctor-turned-writer Taslima Nasreen, in  hiding since religious charges were laid against her, and death  threats made, for criticisms of the Koran.    Rehman told AFP in a telephone interview Tuesday that he  felt  insecure and held the fundamentalist Jagrata Towhidi Janata, or  Rising Faithfuls, responsible because the group had threatened  in a letter to take "appropriate steps" unless his magazine  stopped publishing Nasreen's column.    "These groups are making non-issues an issue because our  writings are hurting their bread and butter," he said.    Nasreen's regular column stopped appearing soon after she  went into hiding early this month, and Rehman said he would not  publish them if the opportunity arose because it would be  "illegal now."    Police are still searching for Nasreen, 32, who faces  charges  of offending Muslim religious sentiment in an interview with an  Indian newspaper. Nasreen denies suggesting rewriting the  Koran, the holy book of Islam.    Rehman said the attack was triggered by a report in the  pro-Islamic Daily INQILAB newspaper that a warrant for his  arrest for blasphemy was issued Sunday was the reason for the  attack. The court ordered his arrest after he failed to answer  several summons and set a hearing for July 17, the Inqilab said.  Government officials were not available for comment because of  a national holiday.    Local resident Hafiz Abdul Alim charged that Rehman insulted  religious feeling by comparing two Arabic letters to human  genitals in his column Day after Day in November 1993. Rehman  refuted the allegation, saying that the two letters were not  only used in Urdu and Persian languages, but he used them in a  joke about international politics without refering to Islam,  religion or the Koran.    JAI JAI DIN was banned by former president Hussain Muhammad  Ershad's government and Rehman returned from self-exile in  London after the dictatorial regime's fall in December, 1990.    In recent weeks, fundamentalists have attacked other  newspapers critical of them. Editors have warned Prime Minister  Khaleda Zia about rising fundamentalism in the predominantly  Moslem country. Three editors of the mass circulation Bengali  daily JANAKANTHA newspaper were arrested recently for alleged  blasphemy. Two were released on bail. Journalist union  officials said 24 newspapers have been attacked in the past  three years.    Rehman said he held a "a section of the government"  responsible for the rise in fundamentalism because it had not  taken any action against the issuers of the death threats on  Nasreen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The newspaper LAO DONG on 28 April reported that  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working session with the  chairman of the Song Be Provincial People's Committee regarding  the illicit import of 273 cars.    After hearing leading comrades of the Song Be Provincial  People's Committee criticize themselves for the wrongdoings they  committed in legitimizing and allowing the operation of 273  illicitly imported cars -- the responsibility for which rests  chiefly with the chairman of the provincial people's committee  and his deputies who were directly in charge of this case -- the  prime minister asked the chairman of the Song Be Provincial  People's Committee to scrupulously carry out self-criticism,  report the results to the provincial party standing committee,  and propose the form and extent of disciplinary actions to be  taken against the provincial people's committee collectively.    As for the chairman and the two vice chairmen of the  provincial people's committee directly involved in this case,  they must scrupulously review their wrongdoings, propose the  extent of disciplinary actions to be taken against themselves,  for instance, resigning from their present positions so other  comrades can replace them. This must be carried out in such a  way as to ensure scrupulous law enforcement.    Those state organs such as tax, security police, customs,  and  trade organs in Song Be that failed to take preventive measures  against this wrongdoing and to report it to higher management  organs and that are found to be involved in the wrongdoings must  also ascertain their specific responsibilities so appropriate  disciplinary actions can be taken against them.</p>

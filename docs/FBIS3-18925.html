President Havel made  this comment at a press conference, adding that conditions for  membership have become more stringent following the Community's  "metamorphosis" into a Union. "We cannot apply for membership  tomorrow or the next day.... We are waiting to be ripe," he  added. Mr. Havel did not express a view on the advisability of  "partial" membership (to the second and third pillars, for  example) but underscored his country's will to participate in  political dialogue with the EU.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Rebels force Greek government to quit THE Greek government was forced to resign yesterday after losing its one-seat parliamentary majority through the defection of a little-known conservative backbencher. A general election will be held on October 10, seven months before the conservatives' four-year mandate was due to end. Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, announcing his cabinet's resignation, accused his political opponents of sabotaging the government's efforts to implement economic reform. 'Greece cannot make progress in an atmosphere where the government's work is being constantly undermined,' he said. Mr Mitsotakis has faced as much criticism in recent months from within his New Democracy party as from the socialist opposition, with dissent focusing on the government's plans for partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms company. However, it was not until this week that Political Spring, a new conservative splinter group, launched a co-ordinated campaign to bring down the government. Its leader, Mr Antonis Samaras, who was sacked as foreign minister by Mr Mitsotakis last year for his unwillingness to compromise on recognition for Macedonia, appealed to his half-dozen supporters among New Democracy deputies to leave the party. It looked until yesterday as if the government might survive, as only one deputy, Mr Stefanos Stefanopoulos, a close ally of Mr Samaras, had declared he would sit as an independent. Then came the unexpected departure of Mr George Symbilidis, leaving New Democracy with only 150 seats in the 300-member chamber. Mr Mitsotakis, who has little personal following among the Greek people, cannot have much hope of being returned to power as head of a government. The government's approval rating has plummeted in the past year as recession deepened and the effects of structural reform, including wage-capping and reductions in public sector hiring, started to be felt. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement is already well ahead in the opinion polls, despite persistent doubts that its ailing leader, Mr Andreas Papandreou, would be strong enough to carry out the prime minister's duties. Pasok officials have been trying to reassure businessmen and diplomats that the party has set aside the radical policies of the 1980s, asserting its commitment to European economic union. Nonetheless, the prospect of a change in government sent shock waves through the Athens stock market, where the index dropped by 6.8 per cent yesterday. Victory for the socialists next month would certainly create problems for the economy, at least in the short term. Pasok says it is determined to abandon the conservatives' privatisation programme, which was expected to yield more than Dr300bn (Pounds 857m) in revenues this year from the sale of 49 per cent of OTE, together with two state-owned oil refineries. With tax receipts lagging far behind the budget forecast the loss of privatisation income would cause a substantial shortfall in government revenues. Public debt amounts to more than 120 per cent of gross domestic product and a socialist government would face serious difficulties in financing a higher deficit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] The announcement that the Search Bloc has arrived in  Valle del Cauca has upset Tulua Mayor Gustavo Alvarez who said  nobody requested permission from him to house the Search Bloc  members in that city's police academy.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mayor Alvarez,  what  have you learned about the presence of the Search Bloc here in  Tulua?    [Alvarez] I have no official information on that. Neither  the national government authorities nor the police authorities  have notified me that the Search Bloc members will be housed in  the Simon Bolivar Academy. However, I heard that report in a  Voice of America broadcast and I read it on the front page of  today's edition of OCCIDENTE.    [Reporter] What does the Search Bloc's arrival represent for  the residents of Tulua?    [Alvarez] As city mayor, I will accept it. However, as a  resident of Valle del Cauca, I am truly sorry. I have said that  the Search Bloc in Valle del Cauca is following the orders of  the U.S. ambassador and State Department officials. Just two  days after Pablo Escobar was killed, they said that a war had to  be waged in Valle del Cauca. I think Valle del Cauca does not  need a war, and I think it can follow the law through reasonable  means, through a dialogue, and seek solutions so that there will  be no war here.

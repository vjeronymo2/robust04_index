			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Gestetner in the red after provisions GESTETNER HOLDINGS, the office and photographic equipment distributor, yesterday gave details of an extensive restructuring of its European businesses. The group also confirmed that it had taken a Pounds 48.3m provision partly to cover the restructuring, which was flagged in May when Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, took a 15 per cent stake. The effect of all the provisions was to produce a pre-tax loss of Pounds 45.4m in the six months to April 30, compared with a profit of Pounds 7.8m, restated in accordance with FRS 3. Gestetner's sales rose from Pounds 440m to Pounds 498m. In constant sterling terms, the increase was 2 per cent, from Pounds 490m. Mr Greg Melgaard, Gestetner's new managing director, said the group's workforce had been cut by 1,000 over the last two years to about 10,500, and a similar number of jobs would go over the next 18 months. Mr Melgaard said most attention would focus on the businesses in France and Spain, where a high cost base had been exposed by the impact of recession. In the UK, the group is also to stop manufacturing offset printing equipment and cut its base capacity for manufacturing stencil duplicators from the current level of 20,000 to about 10,000, although it will be able to make as many as 15,000 to fulfil specific orders. The group said trading conditions in both office automation and photographic markets continued to be difficult. Turnover in office automation increased by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 410m, in constant currency. Trading profit fell from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 14.5m. There was a decline in overall gross margins, of which about half was expected due to reduced sales of high-margin products. The rest was because of recessionary pressures in its main European markets. Turnover from photographic products was 5 per cent down at Pounds 84.4m. However, improved margins and a low expense base allowed trading profits to increase from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.8m. The photographic supplies business had sales of Pounds 48m and trading profits of Pounds 2.2m. Although the conditional contract to sell Gestetner's Vivitar and Hanimex camera distribution businesses lapsed in January, the group said discussion were taking place with another party. In spite of losses per share of 22.2p, compared with earnings of 3.6p last time, the interim dividend is held at 1.8p.</p>

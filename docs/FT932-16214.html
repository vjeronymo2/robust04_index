			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Machine tool group urges investment help THE machine tool industry is urging the government to make it easier for small and medium-sized customers to invest in new manufacturing equipment. Leaders of the Machine Tool Technologies Association want the government to introduce permanent 100 per cent capital allowances for small and medium-sized enterprises and some form of cheaper finance to give such enterprises more confidence in investing. Along with many organisations representing manufacturing industry, the association was disappointed by the chancellor's stance on capital allowances in the Budget. It had argued in vain for the temporary 40 per cent allowances introduced in the Autumn Statement to be extended and increased. The association believes capital allowance improvements and financing help - such as fixed-rate finance for five or 10 years - should be focused on small and medium-sized enterprises because larger companies generally have less difficulty getting funding and are better able to make long-term investment plans. The industry's plea comes as figures this week showed that the UK machine tool market contracted by a further 7 per cent last year to an estimated Pounds 675m. This compares with Pounds 1.02bn in the peak year of 1989. Exports fell 20 per cent to Pounds 329.3m last year, and imports fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 411.5m, widening the industry's trade deficit to Pounds 82m from Pounds 40m in 1991. The latest import figures, however, include between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m of special production equipment for Japanese-owned car plants. According to estimates by the association, employment in the industry last year averaged 14,600 compared with 18,300 in 1991. However, in spite of the contraction of the industry, the UK is still the seventh largest exporter of machine tools. Moss Machine Tools, the Leicester-based company whose high-precision machines are used extensively in the automotive industry, has been placed in administrative receivership. Mr Nick Dargan and Mr John Wilson of Touche Ross have been named administrative receivers. The receivership comes two months after a deal switching manufacturing of Moss machine tools, along with some production equipment, to the Derby-based company Thomas Ryder and Sons.</p>

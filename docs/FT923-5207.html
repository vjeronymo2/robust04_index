			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (5): Complex but real - David White on the consequences of the peace THE PEACE dividend, that overworked cliche, has somehow lost its optimistic connotations. The expression first gained currency in the US at the close of the Vietnam war, when hopes were raised that money previously poured into the conflict could be redirected into new social programmes. In the aftermath of the Cold War, it has come to be usedironically by the sectors that have suffered the negative effects of defence cutbacks. Nobody seems conscious of having received a peace dividend. But it is certainly being paid. General John Galvin, the recently-retired supreme Nato commander in Europe, reckons it will add up to more than Dollars 500bn by 1997 - the value of what the 16 Nato allies will have refrained from buying or saved on their military forces. Worldwide, defence expenditure fell last year for the third year running, according to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Some industrialists, including Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aersopace's defence division, foresee an end to the decline in the mid-1990s, and an increase after that. But even if the outlook for arms manufacturers is not totally gloomy, things are likely to get worse before they get better. Defence spending is like an ocean liner when it come to slowing it down. Sharp revisions of government spending plans have become the norm throughout the industrialised world, including countries such as France which have been relatively conservative about their defence outlays. In the US, the Dollars 281bn requested by the Pentagon for the fiscal year beginning in October would be a 4.5 per cent drop in real terms. Plans up to 1997 have been revised downwards by Dollars 50bn. This has involved halting 10 major equipment programmes including the B-2 stealth bomber, of which only 20 are now due to be built, the Seawolf nuclear-powered submarine, which is being stopped at one boat instead of the original plan for 36, and the Comanche scout helicopter, which is to remain at the prototype stage. US spending plans, which still provide for a slight annual increase in current dollars from the 1994 fiscal year onwards, will continue to come under heavy pressure. The UK has so far managed its Options for Change review without major cancellations but faces a continuing squeeze on defence resources. After a 10 per cent decline in real-terms spending in the second half of the 1980s, current plans are for a further gradual drop over the next three years. A report published just before the April general election by the London-based Centre for Defence Studies estimated that real defence expenditure, on current trends, would be 20 per cent lower by the year 2000 than it was in 1990 - a level of about Pounds 17bn a year at today's prices. Even with the modest reductions envisaged, the future of some ongoing programmes might have to be reviewed, it said. Any deeper cuts in the budget 'could demand a major reappraisal of equipment needs'. Increasingly dependent on exports to offset reductions in their home markets, US and European manufacturers find themselves in head-on collision in the growth markets of the Middle East and Asia. In antithesis to the industrialised west, the Asia-Pacific region has become the prime area of growth in arms expenditure, but suppliers face increasing competition from Asian countries themselves, including South Korea and Japan. Elsewhere in the developing world, export prospects are overshadowed by financial problems, limited requirements for high-technology equipment, inroads by suppliers such as China and Brazil, and the large amount of second-hand Russian and other weapons on offer. Figures from SIPRI show a 25 per cent drop last year in the global value of trade in major conventional weapons, to Dollars 22bn. Significantly, US exporters took 51 per cent of the total. Four years previously the US share had been 30 per cent. The competition for developing-world markets appears unlikely to be greatly affected by the initiatives undertaken in the wake of last year's Gulf conflict to discuss restraints on arms sales, particularly to the Middle East. The US, Russia, Britain, France and China, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, which have held a series of talks on possible curbs, are also the countries which control four-fifths of the market. A global UN register of transactions, initially proposed by Britain, is due to start next year, but there is little sign of willingness among any of the main exporting nations to forego sales vital for sustaining their defence industries. Within Europe, the market in the larger countries remains largely divided along national lines, with the consequences of wide-scale duplication and inefficiency. Progress towards opening up trade in arms in line with other industries has been slow. The Independent European Programme Group (IEPG), made up of European Nato allies, has succeeded in increasing the opportunities for companies to bid for contracts in other European countries. Further moves will have to await the outcome of the ratification process of the Maastricht treaty, which places Community defence responsibilities in the hands of the Western European Union. Problems then needing to be resolved include the status of Turkey and Norway, which are in the IEPG but not the EC or WEU. Proposals such as a joint European procurement agency, favoured by Germany and Holland, still appear remote. Takeovers have increased the concentration of Europe's arms industry, which is in the throes of drastic workforce reductions. But despite much talk about the potential for multinational industrial groupings in Europe, the only truly cross-border ventures to have got off the ground are Matra Marconi Space, which has brought together the bulk of the space activities of France's Matra and the British GEC group, and Eurocopter, the helicopter company formed by Aerospatiale of France and MBB of Germany. In the cost-cutting climate, multilateral collaboration on specific projects has come under strain - the European Fighter Aircraft being only one, albeit spectacular, example. A series of tentative links has been made between European companies, however, for new-generation equipment ranging from vehicles to air combat radars. The sharp change in defence structures and priorities - the thinning-out of forces in continental Europe, the new emphasis on mobility and flexibility, the needs of peacekeeping missions and arms control enforcement - undoubtedly creates new equipment requirements which will go some way towards compensating for the business defence contractors have lost. But governments are in no hurry.</p>

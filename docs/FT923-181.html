			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Italy's big parties lose ground in local polls THE accelerating erosion of electoral support for Italy's traditional political parties has been highlighted by local election results in northern Italy. The elections on Sunday, of which the most important were in the city of Mantua and the surrounding region, were a triumph for the populist Lombard League, headed by Mr Umberto Bossi. The League got almost 34 per cent of the vote, an increase of 11 percentage points since the April general elections. Against this, both the Christian Democrats and Socialists saw their vote drop by more than one-third. These two parties plus the Social Democrats and Liberals making up the current coalition government could muster only 23 per cent.</p>

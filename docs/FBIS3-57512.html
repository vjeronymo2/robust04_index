			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Natalya Chernyshova on interview </F> with former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov and news conference  given by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow on 26  January, including recordings of Fedorov and Chernomyrdin  remarks -- from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Chernyshova] From being a headache of the national  economy, Russia's agro-industrial complex turned into a  political headache late in January. In any case, one of the  reasons Boris Fedorov cited in explaining his reluctance to stay  as finance minister was linked with subsidies for agriculture  and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha keeping his post.    [Fedorov] Why is our grain more expensive than in the world  market? Who has run up grain-related debts? It is Mr.  Zaveryukha, the government, and so on by fixing too high a  price. They knew perfectly well that the budget did not have  this money. But for me, what is not in the budget does not  exist.    [Chernyshova] In addition, Boris Fedorov believes that he  cannot stay in his post if, instead of the 80 percent inflation  at the end of the year which he promised, 300 [percent] is  offered today, while the issuing of 10 trillion rubles planned  by the Finance Ministry for the first quarter is being replaced  with 15 trillion by the prime minister.    [Fedorov] In any state, the finance minister is someone  responsible for economic policy. When a situation takes shape  that turns him into a cashier paying out money, I do not accept  such a situation.    [Chernyshova] The former deputy prime minister cited all  these arguments at the morning meeting with the president in the  Kremlin, but found no understanding.    [Fedorov] He tried to persuade me, nevertheless, that there  was no tragedy today, generally speaking, and that it was  possible to go on working. I for one did not agree with this  point.    [Chernyshova, addressing Fedorov] Why has not your  resignation been accepted for such a long time?    [Fedorov] Neither the prime minister nor the president have  ever complained to me about my performance. Many people are  saying that there is a tendency to use individual reformers as a  screen, a cover for changing the policy.    [Chernyshova] So Fedorov has been removed from work at his  own request, removed or departied at a time difficult for the  country. Some observers view the former minister's step as a  position of principle, others as an escape from real  difficulties. Many people, however, see this as a political  [chess] castling and predict that both he and Gaydar will return  but to an already new government.    The prime minister has invested our agriculture with  political importance, too. He has just made a trip to Orel  Oblast where he met with representatives of 18 central Russian  oblasts which produce almost one-third of all agrarian output.  They agreed on drafting a federal program for central Russia's  revival which would require about 30 billion rubles. Also while  there Viktor Chernomyrdin made a statement on an intent to  return 4 trillion in the first quarter to pay back debts to the  defense industry and the agrarian complex, something which, on  the whole, showed the government's new tendencies. The prime  minister stressed that this money should not be used for the  needs of consumption, but who will be able to control this? At  today's news conference which, in fact, was devoted to Viktor  Chernomyrdin's visit to Italy, something transpired about  domestic matters, too.    [Chernomyrdin] I am rather stingy and do not like to give  out  or pay back, therefore, if we are to go ahead with that, we will  do this the way you mentioned. And the debts -- this relates  especially to debts -- and the credits which should be given  because credits should be used and enterprises will use credits  -- today we demanded that a mechanism be developed. This  relates to the military-industrial complex, defense enterprises,  and the agrarian complex. We want clarifications to be tabled  on how this money is going to be used and where it will go.    [Chernyshova] The prime minister laughed, or only pretended  to laugh when asked about the agrarian deputy prime minister's  request for 40 trillion rubles to support the efficiency of  agriculture.    [Chernomyrdin] As regards Zaveryukha's statement, he said  that it was meant by the year 2050, that was how he explained it  yesterday. As regards claims that he asks for these 40 trillion  immediately now, it is simply someone's wish to turn Zaveryukha  into a scapegoat, someone would just love this. They heard one  figure but do not care about what followed.    [Chernyshova] In the main the conversation with journalists  followed the usual pattern. Viktor Chernomyrdin promised that  this month inflation would be 22 percent; he categorically  rejected conjectures about alterations to the reform policy and,  for Italian journalists, spoke about Italian plans. We will  have enough time to describe them to you when it starts.</p>

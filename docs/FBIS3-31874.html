			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonel Bill Aikman, representative of the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], stated today that the UN convoys  had come under attack three times yesterday, once near Visoko  and twice near Gornji Vakuf. He accused the HVO [Croatian  Defense Council] of attacking convoys near Gornji Vakuf. On  both occasions British troops escorting the convoys returned  fire on the HVO positions, silencing the attackers. No  casualties or serious damage was inflicted on the convoys.    The UN soldiers could not say with certainty who attacked  the  convoy on the Kiseljak-Visoko road, so they did not return fire,  Colonel Aikman said.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Eurotherm Strong second-half sales growth helped Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, report a 30 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits. On turnover up by 6.1 per cent to Pounds 168m (Pounds 158.4m) profits increased from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 26.1m in the year to October 31, highlighting the group's strong operational gearing. Turnover grew by 11 per cent in the second half offsetting a sluggish 1.9 per cent increase in the first six months and re-establishing Eurotherm on a solid growth track. Mr Claes Hultman, chief executive, said: 'Early signs for the current financial year are that this growth is continuing.' Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent from 15.1p to 19.4p and a final dividend of 3.5p is recommended, making a total for the year up 16 per cent at 5.5p (4.75p). The shares closed unchanged at 400p. All divisions achieved higher sales helped by new product launches. However, the strongest advance came in the drives division where sales rose by 16.7 per cent. Internationally the biggest sales increases were in the UK and North America. However, Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, noted that, 'as the year progressed, there has been a growing recovery in the rest of Europe with Sweden and Benelux performing exceptionally well'. Tight cost control helped maintain gross profit margins at 50.3 per cent while administrative expenses fell slightly and operating profits increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 20.1m). Pre-tax profits were boosted by Pounds 500,000 of net interest income reflecting the group's strengthening net cash balances which increased by Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 21.6m over the year. COMMENT Despite the lacklustre market response Eurotherm's latest results will go some way to silencing critics who, while acknowledging management's success over the past four years in restoring profitability and strengthening the balance sheet, have been looking for evidence of organic sales growth. The management is confident that it can keep turnover moving ahead by between 10 and 15 per cent a year, helped by the group's investment in new product development including a new line of temperature controllers. On this basis pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 31m this year producing earnings of 23p. Despite this the shares are trading on a sizeable 38 per cent premium to the market, and the upside potential therefore looks somewhat limited.</p>

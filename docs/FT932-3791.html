			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Court ban fails to halt Nigerian poll NIGERIA'S presidential election will go ahead today as planned in spite of a court ruling ordering a postponement, the National Electoral Commission (NEC) said yesterday. The government, meanwhile, called on the US to pull out one of its diplomats within 72 hours, accusing him of 'blatant interference'. The diplomat is spokesman for the US embassy in Lagos, which declared earlier yesterday that postponement of the election would cause 'grave concern' to the US. In a day of high political drama, NEC chairman Humphrey Nwosu said in Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital: 'For the avoidance of any doubt I wish to restate that the presidential election scheduled for tomorrow. . . will go on as planned.' His announcement appeared to put Nigeria's programme for the return of civilian rule back on track. Nigerians had waited anxiously for the reply by the NEC, a creation of the country's military rulers, to the Abuja high court, which had ordered the poll be put off. The court ruled on Thursday that the first presidential poll since 1983 should wait until the full hearing of a petition by a group wanting army president, Mr Ibrahim Babangida, to stay in power until 1997. But the NEC chairman said the court order was overruled by provisions of a military decree issued this year which said no court had the power to stop an election. Mr Nwosu said the decree was 'a deliberate legislation on the part of this administration to protect the higher interests of the majority of Nigerians in the implementation of the political transition programme'. The last-minute hitch raised doubts over whether Mr Babangida intends to hand over to civilian rule on August 27. Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti of the Campaign for Democracy said: 'We still do not believe that Babangida wants to go. He is making the simple process of handover the most complicated thing in the world.' The case was brought to court by the Association for Better Nigeria, which is campaigning for a four-year extension of military rule, and alleges malpractice by the political parties in the run-up to the elections. The association is led by businessman and former presidential candidate Mr Arthur Nzeribe, who has close links with the presidency. Although the government has made no attempt to stop the association's operations, political meetings by groups opposed to continued military rule have frequently been broken up by the security forces. Voting in today's election is expected to follow tribal and regional loyalties. The National Republican Convention (NRC) candidate, Mr Bashir Tofa, is a Moslem from the north, where the party has traditional support among the Hausa-Fulani and other mainly Moslem groups. The choice of Mr Sylvester Ugoh, who was a central bank governor of the former breakaway Biafran state, as his running mate has also bolstered his support in the mainly Christian south-east. Mr Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the Social Democratic party, has the backing of his fellow Yoruba in the south-west and his party is strong in the north-east. Britain and other EC member states have sent diplomats, MPs and officials to most of Nigeria's 30 states to observe the elections. All political rallies have been banned until 4pm today, while the open ballot system, which was vulnerable to vote rigging in previous presidential campaigns, has been modified.</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING/ FINANCE  </P> <P> Hands-On Help: More people in Orange County try to start new ventures than  entrepreneurs anywhere else, says Tiffany A. Haugen at UC Irvine's Graduate  School of Management.  </P> <P> Part of the reason is that venture capital firms and other professionals have  flocked to the county and helped to build a foundation that finances and  supports entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> But UCI has found that more is needed, and Haugen has come up with a program  called Accelerate. The educational program provides hands-on help to new  business executives who are trying to develop plans, finance their operations  and expand from a start-up shop to companies with $50 million in sales.  </P></p>

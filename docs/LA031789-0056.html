			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD CORNER: BOWIE'S LPS RETURN ON RYKODISC  </P> <P> The CD wait will soon be over for David Bowie fans.  </P> <P> While copies of the English rock star's recent EMI albums, including the  best-selling "Let's Dance," are plentiful on CD shelves, his more celebrated  RCA material has been unavailable for more than three years.  </P> <P> Rykodisc -- the independent label that started out as a CD-only firm, but now  also releases product in vinyl and cassette -- has obtained the North American  rights to those 18 RCA albums released between 1969 and 1983.  </P> <P> The titles include such acclaimed works as "Hunky Dory," "Ziggy Stardust,"  "Aladdin Sane" and "Low" -- as well as two greatest-hits packages.  </P> <P> While some of the albums were released on CD in 1984 by RCA, they had largely  disappeared from stores by the end of 1985 because the rights reverted to Bowie  and RCA could no longer fill re-order requests.  </P> <P> Don Rose, president of Ryko, said he believes Bowie chose Ryko over larger  labels because of the aggressive way the company has marketed more than a dozen  Frank Zappa albums and two Jimi Hendrix collections. No financial details were  announced.  </P> <P> The acquisition is a coup for Ryko because of the large demand for the Bowie  LPs. In a Billboard magazine survey last fall, record retailers indicated there  was more consumer demand for Bowie's greatest hits package, "Changesonebowie,"  than any other album not available on CD. The "Ziggy Stardust" album finished  second in the poll.  </P> <P> Carrie Anne Svingen, a spokeswoman for Ryko, said this week that wherever  possible the Bowie CDs will contain additional tracks -- either previously  unreleased material or non-LP singles from the same period.  </P> <P> No decision has been made yet on the order in which the albums will be  released, but they are expected to be released at the rate of one or two a  month, with the first arriving in stores in the fall, Svingen said.  </P> <P> Other albums that CD fans would most like to see available in CD, according to  the Billboard survey: Queen's "Greatest Hits" (available now only in an import  CD), the Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds" (after many delays, Capitol is now planning a  summer release) and Peter Gabriel's first solo album (now available in a budget  package from Atlantic).  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Selection of Test Methods and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the EPA does not yet have a published reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for analyzing for the amount of VOHAP in a coating,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the measure of total VOC is to be used as a surrogate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 24 is the Agency's reference method for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total volatile organic content (the total amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOHAP and other volatile organics). The proposed rule would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use the VOC content of as-applied coatings to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the VOHAP content limits (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section VII.B.1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most, if not all, major shipbuilding facilities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed to be located in ozone nonattainment areas. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are likely to be required to meet State VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations requiring BACM. As explained earlier in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, the EPA's draft recommended BACM for the draft CTG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains VOC limits equivalent to the VOHAP limits being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. Thus, using Method 24 to measure compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both the VOC and HAP rules (i.e., one test to satisfy two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns) should be the least burdensome route of any source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having to meet VOC rules in addition to HAP rules. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in case there are any sources which are not required to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC rules and have a desire to determine compliance through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring VOHAP instead of VOC, an approach as outlined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option 5 is being proposed. (Comments are requested.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would require that affected sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use forms and procedures comparable to those in the EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Procedures for Certifying Quantity of Volatile Organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compounds Emitted by Paint, Ink and Other Coatings,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Revised June 1986) EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;84&hyph;019 for all certifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed for compliance demonstrations. Consistent use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these forms and procedures will provide uniform and complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records that will allow determination of ``continuous''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures other than test methods would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate compliance with the handling, transfer, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage standard. Each source is required to submit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation plan that will include specific procedures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Selection of Notification, Recordkeeping, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Notification Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would require affected sources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit an initial notification and subsequent quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifications of compliance status. Exceedances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (violations) should be reported on a quarterly basis. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification requirements in &sect;&sect;63.9 (a)&hyph;(d) and (h)&hyph;(j) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart A would apply to all affected sources in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source category-specific requirements in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Sections 63.9 (e)&hyph;(g) of subpart A would not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless an affected source installs an add-on control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 63.9(b) of subpart A contains the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification requirements. The initial notification would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alert the Administrator of: (1) The applicability for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing facilities or of construction for new facilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) how the source plans to comply with the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, and (3) if any delays in compliance are expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notification would be due no later than 120 calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after the effective date of the rule for existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources; for new or reconstructed sources, the due date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be within 120 days after initial startup if approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of construction or reconstruction is not required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;63.5(d) of subpart A. In addition to the items listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;63.9(b) of subpart A, sources would be required to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the initial notification: (1) The compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure(s) that they intend to use for the coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation standards; (2) procedures for ensuring compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the handling, transfer, and storage standard; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) procedures for maintaining records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 63.9(h) of subpart A contains the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for notification of compliance status. These would notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator of whether compliance has been achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the past 3 months. These notifications would be due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the 60th day following completion of each 3-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. If there are no violations within the first year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliant sources may request permission from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator to go to 6-month notifications. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records would be compiled on a monthly basis, 60 days should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide sufficient time to prepare these notifications. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the items listed in &sect;63.9(h) of subpart A,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected sources would be required to include in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifications all other records that the source is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to maintain and compile on a monthly basis according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

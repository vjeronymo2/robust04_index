Supporting this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: This is a  very timely and just patriotic initiative in view of the desire  of the fellow countrymen for reunification and the domestic and  foreign situation.    The Central Committee of the North side headquarters of  Pomminnyon highly estimated the initiative as a good proposal,  expressed full support to it and warmly welcomed it.    The reunification question of Korea is a question of  terminating the domination and interference of outside forces  and fully realizing the sovereignty of the Korean nation and  achieving national unity; it is a nationwide cause which the 70  million fellow countrymen at home and abroad should accomplish,  united as one under the banner of the great unity of the whole  nation.    Great national unity is the basic idea of Pomminnyon and  reunification in the 90s is its noble duty to the nation.    The Pomminnyon organisations at home and abroad should  jointly and energetically organize and conduct the patriotic  movement for reunification to achieve great national unity by  availing themselves of all possibilities and occasions and thus  brilliantly adorn this significant year as a "Year of Great  National Unity".    All the compatriots at home and abroad should frustrate the  anti-national, anti-reunification reactionary offensive of the  Kim Yong-sam group under the "civilian" veil and actively  promote the great national unity in this course.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Honest man striving to sell off the state: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections Deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais, a leading candidate for Russia's Choice, has been architect of the world's most ambitious privatisation programme, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. His conservative opponents claim his sell-off - which has already put about half of Russian industrial capacity into private hands - will be remembered as one of the world's biggest flops. However, the 38-year-old economist from St Petersburg has brushed off the criticism, saying 'it means I've been doing the right thing'. Even the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, who once compared his privatisation to Stalin's collectivisation, has had to give in to the irreversible process set in train by the distribution of privatisation vouchers to Russia's citizen. And while other reformist ministers, including Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's Choice, have come and gone, wavered and compromised, Mr Chubais has kept both his job and his principles since the launch of radical reform in January 1992. His reserved manner and boyish charm conceals a formidable and thick-skinned political operator. 'He thinks strategically, and then fights as much as it takes, compromising only when necessary,' says Professor Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist who has advised the Russian government and is a personal friend. 'It is because of his political skill that privatisation has been the most successful part of the economic reforms so far.' It is in order to complete what he sees as a historic mission of switching the state-dominated economy to 'real owners' that he helped set up Russia's Choice and is running for parliament in his native city. Competing parties in the elections continue to assert that his blanket approach to privatisation is insensitive to the needs of individual companies and sectors. He defends it as the only way to minimise corruption, break the stranglehold of bureaucrats on the economy and make enterprises behave in a more market-orientated way. In order to ensure support for the campaign, he has also given factory directors and workers the option of acquiring up to 51 per cent of the shares in their companies. His next step, he says, will be to focus on the economic restructuring of privatised enterprises, helping those who want it and accelerating bankruptcy proceedings against hopeless companies. Consolidating his stature as a nationwide politician is the network of local representatives of his State Property Committee in every town and city of Russia. An intensely private man, he has little time for a personal life, even employing his wife, Maria Vishnevskaya, who is also an economist, to brief him on aspects of privatisation. A puritan in comparison to many of his colleagues, he is strikingly honest for someone in such a potentially corrupting job. Despite having control of most state-owned property in Russia, he spent his first year in office living in a small Moscow hotel rather than taking over a nice Moscow flat. He may not have the hurly-burly bonhomie of many a Russian politician. But he is looking to the election to confirm that his privatisation, despite seven decades of hostility to private property under Communism, is indeed, Russia's choice.</p>

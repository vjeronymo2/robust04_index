			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Udo Steinbach, head of the German  Orient Institute in Hamburg, has warned that further acts of  violence may committed by Kurds in Germany. In an interview  with the Berlin daily B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] (Tuesday edition),  the expert on Turkey said: "I would not rule out that, if the  overall situation escalates, we will also have to fear an  escalation of terrorism in our country, even up to  hostage-taking."    To the extent to which the military situation in  southeastern  Turkey becomes more dramatic and the Germans continue to supply  weapons, one is increasingly facing the Kurds' dissatisfaction,  the scientist said. This is expressed more and more in militant  actions. "Therefore, we must also expect retaliatory attacks  against German institutions," Steinbach said. Actually, highway  blockades are already a step toward this end.</p>

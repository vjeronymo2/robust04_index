			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Rail union to consider return to negotiations A meeting of the RMT transport union's executive on Monday is expected to welcome Railtrack's willingness to improve its pay offer to signalling staff by allowing up to half of a 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement to be included in the staff's basic rates. This improvement would enable the signal workers, who have been in dispute for the past eight weeks, to secure immediate basic pay rises of 4.7 per cent. The union said last night that while this would not end the conflict it would enable the union to return to the negotiating table. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, appealed yesterday to Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, for five days of secret talks. If Mr Knapp was not prepared to negotiate a final deal in these talks, Mr Horton said, he should ballot his signalling staff again on the company's latest pay offer. Mr Horton was in a more buoyant mood after this week's rejection of strike action by supervisors. He wrote in a letter to Mr Knapp yesterday: 'Your union has received a clear message that the time has come to end this damaging and unnecessary dispute.' The RMT leadership lost no time in rejecting his appeal for secret talks on restructuring. Mr Knapp said the dispute was not about restructuring but about a claim for a rise for past productivity. He said: 'If Railtrack cannot grasp this eight weeks into the dispute, it is little wonder no progress has been made towards a solution.' He added that the union had proposed a joint working party to deal with restructuring and agreed to ballot the signalling staff on the final deal. But the union executive is also anxious to clarify Railtrack's willingness to improve its interim offer. In another letter, sent by Mr Horton to the union on Thursday, he explained that Railtrack had told the conciliation service Acas that it was ready to reshape its last pay offer so some of the proposed 6 per cent unconsolidated supplement could be put into basic rates. Railtrack managers have made it clear that they are 'prepared to go half way' to meet the union and this means consolidating half the 6 per cent supplement. But that suggestion has not been put in writing and this is what the RMT executive will be seeking to clarify next week, before the 72 hours of stoppages planned around next weekend.

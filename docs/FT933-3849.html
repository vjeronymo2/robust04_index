			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Hedging his fiscal bets THE DEBATE over the contents of the forthcoming November Budget will, it seems, be an open and shut affair. Open, in the sense that the war of words over taxing and spending is now seriously under way between embattled factions within the Conservative party; closed, in that Mr Kenneth Clarke has issued a characteristically blunt reminder that he is in charge and that there is no question of him signing away in advance his right to increase taxes, whatever the Tory right might care to hope. Many of the right-wing persuasion appear anyway to be in a state of intellectual confusion. Some claim to believe that theirs is the party of low taxation and that an outsize public sector borrowing requirement will disappear with economic recovery. This would serve remarkably well as the working definition of a party of unsound finance. And, indeed, it could readily be argued that this is precisely what the Tory party has been for the past 14 years. The figures in the last Budget Red Book show that only now, after a soaraway decade in the 1980s, are total taxes coming back down, as a percentage of GDP, to the level inherited from Labour in 1979. Fiscal softy As for spending, the present economic recovery has been pump primed by a substantial fiscal boost in which spending departments have been held on a much looser rein than they had earlier dared hope. Meantime a former special adviser to ex-chancellor Norman Lamont has been complaining bitterly this week that the Tories are now the party of high spending and that Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury minister who threatens swingeing cuts, is talking through his hat. This view derives further support from Mr Clarke's own statements, on becoming chancellor, that it was politically unrealistic to expect to make real cuts in public expenditure. A self-styled man of the hard centre, he threatens on this score to become a fiscal softy in the departmental lion's den. That said, he has yet to reveal his hand on anything substantive. And what, one wonders, could any chancellor be expected to do other than to keep his options open in present circumstances. In the short run, Mr Clarke has been the beneficiary of a bigger than expected rise in output thanks largely to a return of consumer confidence. Inflation figures continue to undershoot mainstream forecasts and unemployment has fallen surprisingly early in the recovery. Yet the very fact that the economy continues to surprise the analysts underlines the Treasury's diagnostic problems. Savings rate Savings behaviour, which is the key to a significant part of the recovery to date, is particularly hard to pin down. After a big surge, which provided the main impetus to recession, the rate of household saving started to fall again last year. But with the personal sector still heavily indebted after the housing boom of the late 1980s, no one can predict how far and fast the rate will now come down; nor, again, whether the confidence boost from falling unemployment off-sets the restraining influence of housing market debt. In the meantime there are difficult questions about the external account, which are exacerbated by the interruption in the official trade data. Sterling devaluation has enhanced competitiveness; and productivity growth, which is traditionally rapid in the early stages of recovery, is now working further magic on unit labour costs. But some of the shine comes off gains in competitiveness when Britain's main trading partners in continental Europe appear bent on putting off recovery - witness the reluctance of the French to cut their intervention rate after the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts on Thursday. Sheer ignorance of how the economy works, together with the fallibility of the Treasury's own past forecasts, provides a compelling reason for delaying the decision on taxation. And even if the data were reliable that judgment would be horrifically difficult, since Mr Clarke has to steer a course between a rate of growth that is neither so slow that the public finances remain under pressure, nor so fast that the trade account collapses further. Much easier, in fact, to run the economy from the backbenches. The Tory right should count its blessings.</p>

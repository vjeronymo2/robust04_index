			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Compensation valid for NZ cheddar - European Law New Zealand cheddar imported into the European Community by one EC country and then resold in other Community countries is entitled to monetary compensation amounts (MCAs) when being resold in the Community, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The case concerned the New Zealand Dairy Board and its subsidiary in Germany, General Milk Products GmbH. Until 1984, the subsidiary had imported cheddar, among other products, from New Zealand for resale within the Community, and these resales benefited from MCAs. MCAs were introduced by the Community to compensate for fluctuations in export and import prices of agricultural products between the prices fixed by the Community institutions and the real market prices. In 1984, an agreement was reached between New Zealand and the Community, whereby the regime for trade in cheese was changed. Instead of minimum prices and quota restrictions on cheese imports into the Community, the new arrangements relied solely on quota limits. This change led the German customs to refuse the applicant company any MCAs for the cheese it was seeking to export from Germany to other countries in the Community. The European Court ruled that the change in arrangements for the import of cheese from New Zealand into the Community had not had any impact on the granting of export MCAs. The Court said that, in deciding to suspend the minimum prices, the Commission must have found New Zealand prices and Community prices for cheddar to be compatible. This had nothing to do with the grant of export MCAs, which were aimed specifically at neutralising the consequences of currency fluctuations on the movement of agricultural products within the Community. The Court therefore ruled in favour of General Milk Products but with one proviso. Export MCAs were applicable to the transactions in question as long as, like the GMP dealings, they were ordinary commercial transactions. MCAs would not be granted to fictitious arrangements, intended only to claim the benefit of MCAs. This proviso was clearly aimed at underlining the Community's wish to stamp out the fraudulent transactions that have been a feature of certain agricultural markets within the Community in recent years. C-8/92: General Milk Products GmbH v Haupzollamt Hamburg-Jonas, ECJ 3CH, March 3 1993. Other cases of interest Among the many opinions of the Advocates-General, two cases look certain to be of particular interest. They both concern the Community rules relating to health warnings on cigarette packets. Advocate-General Lenz found that Community rules required member states to ensure that health warnings on cigarette packets covered 4 per cent of the surface area of each packet. National authorities, however, are not entitled to demand that health warnings cover a larger surface area than 4 per cent, even if the domestic labelling requirements are more strict. Advocate-General Lenz also found that the Community rules, as presently constituted, only allowed for one health warning per cigarette packet. The judgment of the Court will be awaited with interest by the cigarette manufacturers.

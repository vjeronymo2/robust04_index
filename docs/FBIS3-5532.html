Taking advantage of  his visit, the Japanese Government plans to seek ways to resume  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain suspended,  and to seek an understanding with the United States about  Japan's efforts to open its market by explaining these efforts  to Christopher.    He will be the first U.S. cabinet member to visit Japan  since  the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act was  revived. Christopher will meet separately with Prime Minister  Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata and will deliver a speech to  the opening ceremony of the "International Committee on the  Reconstruction of Cambodia" to be held 10-11 March in Japan. He  will also attend the first Japan-U.S. security consultations  (the so-called 2-Plus-2 talks) to be held on 11 March in Tokyo,  with senior foreign and defense officials from the two countries  attending. U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero, who is in  charge of economic affairs and who arrived in Japan on 8 March  prior to Christopher's visit, will meet with Deputy Foreign  Minister Matsuura on the morning of 9 March.    At separate meetings with Secretary of State Christopher,  Prime Minister Hosokawa and his cabinet ministers will brief him  on a new package of economic stimulus measures, as well as  Japan's measures to open its market, measures which the  government plans to map out by the end of March. They will also  seek his understanding of Japanese plans to create an  environment for reducing its current account surplus through a  steady expansion of domestic demand. In addition, they will  consult with him on a set of compromise proposals by the  Japanese private sector for settling bilateral negotiations on  such sectors as cellular phones, automobiles, and semiconductors.    During the separate meetings, they will ask that the United  States cautiously deal with the revived Super 301 provision.</p>

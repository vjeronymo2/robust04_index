			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTONOVICH SUPPORTS REDUCED SLUDGE PLAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who had tried to halt a  controversial plan to truck tons of Los Angeles sewage sludge to farms in the  Antelope Valley, has decided to allow a scaled-down version to be considered  Thursday by a state water board.  </P> <P> Antonovich had argued in March that the city's original plan to export up to  300 tons a day of its sludge to be used as fertilizer required prior county  approval.  </P> <P> But Antonovich's office and county officials decided Tuesday that the latest  plan for about 80 tons a day does not require such approval.  </P> <P> Officials with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board said they  will consider the proposal when they meet Thursday in Lancaster. Los Angeles,  through a private company, had originally proposed spreading sludge over five  Antelope Valley farm sites totaling 3,500 acres.  </P></p>

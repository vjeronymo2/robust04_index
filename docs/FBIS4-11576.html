			<p>BFN     [Text] Cordoba, 28 Apr (NA) -- Local Federal Police  detachment personnel have closed down two FM radio stations and  two unlicensed television stations, and arrested Justicialist  Party militant Luis Vanni for "resisting law-enforcement  officers."    The Federal Police acted in compliance with a Federal Court  warrant issued in light of a complaint filed by national  telecommunications officials because the pirate stations were  interfering with legal radio and television stations.    Luis Vanni is a controversial individual and the leader of  the so-called "Vanni brigades" which have been involved in  strange political events during elections.    As the federal agents closed down the illegal stations, they  found Vanni at his private residence in Arguello district from  where he operated these neighborhood media. Vanni tried to stop  the officers from closing down the stations and had to be  subdued.    He was arrested and taken to the local Federal Police  station, charged with resisting law-enforcement officers. He  was turned over to Federal Judge Raul Bustos Fierro.</p>

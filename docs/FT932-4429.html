			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: De La Rue in Pounds 30m Brazilian disposal DE LA RUE, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, has disposed of its Brazilian subsidiary to the United States Banknote Corporation for Dollars 45m (Pounds 30m). The group has also ended a cross - shareholding arrangement with American Bank Note Holographics, a USBC subsidiary, in a deal which will bring the UK group a further Dollars 15m. USBC is, through its subsidiaries American Bank Note and American Bank Note Holographics, the largest private sector security printer in North America and the largest producer of holograms for security applications worldwide. The Brazilian company, TDLR, has operations in both Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and supplies cheques, financial cards and other security documents to the local Brazilian markets. The deal gets De La Rue out of the volatile Brazilian market, which has been plagued by high inflation and consequent difficulties in establishing the quality of earnings. De La Rue said the Brazilian company did not form an integral part of its global security business and was not involved in the production of currency. The UK group intends to continue supplying currency, passports and other high-security documents to South and Central America, but these will be produced elsewhere and paid for in hard currency. De La Rue has also agreed to unscramble a deal agreed in 1989 whereby a group subsidiary, De La Rue Holographics, entered into a licence agreement with American Bank Note Holographics. De La Rue and USBC also exchanged 20 per cent interests in their respective hologram operations, at a net cost to De La Rue of Dollars 10m. Both companies said they now felt the arrangement had served its purpose and that it was appropriate to terminate the cross-holdings and enter a simplified licence agreement.</p>

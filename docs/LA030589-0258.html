			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE IN COUNTY  </P> <P> I disagree with Rusty Kennedy, director of the Orange County Human Relations  Commission, who is quoted in The Times (Feb. 11) as saying there is no  anti-Semitism in the county. All he need do is wear a Star of David and he'll  learn about anti-Jewish sentiment in Orange County.  </P> <P> I run an editorial bureau for a Boston-based newspaper, and my wife is a  receptionist at a medical clinic. Both of us have seen and experienced  anti-Semitism, blatant and otherwise.  </P> <P> A common example, which I have heard far too often here, is using the noun  "Jew" as a verb. It turns my stomach to hear someone say, "He is just trying to  Jew you down" in reference to negotiations. It also is not uncommon to hear of  how the Jews allegedly killed Jesus and Jewish people are not welcome here. The  hate in this county is more widespread than many, I think, want to believe.  </P> <P> There are other examples. The picture I paint is not pretty; it's not meant to  be. In the 5 years we've lived in the county, we have experienced numerous  incidents of anti-Semitism. Orange County still deserves its hard-earned  reputation.  </P> <P> That's not to say everyone in the county is an anti-Semite. However, the  numbers are too high, and it's time Kennedy realizes much work must be done to  eliminate the problem.  </P> <P> STEPHEN M. LAWTON  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

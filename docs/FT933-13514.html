			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (14): Patriotism seems to pay - Hong Kong businesses are expanding their investments in the colony THE departure of flagships Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation and Jardine Matheson before the Chinese assume sovereignty in 1997 appears to symbolise the international image of corporate Hong Kong, but the reality could not be more different. Far from struggling to lower their exposure to Hong Kong, most of the colony's businesses are expanding their investment portfolios in Hong Kong and in the land of its future masters. When Britain and China signed a joint declaration sealing the fate of Hong Kong as a future Chinese territory, a corporate exodus was widely expected. Jardine Matheson seemed to set a trend in 1984, when it moved its domicile to Bermuda, tacitly implying a lack of confidence in the post-1997 administration. It looked as if other companies might restructure asset portfolios in favour of safer havens, such as North America and Europe. Indeed, some companies have dabbled overseas in property developments in Canada, California and Australia. But the track record of Hong Kong investors who have moved outside the cosy borders of the colony has been extremely poor, while those who stayed have prospered. Mr Stephen Clark, director of Anglo Chinese, a local corporate finance house, says there will be no external flood of capital. 'If there was going to be a move for the door, it would have already happened,' he says. One of the only Chinese conglomerates to make a significant push outside Asia is Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa. In 1987 it purchased a 43 per cent stake in Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Oil - the investment was split between Hutchison and its associate Hongkong Electric. It followed this with the expansion of its telecommunications business into the UK in the early 1990s. Husky contributed write-offs of Dollars HK2.2bn for Hutchison in its 1991 and 1992 accounts. And if its UK telecommunications operations are for sale, as is believed, enormous losses would result. Warburg Securities estimates that these two investments will reduce earnings between 1988 and 1995 by Dollars HK4.5bn, even assuming there are no provisions against the telecommunications business. There was little surprise, therefore, when Mr Li announced last year that Hutchison would refocus its attention on Hong Kong and China. Hong Kong Chinese companies have long understood that those who cash in Hong Kong businesses to pay for overseas investments will be deemed unpatriotic and unsuitable for favourable treatment by a post-1997 regime. Expectations of asset disposals have therefore focused on the four main expatriate-managed companies, Jardine Matheson, HSBC, Swire Pacific and Hongkong Telecom (HKT). Mr Stephen Brown, research director of Asia Equity, says: 'Only two of the British-style Hong Kong companies have decided not to play the decolonisation game, and have instead diversified overseas through acquisitions.' HSBC has finalised its long-awaited takeover of Midland and its move into the international banking arena. Jardine, meanwhile, has completed its restructuring as a primarily a London listed company: recent expansion has focused on the UK, through Trafalgar House, and Singapore, through Cycle &amp; Carriage. Jardine Matheson has been publicly condemned for what is perceived as its lack of confidence in the future of the Hong Kong special administrative region. By contrast, its competitors have made every effort to build up their Chinese guanxi or connections. Swire Pacific and HKT have recognised the changing environment by offering shares to China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), the local offshoot of the Beijing investment corporation. Citic Pacific, the largest China-controlled listing in Hong Kong, now holds 12.5 per cent of Swire's airline Cathay Pacific and 12 per cent of HKT. At the same time, Swire and HKT have expanded their operations across the border into China. Swire Properties has cemented the relationship by launching a HKDollars 2.85bn property development with Citic. Hong Kong offers investors a high growth economy and a cosy, tight-knit business community. Insiders start with a significant advantage, but this is not transferable. Most overseas investments have been mere extensions of a domestic strategy. In 1988 and 1989, for example, Regal Hotels, New World Hotels and Wharf Holdings each purchased US groups - Aircoa, Ramada and Omni respectively. The total cost of these hotel investments was USDollars 535m, and while all were expected to benefit from existing operations, they have proved to be ill-timed purchases. Dickson Poon's more recent HKDollars 750m purchase of Harvey Nichols was also a strategic decision to acquire another brand name for Dickson Concepts' luxury goods distribution business, rather than just a real estate gamble. These investments pale by comparison with the level of capital flows between Hong Kong and neighbouring Guangdong province. Mainland Chinese investors have made substantial inroads into the Hong Kong property and stock markets. Over the next year, nine mainland registered state enterprises will be floated on the Hong Kong stock market, further emphasising the link. In the other direction, Credit Lyonnais Securities estimates that the average Hong Kong listed company has made two investments in China, and the aggregate value of these projects (including the investment by the joint venture partner) amounts to HKDollars 521bn. All the leading corporate finance houses now have China teams, pointing up the irony of Jardine's lone push towards internationalisation, given its historical background as the Princely Hong and pillar of the colony's business community. Jardine has had some overseas successes, notably through its supermarkets subsidiary Dairy Farm - which has significant holdings in Kwik Save in the UK and Franklins in Australia. Its stake in Trafalgar House is viewed by many as another astute move. But as the group's percentage of earnings from Hong Kong declines, so will the level of its influence. China has already indicated the potential problems this could cause, by setting obstacles to its proposed investment in Container Terminal 9.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The concern over President Konstandinos Karamanlis'  health last night has in the end been proven groundless.  President Karamanlis suffered a minor drop in blood pressure at  2000 yesterday evening and, as for any emergency, he was moved  to the Presidential Palace in an ambulance. After awhile, the  president's blood pressure returned to normal and he is  completely fine.</p>

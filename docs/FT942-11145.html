			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP boost The stock market was startled by the 19 per cent dividend increase announced by British Petroleum and hoisted the oil company's shares to an all-time high of 408p, before a flurry of profit-taking left the stock a net 16 1/2 up at 399 1/2 p. Turnover was 21m shares, the highest day's business in the stock since its preliminary results in February. Dealers in the oil sector acknowledged that the figures were startlingly good but posed the question as to why BP was hastening to reinstate a dividend cut made only two years ago. Some of the more cynical traders still harboured a suspicion that the Kuwait Investment Office might be waiting for a good opportunity to place its near 10 per cent stake in BP, the residue of the 22 per cent holding the KIO built up in the late 1980s. But industry analysts were at pains to applaud BP's performance. 'It is very hard to criticise these figures. The company is enormously leveraged to European recovery in refining and chemicals,' said Mr Jeremy Hudson at Lehman Brothers, the US-owned brokerage concern. Hoare Govett, BP's broker, described the figures as 'stunningly good' and the stock 'undervalued'. Goldman Sachs forecast that the shares would reach the high 400s later in the year. Mr Keith Morris at Schroders, a long-time bull of BP, said the shares' performance demonstrated the market's belief that the company can still make decent profits at Dollars 15 a barrel. Reports of swingeing cuts to come at Do It All, the home improvement subsidiary of Boots and WH Smith, boosted the shares in both companies. 'If true, this degree of rationalisation at this price represents good value for Boots and Smith,' said one stores specialist. The report that around half - or 100 - of the DIY outlets would be shut or sold at a cost of some Pounds 60m compares with City predictions of 50 closures at a cost of Pounds 55m. Boots added 12 at 559p, while Smith 'A' put on 12 at 506p. Boots was also refusing to comment on US press reports that it was talking to HJ Heinz over the sale of its Farley baby food subsidiary. The strong rally by the Hong Kong market triggered a big recovery in stocks such as Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings. The latter jumped 29 to 698p and the former, whose shares are scheduled to be split four-for-one this morning, rose 29 to 965p. Barclays advanced 13 to 512p following the annual meeting, while Lloyds closed 20 better at 579p. Bank of Scotland fell to 177p immediately following the preliminary figures, reflecting profit-taking, but rallied to close a net 5 up at 188p. Zeneca improved 9 to 697p ahead of its annual meeting today, and a presentation to analysts on Monday at its research base in Cheshire. Lehman Brothers was also said to have recommended the stock at a pharmaceuticals conference focusing on emerging markets. Wellcome, another of Lehman's favoured stocks, moved up 13 to 563p. ICI, 12 firmer at 830p, benefited from the improved figures at BP, which revealed that its chemicals division had moved into profit for the first time in 18 months. Chemicals group Laporte slipped 6 to 808p, with one securities house believed to be offering a line of 1m shares around the market. Turnover in whisky manufacturer Burn Stewart reached 6m shares as 5 per cent of the company changed hands. Dealers said the shares were bought at 108p and placed in the market at between 110p and 111p, with Cazenove thought to be responsible. Burn Stewart dipped 2 to 116p. Management changes at Bass were said to have unnerved some investors, together with a bout of profit-taking after a recent good run. The stock retreated 9 to 558p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, up 11 at 523p, and Whitbread, ahead 16 at 564p, benefited from switching from Bass. Sparkling spirits figures from LVMH's Far Eastern operations helped Guinness put on 6 at 482p. Luxury goods group Vendome moved forward 14 to 452p. Airtours fully-paid shares surged 39 to 469p after presentations to Scottish institutions. The nil-paid doubled in value to 79p. Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 9.9m and the shares hardened 4 to 194 1/2 p on reports that the group may win a substantial order from Saudi Arabia. Queries over the safety of the Channel tunnel cast a shadow over operator Eurotunnel ahead of today's official opening. The shares relinquished 8 to 460p. The market appreciated news from conglomerate Wassall that it planned to acquire General Cable, of the US, in a Pounds 178.7m deal, to be partly funded by a rights issue. The shares jumped 18 to 320p. Food retailers continued their encouraging run. Argyll climbed 13 1/2 to 251 1/2 p on 9.8m traded, Kwik Save 16 to 567p, Tesco 8 1/2 to 223 1/2 p on 11m dealt and J. Sainsbury 14 1/2 to 392 1/2 p also on 11m.</p>

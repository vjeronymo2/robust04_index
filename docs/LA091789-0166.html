			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A TAX INCREASE FOR ORANGE COUNTY'S SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Although I was not one of those polled, I, too, would support a tax hike that  would directly benefit the schools here in Orange County.  </P> <P> Since the passage of Proposition 13, I have watched the school districts  struggle to provide outstanding instruction with less than adequate funds.  Throughout the county, dedicated teachers continue to find creative ways to  supply a wide variety of enrichment activities in and out of the classroom that  the government simply cannot fund.  </P> <P> A tax increase was opposed by a majority of residents 55 and older, with a  64-year-old woman acting as (spokeswoman): "Most kids, when they get through  school, can't even spell or add or write their names."  </P> <P> This quote simply isn't supported by the facts. For the past several years,  Orange County achievement tests scores have been slowly and steadily climbing,  despite the increasing influx of non-English-speaking students. To bring  children with few or no communication skills in their native language to  acceptable levels of competence in written and spoken English is an outstanding  accomplishment.  </P> <P> I would suggest anyone who "can't see spending more money on something that's  not working," to sign up for a few of the classes our high school students are  required to take for graduation. The academic challenge might prove  stimulating.  </P> <P> There is still plenty of room for improvement in education. However, if we are  to keep well-qualified instructors in the classroom, we need to provide the  worthwhile salaries and facilities that will enable them to do their jobs.  </P> <P> CINDY SUMAN  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

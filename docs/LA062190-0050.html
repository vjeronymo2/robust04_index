			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INS CHIEF PROPOSES SWEEPING CHANGES;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: THE OVERHAUL COULD MEAN MORE AGENTS ALONG THE MEXICAN BORDER AND  IMPROVED SERVICES FOR INCOMING FOREIGNERS.  </P> <P> The new chief of the Immigration and Naturalization Service has proposed  sweeping changes to the agency that could result in more enforcement agents  along the U.S.-Mexican border, more consistent sanctions against violators of  immigration laws and better services for immigrants and their families.  </P> <P> The planned overhaul -- which Commissioner Gene McNary reportedly wants in  place by the end of the year -- would be the most comprehensive restructuring  of the INS since it was decentralized in 1955, observers say.  </P> <P> Proponents hope that the changes will help reduce lengthy delays for foreign  nationals and relatives seeking citizenship, political asylum and permission to  work in the United States. Backlogs for a wide range of immigration benefits  have long been particularly pronounced in Southern California, which  increasingly is the preferred destination for immigrants, both legal and  illegal.  </P> <P> "I think there's a potential here for alleviating some of the real, profound  problems that have long existed in (the region)," said Warren Leiden, executive  director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn.  </P> <P> Agency officials stress that the plans are preliminary and will require the  approval of the U.S. Justice Department and the federal Office of Management  and Budget, along with a Congressional review. McNary will also have to  overcome some tough opposition from officials within the agency, including  Western Regional Commissioner Ben Davidian, who are leery of his desire to  centralize power.  </P> <P> Davidian contends that a reorganization now could hurt the progress of the INS  amnesty program, under which 3 million foreigners, half of them now in  California, are attempting to become permanent legal U.S. residents.  </P> <P> Although McNary and other top immigration officials declined to comment on the  reforms, The Times obtained copies of several internal memorandums, letters and  other documents outlining the plan.  </P> <P> Privately, McNary has expressed concern that the central INS office in  Washington has lost its agenda-setting role in recent years as several regional  political appointees -- notable Harold Ezell, the provocative former Western  regional commissioner -- carved out highly visible mini-empires.  </P> <P> McNary, a former Missouri county executive with a reputation as a deft manager,  is scheduled to make his first official public appearance in Los Angeles today.  He took office last fall with a congressional mandate to return stability to a  labyrinthine agency that several much-publicized studies found to be  inefficient, inconsistent and riddled with fiscal irregularities.  </P> <P> The service's shortcomings have become more pronounced -- and more public -- in  recent years as illegal immigration has blossomed into a national concern and  the service has expanded rapidly from a Justice Department backwater into a  $1-billion-a-year bureaucracy with more than 15,000 employees worldwide.  </P> <P> The INS, which had its origins as a small bureau of the Treasury Department  almost a century ago, has a dual role: Its agents arrest almost 1 million or  more undocumented foreigners each year while, at the same time, officers  annually admit millions of new immigrants, naturalized citizens and foreign  visitors into the United States.  </P> <P> Inconsistent policies from region to region have long plagued the service. For  example. a survey by the Urban Institute and the RAND Corp., two public policy  research groups, found that the average fines assessed by the INS against  employers of illegal aliens varied wildly, from less than $1,000 in San Antonio  to about $4,500 in Los Angeles to more than $11,000 in New York and $45,000 in  Chicago.  </P> <P> In McNary's plan, the four regional INS offices -- in Laguna Niguel, Dallas,  Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., and Burlington, Vt. -- will become mostly  administrative bodies, losing most of their enforcement power, including the  initiation of investigations, the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring  of smuggling activities.  </P> <P> Under the revised setup, the service's 34 districts and 21 Border Patrol  sectors nationwide will report directly to Washington, bypassing the regional  commissioners. In Washington, a chief of staff and executive commissioner will  help implement McNary's agenda.  </P> <P> The anticipated redesign, McNary explained, will ultimately result in a  bureaucratic structure such as those of other U.S. Department of Justice  entities, notably the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement  Administration.  </P> <P> McNary said he does not anticipate cutbacks in personnel; in fact, expansions  are likely, particularly in "seriously understaffed" areas. However, he added  that transfers, relocations and shifts in duty are also being considered.  </P> <P> Among the most provocative aspects of McNary's blueprint are his intentions to  narrow and focus the role of the Border Patrol, the service's 4,000-employee  armed enforcement branch. Agents are principally charged with arresting illegal  immigrants along the nation's frontiers, particularly the porous,  almost-2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> McNary, seeking to concentrate officers in their primary mission along the  border zone from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., would largely strip the patrol  of its roles in anti-smuggling investigations and enforcing laws barring the  hiring of undocumented workers. Separate INS branches would handle such tasks.  </P> <P> The new commissioner is also proposing reducing staff or shutting down some  inland Border Patrol posts -- notably those in Livermore, Dallas and Portland  -- and the redeployment along the border of officers now assigned to inland  stations.  </P> <P> Western Regional Commissioner Davidian, who is based in Laguna Niguel and  oversees California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam, has argued that regional  offices are better equipped to understand local issues than a far-removed  central office in Washington.  </P> <P> McNary already has wrested control of budget, personnel and purchasing. In  addition, policy statements to the press must be cleared through Washington, a  cumbersome procedure that has been criticized as a "gag order" but one the  commissioner says ensures that the agency speaks "with one voice."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE COACH FOX FINDS FAULT WITH PARENTS' INSTRUCTION OF KIDS  </P> <P> Pepperdine men's tennis co-Coach Allen Fox has a message for parents who are  thinking of coaching their children: Think again.  </P> <P> "More kids have been ruined by a parent as a coach than have been helped," Fox  said.  </P> <P> Fox, 51, a former tour player and Davis Cup team member, holds a doctorate in  psychology from UCLA and has written several articles on the subject of  coaching one's child.  </P> <P> "There's a big difference between pushing your child to achieve in school and  pushing the child in sport," he said. "Sports is a pastime -- it's for fun.  </P> <P> "The parent becomes too involved and doesn't know where his interest ends and  the kid's begins."  </P> <P> Fox, entering his 13th year as coach at Pepperdine, said the negative effects  of a parent's coaching his child can be early burnout for the athlete,  incorrect instruction and the ruining of one or more family relationships.  </P> <P> "When a coach criticizes you, that's one thing. But the coach you can leave --  the parent you can't," he said.  </P> <P> Fox acknowledges that there are exceptions to his rule. He cited the success of  several parent-child teams, such as those involving Steffi Graf, Monica Seles,  Jimmy Connors, and Jennifer Capriati.  </P> <P> "Capriati's parents do a good job with her," said Fox. "You can tell she's  well-balanced and stable and gets lots of love. Her dad coaches her without  attacking her. You look at her face and you can tell she's happy.  </P> <P> "But there is no good documentation on the parents who coached their kid and  ruined them, because those kids obviously didn't get far," he added.  </P> <P> "If the kid really likes the game, he'll get good anyway. If a kid has the  potential to be a champion, they'll develop anyway on their own -- they can do  it without coaching," Fox said.  </P> <P> Fox, who is writing a book on the mechanics of tennis, also wrote "If I'm the  Better Player, Why Can't I Win?" a book published in 1979 that has sold more  than 20,000 copies.  </P> <P> Over the last 20 years, Fox has seen tennis players gain more attention and  prestige, but thinks tennis has lost some of its integrity in the process.  </P> <P> "There's much more money and glory now," Fox said. "Parents look at tennis as a  way to get into show business.  </P> <P> "The growth in tennis has been a negative, really, to most players -- it has  led them astray. (Players) have given up school and their education, family  values and life in order to pursue this potential they have in tennis," he  said. "What if they don't make it?"  </P> <P> Teens in tournaments: Nine Valley-area teen-agers took part in the U. S. Tennis  Assn. national championships last week. They are Natasha Pospich of Woodland  Hills, Meilin Tu of Northridge, Gary Potter of Thousand Oaks, Darren Potkey of  Ventura, Derek Pope of Ojai, Staci Jellen of Calabasas, Molly White of  Camarillo, and brothers Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo.  </P> <P> The team of Pope and John Roddick of Austin, Texas, was defeated in the boys'  14-and-under doubles final Saturday in San Antonio. Pope and Roddick went down  in straight sets, 7-5, 6-4, to Scott Humphrey of Alamo, Texas, and B.J. Stearn  of New City, N.Y.  </P> <P> In girls' 18-and-under doubles, Pospich and partner Laura Richards of Vista  lost to Rachel and Rebecca Jensen of Norcross, Ga., 6-2, 6-4, in quarterfinal  action at San Jose.  </P> <P> Pospich was easily beaten, 6-1, 6-1, in the fourth round of singles competition  last week by Lisa Raymond of Wayne, Pa., who went on to defeat her next three  opponents in straight sets to earn the title.  </P> <P> Tu came back from a 6-0 loss in the first set of her fourth-round match against  Karen Miller of Trenton, N.J., to win, 0-6, 6-4, 6-2. But Tu was eliminated in  the quarterfinals of the girls' 14-and-under division by Tracy Kotseos of  Winter Springs, Fla., 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> Add tournaments: The 15th tournament of the junior circuit K-Swiss Summer Grand  Prix began Monday and will conclude today at Cal State Northridge. The  21-tournament series will culminate in the 11th Masters Championships in North  Hollywood. The top eight point earners from all tournaments in each of five age  divisions will advance to the championships.  </P> <P> Many current and former pro tour players have left their mark on this Grand  Prix series. Debbie Graham of Fountain Valley, who was defeated by Martina  Navratilova in straight sets Tuesday in the second round of the Virginia Slims  of Los Angeles in Manhattan Beach, won the 12-and-under division title in 1982.  Graham, 19, who played for Stanford this year, is the 1990 NCAA singles  champion.  </P> <P> Team Tennis playoffs: Sectional playoffs for the USTA/Volvo Team Tennis League  start today and continue through Sunday at Los Caballeros Sports Village in  Fountain Valley. Eight of the 56 Southern California teams are from the Ventura  County area.  </P> <P> Winning teams in each division will advance to the national championships in  October. More than 750 Valley-area residents took part in the league this  season.  </P> <P> Camarillo event: The Cabrillo Racquet Club in Camarillo is playing host to the  Wilson/Eagle Tennis Fest on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Five tennis pros will  provide instruction and a radar gun will be used to clock the speed of serves.  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Central bank head resigns Greece's central bank governor, Mr Yannis Boutos, resigned yesterday in a political dispute over his sacking of the temporary commissioner in charge of the loss-making Bank of Crete, Kerin Hope writes. He was replaced by Mr Loukas Papademos, the deputy governor. Mr Papademos said the change would not affect the bank's tight monetary policy, aimed at cutting inflation from 11.9 per cent to single digits next year. The bank's exchange rate policy, based on a 'hard drachma' which has slipped only 6-7 per cent this year against other European currencies, will also be maintained. Mr Boutos, appointed governor 11 months ago by Socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou, said he resigned 'over a question of principle' but gave no details. Banking sources said he was under pressure to reinstate the commissioner, Mr Kostas Kalivianakis, who has close links with senior Socialist officials. The Bank of Crete was placed under central bank supervision in 1989 following a Dollars 200m (Pounds 126.5m) embezzlement scandal involving its owner, Mr George Koskotas, now in jail for fraud. The central bank planned to put Bank of Crete on sale this year. Informal discussions had already taken place with ETEVA, a state-owned development bank keen to expand into commercial banking. However, the sale was placed on hold following the Bank of Crete's worsening performance under Mr Kalivianakis.</p>

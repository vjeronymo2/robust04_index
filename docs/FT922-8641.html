			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Foreign chip makers advance into Europe - The trend is to dominance by US and Japanese groups IN the rural setting of Avezzano, a peaceful town about 100km east of Rome, Texas Instruments of the US on Friday officially opened a new factory making semiconductor chips for the European market. It is just the latest in a number of foreign-owned chip plants to open in Europe. One of the world's most advanced plants, it provides vivid testimony to the growing foreign presence in the European semiconductor market. The Avezzano plant, where Texas Instruments will produce 4-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for use in a broad range of electronics products from personal computers to telecommunications systems, has been the subject of some controversy since it was announced in 1989. At a time when indigenous semiconductor manufacturers have been struggling for survival in the increasingly competitive trading environment, the US group has secured more than half the cost of its main investment in Europe from the Italian government, which is providing as much as Dollars 650m (Pounds 367m) of the Dollars 1.2bn the programme is costing. The Avezzano plant raises difficult issues not only for Europe's indigenous chip makers, faced with a growing foreign presence in their own market, but also for European industrial policy. In the world of semiconductors, Europe as a market place is coming to mirror more and more the world trend towards dominance by the large US and Japanese groups. Foreign chip makers have been stepping up their activity in Europe in response to a growing need to be closer to customers, in order to remain competitive. They have also been under pressure from their own customers in Europe, led by the large US computer and information technology groups, to move production to the region and supply them with locally designed and manufactured products to meet the EC's local content rules. Last year Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and semiconductor group, started producing 4-megabit DRAMS in England and, NEC, the Japanese electronics and semiconductor group, added a 4-megabit DRAM facility to its plant in Scotland. Hitachi and Mitsubishi, the integrated Japanese electronics groups, have also announced plans to set up DRAM production in Europe. Local production of memory chips by the foreigners comes when the Europeans are already losing their grip over their own market. The top three European manufacturers still dominate the European rankings, but they each lost market share last year, according to a survey by Dataquest, the high technology consultancy. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, maintained its leading position in the European semiconductor market, but saw sales growth of just 1.5 per cent, against growth in the European market of 6.8 per cent. Siemens of Germany followed in second place but posted a 0.6 per cent decline in sales, while SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian group in third place, saw sales decline 2.3 per cent. As a group, European semiconductor makers saw their share of the European market fall from 39 to 38 per cent last year, even before a number of new foreign-owned plants have started to turn out products in volume. The growing presence of foreign manufacturers in the EC means that although by 1995 Europe will be producing about 60 per cent of its indigenous demand for 4-megabit DRAMS, 80 per cent of that locally-produced supply will come from foreign-owned manufacturers, Dataquest says. The remaining 20 per cent will come from Siemens, the German group which is the only remaining European manufacturer still producing DRAMS. In the short term, the volume production by foreign makers of memory chips for the European market poses the greatest threat to Siemens. But as production of semiconductor chips in Europe increases in line with any pick-up in economic activity, the European market is likely to be fought over more among themselves by foreign manufacturers. 'The competition here is the same as we face anywhere in the world,' says Mr Jerry Junkins, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Texas Instruments. That competition comes from the large US, Japanese and increasingly Korean, manufacturers rather than the European, which hardly have a presence outside their home market. The deal between Texas Instruments and the Italian government, which has one of the EC's worst records for high-technology investment, is also instructive as a likely harbinger of things to come. The agreement provides the Italian government, also under pressure to assist in recapitalising SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor joint venture with the French Thomson group, with investment from the US group, in a deprived region in an industry the government would like to support. But Texas Instruments believes it is also indicative of a growing recognition in Europe that foreign manufacturers have a contribution to make. 'I am convinced there is a new direction taking place in Brussels which recognises the importance of good European citizens like ourselves and the contribution these companies can make to improve the competitiveness of the European electronics industry,' says Mr Roberto Schisano, president of Texas Instruments in Europe and vice-president of the its semiconductor group. Whether the attitude in Brussels has seen such a change or not, the Italian-American partnership reflects a growing trend for investment in new semiconductor technology in Europe, and therefore European competitiveness in electronics, to be increasingly dependent on foreign manufacturers.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  NEW CHIP-MAKING FACILITIES IN EUROPE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company          Location                 Status  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

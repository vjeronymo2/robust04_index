			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE ARSONIST: A SHADOWY FIGURE HARD TO CATCH  </P> <P> The flames were still raging through dense brush in Carbon Canyon Regional Park  late last month when investigators discovered the remains of an incendiary  device near a horse trail where the blaze began.  </P> <P> The fire, which lasted until the next morning, "was deliberately set by an  individual who wanted to start a fire," said Orange County Fire Department  Capt. Dan Young. "Why, we don't know."  </P> <P> About 80 acres of grassland were charred in the fire, which narrowly missed a  grove of California redwoods and came within a quarter-mile of two housing  tracts, as well as threatening a mobile home park. It became the 572nd to be  attributed to arson in Orange County this year.  </P> <P> One in four fires is intentionally set, officials say, and arson is the leading  cause of fires in commercial buildings.  </P> <P> In the past year, the number of arson fires has declined 8%. But fire officials  say that the amount of damage has increased by 15%.  </P> <P> And the trend may worsen. Traditionally, a flagging economy is associated with  an increase in arson-for-profit crimes, as some are tempted to see arson as a  solution to financial woes.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen the trend yet" this year, said chief arson investigator Mike  McCann, "but we have seen it in the past."  </P> <P> Of the more than 500 fires intentionally set this year, only 71 have been  solved. In many of the unsolved cases, investigators have identified suspects,  but they lack one or two key pieces of evidence that can lead to an arrest.  </P> <P> The difficulties in arson investigations frustrate officials, who say the crime  not only endangers lives, but raises already high insurance rates and saddles  financially strapped Orange County with hundreds of thousands of dollars each  year in firefighting costs.  </P> <P> "It's not like you have a dead body with a knife in the back and you can point  to motive and opportunity," McCann said. "In arson, you have ashes to work  with."  </P> <P> Arsonists range from homeowners and business people in debt to pyromaniacs and  burglars trying to hide their tracks.  </P> <P> "You don't always have the smoking gun" in arson crime, McCann said. "Arsonists  are a cowardly lot. They hide in back alleys and commit their crime in the  dark."  </P> <P> So difficult is the investigator's task that often, only the public can help  solve the crime.  </P> <P> "For us, (compiling meaningful evidence) is like searching for a needle in a  haystack. You have to sift through tons of debris," said Russell Jones, one of  the County Fire Department's eight full-time arson investigators, whose  responsibilities include determining cause, doing detective work, making  arrests and testifying in court as expert witnesses.  </P> <P> Some examples of recent cases:  </P> <P> * The Cook Book, a popular Tustin restaurant, burned in May, causing $1 million  in damage. A nearby store owner locking up for the night reported seeing a  bright flash before the flames broke out, said arson investigator John  McMasters. That was the first indication that arson was to blame.  </P> <P> Combing through the soggy piles of charred debris and ashes, investigators  found other, more solid evidence that the fire had been intentionally set. It  was also apparent that the fire had started in several different spots, a  strong indicator of arson.  </P> <P> "Whoever was in there (at the time of the fire) was intent on destroying the  building," McMasters said, adding that his unit received an anonymous call  about the case.  </P> <P> Despite that call, fire officials still do not have enough information to make  an arrest.  </P> <P> "In this case, we want to talk to those folks who already called us," McMasters  said. "We'd like them to come forward to testify."  </P> <P> * In 1989, customers in Little John's Inn in Santa Ana Heights had to dash  through flames that had engulfed the main entrance.  </P> <P> Investigators discovered that gasoline had been poured on a motorcycle  belonging to a customer. The cycle was moved against the front door and  ignited.  </P> <P> No one was seriously injured in that blaze, which caused $200,000 in damage.  </P> <P> The motive, investigators believe, was revenge.  </P> <P> Investigators are not only hampered by a vague description of the arsonist, but  they are not sure if the suspect was targeting the bar owner, the motorcycle  owner or someone else in the bar, Jones said.  </P> <P> "We don't know who he was mad at," Jones said.  </P> <P> Revenge-seeking arsonists may range from a gang member who torches a rival's  car to a spurned lover who sets a fire to the possessions of an estranged mate,  or in one recent case, a former lover.  </P> <P> * For the past two months, downtown Tustin area has been plagued by a string of  dumpster fires that fire officials believe were intentionally set by the same  person. The fires cause minimal damage, but fire officials are worried that the  fires will become increasingly more dangerous if the arsonist is not caught  soon.  </P> <P> One indication was a recent fire which destroyed a late-model Oldsmobile  convertible parked at a high school football game. Fire officials declined to  be specific, but they believe that fire was related to the dumpster blazes.  </P> <P> The Tustin fires may be an example of the most perplexing type of arson: that  set by a "firebugs" who either get sexual or other gratification by watching  fire or enjoy acting like a "hero" by setting a small fire and reporting it,  McCann said.  </P> <P> Fire officials have asked for the public's help in solving the Tustin fires,  and are hoping for the sort of assistance which landed Peter Diaz Reyes in jail  last summer.  </P> <P> Reyes, a 29-year-old transient, has been charged with setting the June 27 fire,  also in Carbon Canyon, after receiving a tip from a witness who told them that  they saw the homeless man in the area just before the fire erupted.  </P> <P> After the Nov. 28 fire in the same canyon, police and fire investigators have  fielded many calls from witnesses who have provided evidence that may lead to  an arrest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TROUBLING CASES FOR FIRE INVESTIGATORS  </P> <P> WHEN: July 25, 1990, at 3 a.m.  </P> <P> WHAT: Office of dentist David Semrau.  </P> <P> WHERE: 24481 Alicia Parkway, Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> DAMAGE: $250,000, $220,000 of which were contents.  </P> <P> DETAILS: Arsonist poured accelerant throughout the office and lighted the  material.

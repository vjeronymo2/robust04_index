			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Lightning strike Patrick Nicholls, the newest of the Tories' vice-chairmen, is either a brave man or a fool. Just as his fellow Tory MPs are trying to persuade their constituents that putting value added tax on domestic fuel and increasing national insurance contributions are not incompatible with the government's election promises, Nicholls is threatening the party faithful with the unthinkable. While other backbenchers have been preferring to canvass the options of extending VAT even further or raising corporation tax, Nicholls, who has special responsibility for campaigning, has vigorously denied the idea that any increase in income tax would be 'a shame and embarrassment' given the government's stated objectives. 'A government which brought the top rate of income tax down from 98 per cent to 40 per cent need not be embarrassed if for a temporary reason it has to go up slightly,' he insisted on BBC radio yesterday. Perhaps he needs to brush up on his campaigning techniques. Despite his vehement denials that any such course was planned, his interview left the impression that he had been softening up opinion for the move.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: PERUVIAN'S ART SOMETIMES POWERFUL, SOMETIMES GRATUITOUS  </P> <P> Fernando de Szyszlo, Peru's best-known painter, practices an art of fusion,  melding together European and pre-Columbian motifs, abstract and figurative  styles. His current show, at the Iturralde Gallery (7592 Fay Ave.) through Dec.  13, reveals his work also to be of hybrid quality, at one moment rich and  suffused with mythical power, the next decorative and gratuitous.  </P> <P> Szyszlo, who was born in 1925, studied architecture in his native Lima before  shifting his focus to art. He lived in Paris, Florence and several American  cities sporadically throughout the 1950s and '60s, but since then has been  based primarily in Peru. His work has been collected and exhibited  internationally, and was recently seen at the San Diego Museum of Art in the  traveling exhibition "The Latin American Spirit."  </P> <P> The paintings and prints in the Iturralde show, all from the 1980s, speak in  the highly personal vocabulary of forms that Szyszlo has developed over his  40-year career. Occasionally, his shapes and patterns resonate with those found  in pre-Columbian art and architecture.  </P> <P> For instance, in each work in the series, "Mar de Lurin" (Sea of Lurin),  Szyszlo sets a blocky vertical shape before a horizontally striated background.  The vertical form vaguely suggests a human figure, but its articulated sections  also recall ancient stele and the colossal columns of Toltec temples. While the  background appears landscape-like, its undulating layers of patterns also echo  the meandering geometric ornamentation of ancient Mesoamerican temples.  </P> <P> Szyszlo's affinity with ancient cultures surfaces throughout his work, though  subtly. In "Anabase," a gouache painting on paper from the series, the artist  pictures a flat ocher plane studded with squat, pyramidal forms. A knot of hot  color and swirling shapes rushes toward these structures on the horizon with  the blind fury of an impending storm. Szyszlo may be pitting the flux and fury  of modern civilization against the solidity and permanence of the ancients in  this powerful image, just as he may be representing the classic dichotomy  between nature (the horizontal) and culture (the vertical) in his "Mar de  Lurin" series.  </P> <P> The strongest of Szyszlo's images sustain and even encourage such lofty  interpretations, but others trade this poetic tension for trite decoration, and  abandon the artist's fiery hues and ominous shadows for a palette of lipstick  pinks.  </P> <P> After a generation of hard-edged abstraction, minimalism and conceptualism,  painting has made a comeback on the American scene. Impassioned brushwork flung  itself with fervor onto gallery walls in the early '80s in the work of  neoexpressionists, while young "new image" painters and others professing a new  romanticism have breathed life into an otherwise arid artistic landscape.  </P> <P> For some artists, however, painting never died. Its potential to satisfy the  senses and nourish the spirit never even waned during the '60s and '70s.  </P> <P> Geer Morton, for one, has been frosting canvases with lush, juicy pigment for  30 years, undetered by opposing winds of taste and popularity. "East Coast,  West Coast," at the Tarbox Gallery (1202 Kettner Blvd.) through Dec. 9, joins  paintings from a short-term stay in San Diego with works from Maine and  Northern California, where the artist maintains homes.  </P> <P> Morton's work makes no intellectual claims and has no pretenses of conceptual  currency. It is refreshingly free of rhetoric, relying only on rich color,  genuine emotion and uncontrived gestures for its appeal. Morton's creamy tones  and abbreviated representational style owe much to his mentors of the '60s, Bay  Area painters Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff and David Park, but his work  feels more modest in intent. He clings to traditional themes -- landscapes,  floral still lifes, figure studies -- and seeks in earnest to capture the  fleeting light and mood of each arrangement.  </P> <P> Morton's fluid strokes have a natural affinity with their organic subjects, and  it comes as no surprise that his paintings of cities, with their blocky, static  monoliths, are the least convincing. Flowers, however, seem to continually  regenerate his painterly energy, and each arrangement maintains its  individuality and integrity. A dozen distinct brush strokes in a subtle range  of tones define a small glass vase in "Porch With Flowers," exemplifying the  artist's keen regard for even the most nondescript objects.  </P> <P> Deep ochers, teals and violets balance against shimmering whites, golds and  fleshy pinks in Morton's ceaselessly varied palette. Morton makes each canvas a  celebration of the transitory moment, for he knows that color and light never  meet the same way in the same place twice.  </P></p>

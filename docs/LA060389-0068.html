			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR'S GRIM PROSPECTS  </P> <P> The inauguration of El Salvador's President Alfredo Cristiani was a landmark in  the history of that country. For the first time, a democratically elected  civilian peacefully handed power to another democratically elected civilian, no  small accomplishment in a nation controlled for 140 years by a small landed  oligarchy and a corrupt military.  </P> <P> That said, however, there is little else positive, or even very hopeful, about  El Salvador these days. For Cristiani's ascension to the presidency marks the  final step in a campaign by the most radical elements of the Salvadoran right  wing, a notorious faction with a sordid history of violence, to take control of  a Salvadoran government that is already under siege from a fierce and  persistent Marxist insurgency. Cristiani's Nationalist Republican Alliance,  best known by its Spanish-language acronym Arena, controlled El Salvador's  courts and its legislature before his inauguration. Now Arena's grasp of power  is total.  </P> <P> That bodes trouble for the United States. For the past 10 years U.S.  policy-makers and diplomats have promoted moderate Salvadoran politicians such  as former President Jose Napoleon Duarte as alternatives to the extremists of  right and left. For a while that strategy worked. Duarte helped persuade  Congress to make El Salvador the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the Western  Hemisphere. But with Duarte out of office and likely to die of cancer soon,  there seem to be no moderate alternatives in El Salvador. That puts the  Administration in the unenviable position of sending about $1.5 million a day  to a government run by men described by some U.S. officials as neo-Nazis.  </P> <P> Cristiani, a businessman who was not among the original leaders of Arena when  the party was founded several years ago, insists that he represents a new breed  of more moderate Arena leaders. But the old hands lurk in the background,  including Roberto D'Aubuisson, the alleged godfather of El Salvador's death  squads, and Hector Antonio Regalado, whom Duarte accused of assassinating  Archbishop Oscar Romero several years ago. If recent history is any guide,  Cristiani cannot control the Arena thugs. He was forced to appoint associates  of D'Aubuisson to important security positions in the government. And when he  resisted pressure to appoint a hard-line officer as his defense minister,  Cristiani faced a near-revolt in the Salvadoran military.  </P> <P> It is hard to say which faction in El Salvador will pose the greater headache  for the United States in the coming years -- its "enemies" the rebels or its  "friends" in the government. Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front control a third of the country and have an unnerving capacity  to kill and wound security forces and sabotage the national economy. The  government now represents reactionary civilians who refer to land reform as  "U.S.-imposed socialism" and hard-line military officers who want to replace  the low-intensity warfare urged on them by U.S. advisers with all-out war on  the guerrillas.  </P> <P> With more than 60,000 people dead and 1 million refugees -- this in a nation of  only 5 million people -- El Salvador has had more than enough of war. But the  only alternative to either high-intensity or low-intensity conflict is a  revival of peace talks begun by Duarte that stalled when the severity of his  illness became known. In almost 10 years of fighting, neither side has come  close to defeating the other. Under the circumstances, it is amazing that  hard-liners on both sides think victory is possible. But if Arena and the  Salvadoran military want to pursue a scorched-earth policy to rout the FMLN,  Washington should make it clear that U.S. taxpayers won't pay the bill.  </P> <P> Rather, this county must use its leverage to downplay the war talk and push for  a renewal of the dialogue with the FMLN. Peace talks will not be easy between  two sides that have been at war so long,but there are short-term goals that  could be a starting point -- specifically, plans to "humanize" the war by  reducing the level of fighting in areas where innocent people are affected, and  beyond that the details of a possible cease-fire. Ultimately, any peace talks  must include a power-sharing arrangement between the various political  factions, a step hard-liners on both sides have resisted, but one that would  take the resolution of the divisions within Salvadoran society off the  battlefield and put it on the conference table.  </P></p>

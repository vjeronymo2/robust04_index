			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PPLM President Neves Serrano by Domingos </F> Alberto; place and date not given]    [Text] [Alberto] What is the ideological stand of the  Mozambique Liberal Progress Party [PPLM]?    [Serrano] In terms of ideology, the PPLM stands for social  democracy, based on religious communities.    [Alberto] What kind of state does the PPLM favor?    [Serrano] The PPLM is aware of a series of state theories in  existence, such as a centralized presidential system, semi-  presidential system, and anarchical and utopian systems  [anarquico utopico]. The PPLM favors the introduction of a  centalized presidential system in the country, based on  federalism, where regional governments are free to make certain  decisions connected with their regions.    [Alberto] Of the various state theories, which one do you  think is the best for Mozambique?    [Serrano] The PPLM believes that the centralized  presidential  system is the best for the country, in that it provides for the  existence of a constitutional high court which can impute the  Head of State. With this kind of state, we can avoid cases of  generalized corruption in a country like ours where civil  servants abuse power. The PPLM also stands for a strong  parliament. This is actually the tendency in democratic  countries. There is a need to separate legislative, judicial,  and executive powers to avoid abuse of power. There should be  an executive power made up of the prime minister who responds  for the government and the President of the Republic who in  general responds for political issues (state and government  issues). The other power which involves the people in general,  is the Parliament, with legislative powers. Then, there is the  Judicial power represented by the High Court....    [Alberto] With the consolidation of peace, do you think it  is  possible to gradually eliminate centralized economy in favor of  a decentralized economy?    [Serrano] The way I see things at the moment, I do not think  it is easy. I say this for one specific reason: During 16  years of war, Mozambique lived under a centralized system of  economy. It is not from one day to the next that we are going  to end this system. To resolve the problems facing the  Mozambican economy, the PPLM proposes: One, to inform donors  and other economic partners that we need money because we do not  have yet. When they are ready to assist us or cooperate with us  in any undertaking, we shall make use of our export commodities,  such as prawns, and so on....    [Alberto] What kind of economic and social system does the  PPLM advocate?    [Serrano] The PPLM advocates a free market economy, with  economic democratization and freedom, as well as the  establishment of a "joint venture" [preceding word in English]  system in certain fields, with most developed countries. This  means that the Cooperation Ministry would sign bilateral  agreements with any state. What is more, businessmen would be  free to make undertakings with their foreign partners to advance  the country's economy. This is not happening presently because  of the Government's selfishness or mismanagement.    [Alberto] What would be your government's priorities if you  would win the forthcoming free and democratic elections?    [Serrano] Among dozens of sectorial programs that the PPLM  possesses, I would first give priority to education and health,  in order to create conditions for our people's welfare. In  brief, I would concern myself with assisting our people who are  experiencing absolute misery.    [Alberto] But how would the PPLM realize this objective  under  the present conditions in the country?    [Serrano] Although the PPLM is aware that our country may  break away from the International Monetary Fund in future, there  is an urgent need to create conditions in order to renegotiate  the agreement with this interanational institution, since this  is the only way Mozambique can resolve its basic needs. The  PPLM would also encourage people to return to rural areas to  engage in subsistence agriculture. I say subsistence  agriculture because Mozambique has no funds....    [Alberto] Apart from the projects you have mentioned, what  other priorities does the PPLM have?    [Serrano] As I said earlier, among dozens of programs that  the PPLM has, we give priority to education and health. All the  same, there are other economic and social projects which are  also important. In the economic field, the PPLM is determined  to develop agriculture to make it the foundation for economic  development. The PPLM also intends to revitalize primary,  secondary, and tertiary activities, such as industry,  construction, transportation, wildlife and forests. In the  social field, the PPLM intends to establish a fiscal policy that  would rationalize and lessen the fiscal burden on the less  privileged people. In the field of labor, it wants to guarantee  employment and in the field of justice, it wants to guarantee  human rights, providing legal assistence to all citizens.    [Alberto] At present, politicians are arguing over what  system to implant in the country after elections. Some want  federalism, others a unitary state. What should be followed?    [Serrano] As far as the PPLM is concerned, both federalism  and a centralized presidential system (unitary state) are  acceptable. Let us see, federalism is defined as a political  organization where government activities are carried out both by  regional governments and the government of the Republic of the  country which is responsible for the maintenance of national  unity. Regional governments have the power and freedom to make  local decisions, for example with regard to the exploration of  resources. Many leaders think federalism signifies the  destruction of national unity. That is not true.    [Alberto] There are many parties in the national political  arena. Does the PPLM hope to ally itself to other parties to  form a coalition?    [Serrano] For the immediate future, the answer to your  question is negative. So far, the unarmed opposition parties  and even the ruling party have not yet come up with distinct  philosophies. I will not ally myself to a person or party whose  program I do not know well. The PPLM feels it is premature to  speak about this issue.    [Alberto] Elections will be held in nine months' time. Has  the PPLM already drawn up its campaign program?    [Serrano] Good question. The PPLM has a political mechanism  [preceding word in English] capable of carrying out a positive  electoral campaign, which will even surprise certain politicians.    [Alberto] Apart from the funds made available by the  government, what other financial assistance does your party  count on for the electoral campaign and other programs?    [Serrano] As far as the PPLM is concerned, the funds  promised  by the national community are secondary, because they may not  materialize. The PPLM counts on European, U.S., and Asian  partners for its finances.    [Alberto] What do you think of the confinement process until  the present date?    [Serrano] Well, I think your question is excellent, in that  you are making it at the right time. Before I answer it, I  would like to say the following, however: Apparently, it seems  as if everything is progressing smoothly. If we deeply examine  the process, we shall realize, however, that there is still a  lot of work to be done by the signatories of the General Peace  Accord, and the United Nations, particulary Mr. Aldo Ajello,  special representative of the UN secretary general in Mozambique.    [Alberto] The way the peace process is moving, do you think  it would be possible to hold the first multiparty elections this  October?    [Serrano] In my view, if the issue of funds for the unarmed  political parties is resolved in time, they would be able to  contribute to the holding of elections in October without the  shedding of blood.    [Alberto] Do you think it is easy or difficult to be the  leader of a political party in a society like ours which is in  transition to democracy?    [Serrano] My answer to your question is that in Africa we do  not have political leaders but only public power leaders, which  are two different things. Answering your question directly, I  will begin by saying that it is difficult to be a political  leader because it requires talent, drive, gift, and other  qualities.</p>

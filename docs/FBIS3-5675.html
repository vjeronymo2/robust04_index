			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The UMNO [United Nalays National Organization]  Youth Movement has urged Andrew Neil, chief editor of the SUNDAY  TIMES, to resign for straining relations between Malaysia and  Britain and causing British companies to incur huge losses as  they are no longer allowed to bid for Malaysian Government  contracts. Tan Sri Haji Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, chairman of the  UMNO Youth Movement, said it would be good for the SUNDAY TIMES  to promise not to publish baseless and untrue reports about  Malaysia to ensure that the economic interests of the two  nations are maintained. In a statement issued in Melaka, the  movement also severely criticized the provocative attitude of  the SUNDAY TIMES, which urged the British Government to  retaliate against Malaysia by freezing payments to the Pergau  hydroelectric plant project. Malaysia should be prepared for  any eventuality, in case the British Government is really forced  to bow to the wishes and pressure of the SUNDAY TIMES which led  to the Malaysian Government's decision not to award government  contracts to British companies.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Minebea profits plunge 45% MINEBEA, Japan's leading miniature bearing maker, yesterday announced a sharp fall in non-consolidated earnings for the six months to March. Pre-tax profits fell 45 per cent from the previous year to Y4bn (Dollars 30m) on a 3.3 per cent decline in overall sales to Y98.2bn. After-tax profits fell 51 per cent to Y2.1bn. Sales of bearings, the company's main profit earner, fell 6.5 per cent to Y27.1bn, because of slumping overseas demand. Sales of electronic equipment and components, manufactured mainly in Thailand, rose 7.4 per cent to Y48.1bn. Minebea's financial balance declined 65 per cent to Y688m because of a 53 per cent fall in interest income. The company said orders for electronic equipment and parts such as precision motors, keyboards and floppy disk drives, have been rising. However, profitability for such products remains poor. Minebea expects an improvement in the current six months. It is forecasting a 36.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y9.5bn for 1991-92 as a whole, on sales little changed at Y207bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikola Hrynyavitski: "Kebich Restored the </F> Secrecy Regime Which Existed in Former Soviet Union"]    [Text] On 19 April, V. Kebich signed a secret Cabinet of  Ministers resolution "On Ensuring the Secrecy Regime on the  Territory of the Belarusian Republic." Through unofficial  sources, SVABODA has secured a copy of this document. We quote:  "The Cabinet of Ministers resolves that before the Supreme  Soviet, a legal act regulating issues related to protecting  state secrets, government institutions, organizations, and  economic entities should comply with instructions on ensuring  the secrecy regime in ministries, institutions, enterprises, and  organizations of the USSR, approved by the USSR Council of  Ministers on 12 May 1987."    We know that the Cabinet of Ministers tried but failed to  draft its own instructions. It is not clear whether the reason  was shortage of time or brains... So they decided to reinstate  the Soviet secrecy regime, which was proven by practice.    According to a SVABODA correspondent, this 60-page document  was written by Comrade Kryuchkov, former chief of the Soviet  KGB. The document is perfect. In compliance with it,  information on, for example, the aftermath of the Chernobyl  disaster was kept secret.</p>

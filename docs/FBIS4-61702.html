			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has already reported that the Central  Electoral Commission on 5 May registered Larysa Skoryk,  Nationwide Movement of Ukraine leader, as a contender for the  Ukrainian presidential candidacy. Interviewed by a UNIAN  correspondent on 6 May, she said that that report was outdated  as she had submitted an application to the Central Electoral  Commission for her candidacy to be withdrawn. "I was nominated  when Leonid Kravchuk had not yet decided to take part in the  presidential election. When that happened, I wrote a letter  declining to run," she said. In Larysa Skoryk's words, she did  not expect to win but wanted "to spoil a little bit the mood of  such contenders as Leonid Kuchma." Larysa Skoryk said that in  the event of the presidential election being held, the  Nationwide Movement of Ukraine would back Leonid Kravchuk "who  will undoubtedly gather 100,000 in his support." The  organization led by her has taken part in the collection of  these signatures.    UNIAN has been informed by the Central Electoral Commission  that Larysa Skoryk's application for the withdrawal of her  candidacy was dated 5 May. She received forms to collect  signatures in her support on the same day.</p>

In a news conference after the meeting, Demirel commented on  his contacts. The president reported that during his contacts  he explained that it is essential to reorganize Europe following  the dissolution of the Soviet Union and that East European  countries should be included especially in organizations such as  NATO and the EC. Noting that he also stressed Turkey's  importance for the EC, Demirel said Europe can stretch as far as  Central Asia and China using Turkey as a bridge. He remarked  that oil and natural gas from Central Asia will be transported  to the Mediterranean via Turkey and underlined that Turkey will  become an energy terminal in the future.    Answering a question on the air operation launched against  the Zhalah camp, Demirel explained that the operation was  conducted after long investigation. He declared that Zhalah had  replaced the al-Biqa' Valley and 2,000 terrorists were sheltered  in the camp. Great care was taken not to hurt women and  children, Demirel added.    Demirel will continue his contacts and bilateral meetings in  Davos today as well.</p>

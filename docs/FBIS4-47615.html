			<p>SUMMARY                                           When the Ukrainian government at tempted to merge units inherited  from the former USSR's Air Force and Air Defense Forces into a  single service arm, it encountered potent opposition from  officers of both services, illustrating that the officers' sense  of service identity and concern to protect their traditional  military missions have carried over into Ukrainian politics as  potent forces.  Although the government retreated partially on  the merger, postponing it at least until 1996, the government and  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, in particular, seem  determined to assert their authority over the services and  eventually to force the merger through.  The dispute over the  merger is taking place against a background of military  dissatisfaction over a wide range of issues, including budget  shortfalls that the government is unlikely to be able to relieve,  making further conflict between the government and the officers  probable.                                       END SUMMARY     The officers waged a dogged struggle against the government's  intention to merge units of the Air Force and Air Defense Forces-  -separate services under the Soviet regime--into a single service  arm.  On 6 December 1991, the Supreme Council approved a Law on  the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which specified that the armed forces  would consist of three services: ground forces, a navy, and a  single "Air Force (Airspace Defense Troops)" [footnote: In both  Russian and Ukrainian, the term "airspace defense" (oborona  vozdushnogo prostranstva/oborona povitryanoho prostoru) clearly  refers only to territorial airspace, and not to outer space.]  (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 January 1994).  Perhaps in deference to to  military opposition, the government was extremely dilatory both  in implementing the merger and in publicly making the case for  it.  Volodymyr Antonets, an Air Force major general, spent  several months in 1992 drafting a plan to implement the merger  (Narodnaya Armiya, 31 July 1992; Holos Ukrayiny, 4 August 1992);  subsequent press reports identified him as the initiator of the  idea for the merger (Krasnaya Zvezda, 6 February 1993 and 4 March  1994; Kievskiye Vedomosti, 23 February 1994).  However, while  Antonets was working on the merger implementation plan, President  Leonid Kravchuk issued a decree on military organization which  listed the Air Force and Air Defense Forces as separate services  (Narodnaya Armiya, 20 May 1992) and appointed separate Air Force  and Air Defense Forces commanders, Valeriy Vasylyev (Pravda  Ukrayiny, 6 May 1992) and Mykhaylo Lopatin (Narodnaya Armiya, 6  June 1992).     Military Opposition to Merger     From the beginning, there was clearly strong opposition within  the military to the merger.  Only days after the text of the Law  on the Armed Forces was published, Armed Forces First Deputy  Chief of Staff Georgiy Zhivitsa told an interviewer that Ukraine  would have separate Air and Air Defense Forces (Narodnaya Armiya,  10 January 1992).  Shortly after his appointment as Air Force  commander, Vasylyev openly opposed the merger, telling an  interviewer that the two services had sharply different functions  and that the combined service would give short shrift to the Air  Force's function of carrying the war to an aggressor's rear areas  and home bases, a function which he said Soviet experience in  World War II and Afghanistan had shown to be crucial.  Vasylyev  also called for the adoption of special emblems and other  measures to enhance the Air Force's sense of group identity, and  made a rather plaintive plea for the government to be more  "solicitous" of the Air Force's needs in general (Narodnaya  Armiya, 2 June 1992).     Shortly thereafter, Vasylyev's fears were indirectly  substantiated in an article by the Air Defense Forces chief of  staff, Vladimir Tkachev.  Tkachev seemed to envisage the merger  as, in effect, absorption of the Air Force by the Air Defense  Forces.  He argued that a Soviet-style, offensively oriented Air  Force was inappropriate to independent Ukraine's purely defensive  military strategy.  He predicted that, in the new combined air  service, some of the Air Force regiments inherited from the  Soviet Union would be disbanded and the remaining ones assigned  to air defense tasks (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992).  Air  Defense Forces Commander Lopatin, however, was reported to oppose  the merger on grounds mirroring Vasylyev's:  He feared that the  combined service would in wartime concentrate its assets on the  defense of military forces in the field, ignoring the Air Defense  Forces' central mission of protecting Ukrainian cities and  industrial centers against enemy air attack.  Adding a note of  national pride to the dispute, Lopatin also deprecated "blind  copying" of Western military organizational models (Narodnaya  Armiya, 31 July 1992).     Delayed Efforts To Implement Merger     The government persisted in its efforts to carry out the merger,  although high level opposition within the military evidently  slowed its progress.  A year after the Law on the Armed Services  was enacted, Kravchuk finally appointed Antonets the first  commander of the new combined Air Force (Airspace Defense Troops)  in January 1993 (Holos Ukrayiny, 20 February 1993), with Vasylyev  and Lopatin as his deputies for aviation and air defense,  respectively (ITAR-TASS, 17 February 1993).  The Defense Ministry  leadership also at last began to publicly answer critics of the  merger.  Lyubomir Petriv, the new combined Air Force's first  deputy chief of staff for aviation, assured an interviewer that  the new service would adequately fulfill both air defense and  offensive air combat functions.  He also argued that "world  experience" showed that air superiority in wartime could be  achieved only by the coordination of air defense and offensive  operations which the merger would make possible (Demokratychna  Ukrayina, 4 March 1993).     Opposition Intensifies     Six months after Antonets' appointment as combined Air Force  commander, Petriv told an interviewer that unnamed officers, in  both branches of the new service, were organizing to oppose the  merger.  He accused them of being unpatriotic and said that they  were opposing the merger because, by consolidating redundant  command structures, it would eliminate a "considerable number" of  jobs.  He concluded by calling on them to set aside "parochial  departmental or service ambitions" (Golos Ukrainy, 8 July 1993).  On 29 July 1993, UNIAN reported that Defense Ministry  "discussion" of the merger--supposedly policy since December  1991--had only just begun and that Armed Forces Chief of Staff  Anatoliy Lopata was opposed to it.  Furthermore, UNIAN reported,  Antonets was complaining that "military leaders" were  "sabotaging" his directives.  In October, Supreme Council member  Ihor Derkach claimed that the merger was going so slowly because  Kravchuk was unable to control the military (Moloda Halychyna, 23  October 1993).     Merger Called Off     Toward the end of 1993, the Defense Ministry appeared to  retreating.  Although in October, the newly-appointed minister,  Vitaliy Radetskyy, endorsed the merger (Narodna Armiya, 28  October 1993), the next month Lopata told an interviewer that the  merger, while still on track, would take place only "after  diligent study and substantiation, and without any haste  whatsoever" (Narodna Armiya, 23 November 1993).  Finally, in  December Radetskyy "suspended" the merger and reduced the  combined Air Force staff from 180 to 40 officers, whose only  function would be to prepare a "feasibility study" on the merger.  Radetskyy reportedly based the suspension on an earlier decree by  President Kravchuk (UNIAN, 21 December 1993; Narodna Armiya, 25  February 1994).  Plans for the Air Force/Air Defense Forces  merger were "premature," Radetskyy subsequently said, and they  would be carried out eventually, but not earlier than 1996 (Holos  Ukrayiny, 20 January 1994; Ukrayinska Hazeta, 20 January-2  February 1994; Kiev radio, 25 February 1994).  The postponement  may have been a larger concession than Radetskyy was willing to  admit.  In his 8 July 1993 Golos Ukrainy interview, Petriv had  claimed that opponents of the merger hoped that, if it could be  stalled until 1996, the separate service command structures would  by that time be so entrenched as to make the merger impossible.     Military Targets Antonets     Two months after Radetskyy suspended the merger, Kravchuk  outraged Air Force officers by appointing Antonets as Air Force  commander in place of Vasylyev, who was placed "at the disposal  of the defense minister pending future assignment" (Narodna  Armiya, 22 February 1994; Kiev TV, 24 February 1994). [footnote:  At the same time, Kravchuk gave Lopatin back his old job as  commander of the separate Air Defense Forces (Narodna Armiya, 22  February 1994).]  Seven senior Air Force generals, including the  entire Air Force Military Council, reportedly refused to serve  under Antonets and threatened to resign from the service unless  his appointment was rescinded (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 23 February,  2 March 1994; Narodna Armiya, 25 February 1994).  [footnote:  Ukrainian media have not been observed to identify all seven of  the generals.  Kievskiye Vedomosti on 2 March 1994 listed five of  them: Vasylyev, Air Force Deputy Commander Ya. Skalko, V.  Varyvoda, and N. Morokhovets--all Air Force Military Council  members--and Gennadiy Kolodiy, commander of the 17th Air Army.]  Ukrainian and Russian press reports attributed the generals'  antipathy toward Antonets to his role in the merger plan, to his  active role in the Ukrainian Officers Union (UOU) (See box), and  to charges that Antonets was using political connections to  displace a respected professional officer.  (Post-Postup, 2  December 1993; Kievskiye Vedomosti, 2 March 1994; Krasnaya  Zvezda, 4 March 1994; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 17 March 1994).  The  military newspaper Narodna Armiya wrote that the seven generals'  feelings were widely shared among Air Force officers (25 February  1994).  The Russian newspaper Kommersant-Daily commented that the  incident was symptomatic of military unhappiness with the  government over a wide range of issues (25 February 1994).  Radetskyy Seeks To Soothe Feelings, Assert Authority     Radetskyy responded to the resignation threat by trying to  address the officers' concerns while simultaneously reasserting  government authority over the military and defending Antonets.  He promptly led a delegation of top Defense Ministry officials to  Air Force headquarters in Vinnytsya, where he "presented"  Antonets to his subordinates and reminded the officers that  presidential appointments were not subject to discussion by  military officers.  During his visit, Radetskyy also fielded  questions from Air Force officers, as well as from officers of  the Vinnytsya-based 43rd Missile Army, on a wide range of issues  and promised to deal with their concerns in such areas as  shortages of fuel and spare parts and problems in discipline,  combat readiness, safety, and living conditions.  He also  promised the missile officers that their careers would not suffer  as a result of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament (Narodna Armiya, 25  February 1994; Kiev TV, 24 February 1994; Holos Ukrayiny, 26  February 1994).  The generals were apparently persuaded to  withdraw their resignation threat, at least for the time being  (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 2 March 1994; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 17 March  1994).  Radetskyy also reportedly showed his confidence in  Antonets by including him in a high-level group to deal with the  crisis in Crimea (ITAR-TASS, 5 April 1994).  Deputy Defense  Minister Ivan Bizhan also defended Antonets and confronted  Vasylyev's supporters, saying that Vasylyev was removed from  command of the Air Force for incompetence (Kiev radio, 6 April  1994; Narodna Armiya, 6 April 1994).     Unrest in Military Widespread     The Ukrainian military's grievances against the government are  long-standing and cover a wide range of issues, as evidenced by  Vasylyev's plea for more support in his 2 June 1992 Narodnaya  Armiya interview and by the questions which officers posed to  Radetskyy during his trip to Vinnytsya.  There have been other  recent manifestations of military unhappiness with the  government:     -- A Narodna Armiya correspondent, Lieutenant Colonel Nykyfor  Lysitsya, complained in an 18 December 1993 article that cutbacks  in flight training as a result of fuel shortages had seriously  degraded Air Force pilots' combat skills.  0n 21 February 1994,  UNIAN reported that all Air Force combat training flights had  been suspended for lack of fuel.     -- On 21 February 1994 UNIAN reported that soldiers of a combined  arms division stationed near Odesa and an Air Force regiment in  Ivano-Frankivsk had gone on strike because they had not been  paid.  UNIAN also reported that officers at the Kiev Military  Control and Communication Institute were circulating leaflets  protesting poor living conditions.     -- An Air Force regiment in Chernihiv protested to President  Kravchuk over shortages of fuel and other supplies, claiming that  money was being wasted on non-essential items (Kievskiye  Vedomosti, 2 March 1994).     -- A military columnist, Colonel Mykola Bilovil, published a  scathing personal attack on Radetskyy, saying that the defense  minister was lavishing luxuries on himself while the troops  lacked basic personal and operational necessities (Ukrayinska  Hazeta, 31 March-13 April 1994).     Outlook     The two services' success in blocking--even if only temporarily-  -the planned Air Force/Air Defense Forces merger marks their  emergence as a political force to be reckoned with, with a sense  of their own institutional identity and interests and the power  to defend those interests.  Their success evidently emboldened  officers to press their perceived advantage by seeking to block  Antonets' appointment as Air Force commander.  However, their  failure to do so indicates the limits of their power for the  moment as well as the government's determination to resist making  any more concessions.  Ukraine's near-catastrophic economic  situation will probably make it impossible for the government to  assuage officers' discontent over other issues such as military  pay and supplies, thus setting the stage for further conflict.  The alliance--perhaps of convenience--between Radetskyy and a UOU  activist like Antonets suggests that the defense minister may now  see the development of the armed services into entrenched  interest groups along service lines as a greater threat to his  authority than the UOU's attempts to influence military policy,  attempts he has previously opposed.     Box     Biographic Information on Antonets     Volodymyr Mykhaylovych Antonets is a career Air Force officer as  well as a long-time activist in the Union of Officers of Ukraine  (UOU).  In February 1992 he was a major general of aviation and  commander of aviation for the Carpathian Military District  (Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 February l992), and was then appointed  commander of the 14th Air Army (Narodnaya Armiya, 21 March 1992).  At a session of of the UOU oblast chairmen's coordinating  committee, he spoke against acceptance into the armed forces of  officers whose loyalty to Ukraine he considered suspect  (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 May 1992; Krasnaya Zvezda, 10 June 1992).  In a round table sponsored by Narodnaya Armiya, he defended the  UOU's then-prominent role in military reorganization (13 June  1992).  Critics of the UOU have accused Antonets of organizing  medical treatment, on the UOU's behalf, for members of the  underground armed Ukrainian Self-Defense (UNSO) organization  (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993; Krasnaya Zvezda, 4 March  1994).  On at least two occasions, Antonets has spoken publicly  against Ukraine's nuclear disarmament (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 20  February 1992; Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 February 1992).  In 1992,  Antonets drafted a plan to implement the merger of the Air Force  and Air Defense Forces, which the Supreme Council had decided on  in December 1991 (Narodnaya Armiya, 31 July 1992; Holos Ukrayiny,  4 August 1992).  In January 1993, President Kravchuk promoted him  to lieutenant general and appointed him commander of a new  service arm combining the Air Force and the Air Defense Forces  (Holos Ukrayiny, 20 February 1993).  After the merger of the two  services was called off, Kravchuk appointed him commander of the  Air Force (Narodnaya Armiya, 22 February 1994).     End of Box     (AUTHOR:  O'LEARY.

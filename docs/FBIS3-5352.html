This is part of Japan's undisguised intention to produce  nuclear weapons any time by securing large quantities of  plutonium by itself, and thus become a nuclear power.    The annual capacity of Japan's reprocessing factories is 800  tons, largest in the world. Japan has reportedly stockpiled 26  tons of plutonium and will secure 100 tons by 2010. This amount  is enough to make far more than 10,000 nuclear bombs.    Japan, which has already been possessed of electronic  destructive device and other devices and technology of nuclear  bombs, developed in February this year even long-range, large  roket H-2 which can be used as inter-continental ballistic  missile.    The facts show that Japan's nuclear armament has reached a  danger line.    With the nuclear armament being accelerated in real earnest  in Japan, a neighbour of the Korean peninsula, we cannot but  cope with such a situation with vigilance.    The accelerated nuclear armament of Japan throws a snag in  the way of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    The Japanese reactionaries must give up their criminal  nuclear design, clearly mindful of the grave consequences to be  entailed by their moves to turn Japan into a nuclear power.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10: GARDENING BOOKS;  </P> <P> THIS LIST MAY PLANT SOME IDEAS FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS  </P> <P> The perfect gift for a gardener might be a gardening book, but not just any  book. Though there are hundreds of books on gardening, many, if not most, are  inappropriate for gardeners living in California.  </P> <P> Our climates and soils are different from those on the East Coast, and, more  importantly, from those in England, where most gardens books are authored. Some  of these might as well be written in a foreign tongue -- they talk about things  such as "liming the soil" (which would have disastrous results in California)  or "hardiness" (ability of a plant to survive the bitter cold of an Eastern  winter).  </P> <P> They rarely address some of the biggest problems of California gardeners, such  as irrigation or how much water a plant needs. And some of our best plants,  such as gazanias and agapanthus, are not included in their lists of the best.  Instead you'll find peonies and lilacs, poor choices for a California garden.  </P> <P> So a list of the best garden books for Californians must begin with books  written in California. These may not be the best of garden literature, or the  prettiest, but they offer sound and useful advice, and any photographs will  picture plants we can actually grow.  </P> <P> "Sunset Western Garden Book," Joseph F. Williamson, Editor (Lane Publishing,  Menlo Park: $22.95). This may be old news for experienced gardeners, but the  "Western Garden Book" is the bible of California gardening, used by  professionals including landscape architects and nurserymen, though designed  for the home gardener. Even experienced gardeners may not know that there is a  new (fifth) edition, published in 1988, which includes many additional plants  and some new cultural information.  </P> <P> For instance, though it may not seem as if there could be any new way to dig a  hole, there is, according to the fifth edition, and it is radically different  at that.  </P> <P> The front of the book is full of precise and pithy garden culture, with  sections on soils, planting techniques, watering, fertilizers, pruning,  propagating, tools, pests and diseases, and weeds. There are charts listing  plants best suited to a particular job -- the best plants for shade, the best  ground covers for a slope, or the best trees for a patio, for instance.  </P> <P> The key to this book, however, is the map up front, which divides Southern  California (and the rest of the West) into various climate zones. Detailed  enough to divide Santa Monica into two zones, the map helps explain the  differences between gardening in the San Fernando Valley and the L.A. basin, at  the beach or in the mountains, and even the high desert.  </P> <P> The rest of the book is a big plant encyclopedia. After each plant it shows the  zone for which it is most appropriate, as well as a description, small drawing  and information on how to grow it. The fifth edition also tells something about  each plant's water needs.  </P> <P> "Western Home Landscaping," by Ken Smith (HPBooks, Tucson: $10.95). This picks  up where the Western Garden Book leaves off -- explaining in clear language how  to put a landscape together, from soil preparation to laying bricks, building  fences and patios, lawns, irrigation and the like. There are plans and plenty  of photos, and the author even estimates what the costs might be. Ken Smith is  a practicing landscape architect in Southern California, so the information is  especially appropriate. He is also one of the pioneers of drought-resistant  landscaping, and the book addresses this timely subject.  </P> <P> "Designing and Maintaining Your Edible Landscape Naturally," by Robert Kourik  (Matamorphic Press, Santa Rosa: $16.95). This is the definitive work on growing  fruits and vegetables, and it leaves no stone unturned. This is not a casual  work; thoroughly researched and thought out, it shows the author's years of  experience in California. Not many pretty pictures, but lots of charts, plans,  graphs, drawings and other meaty stuff for the serious (and even scientific)  gardener.  </P> <P> "The Principles of Gardening," by Hugh Johnson (Simon &amp; Schuster, New York:  $17.95). This is an English coffeetable book -- now available in paperback --  that is so insightful (and so wonderfully written) that many use it as a  textbook in gardening classes. It is neatly divided into two-page sections that  can be digested along with a morning sweet roll or evening snack. Sections on  garden paths, hedges and color tactics are especially useful. Many plants are  also listed, but this information is very English and not terribly helpful for  Californians. Lots of pretty pictures.  </P> <P> "Trees and Shrubs for Dry California Landscape," by Bob Perry (Land Design  Publishing, San Dimas: $22.50) and "Trees and Shrubs for Temperate Climates,"  by Gordon Courtright (Timber Press, Portland: $45) are two books full of color  photographs of plants we can grow (both authors are Californians). They're not  spectacular photos but very useful because you can quickly see how big a plant  gets, what shape it grows into and what color the foliage and flowers are.  There are also descriptions of each plant. These books are especially useful  for those trying to plan a garden, or those trying to identify something  already growing in the garden.  </P> <P> "Tropicals," by Gordon Courtright (Timber Press, Portland: $35.95) is a new  photo reference (the author calls it a "visual dictionary") that illustrates  and describes all those plants that are tropical in appearance, if not in fact.  We can grow most of these, but because they are so seldom shown in gardening  books, they are not often considered when it comes time to pick a palette of  plants for the garden.  </P> <P> "The American Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Garden Plants," Christopher  Brickell, Editor (Macmillan, New York: $49.95). This is a brand-new book  containing about 4,000 color photographs of garden plants. Not all will grow in  California, so check the "Western Garden Book" before becoming too attached to  any one plant. The true value of this book is in its sheer size and the way all  the plants are arranged -- first by type (large shrubs, perennials, etc.), then  by color of the flowers -- which makes it most useful for planning and  reference.  </P> <P> "Color in Your Garden," by Penelope Hobhouse (Little, Brown, Boston: $35). By  England's most prolific garden writer, this elegant and beautifully illustrated  book is also just about the only one on the subject of using color in the  garden, a tricky task. Much thought has gone into her discussions of why blue  flowers look best here, or red flowers there. Although you may never be  completely satisfied with color schemes, this book will help you make more  intelligent decisions.  </P> <P> "Garden Style," by Penelope Hobhouse (Little, Brown, Boston: $40.). Inspiration  will be your chief benefit from this gorgeous coffeetable book. While the  information may not be useful for Californians, the book contains a great  variety of photographs -- from extremely formal gardens to completely natural  schemes. For those looking for landscape ideas, or simply for a kick in the  pants that gets them outside and into the garden, this is the ticket.  </P> <P> Good garden books are not always easy to find; one garden-book specialist is  V.L.T. Gardner, mail order or by appointment, on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  Phone (213) 541-1372.  </P></p>

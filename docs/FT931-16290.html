			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on arbitrage selling FUTURES-linked arbitrage selling gave a downward impetus to Tokyo share prices in another day of quiet trading, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended at 16,782.88, down 59.70 from Tuesday's close. The index followed the previous day's pattern, reaching a high of 16,862.45 in early trading before selling by arbitrageurs pushed it to a low of 16,650.35 in the afternoon. The market rallied shortly before the close. Declining stocks outnumbered rises by 569 to 347, with 179 issues unchanged. Volume remained low, at an estimated 170m shares against Tuesday's 167m. The Topix index of all first section shares dipped 6.26 to 1,291.87. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.70 to 1,054.25. Brokers expect trading to remain quiet for the rest of this week, with no important economic data announcements scheduled which could provide impetus to a lacklustre market. 'Most of us are still waiting for the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan to show their hands,' said Mr Brian Tobin of SG Warburg. 'A lot of people were expecting there would be an interest rate cut by the end of 1992.' Construction, heavy industry and foods issues led a decline in most sectors, with only a few stocks backed by specific buying incentives. Brokers said some issues, such as Nintendo and Sega, which traditionally had a year-end run were still holding up well, because their profitability stood out in contrast to other companies. Isuzu Motors kept its position as the most actively traded stock for the third consecutive day, easing back Y9 to Y329 after recent strong gains on expectations of restructuring. Other motors closed mostly lower after Tuesday's news that new vehicle registrations in Japan fell by 7.2 per cent last year. Nissan Motor declined Y12 to Y550 and Toyota Motor and Honda Motor each slipped Y10 to Y,1440 and Y1,310 respectively. Asics, the sporting goods company, was the day's biggest loser, dropping Y43 to Y420 after announcing a 55 per cent year-on-year decline in pre-tax profits. Dowa Mining gained Y14 at Y544 in volume of 2.6m shares on reports of its successful development of superconductive thin films. Fujitsu General, the consumer electronics affiliate of Fujitsu, was traded heavily for a second day on news that it is to handle production of Fujitsu's new home-use multi-media device. Late profit-taking left Fujitsu General down Y3 at Y464. In Osaka the OSE average finished 30.62 down at 18,393.98 in volume of 58m shares. Roundup THE REGION saw mixed performances yesterday. HONG KONG ended higher in moderate trading, helped by expectations of renewed institutional buying in the new year and the suspension of trading in CITIC Pacific amid rumours that it was about to make a HKDollars 7bn placement to buy a 10 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecom held by its Beijing parent. The Hang Seng index put on 38.64 at 5,586.67 as turnover improved further to HKDollars 2.02bn from HKDollars 1.71bn. HSBC Holdings topped the actives list and jumped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 57, followed by its Hang Seng Bank unit, which gained 50 cents at HKDollars 53.50, and HK Telecom, up 5 cents at HKDollars 9.70. TAIWAN closed at a 26-month low on poor economic data and political worries. The weighted index fell 153.74, or 4.6 per cent, to 3,188.44 in moderate turnover of TDollars 10.75bn. The data revealed that the country's trade surplus had shrunk to an eight-year low while the average annual inflation rate had reached an 11-year high in 1992. SINGAPORE suffered from profit-taking after sharp gains on Tuesday. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.13 to 1,558.22 in volume of 149m shares. Foreign shares of SIA, OCBC, DBS and UOB topped the list of losers, eaching falling between 40 and 20 cents. SEOUL finished easier as large-capitalisation shares lost momentum. The composite index was 2.39 lower at 688.40 in turnover of Won677.34bn, against Won667.62bn. BANGKOK saw heavy buying of banks in the afternoon, boosting the stock index to a close above the 900 level for the first time since authorities filed share manipulation charges against a leading investor in November. The SET index rose 13.20, or 1.5 per cent, to 904.11 in active turnover of Bt9.92bn. MANILA was lifted by the oil sector and the composite index moved up 2.81 to 1,277.42 in turnover of some 236m pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone lost 5 pesos to 875 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR showed some improvement on bargain hunting. The composite index rose 2.77 to 633.66 in volume of 74m shares. Multi-Purpose Holdings group shares led the gains as Multi-Purpose added 12 cents at MDollars 1.82 with 7.6m shares traded. AUSTRALIA fell back on profit-taking before the release of November balance of payments data. The All Ordinaries index lost 22.7 to 1,542.1 in turnover of ADollars 276.3m. News Corp weakened 80 cents to ADollars 28.60 on news that the head of its Fox Broadcasting unit in the US had resigned.

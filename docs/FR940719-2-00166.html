			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The GATT Contracting Parties have established Working Parties to examine the requests by Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine to accede to the General Agreement pursuant to Article XXXIII of that Agreement. The Working Parties for the accessions of Bulgaria and Mongolia are well advanced in their work, while those for Russia and the Ukraine were only recently established and have not yet met. These Working Parties, composed of interested GATT members, examine applicant countries' foreign trade regimes during the course of several meetings and ultimately submit to the GATT Council recommendations that may include a draft Protocol of Accession and a schedule of tariff and nontariff concessions. There is no established timetable for the accession process. The United States will be a major participant in these deliberations, and will engage in bilateral negotiations with all four countries to develop the terms of each country's accession to the General Agreement and to the WTO. These terms will be contained in a Protocol package that will include Protocol commitments and schedules addressing market access issues in agriculture and in non-agricultural goods. The Protocol package could also include a schedule of commitments in services and additional commitments on internal supports and export subsidies in agriculture required by WTO provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Protocol of Accession that each country negotiates with the GATT Contracting Parties will set forth the agreed terms of membership in the GATT and the WTO, based on the relationship of the foreign trade regime of each country to the Articles of the General Agreement and the WTO. Aspects of the foreign trade regime that are normally examined in such negotiations include: application of most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment to imports from other GATT contracting parties, licensing requirements, quantitative trade restrictions, subsidy practices as they affect trade, non-tariff charges and taxes, customs valuation and classification procedures, transparency in trade regulation and administration, and state trading practices and monopolies. The Working Party will want to receive information from each of the four countries concerning trade in services, intellectual property protection, trade-related investment measures, agricultural supports and subsidies, and sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as part of the accession process, each of these countries will conduct bilateral negotiations with interested GATT members to formulate schedules of tariff and non-tariff concessions in agriculture, goods, and services that will become part of the terms of GATT/WTO accession contained in the Protocol package. These concessions will consist of agreement by the acceding countries to bind against increase the tariff and non-tariff terms of market access applied to certain imports. Such concessions restrict their ability to block trade though non-tariff means or to increase the tariff rate applied to those items without offering appropriate compensatory tariff concessions on other items. The rates of duty and other conditions of market access for agriculture, goods, and services negotiated bilaterally, as well as all the other protections of GATT Articles and the WTO, will apply to the trade of all other GATT contracting parties and WTO members with whom these countries have GATT/WTO relations after accession or with whom they have other Most-Favored-Nation agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a member of the GATT/WTO, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine will enjoy a multilateral guarantee of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment from countries with which they have GATT relations that is more comprehensive than that available through bilateral agreements. The bindings on tariffs and certain nontariff measures maintained in the schedules of other members of the GATT and the WTO that have formal GATT/WTO relations with these four countries will be extended to their exports as obligations, first under the GATT, and potentially under the WTO. They will also have recourse to GATT/WTO procedures to protect themselves from unfair or unreasonable trade actions by these countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In return for these benefits, each country acceding to GATT/WTO will be expected to grant similar benefits to the trade of other GATT/WTO members, to conduct its trade policies in accordance with the rules set out in the General Agreement and the WTO, and to establish its own schedules of tariff and non-tariff commitments and concessions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 15 CFR 2002.2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Frederick L.

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / France unveils plans to spend 'Balladur bond' THE FRENCH government yesterday unveiled plans to use the FF70bn (Pounds 7.9bn) windfall from its successful 'Balladur bond' issue to provide funds for business and to invest in regional schools and colleges. The bond, designed to bridge the gap between current public expenditure and future revenues from the government's privatisation programme, raised about FFr110bn, almost three times the original target when the offer closed earlier this month. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, said that the government had decided to use FFr35bn, half the surplus, to eliminate a one-month delay in the repayment of value added tax refunds to companies. This will represent a substantial boost to corporate cashflow without increasing the government's budget deficit, which is forecast to reach about FFr317bn this year. The move is intended to ease companies' short-term financial pressures due to the French recession. Mr Sarkozy said that 97 per cent of French companies owed VAT refunds - about 2.4m companies - would be repaid in full this year. According to Mr Sarkozy, a further FFr20bn of the bond surplus would be used to fund a jobs and investment package early next year. These funds will be incorporated in the government's 1994 budget plan, due to be completed in September. As with the FFr40bn initially budgeted in the Balladur bond, these funds are expected to be used for public works and construction projects. In the meantime the government plans to use FFr8bn of the surplus to provide subsidised loans to local government for the renovation of schools and colleges. The education ministry said this initiative was also intended to help create jobs in the construction industry. Security measures will also be improved in French schools. Local authorities will also receive an additional FFr7bn for youth training schemes. The French right was fiercely critical of the Socialist government's youth training programmes, but has expanded the schemes since taking power in the March elections. The government also said it will raise 'return to school' payments to help low-income families.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An individual suggested that reclassification was premature because the Service's definition of viability is based on the population's reproductive status as opposed to a stem count and reproductive status. However, the Service's definition of a viable population for this species includes both stem counts (geometric mean of 20 plants over a 3-year period) and reproductive status of the population (25 percent of the population must have flowering individuals). Therefore, the Service believes the definition for viable populations requires both constancy of stem emergence and reproduction, and provides for the best possible determination given current life history information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another comment questioned the Service's standard of an average of 20 stems over a 10-year period for a viable population. The individual suggested that the majority of extant populations be monitored for 10 years prior to determining the viability for all populations with 20 stems or more. The Service assumes that the commenter is referring to the delisting criteria. The stated recovery criteria are based on the best scientific and professional judgment available and were given public review during the revision of the recovery plan in 1992. No comments were received at that time opposing the criteria. Furthermore, the majority of populations averaging 20 or more stems have been monitored periodically for close to 10 years or since their discovery. Waiting to reclassify this species until such time as 10 years have passed for all sites with 20 stems or more would delay reclassification indefinitely, given that new populations continue to be discovered. The Service believes that the reclassification criteria are sufficiently protective and adequately define viability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also interpreted the Service's recovery strategy to include habitat management and questioned its inclusion given the lack of information on appropriate and successful management. While it is true that habitat management strategies currently have not been developed, the Service believes that the potential for habitat management may exist. Habitat management will only be an aspect of the recovery strategy should it be deemed a useful tool. The proposed rule did not mean to imply that this was a given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service was requested to consider reclassifying the species in a section of its range. The Act does not provide for the separate listing or reclassification of plant populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters questioned the protection afforded threatened plants under the Act. The Service does not believe that protection will be significantly lessened by reclassification to threatened. The protection given to this threatened species under sections 7 and 9 of the Act is essentially the same as when listed as endangered. The only exception to future protection is the exemption given to seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plants. Cultivated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> seeds will be exempt from the trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. However, retention of threatened status reflects the Service's awareness that threats continue to exist for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> though it is no longer in immediate danger of extinction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should be reclassified as a threatened species. Procedures found in section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations implementing the listing provisions of the Act (50 CFR part 424) for reclassifying species on the Federal lists were followed. A species may be listed or reclassified as threatened or endangered due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Pursh) Raf. (small whorled pogonia) are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following the listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as endangered, recovery activities carried out by Federal and State agencies, private organizations, and the academic community resulted in the discovery of many new sites. The number of extant sites has more than tripled in the 11 years since the orchid was listed, with approximately 48 percent of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I. medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> sites afforded some level of protection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and its habitat continue to be vulnerable to development pressures throughout its range. With the exception of a few States, the upland habitat in which it is found receives limited protection through State or Federal regulatory means when occurring on private land. Residential and commercial development, both directly and indirectly, are primarily responsible for the destruction of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Isotria medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> habitat. Of the 104 extant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> I. medeoloides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> sites, 2 States, Maine and New Hampshire, account for 57 percent (59 sites) of all of the known sites. Only 15 of the 59 sites in these 2 States are protected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

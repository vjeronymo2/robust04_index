			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MORE LAUGHS: Sen. Alan Cranston's move to placate victims of the Lincoln  S&amp;L collapse (D1) is good news for comedian Jay Leno, above, who has been  mining jokes from that mother lode for months. . . . Leno is hosting "The  Tonight Show" all week, "and the stuff that works best there is sex and money,"  he said. "This is the ultimate money scandal of the '80s, plus the fall of the  high and mighty." . . . A favorite: "Why was it called Lincoln Savings? Because  Charles Keating walked 12 miles through a blizzard just to give $600,000 to a  senator." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

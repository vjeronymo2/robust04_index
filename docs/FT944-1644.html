			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch Fed and Buba - Currencies Meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow, and the Bundesbank council on Thursday, offer foreign exchanges their best possibility of excitement in the final days of 1994. The only other country that might provide some pre-Christmas indigestion is Italy, where the lira remains vulnerable to further political setbacks. The government faces possible defeat in a no-confidence vote this week. The dollar is probably vulnerable to a decision from the Fed to keep rates on hold into the new year. It has risen about 5.5 per cent against the D-Mark, and 3.5 per cent against the yen, since late October. To some extent, this appreciation has been built around the expectation of the Fed moving aggressively to curb inflationary pressures. Following weaker than expected inflation data last week, however, expectations of the Fed sanctioning higher rates tomorrow have receded. Some observers, however, believe the odds on a move are 50:50, citing evidence of strong consumer spending as a countervailing argument. In Germany the balance of opinion overwhelmingly favours the Bundesbank leaving rates unchanged. Nothing, however, should be taken for granted. The German central bank is well known for the pleasure it takes in defying market expectations. For the statistically minded, there is a further issue. High Frequency Economics in New York points out that, on past evidence, December is the most likely month for interest rates to be moved. Over the past 25 years, 10 of the 72 adjustments of official rates have been in December; nearly twice what could be expected. The prospect of the Berlusconi government falling in Italy has pushed the lira to record lows recently. The confidence vote will provide markets with more to chew on. The markets appear to have discounted most bad news, but the lira could weaken further if a political hiatus threatens the normal course of government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) wound up its annual  ministerial meeting Wednesday [8 June] after adopting a joint  communique on solving various global issues ranging from the  world job crisis to an agenda under a new world trade body.    After two days of intensive discussions, foreign and trade  ministers from 25 of the world's richest nations released the  communique which proposed reinforcing the OECD's links with  nonmember countries, especially China and other Asian nations.    The communique recommended four major issues be addressed  under the next round of global trade talks sponsored by the  World Trade Organization (WTO), successor to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The recommended topics are the linkage between trade and  environment, relations between trade and labor standards, trade  and investment, and competition policy under global trade.    The communique's proposals will form a basis for an economic  declaration to be issued at the Naples summit of the Group of  Seven key industrial countries next month.</p>

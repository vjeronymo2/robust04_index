			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: BPA shareholders fight bid Leading shareholders in Banco Portugues do Atlantico are preparing to defend Portugal's largest commercial bank against a hostile takeover bid by Banco Comercial Portugues, a smaller rival. A group of Portuguese businessmen who control 27 per cent of BPA said they would seek to expand the core shareholding to 40 per cent. Earlier this week, BCP made a public offer of Es132bn (Dollars 819m) for 40 per cent of BPA. An official of Sonae, Portugal's largest private conglomerate and leader of BPA's core shareholders, said the group would not make a counter-bid but hoped to increase its own holdings and persuade other shareholders to join the group. BPA's core shareholders are bound by an agreement not to sell outside the group. The Sonae official said that if the core were extended to 40 per cent, BCP's bid would fail because the state owned 25 per cent of BPA and would remain neutral in the bid battle. But Lisbon analysts said BCP's offer would be a severe test of the cohesion of BPA's core shareholders. 'When the crunch comes and the money's on the table, the group may not hold together,' said a Lisbon dealer. BCP's bid of Es3,000 a share values BPA at Es330bn. BPA shares reached a high of Es2,800 yesterday before closing at Es2,615. They had been suspended since Tuesday, when they closed at Es2,010. More than 185,000 shares were traded yesterday. BCP's offer has to be approved by the government, central bank and stock exchange commission. BCP control of BPA would create Portugal's largest private-sector banking group, with combined assets of about Es5,360bn. The new group would be close in size to state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos, the country's largest bank, which focuses on mortgage lending and savings deposits.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sisde Director Antonio Salazar by Andrea </F> Purgatori; place and date not given: "Mysterious Sickness Not  Within Sisde"--first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- There has been no "purge" within Sisde  [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] -- merely a  general cleansing operation that has led to the dismissal of 300  personnel termed "unnecessary or unfit," and whoever  "insinuates" that the aim was to make way for some 50  "favorites" is "lying" and will answer for it in court. As for  spying on the parties, after the polemics over the file on the  League, from now on there will be very strict rules. There will  be no reports on any "political and official organizations," and  no activities will be permitted "outside the sphere of  institutional responsibilities." Center chiefs will pay  personally for any violations. After eight months at the head  of a storm-tossed Sisde, Domenico Salazar talked about agents  "retiring" and others entering on duty, including those with  "famous fathers," who have, he said, displayed "a high degree of  professionalism and expertise." He also talked about the "bogus  train bomb" -- reports of which had an "authenticity rating of  C3, that is, very low" but which nevertheless had to be  investigated. He talked about the "misfortune" of the "black  sheep" (namely, [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti and company)  who involved in scandals and trials a service that now "has to  regain the dignity that it needs in the eyes of the public and  the media." Suspicions, polemics, accusations. The service,  Salazar said, "is operating well," but "that does not seem to  interest anyone." Is this the fault of an image that has now  been "distorted" by those who are still trying to undermine it?  "The mysterious sickness is not within Sisde. It is outside."  This is what he had to say:    [Purgatori] Mr. Salazar, during your period as director of  Sisde, some 300 agents have been dismissed. This constitutes an  outright purge....    [Salazar] People have been excessively alarmist about this  alleged "purge," though that term is very remote from the actual  truth of the matter. When I assumed my post, I was asked to  assess the usefulness, professionalism, and reliability of my  personnel with a view to making Sisde as efficient and reliable  an organization as possible from the viewpoint of democratic  security. And this is precisely what I have done.    [Purgatori] On the basis of what criteria?    [Salazar] Only one, the only feasible one in practice: to  have members of staff assessed by their own office chiefs. This  is such a general and obvious rule that it applies to all  offices in the world, whether public or private, so I do not  think I need to say any more about it. Every division chief  classified his own staff according to different productivity  ratings, without any outside influence, and placed in the lowest  bracket those that were superfluous or unfit to work for Sisde.    [Purgatori] Were they unreliable, incompetent, or corrupt?    [Salazar] They simply failed to satisfy the criteria I just  mentioned. Personally, I do not even know these members of  staff. On average, they entered service five years ago, that is,  well before I assumed my post.    [Purgatori] Some of them have already taken legal action to  be reinstated or to protest the decisions. Can you rule out  abuses or vendettas on the part of your division chiefs?    [Salazar] Well, some people have suggested such a  possibility. But if there were any abuses or vendettas on the  part of division chiefs, I certainly could not know about them.  Be that as it may, these libelous charges must be supported by  concrete evidence.    [Purgatori] Sisde is a hotbed of nepotism -- sons of  politicians, magistrates, generals, officials. How many of them  have you dismissed?    [Salazar] I can only tell you that on the basis of the  assessments 67 individuals were returned to their respective  administrations or at least transferred to another  administration according to a precise and rigorous procedure. A  further 170 people were separated from service for various  reasons -- mostly with pensions or special early pension  arrangements. Since our manpower totals some 300,000, it seems  to me that there is no connection between transfers or  dismissals on the one hand and the employment of temporary  personnel on the other. These latter total some 50 and could  all easily be allocated to some of the 300 vacant positions. But  there has been a great deal of nonsense talked about the  business of these temporary staff, too, thus creating alarm by  focusing public attention on a nonexistent problem.    [Purgatori] Did the purge not serve precisely to make way  for  further sons of the famous and temporary staff?    [Salazar] Such an insinuation is an absolute lie, and those  responsible for it will answer for it in the appropriate forums.  Be that as it may, the regularization of the position of  temporary staff -- who are fully entitled to assert their own  position in the courts -- was not a hasty initiative on my part  but the implementation of precise requirements on the basis of  instructions from the Prime Minister's Office. If these  temporary staff have famous fathers, that would be reason enough  for me to avoid making unfair comments. During our internal  competition we established that these people display a high  degree of professionalism and expertise. It would be a strange  circumstance if all the fathers' sins were to fall on their  sons, and by sins I mean the very fact that their fathers are  famous.    [Purgatori] Sisde is under a cloud of suspicions, legal  inquiries, and a generally negative public opinion. The  business of the bogus train bomb was not a heroic episode. Then  there are the suspicions in connection with the bombings in  Rome, Florence, and Milan.    [Salazar] Look, I am tired of repeating that the train bomb  -- an operation started before I assumed this post -- was merely  one of over 700 reports in the field of organized crime, added  to which there are the approximately 500 reports in the field of  terrorism and subversion. We have had over 500 people arrested,  have captured 70 wanted persons, and so forth. Why should a  single erroneous report be so important within the overall  context of our work?    [Purgatori] But an erroneous report, especially if it  concerns a bombing, could bring a secret service to its knees.    [Salazar] So I should explain. We prepare reports  originating from a certain source, which we try to assess as  best we can. And over 95 percent of our reports are confirmed.  But it must be clear that on the whole these reports by the  services constitute only pointers or suspicions, which it is  then the duty of the judicial police to investigate and to back  up with supporting evidence. The results of this are presented  to the judicial authorities, not to us. So we cannot be  answerable for the accuracy or otherwise of the report, even  though we do assess it.    [Purgatori] And what happened in the case of the bogus bomb?    [Salazar] What happened was that the report was issued with  a  reliability rating of C3, that is, very low. But that does not  alter the fact that all possible kinds of checks had to be  carried out immediately. Let me ask you: Faced with the  possibility that there is a bomb on an aircraft or a train,  would you be prepared not to forward the report to the police  immediately so that all possible checks could be carried out? I  do not think so. So it seems to me that it is time to put an  end to this business of our "disgrace."    [Purgatori] Let us talk about the incompetence of the  untrained personnel and Sisde's lack of international  credibility.    [Salazar] I must deny this immediately. Consider that when  the head of the secret service of a neighboring country heard  that, after the well-known events, it was intended to deprive  Sisde of the autonomy that it enjoyed, he immediately offered to  bear witness to our efficiency in an international forum.    [Purgatori] The issue of the file on the League remains  unresolved. You maintain that it contained newspaper cuttings.  But the service's past suggests something quite different. Do  you or do you not spy on the parties?    [Salazar] It must suffice for you to know that I have in  fact  issued instructions to all operational staff for center chiefs  to confine themselves to intelligence activities of strict  institutional relevance without straying from their proper  sphere of responsibility. I expressly forbade any intelligence  activities with respect to political and official organizations  and stated in writing that any violations would constitute  illegal and unauthorized actions. The consequences would be the  personal responsibility of the center chief himself.    [Purgatori] Tell us what crises Sisde is tackling and has to  resolve in the midst of this storm.    [Salazar] The first problem, and the greatest, is how to  enable Sisde to regain its proper dignity in the eyes of the  public and the media. But I still cannot understand why, with  all the structures that have had the misfortune to encounter  black sheep (and frankly, I do not know which of them has none),  the same attitude has not been adopted, but an issue has been  made only in the case of a body whose principal responsibility  is precisely to defend the state.    [Purgatori] Mr. Salazar, what is your mysterious sickness?    [Salazar] I could reply that the newspapers are not helping  us. It does not seem to interest anyone that this organization  is operating well.    The sole concern is to seek out disappointed dismissed  personnel, to impart a distorted image of the service and its  staff, to highlight what is wrong, even if that is now water  under the bridge. As you can see, the mysterious sickness is not  within Sisde. It is outside.</p>

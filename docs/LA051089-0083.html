			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISIT TO DRUG SITE  </P> <P> He fell for it. There, on the evening news, President Bush standing before  reporters and public in Orange County; behind him to the left a tall pyramid of  those bags of white drugs we've all become so numb to seeing on television  (there seems to be a competition among law enforcement groups on constructing  the most impressive stack). Next to him on the right an equally tall pile of  bundled U.S. currency.  </P> <P> At a glance the image looks like a large balance scale with the President as  its center.  </P> <P> And the message this scene relays to too many viewers, especially those most  impressionable: Drugs equal money.  </P> <P> I'm sure neither the President nor his PR adviser intended that it come across  this way. They take the news media approach of using U.S. dollars as a measure  for quantities of confiscated illegal drugs (as was the currency displayed).  </P> <P> Rarely, if ever, is a news story written where a "street value" figure is not  attached to a quantity of drugs seized in a drug bust, often in headlines or  evening news teasers. The wise reporter appreciates the sensational value of  that figure; the naive believes it to be quantitative.  </P> <P> But using a "dollar-value" figure in discussing illegal drugs is much too  subjective. To me and, I hope, to a majority of citizens, the value, dollar or  otherwise, of one ounce or one ton of marijuana, crack, coke, heroine is zero.  We wouldn't buy it, sell it, trade it, or touch it. If we saw it on the street,  we would pass right by, as many people do in their cities and neighborhoods  every day.  </P> <P> It is an unfortunate choice to continually use the illegal drug retailer's  price as a figure for measuring illegal drug amounts. It would be more accurate  to continue to recount measures of weight or volume, whether it be stone,  pound, or kilogram; even cubic feet will do for comparison. You could even use  a misery factor, such as: "enough to kill 100 athletes, or cause 1,000 people  to become hopelessly addicted."  </P> <P> Unless you want to send the message that drugs equal money (or gold, or  Ferraris), and ultimately that drugs and money are exchangeable, if not  interchangeable, refrain from the visual and mental images of association that  have become commonplace in news reporting and law enforcement publicity. The  "street value" method is a dangerously wrong approach.  </P> <P> JAMES REILLY  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

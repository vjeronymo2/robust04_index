			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Brash calls in administrator Brash Holdings, the Australian consumer electronic retailer and once the nation's largest specialist stores group, yesterday called in an administrator after its main bankers - which include ANZ, Westpac and Societe Generale - withdrew their support. Brash's shares were suspended on the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 2.26. ANZ said recent developments in Brash's financial condition, coupled with business plans presented by the group last week, failed to provide the banking group with 'sufficient confidence' for it to renew a ADollars 61m (USDollars 43m) facility. It added that an independent assessment of Brash's condition was thought desirable. The voluntary administrators will be Mr David Beatty and Mr Michael Humphris from Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm. They said yesterday that all options for Brash's will be considered, ranging from a return to normal operations to a winding up of the company. The company suffered a loss of around ADollars 15m (USDollars 10.7m) in the year to July 1993, on sales of around ADollars 706m. It subsequently pulled out of the loss-making book retailing business but still posted a further, and larger, interim loss last month.</p>

Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, telephoned a local newspaper from  the nearby town of Tagum to announce that he had just been freed  unharmed by unidentified men who snatched him in Davao on  December 28 and freed him early Wednesday.    He later arrived with Tagum police at the regional police  headquarters in Davao, located about 950 kilometers (600 miles)  south of Manila, to pay a call on officials who had been stumped  by his disappearance.    The Houston, Texas, native told police that two gunmen  forced  him into a car in Davao on December 28 and transported him  blindfolded outside the city.    He said they stripped him of $2,200 in travellers cheques,  $200 in cash and two gold rings and kept him in a windowless  room until his release. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Housing recovery underpins Tay Homes Shares of Tay Homes yesterday rose 12p to 163p as the Leeds-based housebuilder announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 3.09m to Pounds 6.23m for the year to June 30. The recovery in the new housing market underpinned the rise, which was also helped by the return to profit of the group's Scottish region. Turnover advanced 22 per cent to Pounds 85.1m (Pounds 69.6m). The group sold 1,308 houses, an increase of 18 per cent on last year's 1,107, at an average price of Pounds 64,700, compared with Pounds 61,000. However, the land bank declined from 4,200 to 4,000 plots. Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, blamed the rise in land prices, which have reached levels not seen since the boom of the late 1980s. 'We have been forced to become more selective in our land purchases,' Mr Spencer said. Land prices rose by an average Pounds 1,800 to Pounds 11,300 a plot during the year, the rise eating into the group's cash pile despite the boost from last year's Pounds 10.2m rights issue. As a result, gearing rose from 36 to 45 per cent. Cost pressures had been felt from building materials suppliers but had been largely contained at about the 4 per cent level. Earnings per share increased from 9.1p to 15.5p and a proposed final dividend of 5.1p lifts the total to 6.45p (5.85p). Mr Spencer said that the group was now well positioned to take advantage of the recovery in the market. However, although sales reservations were 25 per cent ahead of the position seen this time last year, they had dropped off since the latest rise in interest rates. 'Things have definitely slowed down, but we are hopeful that the level of customer interest that has been shown will still convert into steady sales,' he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA also requests comments on whether to specify the pass/fail criterion for the salt spray test to ``no leakage'' in lieu of ``shall not leak or be permanently changed in external configuration or dimensions.'' Concurrently, the agency would also increase the number of cycles during testing from two sets of 5,000 cycles each to two sets of 9,000 cycles each. The agency requests comments on whether these modifications in the number of cycles would be appropriate for the road salt test as well as the environmental cycling test discussed earlier. The agency also requests comments on the estimated cost of the salt spray test and the extent to which current CNG containers would comply with the requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Charpy Impact Test <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1&hyph;12(d) and 1&hyph;13(e) of NGV2 set forth an impact test, known as the Charpy test, and performance criteria to address brittle fracture of steel CNG containers and liners under low temperatures. NGV2 states that this test is an indicator of the performance of heat treated steels. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The Charpy test evaluates marginal heat treating performance which can lead to poor fracture performance, degraded resistance to stress corrosion cracking, and lessened fatigue resistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4&blank;The Charpy test only evaluates steel CNG containers and liners. The environmental cycling test evaluates composite materials under low temperature conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments on whether there is a safety problem sufficiently serious to warrant establishing a requirement for low temperature testing of CNG container materials. The agency requested these comments due to its concern that certain materials such as high strength steels can lose their ductility at low temperatures, a situation that could lead to a container's catastrophic failure. The agency requested specific comments on the Charpy impact test set forth in NGV2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV Systems, ARC, Comdyne, Pressed Steel Tank, EDO, Fiber Dynamics, AAMA, Minnesota Gas, Amoco, Navistar, CNG Pittsburgh, and Manchester commented about the need for cold temperature testing. All but Manchester believed that the standard should include some sort of cold temperature testing for containers. Manchester stated that the container's service environment should be examined to determine if such cold temperature testing is needed. Most commenters stated that temperature extremes should be accounted for in the standard but did not elaborate about the specific test. PST recommended that the agency include the Charpy impact test in the Federal standard. AAMA and EDO recommended that the containers be cycled at ^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C (^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F) and ^50 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C (^58 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F), respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 304 to include a low temperature test patterned after the Charpy impact test. This test is set forth in sections 1&hyph;12(d) and 1&hyph;13(e) of NGV2, which references  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ASTM E 23. Section 1&hyph;13(e) states that the average energy absorbed by the three test specimens shall not be less than 100 J/cm2. The minimum value for any one specimen shall not be less than 80 J/cm2. Under the test, a pendulum swings down and hits a specimen. The test device then measures the amount of energy transmitted into the specimen needed to break it. If the specimen breaks at low levels of energy, then it would fail the test. To illustrate, while a substance such as glass would break at very low energy levels, a non-brittle metal would break only at relatively high energy levels. Specifically, the purpose of this test is to determine the brittle fracture behavior of steels. It also evaluates the performance of steels which have been heat treated as part of the manufacturing process. An improper heat treatment process can result in the material being brittle and thus more susceptible to fatigue and stress corrosion cracking. Non-steel containers and liners need not be tested to comply with the Charpy test because they are not heat treated this way. The agency requests comments about the agency's decision to propose the Charpy impact test. Is it appropriate to only apply these requirements to Type 1 containers and Type 2 and Type 3 containers with steel liners? In addition, NHTSA requests comments on applicable performance tests for fracture and fatigue assessment of liner materials other than steel, if such materials perform a structural function, e.g., aluminum liners or containers. Along with this information, commenters should include a description of the specific performance tests recommended, along with objective pass/fail criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees with the recommendations by AAMA and EDO that containers be pressure cycled at low temperatures (e.g., ^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; C (^40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F)). The agency notes that this low temperature is consistent with test conditions in NGV2 and NHTSA standards, including Standard No. 105,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hydraulic Brake Systems, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Standard No. 106,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brake Hoses,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and Standard No. 108,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The agency requests comment about whether the proposed test temperature is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to Manchester's comment that the service environment should be examined to determine if cold temperature testing is needed for a particular container, NHTSA notes that it would be impracticable to determine what type of environment each individual container would encounter. In establishing a requirement, the agency believes that it is appropriate to test CNG containers in a worst case scenario, such as the low temperature levels being proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Gunfire Test <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1&hyph;18(j) of NGV2 includes a gunfire test that evaluates whether a fully pressurized container fragments upon suffering a high impact puncture. A similar puncture could occur in a motor vehicle crash, causing the propulsion of container fragments at high speeds. The gunfire test assures that a container will instead essentially remain in one piece. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

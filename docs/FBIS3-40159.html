			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xiang Xuhan (0686 4872 3352) and Peng Jiaming </F> (1756 1367 2494): "Influence of Party and Government-Run  Economic Entities on the Judicial System, Legal Countermeasures"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 1. Entities and units  set up and operated by the party are unable to cut their ties;  there is no differentiation between government and enterprise,  or between official and commercial; and it is hard to tell the  defendants from the plaintiffs.    To provide support to entities being run by party and  governmental organs, the great majority of local party  committees and governments have explicit regulations: Concerning  entities which temporarily do not have the wherewithal to cut  ties, they are permitted a transitional period, and after  conditions are ripe then all relations are to be severed.  Undoubtedly this sort of regulation has a certain positive  effect in the initial phase when the entity is being created.  However, because the entity's structure and its personnel and  even its property have not yet been cut loose from the party or  government organ, the interests of the entity are still closely  linked with the interests of the cadre, thus it is hardly  avoidable that some units make use of these functional  advantages to get someone's initials on something, uncover  resources of materials, make hot merchandise scarce. The party  and government organs in Tianjin city set up some 124 entities,  of which only seven cut their ties. According to an  investigation, despite the fact that when these entities were  set up they were duly registered with the industrial and  commercial control departments and attained the status of legal  persons, looking at them at the present time from the angle of  their actual control structures, they fall into only two types.  In one type the party or government organ used the "washed  hands" method and contracted it out to an individual, and while  the parent organ provides some facilitating for it, it also  rakes in a certain amount of management fees; the other type is  that in which the parent organ sets up a "big contract and tight  connections" and everything is centrally controlled and  operated. Because the entity and the parent organ are unable to  cut their ties, there remains a huge spider-web of relationships  between the two, and no matter which of the above two types of  operation was chosen, it has to result in the situation wherein  there is no differentiation between government and enterprise,  between official and commercial. But this is exactly the reverse  of the goal of the reforms, and this is especially true in the  cases where official and commercial are not separated and  authority is used to make the commerce operate: Exactly what the  masses of people most detest. In the same manner, when  government is tied to business, it presents some new problems to  the People's Courts in their judicial work. At present the most  prominent problems occur when an organ's entity has a dispute  with an individual: What position in the litigation does the  party or governmental organ take? When asked this, judicial  officers commonly hold one of three opinions. 1) The  party/governmental organ cannot become a party in the  litigation, the reason being that, in theory, the entity is an  independent legal person and should independently shoulder its  legal responsibilities. 2) The party/governmental organ has the  position of plaintiff or defendant in the litigation, the reason  being that in reality, the entity's status as a legal person is  nominal not actual, the organ is really the person running the  operation. 3) The party/governmental organ is a third party  without independent rights of appeal, the reason being that the  entity is an independent legal person, but the outcome of the  decision on the case has relevance to the entity's interests  under the law. We believe that all three of the above views  suffer from bias, and cannot categorically address the question  of the position of party and governmental organs in litigation  cases; we should do a synthesis of cases and seek a firm  understanding from the actual situations.    2. When economic management departments and  governmental and judicial organs engage in commercial  businesses, it causes problems among the masses and judicial  work becomes difficult.    The majority of the entities established by party and  government organs are established utilizing the organ's own  functional advantages, and thus the interests of the entity and  those of the organ and its cadres are intimately connected. Some  units unavoidably make use of their own official authority to  market their power or monopolize a sector. This is especially  true of some economic control departments with real power and  governmental and judicial organs which engage in commercial  businesses. Even though nominally the entities they establish  are market principals equal with other companies and  enterprises, because of the effects of the functions and  official power of their parent organs, they seem to be most able  to control the markets and master all situations. This is a  matter of concern with the populace, who consider this a type of  "upside down officialdom" and "official businessmen," and  universally complain that "the powerful make lots of money, the  not so powerful make a little money, the powerless don't make  any money at all." In the same manner, the involvement of these  organs has had a rather great effect upon litigation work in the  judiciary. Considering present conditions, the establishment of  commercial entities by such units and organs has had the  following effects upon the judiciary. 1) Economic control  departments which in their own right have state apportioned  management authority can, in some areas, directly influence and  exert pressure upon the judicial organs. The result is that when  the judicial organs are handling cases which directly affect the  entities established by the these units or departments, it has  no choice but to act with extreme caution. 2) When handling  cases involving the entities set up by other governmental or  judicial departments, the judiciary often is subjected to the  influence of personal intercessions and relationships. 3) In  cases where the odd judicial organ has established its own  economic entity, some judiciary personnel have become involved  in "running the business," the image of the judiciary and the  judicial official is greatly effected, especially when handling  cases of litigation involving the very entity it has established.    3. Registered capital is falsified, real entities  become "ghost entities," judicial decisions and rulings are  difficult to enforce.    Even though according to the materials provided by the  industrial and commercial departments the 124 entities of organs  have registered capital of over 18 million yuan, according to  actual figures which we have, the majority of the units'  registered capital is exaggerated. Some of the figures are  totally fabricated out of nothing, others reflect borrowing from  someone in order to register and then immediately repaying them;  some exaggerate by increasing the value of mortgaged goods. Our  investigation shows that majority of the capital in the organs'  entities comes from three areas. First are bank loans and loans  from friends and relatives. Second are public funds invested by  the organ establishing the entity, and third are from personal  savings. However, these funds are always limited, short term,  and unstable. In Tianjin personal savings amount to 1.2 million  yuan, and the average for each entity is less than 10,000 yuan.  Many of the bank loans taken out by the entities have fallen  due; public funds invested by the establishing organ cannot be  subjected to any risks and can be recalled at any time, so many  of the organs' entities only have their license and their  personnel but have no "wherewithal" to run a business, thus  becoming "ghost entities." Thus, in the administration of  justice, after a case is settled, we often encounter the  situation where these units have no capacity for continued  operation; the judicial decision or ruling is nothing more than  "empty words" and "useless sentences."

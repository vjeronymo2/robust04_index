			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Victoire's new owner to be announced soon Suez, the French holding company, is soon expected to announce the new owner of Victoire, its insurance subsidiary which has been for sale since late last year. Victoire, one of France's five largest insurers, is valued at around FFr15bn (Dollars 2.6bn). It was put on the market after Suez's deal last autumn with the Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) insurance group. The sale represents a rare opportunity for a foreign company to establish a significant presence in the French insurance industry. Several foreign companies are understood to have shown interest in Victoire, including Italy's Generali, AIG of the US and Commercial Union of the UK. BAT, another UK group, is believed to have considered making an offer but issued a statement saying it had decided not to do so. Suez is thought to have received four bids for Victoire by the end of last week, the official deadline for the close of offers. The French government will today announce details of the level of public subscription for the sale of its 50 per cent stake in UAP, the insurer.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (6): Relief without pleasure / Assessing reactions to the UK's new advanced corporation tax rules This summer will see the first payments of cash dividends by UK companies which will not attract advance corporation tax for many years. Changes announced in last November's budget will allow companies to reclaim ACT on dividends if certain conditions are met. However, so far only one, BAT Industries, has said it will take advantage of the rule change which takes effect from July 1. Since the imputation system of tax on dividends was introduced in 1973, companies have been obliged to act as income tax collectors for the Inland Revenue. They must pay dividends to shareholders net of basic rate income tax, and pass on the tax due to the Treasury. Those shareholders entitled to receive income gross - such as pension funds  -must apply for a refund of tax, while higher rate taxpayers must pay the difference between the basic rate already paid by the company and their marginal tax rate. Meanwhile, the companies, having paid the tax in advance, can then offset it against their mainstream corporation tax payments, hence the name advance corporation tax. The system appears very neat. But it has proved increasingly unpopular with companies. A problem arises if a company has too low a UK corporation tax liability to offset the whole of the ACT it has paid on the dividends. If that is the case, the company ends up paying a greater proportion of its profits in tax than it is strictly liable to do. So-called 'unrelieved ACT' can be carried over to future years, but some companies find they can never offset it against corporation tax and must evenutally write it off. In other words, as Mr Barry Bracewell-Milnes, an expert on the subject, has put it, 'in certain circumstances ACT is not an advance tax but a final tax'. Companies build up unrelieved ACT when they have a UK corporation tax liability disproportionately low relative to the dividends paid. At the last estimate, the total of surplus ACT was Pounds 5.5bn, and the mountain was increasing at the rate of Pounds 700m a year. This can occur for two main reasons; either when a company's UK profits have dropped but it decides to maintain dividends at a high level, or where a company's overseas activities have become dominant in total profits. The Treasury has little sympathy in the former, so-called cyclical case  - and is now investigating why companies have continued to pay dividends at pre-recession levels through the downturn - which could in any case be cured when profits recover. However, the latter, structural, problem is both long term and a worrying deterrent to companies expanding outside the UK. Arguably, if companies do not compete internationally, they will eventually be unable to compete at home. The ACT problem was having a distorting effect on companies' behaviour. For instance, encouraging the purchase of non-trading companies' with a maintstream corporation tax record and the moving of costs - such as head offices, research and development establishments or borrowings - off-shore so as to depress foreign earnings and boost UK profits. Then, last year a rash of enhanced scrip dividends appeared, which made significant inroads to the Treasury's receipts from ACT. Companies used the enhanced scrip idea because dividends paid in shares rather than in cash do not attract ACT. The trick was to make the share dividend so much more attractive than the cash dividend - by setting it 50 per cent higher - that most, if not all, shareholders would plump for the paper. Years of lobbying by companies, the increasing size of the problem, with unrelieved ACT mounting, and the prevalence of the enhanced scrips finally broke through the Treasury's natural resistance to losing part of its income. And in last year's March budget Mr Norman Lamont, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, acknowledged that 'something must be done' about ACT by bringing up the idea of a 'foreign income dividend' scheme (FID). Put simply, the idea was that if companies could show dividends were paid out of foreign profits they could reclaim the ACT on them. A period of consultation followed which left companies divided over whether the scheme would be beneficial. Many thought it did not go far enough, since it tackled only the 'structural' not the 'cyclical' problem. Others thought it would be cumbersome to operate. But the greatest concern was that it would divide shareholders against each other. Under the outlined scheme the position of a taxpaying shareholder would be unchanged and the dividend would be treated as if basic rate tax had been paid on it. However, non-taxpayers, those who reclaim the tax credit, would not be able to claw back that income from a FID. That would mean they would lose a sizeable portion of their income, and could lead them to sell shares in companies which paid FIDs, distorting stock market values. So when Mr Kenneth Clarke revealed his Budget in November, there was some surprise that the FID scheme was introduced much as originally suggested. And the scheme met only a guarded welcome. Nor has the response become more enthusiastic since further details were published in the Finance Bill. So far only BAT - the company which pioneered enhanced scrip dividends last year - has said it will definitely pay a FID, its final dividend for 1993, which will be delayed until July to take advantage of the new rules. The tobacco and insurance group makes about 70 per cent of its profits outside the UK and has been suffering high tax rates as a result of unrelieved ACT. By making its final dividend a FID it will save about Pounds 90m in ACT. However, in order to address the concerns of non-tax paying shareholders, which make up about 40 per cent of BAT's shareholder register, the company will pass the ACT saving to investors through a 25 per cent higher dividend. In spite of BAT's lead, announced in March, no other large companies have yet followed. The complexity of the FID scheme may well deter companies, since they must pay the ACT on dividends and then reclaim it by proving that the dividend has been paid from foreign income. Some companies find that repatriating cash from overseas to pay a FID brings extra costs which might outweigh the benefits of saving ACT. No doubt finance directors and tax experts are looking closely at the scheme. But it may take a further reform of the rules before there is a wider interest in using it.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: Moti Roti, Puttli Chunni - Theatre Even being in the audience at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East nowadays is an experience in itself. Nowhere else in the London theatre is there such a sense of direct participation. If Stratford East put on a really bad production, one has the sense that the audience would throw things at it. There is no such problem with Moti Roti, Puttli Chunni, which is Hindi for 'Thick Bread, Thin Veils,' and part of this year's London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT/93). The source is the prolific Indian movie industry which specialises in high drama, violence, passion and romance. Here it has been partly turned into theatre: some of the action takes place behind a veil, as though on screen, then the real characters appear, as in a play. The plot has also been devised for Britain. These are Indians who have emigrated in order to get away from arranged marriages and undue family interference, but who mainly consort with Indians when they get here, maintain their links with Bombay and still stick very largely to their own culture with a bit more freedom. Moti Roti concerns a construction company called Kumar Developments which operates in London's East End and, like many companies, is in trouble with the end of the property boom and has probably cut a few corners on the way. It attempts to revive its reputation by building a public health complex, but when the Kumar family runs out of money, they seek to turn the complex private. Corruption is rampant. So is every other kind of passion. If one had to attach a label to the style, it would be melodrama, so the old theatre at Stratford East is a very fitting place for it. The audience hisses at anything villainous and cheers ironically at the sentimental passages. No doubt there is more to Moti Roti than meets the average Anglo-Saxon eye and ear. Some of the dialogue is in Hindi. Yet even the dullest Englishman can scarcely fail to rise to the zest, the passion and the sheer enthusiasm. It may be soap, but it is Indian soap on an epic scale with handsome men and beautiful women, though also a wonderful comic character in Ajay Chhabra's Bunty. The colours are lurid - mostly shades of purple - but even that adds to the impression of an Indian Hollywood run wild. They call it Bollywood. Direction and design are by Keith Khan. The audience at the first night was a huge ethnic mix; they all loved it. Part of the pleasure is simply being there. Theatre Royal, Stratford East until July 17. (081) 534 0310</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Maseru May 26 SAPA -- Agreement was reached on  Thursday between the Lesotho Government and striking police for  an increase in a series of police allowances. The agreement  however, did not include the 60 per cent salary increase  demanded by the striking police.    The parties agreed most of the allowances would be doubled.  The risk allowance had been doubled from R50 [rand] to R100,  special duty and plainclothes allowance from R25 to R50, and  mountain allowance from R17 to R25.    It believed that the leaders of the police strike will reach  a compromise agreement with the government following the  increased allowances, which will also affect the same categories  of officers in the army,.    It has been announced that an independent salary commission  will be established to review the salary structure for all civil  servants.    Meanwhile, Lesotho's natural resources minister, Mr Monyane  Moleleki, has resigned, according to an announcement broadcast  by Radio Lesotho on Thursday. Mr Moleleki's department was  responsible for the implementation of the Lesotho Highlands  water scheme which will provide water to South Africa.    Mr Moleleki fled into neighbouring Orange Free State last  week and is now believed to have travelled to Johannesburg.</p>

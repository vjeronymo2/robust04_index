			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Defining directors Sir, Re Mr Bob Garratt's letter (April 8), if we are moved to have our corporations directed by boards of professional governors rather than of promoted operational managers, and are still not prepared to adopt 'twin boards', then we need clearly to define and separate the often incompatible roles of governing and managing. Perhaps we could now consider clear role separation by adopting a convention that a significant majority of a board's members cannot also be employees of their company - moving towards the upper, non-executive tier of twin boards, but preserving scope for companies to evolve their own specific board structures.

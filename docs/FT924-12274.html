			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (5): Under pressure - The Strategy Boutiques THE DOWNTURN has put pressure on all management consultancies, but perhaps more vulnerable than most are the small 'strategy boutiques'. Recession has found them competing with both the consulting arms of the international accounting firms and with a plethora of new one-man consultancies, and faced with clients determined to get more for their money. Leaving aside the fashionable jargon with which consultants adorn their profession and confound their clients, strategy consultants basically help formulate strategies at the corporate or business unit level. This may be through an analysis of growth opportunities, potential acquisitions, markets, organisational structure or product competitiveness. Over the past decade the move has been away from 'pure' strategy analysis to training and hands-on involvement in the implementation of the strategies. The initial impetus for the strategic boutiques came from a perceived failure by the multinational accountancy companies to provide specialised services. Although most agree that the boutiques - because of competitive pricing, niche-marketing and personal service - will ride the storm, the empire has now struck back. 'The boutiques are now under pressure from the multinationals, who have substantial support networks for research, as well as the advantage of international experience and resources,' says Mr Brian O'Rorke, executive director of the Management Consultants Association. 'Also, the multinationals have moved from being generalists to being multi-boutiques - trying to set up under one roof a raft of specialist operations.' The downturn and management de-layering has also shaken loose many a senior executive, either through redundancy or early retirement. These have been tempted to supplement income by setting up small one-man consultancies, increasing the pressure on fees and hence margins. Mr John Mitchell of Mitchell Phoenix who works in the high technology sector with the likes of Microsoft, is more worried about the effect of one-man-bands on the quality of consultancy offered: 'It is becoming more and more difficult to attract clients because of the bad experiences they have had with consultants who charge them tens of thousands of pounds and leave them with a bound document and very little else.' This raises a more serious problem for the strategy boutiques of whether the bottom line effect of the specialised and sometimes esoteric service they offer is sufficiently clear. A critic is Mr James Irwin, chairman of Impac, an international consultancy specialising in 'productivity and quality engineering', very much a hands-on consultancy which guarantees savings greater than the project fee. He is a great believer in quantifiable analysis, and is scathing of 'fuzzy' programmes where no one in the company is afterwards able to pin down the benefits to the bottom line. 'A lot of consultants are selling ego stroking rather than anything that provides a lasting effect.' Not surprisingly, this is a view rejected by most consultants. Mr Mitchell is critical of strategy consultants who encourage a culture of 'client dependency' by projecting themselves as gurus with patented solutions and while he would probably agree with Mr Irwin's scepticism of faddism, he insists that strategy boutiques need to go beyond the purely analytical. 'Straight line projection of the past into the future is not enough. What is needed is innovation; companies need an adherence to vision at the top and an organisational ability to translate this into action. 'What has often happened is that a major consultancy of the Price Waterhouse ilk will design a strategy costing Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 500,000 and then wash its hands of whether there is in place in the business the infrastructure to make the change. What the boutiques can and are having to do is to modify that infrastructure through an ongoing involvement with the company.' Mr James Thorne, managing director of Strat*X, a consultancy which is building a reputation for 'action-oriented' training with multinationals, traces the demand for greater consultancy involvement directly to the harsher economic climate of the past few years: 'On the demand side, because of the drive for tangible results, there is less and less training for training's sake taking place,' he says. 'However, the processes of management de-layering and employee empowerment have been continuing, which has opened an area of huge potential for strategy consultants. If control from the top is to be reduced and to be successfully replaced by a system where responsibility and involvement bubbles from the bottom up, it is no longer just a few managers who need sophisticated training: all key employees need that exposure.' If employee empowerment is an ideal to which British commerce and industry pay more than lip-service, there will be a need for a massive commitment to restructuring to meet the 'challenges of change', but the jury is still out on this. Mr Jon Morgan, managing director of Executive Information Solutions admits to a missionary zeal over the short-termism of British industry: 'More serious than trimmed margins is the fact that training, marketing and consultancy work are considered expendable by management and are the first to be cut in a recession.' Mr O'Rorke identifies eastern Europe, along with Information Technology as the two growth areas for consultancies: 'As much as 45 per cent of MCA members' revenue comes by way of work in IT - but one needs to be circumspect: nowadays everything has an element of IT in it.' 'Eastern Europe is providing a fair amount of work, with encouraging growth signs. The problem is that it is entirely dependent on funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and the European Community's Phare programme - the eastern businesses don't have the money at the moment. 'Although fee rates are not good, it is useful in the sense of establishing a beachhead for the future and, of course, it is a way of keeping consultants who might otherwise be sitting doing nothing in the UK, occupied.'</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CLIMATIC COMPETITION AT SUNDAY BOWL PROGRAM  </P> <P> It takes a lot to upstage Mother Nature. That John Nelson, Cho-Liang Lin and  the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute Orchestra even came close in their  Sunday night concert at Hollywood Bowl is tribute to their considerable  music-making abilities.  </P> <P> This was no routine evening at the Bowl. Lightning, thunder, rain -- and plenty  of it -- livened/dampened the evening. But few of the 6,892 in attendance felt  the need to leave, opting instead to stay for what proved uncommonly compelling  performances of Prokofiev and Schumann, under any conditions.  </P> <P> Lin's performance of the Violin Concerto No. 1 by Prokofiev was remarkable for  its unremitting intensity. The violinist seems virtually incapable of producing  harsh sounds, even though he dug into his part with fiery aggression. His tone  never wavered, never thinned, his intonation remained perfect, and nothing  overtaxed his technical capabilities. As a result, this virtuoso performance  managed not to call attention to itself; the focus remained firmly on the  music.  </P> <P> When the rain began in the third movement his playing only gained in intensity,  despite the not inconsiderable ruckus in the audience and clatter onstage as  violinists scooted to avoid the wet. Otherwise, Nelson kept the orchestra in  tight order, offering keen, flexible support.  </P> <P> Spectacular thunder and lightning together with sporadic rain accompanied,  sometimes dramatically, the entirety of Nelson's account of Schumann's Second  Symphony. Here, Nelson found more than a few hints of Beethoven, highlighting  the music's heroic aspects with pointed woodwind solos, noble brass  declamations and crisp timpani interjections.  </P> <P> The concert opened with a lucid, slightly overcontrolled reading of Ravel's  "Rapsodie espagnole" led by Institute conducting fellow Lan Shui.TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

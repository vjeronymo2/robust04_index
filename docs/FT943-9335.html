			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Pay-off to Manweb chairman under fire The potential Pounds 1m retirement package that Mr Bryan Weston, the non-executive chairman of electricity company Manweb, will receive later this month came in for heavy criticism yesterday. Mr Weston, who was executive chairman from 1985 to 1992 but now has a two-day week, has compiled the package of share options in the four years since the Chester-based company, which provides electricity to Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales, was privatised. But Mr Frank Dobson, the Labour party's campaigns co-ordinator, attacked the size of the pay-off, saying: 'This is just another round in the privatisation rip-off.' Mr Weston holds 121,878 ordinary shares in the company, which at one stage yesterday were trading at Pounds 7.24 each, making them worth Pounds 882,396. He also has an option under an executive share scheme for directors to buy 47,945 shares at Pounds 3.65 each. Under a savings scheme Mr Weston also has the option to buy another 3,128 shares at Pounds 1.75 each. The disclosure is the latest in a series of revelations of high rewards for executives in the privatised electricity companies.

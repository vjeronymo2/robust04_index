			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Scream's tops - Pop THE RECORD of the year is Screamadelica by the Scottish band Primal Scream. That's official. It was chosen by experts from a short list of 100 albums, in the record industry's attempt to match the Booker Prize with a serious, incorruptible competition to find the best album of new music released in the UK and Ireland in the past year. Sponsored by Mercury - the communications company not the dead Freddie  - the idea has taken a firm hold in year one. The 10 short-listed albums were wonderfully eclectic, ranging from the multi-million selling contributions by such big guns as U2 and Simply Red (who would have regarded the Pounds 20,000 prize as small change) to the intense spiritualism of John Tavener's The Protecting Veil (Virgin Records), a cello piece inspired by a miracle of the Greek Orthodox Church, and the soulful jazz of the South African, London based, pianist, Bheki Mseleku (World Classic) on the album Celebration. If the Mercury prize had no other plus than making these two albums available in High Street stores, it would have justified its existence. Primal Scream was the obvious choice to lift the award. Its music manages to be both trendy and reassuring. The tracks range from the sprightly, uplifting, melodic 'Movin' on up', a natural hit single; to the right-on, ethnicity of 'Slip inside this house'; to the even more black 'Don't fight it, feel it'; to a nod towards psychedelia in 'Higher than the sun'; and so on. The entire Mercury shortlist sampler of 10 representative tracks, a wonderful bargain at Pounds 3.99, offers a crash course in contemporary music, and Primal Scream condenses it all into one album. It is all very clever; very accessible; beautifully produced; and enjoyably fronted by singer Bob Gillespie. No new worlds are explored, indeed there is more than a hint of Simply Red in the slower numbers, but 1992 is neatly captured. The judges plumped for a 'no risks' winner, for a band which could still use the prize money. Apparently, Primal Scream, saw off strong challenges from U2, John Tavener, Bheki and The Young Disciples, whose genuinely black, funky soul, pulsatingly danceable album Road to Freedom (Talkin' Loud) would have been a bolder choice for the winner. Here again, the debt is palpably owed to American Soul, but there is a commitment, especially on tracks like 'Move on', which makes this album particularly enjoyable. Apart from Simply Red, the other shortlisted albums were Rising Above Bedlam (Oval) by the idiosyncratic Jah Wobble, which takes you smoothly to Africa and beyond; Fox Base Alpha (Heavenly) by the dance band favourites Saint Etienne; Honey's Dead (Warner) by the American-influenced Jesus and Mary Chain; and one completely oddball outsider Barry Adamson, whose Soul Murder (Mute) takes a Laurie Anderson approach, with the man talking mysteriously over late night urban jazz music. Of these my fancy would have been Jesus and Mary Chain, if only for the deathly vocals of brothers Jim and William Reid and the drained out punk feel, a cross between Lou Reed and The Pixies. But if you discount Primal Scream as the marketable choice for the winner, what of the two also-rans? The Protective Veil is a 45-minute challenge for cellist Steven Isserlis, whose continuous, austere solo seeks to portray the transcendental power of the Virgin Mary. Moving through various stages of her earthly and heavenly life, the cello maintains a haunting lyrical strain, seeing off interruptions from the strings. There is no development towards a finale, but the evocation of a mood is beautifully sustained. It is instrumental plainsong as far removed from Radio One as Purcell is from Prince. There is something equally hypnotic about Bheki's Celebration. Intense, introspective, building up from simple melodies into finely textured jazz rhythms, Mseleku is well served by such British musicians as Courtney Pine on soprano sax and Eddie Parker on flute, but the inner force comes from the American bass and drums team of Michael Bowie and 'Smitty' Smith. There is nothing new here, but it is very classy stuff. The judges have selected probably the best two new albums of contemporary classical music and jazz for praise. It would have been perverse to make either the winner of a popular competition.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S VOLUNTEER HELD IN ATTACK ON WOMAN  </P> <P> A civilian Los Angeles County sheriff's volunteer was arrested Thursday on  suspicion of slapping and sexually molesting a Tujunga woman after using a  police-style flashing red light to halt her car, Burbank police reported.  </P> <P> Nikki Amorosino, 39, was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail on suspicion of  felony sexual battery, said Sgt. Don Goldberg. Arraignment is scheduled Monday  in Burbank Municipal Court, he said.  </P> <P> The 39-year-old victim, who is married to a California Highway Patrol officer,  was treated for bruises and scratches at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank  following the 8 a.m. Wednesday attack, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> The woman wrote down the license plate number of the van that pulled her over,  and police traced it to Amorosino's Arleta home, where he was arrested,  Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Deputy Pat Hunter said Amorosino, a self-employed fireworks  technician, was a volunteer in the department's media resources office in  Whittier, which produces training films for deputies and recruits. Officials in  the office could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Goldberg said  sheriff's officials told him that they had ended Amorosino's connection with  the department because of his arrest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pulled in Front of Car  </P> <P> Police said the assault occurred after Amorosino repeatedly pulled in front of  the woman's car as she drove south on Buena Vista Street. When the woman  attempted several times to pass Amorosino's slow-moving van, he caught up with  her and again pulled in front of her car, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Amorosino then pulled alongside the woman's car, put a flashing red light atop  his van and motioned for the woman to stop, Goldberg said. The woman, thinking  that the man was a police officer, stopped and got out of her car at Buena  Vista and Victory Boulevard, Goldberg said. Amorosino, enraged and shouting  obscenities, ran up to the woman, identified himself as a sheriff's deputy,  grabbed her arms and slapped her head, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Amorosino then allegedly threw the woman against the side of his van, reached  under her blouse and grabbed her right breast, Goldberg said. When the woman  yelled "Rape!," Amorosino returned to his van and drove off, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Police searching the van after Amorosino's arrest found a red light believed to  be the one used to stop the woman's car, a sheriff's deputy's cap with badge, a  pair of handcuffs and several explosive devices, Goldberg said. The Los Angeles  Police Department bomb squad was called to take custody of the explosives, he  said.  </P></p>

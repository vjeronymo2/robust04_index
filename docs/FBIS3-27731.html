The consultative body, chaired by Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, began discussions on the fiscal 1994 budget late last  year. The debate was stalled earlier this month, however, due  to political turmoil after the rejection of the reform bills by  the House of Councillors January 21.    Friday's agreement on political reforms reached between  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party, prompted the government and  governing coalition to make haste in weaving together steps to  rev up the flagging economy, the sources said.    The consultative body, made up of cabinet ministers in  charge  of economic affairs and representatives of the ruling coalition  parties, is determined to set the timetable for drafting the  national budget on Saturday, they said.    Saturday's discussion is expected to focus on when to raise  the 3 percent consumption tax as a means of securing funds to  implement major income and residential tax cuts, the sources  said.    Indications are that the government will announce the  pump-priming package by the end of next week and have the  Ministry of Finance adopt its budget proposal around February 10  ahead of a summit meeting between Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton in Washington February 11.    The government intends to adopt its draft budget in  mid-February, sources said.</p>

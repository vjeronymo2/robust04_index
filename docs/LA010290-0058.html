			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> AKINEMOD MIGHT NOT KNOW IT, BUT SHE MIGHT BE QUITE A FILLY  </P> <P> With her easy victory Monday in the $107,650 La Brea Breeders' Cup Stakes at  Santa Anita, Akinemod ran her win streak to five, the only blemish on her  record coming when she was a troubled fourth in her debut last April.  </P> <P> Not bad for a filly who still hasn't figured out exactly what she's supposed to  be doing for a living.  </P> <P> "It's like a big game to her," said Gary Stevens after steering the Time To  Explode filly to a two-length win over Fantastic Look.  </P> <P> "I don't feel she knows what she's doing. I still feel there's room for  improvement."  </P> <P> This would be disheartening news to those who chased her home Monday. After  battling with Pat Copelan and Linda Card through a :22 and :44 1/5 half, she  opened up by 2 1/2 lengths about a furlong from the finish. Fantastic Look, the  beneficiary of a perfect trip and who looked dangerous around the turn, could  make no impact late.  </P> <P> Covering the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5, the 6-5 favorite earned herself a  start in the middle leg of the La Canada series, the El Encino Stakes Jan. 15.  That would mark her initial venture around two turns, and among her likely  opponents is Breeders' Cup Distaff runner-up Gorgeous.  </P> <P> "I don't know how far she wants to go, but we'll run her in the next one and  see," said Jerry Fanning, who trains Akinemod for owner Jack Klugman. "I wasn't  so much worried about the speed in the race as when I saw (Fantastic Look)  coming up so fast.  </P> <P> "But Akinemod just kept running. She finished well and she's just a good  filly."  </P> <P> Although she had never bled in a race, Akinemod did so in her Dec. 22 work and  that's why she ran with Lasix Monday.  </P> <P> "We scoped her and it kind of worried us a little," Fanning said. "We gave her  Lasix for her next work (Dec. 28) and if she hadn't worked well with it, we  wouldn't have run her with Lasix."  </P> <P> Stevens, who has ridden her in half of her lifetime starts, thinks Akinemod  will handle a distance of ground.  </P> <P> "I don't feel it's going to be any problem," he said. "She galloped out real  strong and I didn't get her pulled up until the middle of the backstretch.  </P> <P> "She's real relaxed early and she's not speed crazy. She relaxed well today  with a horse inside (Linda Card) of her and a horse (Pat Copelan) outside of  her. She's a natural athlete. She's got more natural ability than 90% of them."  </P> <P> Akinemod's victory completed a dream afternoon for Klugman. In the opener, his  Flor 'em Jak, a 4-year-old Jaklin Klugman gelding, broke his maiden at first  asking. He is also trained by Fanning and was ridden by Stevens, who was aboard  three winners Monday.  </P> <P> "It's like being reborn," Klugman said. "My heart is going a mile a minute. I  think I've owned two winners on one card once before in my life and that was  years ago."  </P> <P> Fantastic Look, the 9-2 second choice, was 3 1/2 lengths clear of Reluctant  Guest, then came Affirmed Classic, Kiwi, Linda Card, Stocks Up and Pat Copelan.  </P> <P> Opening Verse, the unluckiest loser the first week of the meeting, may come  back in the San Fernando Stakes a week from Sunday.  </P> <P> Trained by Richard Lundy and owned by Allen Paulson, Opening Verse made his  U.S. and main track debut in Sunday's seventh race. The 4-year-old son of The  Minstrel drew the rail in the classified allowance mile, moved up comfortably  to be just off the leaders down the backside, then had nowhere to go almost the  rest of the way.  </P> <P> When he finally did get some room, it was too late and he was beaten a  half-length by Attesa, the longest shot in the field who had rallied from last  and had clear sailing outside.  </P> <P> "He sure proved he had a lot of heart in that race," said Pat Mitchell, Lundy's  assistant. "He was ready to run some more when he came back to unsaddle. He was  fine this morning and the plan is to nominate him to the San Fernando."  </P> <P> A poll of the media covering Santa Anita selected John Henry, Laffit Pincay and  Charlie Whittingham as the "best" in California thoroughbred racing through the  just-concluded 1980s.  </P> <P> John Henry, who was horse of the year in both 1981 and '84, received 17 of the  20 votes cast. Alysheba, Spectacular Bid and Ferdinand received one apiece.  </P> <P> Pincay, who is the world's second-winningest rider behind Bill Shoemaker,  outpolled Chris McCarron and Eddie Delahoussaye. Whittingham and Wayne Lukas  were the only trainers to be mentioned.  </P></p>

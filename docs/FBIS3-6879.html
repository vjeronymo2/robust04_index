			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 22 Mar Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] A government source said on the morning of 22 March  that if the UN Security Council decides to slap economic  sanctions on North Korea in connection with its suspected  nuclear weapons development, "it would be difficult" for the  Japanese Government to ban the remittance of money by ethnic  Koreans in Japan to North Korea. But he stressed that the  "Japanese Government should make every possible effort to stop  the ethnic Koreans from remitting money to North Korea if the UN  Security Council imposes the economic sanctions on North Korea."</p>

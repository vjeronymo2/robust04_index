			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Forenende declines to NKr262.7m midway FORENENDE, one of Norway's four biggest insurers, said yesterday that first-half operating profit had declined to NKr262.7m (Dollars 45.6m) from NKr278.5m a year earlier. The group blamed the decline on a NKr54m fall in net currency gains. Group premium income rose 6 per cent to NKr1.016bn while non-premium income advanced 20 per cent to NKr1.146bn. Forenende said that first-half sales rose 13 per cent to NKr2.251bn while assets at end-June were up 20 per cent from last year at NKr18.646bn. The acquisition of four finance companies constituted the majority of the growth in turnover and gross assets. The group is in the process of being acquired by Gjensidige, another Norwegian insurer, which controls 75 per cent of the company. Gjensidige expected to complete the takeover by August 1993. Forenende said the acquisition was dependent on the elimination of the company's 10 per cent limit on shareholdings and a 5 per cent limit on voting rights. It added that the board and management were positive that it would be acquired by Gjensidige.</p>

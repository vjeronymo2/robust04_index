David Collenette points to last December's election victory  by extreme nationalists in Russia as a potential threat to peace  in the future. Canada's Liberal government has promised deep  cuts in military spending, but Mr. Collenette says those  promises were based on the belief that the world had entered a  more peaceful era and that belief may no longer be valid.</p>

This was reported at the meeting held in  Bayamo to check the progress of that economic sphere. Central  Cuba's sugar agroindustrial complexes obtained superior results  in yield, base 96 [not further identified], and in reducing  electrical energy consumption, while they tied with those of the  east in recovery and amount of sugar produced.    The agroindustrial complexes of western Cuba headed sugar  recovery, making the best use of installed capabilities and cane  planting.    The progress check for the first 10 days of the harvest in  March, which was held in Bayamo, Granma Province, was presided  over by Nelson Torres, minister of the Sugar Industry, and Jose  Naranjo, chief of the team for coordination and support of the  commander in chief.</p>

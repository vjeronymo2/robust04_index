			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: New gain on Portals bid news A sudden surge in the share price of Portals, the specialist paper group, prompted the company to announce that it had received a bid approach. The statement threw a spotlight on De La Rue, bank note printer, Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper producer, and the Dutch group KNP BT, as potential suitors. Portals, which controls 50 per cent of the world market for bank note paper, first saw its shares rise sharply on Tuesday. The gain was apparently on the back of rumours that the company would secure a contract linked to the redesign of the US dollar. Yesterday, the shares jumped a further 99 to 765p. Market sources said concern over the earlier share price rise had prompted a Stock Exchange inquiry. The Exchange would only say it 'automatically looks at any unusual share price movements'. Arjo refused to comment on the speculation, although company sources were said to have denied the rumour. De La Rue, which has a cash pile estimated at around Pounds 200m, was refusing to be drawn. Shares in Arjo slipped 1 1/2 to 297p. De La Rue fell 7 to 878p after hitting a low of 872p. Analysts said Portals had a break-up value of 800p a share, but could attract around 950p, which would translate to an offer of about Pounds 615m.</p>

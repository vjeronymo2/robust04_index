			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (12): How the paper mill was saved - Theresa Byrne on the new corporate culture at Spruce Falls, Ontario When workers struck a deal to buy the Spruce Falls paper mill at Kapuskasing, Ontario, in late 1991, the whole town felt it had been granted a reprieve. 'The euphoria of just having avoided death, so to speak, was running through the air,' says Mr Denis Turcotte, vice-president and general manager of mill operations. Mr Turcotte led the group of employees which now owns 52 per cent of the mill, located about 800km north of Toronto. The story is a microcosm of the pressures felt in recent years by companies and workers in the Canadian forestry industry. It illustrates the sacrifices and changes in corporate culture required to maintain a competitive footing. The drive to save Spruce Falls began when the previous owners of the mill, Kimberly-Clark and the New York Times, decided to cut their exposure in the Canadian newsprint industry. The two US companies offered to hand over the mill to the employees, contingent on the sale of a nearby hydro-electric generating plant to Ontario Hydro. Without an agreement, the owners warned, they would shut three of the mill's four newsprint machines, putting 1,200 people out of work. After months of tense negotiations, which at times hovered on the brink of failure, Spruce Falls Acquisition Corp bought the mill for one dollar in December 1991. 'It was a long, drawn-out courtship,' says Mr Norman Leybourne, leader of the coalition of the five local trade union branches which represent the workers. 'We had many arguments.' Under the deal, the employees own 52 per cent of the operating company, known as Spruce Falls Inc. Another 7 per cent is held by residents of Kapuskasing (population 10,000) and surrounding communities. Tembec, a major Canadian pulp and paper producer which has its origins in an employee buy-out of a Quebec newsprint mill, acquired a 41 per cent stake in Spruce Falls. Tembec resisted efforts to turn Spruce Falls into a co-operative and its president, Mr Frank Dottori, took over as chief executive of Spruce Falls. Ontario Hydro bought the Spruce Falls power plant. In what has become a sensitive issue, the mill will get free power for 10 years plus a CDollars 34m non-interest bearing loan. Mr John Johnson, forestry analyst with Richardson Greenshields, defends the package, saying: 'It's not like a government subsidy. It was part of the deal.' Mr Leybourne says that the new company's goal is to 'modernise and grow, with real permanent jobs. It's not just to survive.' The cornerstone of its strategy is a CDollars 300m modernisation programme due to be completed by 1994. A CDollars 100m thermo-mechanical pulp line is expected to be fully operational by the end of August. This facility will boost TMP capacity by 500 tonnes a day, to 825 tonnes. The cost will be well below the CDollars 130m originally projected, largely due to Tembec's expertise in building such plants, says Mr Turcotte. The new pulp line will enable Spruce Falls to supply a wider variety of products, including brighter, bleached paper. Further diversification will come from a CDollars 20-25m sawmill now in the planning stages. Marketing operations, too, have been upgraded. In the old days, the sales department was isolated from production. 'Every problem that they had was our fault,' says Mr Leybourne, the union leader. Spruce Falls' marketing and sales office is still based in Toronto. But co-ordination with the mill has been improved by moving the order entry system to Kapuskasing. At the same time, managers and workers are having to adjust to a new corporate culture which emphasises consultation. 'This is a merging of capitalism and socialism,' says Mr Leybourne. 'The system that we had up until now has been a reactionary, master-slave relationship.' The workforce has shrunk to about 800 from 1,400 in mid-1991, although the pain of lay-offs has been alleviated by offering some workers temporary construction jobs on the new pulp line. Greater flexibility and a higher level of productivity are being demanded from the employees who remain. Mr Turcotte cites the example of repairs to a small pump. In the Kimberly-Clark days, union rules required up to 10 people to do the job. Now, only a millwright and a pipe-fitter are deployed. Participation by all levels in decision-making and problem-solving is a cornerstone of the new corporate philosophy. Disciplinary hearings have been speeded up, and disciplinary committees are now composed of both union and management representatives. 'I think one major risk is that, as a company, we do not successfully complete this cultural change we're looking for,' says Mr Turcotte. Spruce Falls has been profitable since the employee buy-out. Net income for the 10 months ended September 30 1992 was CDollars 4.5m on sales of CDollars 94.6m. For the three months to December 31 1992, the company reported earnings of CDollars 2.5m on sales of CDollars 31.6m. The new owners say they are taking a more aggressive approach than Kimberly-Clark to environmental concerns. In an effort to protect fish habitat, this summer marks the last that the Kapuskasing River, which borders the mill, will be used to transport logs. In addition, the company has started to build a CDollars 38m secondary effluent treatment facility, which is due be operational by summer 1994. An investment of CDollars 2.5m in the newspaper de-inking and recycling plant last year means that newsprint is now produced with up to 15 per cent recycled content. Additional spending of CDollars 7m in 1993 will increase the average recycled content to 25 per cent. In the short term, the continuing over-supply of newsprint in North America remains a worry. But given reduced production costs at Kapuskasing, Mr Turcotte predicts that low prices would force 90 per cent of other mills out of business ahead of Spruce Falls. The company hopes to benefit in the long run from its advanced technology and proximity to high-quality black spruce and aspen forests. In words echoed by many other forestry executives, Mr Leybourne says: 'If you don't change, you die.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J Rees] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein April 5 SAPA -- The National Party [NP]  was reaching the stage where it could no longer prevent its  supporters from retaliating against intimidation by the African  National Congress, a NP official warned in the Orange Free State  on Tuesday. NP Free State elections agent and provincial  candidate Frik van Heerden accused the ANC of neglecting its  duties and not controlling its supporters. Speaking at a  meeting of the Independent Electoral Commission's party liaison  committee, he said the IEC's operation access had failed to  level the political playing field.</p>

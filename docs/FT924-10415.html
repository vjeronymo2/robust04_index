			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: Why things happen - Dance THE LATEST Second Stride production, Why Things Happen, demonstrates with marvellous authority why this company is among the most remarkable theatrical troupes in Britain. No local company has worked more consistently to combine diverse theatrical elements into its productions; and Why Things Happen plunges us at once into the kind of mysterious and satisfying web of feeling that can only occur with Second Stride. The director, as always, is Ian Spink; the writer is Marty Cruickshank; the designer is Antony McDonald; the music (largely by JS Bach) is arranged and directed by Judith Weir. There are just three performers - a director, a dancer, a musician - and much of the time in Why Things Happen we experience speech, dance and music as discrete acts. Each clearly affects us on a different level of consciousness, and so we become aware of the many layers of feeling within ourselves: a quintessential Second Stride feat. But there are also connections. The director (Timothy Walker) is the central figure. He interviews the musician (Charles Mutter), who speaks of the Bach sonata, its importance to him, his attitude to rehearsing and performing it, and its internal structure. And the director also has a complex, adult, fragmented relationship with the dancer (Joanne Leighton). To complete the third side of the triangle, she dances at times to the Bach, with both spontaneity and formal concentration. Meanwhile, in words, the director addresses concerns of his own - his mother's letters, nuclear physics, a whole collage of quotations, the hairs on his legs. How do all these things connect? Of course, they don't - except that they reproduce the complexity of ordinary human existence, the way in which, in our daily lives, our minds run simultaneously on numerous tracks at once. Why Things Happen lasts some 75 minutes, and the first 55 of which are on a very high poetic level. Watching, listening, feeling, you are bewildered, stimulated, gratified. The pleasure begins in rhythm and elegance. As in several Spink theatre pieces since 1983, the strange modernist ordering of spoken material into arrays of soliloquy, dialogue, exposition and quotation has a rhythm and humanity that evoke the poetry of TS Eliot. The last 20 minutes decline, not in elegance but in tension. There is a pointlessly elaborate scene-change - McDonald, though among our most remarkable designers, is too fond of clutter - and the ending steers too close to sentimentality. But nothing breaks the work's mini-layered spell Spink's choreography for Leighton is always shaped in handsome, rigorous phases; and she dances with a movingly strict absorption. Though she is not always yet a natural speaker, all three performers have been directed to give eloquent, unmannered performances. Numerous meanings pour forth as you watch. By one light, the woman is a symbol of private life, the violinist of pure art. But the dancer is herself both mistress and muse to the director. And both of them have their private needs, their unfaithfulnesses to each other, and their independent artistic integrity. The director half withdraws into abstracted concentration upon other issues, but half becomes a latter day Othello, contemplating his need to kill her. This latter thread turns into a treatment of 'Each man kills the thing he loves.' And, as the director talks of the internal composition of the atom, his words - though apparently irrelevant - actively cast light on everything we have heard: the organisation of the Bach; the structure of a private life; the interaction of independent elements; the way that huge energies are powerfully yet perilously contained within a single unit. AT THE ICA, until October 31, and on tour until November 14.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SONOMA COUNTY;  </P> <P> DRIVE-UP WINDOW PLANNED FOR VOTERS  </P> <P> Sonoma County has come up with a plan to make casting an absentee ballot as  easy as buying a fast-food burger. Election officials are opening a window  where motorists can pull up, sign their names and drop off their marked  ballots. The window will shorten the often long lines of early absentee voters  filing into the elections office, Deputy Registrar of Voters Janice Atkinson  said. Her idea was approved easily at a recent meeting of the Sonoma County  Board of Supervisors, despite some doubters. The plan is expected to take  effect after the first of the year, when the registrar's office moves to a new  building in the county government complex in Santa Rosa. The new system,  including the "teller's" window and drive-up ramp, is expected to cost $9,100.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Debbie Chu] </F>   [Text] China and Britain are now drafting an agreement on  the Chek Lap Kok airport financial arrangements -- to be signed  within the next few days, according to the chief negotiators.  The Sino-British Airport Committee team leaders Guo Fengmin and  Hugh Davies emerged from a three-hour meeting yesterday to say  that further progress had been made and that experts will  prepare a draft deal.    Governor Chris Patten said "we are quite close to an  agreement."    "Obviously, this week has seen several strides forward but  we  are not quite home yet," he said. "I prefer not to use words  like agreement until everything is cut and dry.... It is  important for both sides to have a piece of paper which embodies  precisely what's been agreed that they can use, for example,  that we can use when we are talking to bankers and to others.  We want to get everything sorted out as cleanly and clearly as  possible."    Financial Secretary Sir Hamish MacLeod said he was  encouraged. "We are in a positive mood. I think both sides are  working hard to try and reach an agreement and resolve any  outstanding points," he said.    Sources close to the negotiations said the Chinese side  "seemed to be OK with the figures" contained in the latest  government financial package, removing the major obstacle over  the dispute which has dragged on for nearly two years. But they  were concerned that substantial differences and "new problems"  might crop up in the process of "putting the figures into a  document".    British team leader, Mr Davies, said: "We agreed that the  next step should be for experts on both sides to meet as soon as  possible to draw up documents which will form the basis of  agreement between us. That is extremely important because  without such a document it will be difficult to persuade the  finance houses to provide the finance for the airport and Mass  Transit Railway Corporation," he said.    He hinted there were still some issues in contention. "If it  had been totally resolved I think I would have come out and told  you. If it were only wording without substantive issues we could  have signed it yesterday or this morning. There are some issues  which need to be sorted out. I hope we will reach an agreement  before the end of this month. If possible within the next few  days but everything depends on the drafting group."    Mr Guo said the two sides "still need to study some of the  details and wording in the document".    The fourth financial package provides for an equity  injection  of $60.3 billion to contain borrowings by the railway  corporation and the Provisional Airport Authority at about $23  billion. Mainland sources confirmed there was no new demand on  the level of equity although China continued to hope that the  government would be able to reduce the debts to run beyond 1997.    The negotiators had disputed whether the borrowings by the  two corporations should be considered as government borrowings,  which were limited to $5 billion under the Memorandum of  Understanding.    It is understood that the issue was no longer contentious,  with neither side insisting that a clear definition of the  borrowings be written into the draft agreement.    "But the details and figures used by the two sides at the  talks have to be spelled out very precisely and in a sustainable  form so that the agreement can be implemented," a source said.    It is understood an agreement was reached on the disposal of  land along the rail link and the issue of cost-monitoring. The  two sides will leave further discussion on the Airport  Corporation Bill to experts after finalising the financial  package, sources said.</p>

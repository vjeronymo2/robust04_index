			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (5): Doubts about Government support - The concerns of associations catering for smaller social and ethnic groups The public image of the Young Men's Christian Association is probably still more akin to its foundation 150 years ago by an evangelical draper's apprentice than to contemporary reality. Not only does today's YMCA, in spite of its name, cater for both sexes, it is also the biggest specialist provider of accommodation for young people in England. It already houses 6,000 young people at 67 locations, and last month the YMCA launched a Pounds 35m building programme which will increase its housing stock by 17 per cent. While traditional hostels still exist, the new programme - funded by charitable donations, local authorities and the Housing Corporation - will provide self-catering flats and bed-sit complexes. Counselling and training services are offered alongside housing. In 1992, the YMCA opened Britain's first foyers - hostels linking accommodation with training for unemployed young people - under a government pilot scheme. One of the central values of the housing association movement is its ability to house sections of the community with particular needs. But many specialist associations have neither the reputation nor resources of national charities such as the YMCA or the Anchor Housing Trust, which provides housing for the elderly. There is concern that a climate of declining government grants, coupled with lenders' preference for large, established organisations, may put the future of smaller specialist associations at risk. 'Things are getting worse rather than better,' says Mr Barrington Billings, director of Derby People's housing association, an ethnic minority association which was set up three years ago and has 130 housing units. Problems recounted by Mr Billings are similar to the experiences of many people from the ethnic minority communities trying to launch small businesses. 'Potential funders and partners ask for evidence of track record, reserves and all the other things that new organisations do not have. There is, in addition, a perception of black organisations as high risk. That is a myth which we have to break.' The public grant to housing associations, currently averaging 65 per cent of new building costs, is declining and is expected to drop to 55 per cent by 1995-96. Public financial support remains particularly important for small specialist associations, and continuing reductions in subsidy would threaten the survival of some. An eventual outcome could be the withdrawal of specialist associations from house building, while retaining letting and management functions. Small associations already sometimes carry out developments in conjunction with larger, well-established ones. 'It is often necessary to piggy-back in this way,' says Mr Billings. 'But you are then at the mercy of the bigger associations and have to accept their decisions on priorities and charges. Smaller associations are looking at other options like consortia purchasing arrangements and groups schemes. 'The ultimate solution would be mergers to form larger associations. But while this may be economically efficient, it is not necessarily in the interests of the particular services we are trying to provide.' Some of these particular interests could be lost if specialist associations withdrew from building. Mr Billings points out that ethnic minority housing associations are, for example, more likely to try to encourage the employment of local black people in building projects. Although ethnic minority housing associations must have a majority of black people on their management committees they do not, in spite of their name, provide accommodation only for the ethnic minority communities. But their closer relationship with these communities often gives them advantages in identifying needs. Mr Tony Soares, director of Westway, a relatively small black housing association in London, shares the concerns. 'Lenders have a typically suspicious view of new, small organisations. But housing associations are a far safer prospect for them than many of the private business ventures that they support. 'The Housing Corporation has enormous powers to regulate an association that looks as though it is running into financial trouble or has management problems and, at the end of the day, you've at least got the houses. The task is getting through the door of some of the big institutions and persuading them to revise their thinking.' An idea which may help tackle the familiar problems of lenders preferring large, established borrowers is being developed by CDS Co-operative housing society and housing association specialists at Lewis Silkin, CDS's solicitors. Aimed at housing co-operatives, the approach could eventually be extended to small housing associations as well. CDS hopes to set up a provident society - the Co-operative Housing Finance Society - as an intermediary between lenders and borrowers. It would provide co-operatives and small housing associations with management support, and guarantee lenders interest payments for a specified period in the event of problems arising. 'The society would be offering risk management and default management,' said Mr David Rodgers, CDS chief executive. 'Borrowers would be expected to perform within tighter controls than under a normal loan deed, and if they looked as though they were running into difficulties it would show at an early stage. This would provide reassurance to lenders, and should eventually lead to lower rates.' If the plan takes off - and the Housing Corporation is giving encouragement to it - representatives of lenders would be invited to join the society's board to generate maximum confidence. New arrangements for funding housing associations catering for people with special needs will be outlined by the government shortly. Associations receive support from the Corporation for providing homes for people with special needs, and there has been concern that these could be threatened by the government's community care reforms. Sir George Young, housing minister, announced last month that arrangements for paying special needs management allowance to housing associations would continue unchanged for another year, pending the new proposals. The National Federation of Housing Associations says continued Housing Corporation funding is 'desperately needed' to safeguard housing schemes for vulnerable people. It is calling for greater certainty and flexibility in funding housing association community care schemes.</p>

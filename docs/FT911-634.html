			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt announces NT investment Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, announced that Northern Telecom is to make a 'large investment' at its telephone equipment plant in Cwmcarn, just outside the Monmouth constituency, safeguarding 600 jobs. He expressed 'delight' that regional selective assistance had helped produce the project, though he could not put a figure on the project. Northern Telecom would not comment on the amount to be spent on the factory, suggesting that the announcement had been rushed forward. It is believed the sum will run into tens of millions of pounds and could lead to the creation of another 200 or so jobs.</p>

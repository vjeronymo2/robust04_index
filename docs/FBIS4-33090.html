			<p>BFN     [Text] As I said a moment ago, today's convening of the  parliamentarians has been postponed or canceled. Senator Clark  Parent raises the question of security.    [Begin recording in Creole] [Parent] Well, I do not believe  it even reached the stage of postponement because it had not yet  been convened, because safety ... [pauses] a lot of other things  are taken into consideration ... [pauses] because it is ...  [pauses] we are experiencing coup d'etat logic and ... [pauses]  I think these are the reasons.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sen. Parent, do you think this  session will be possible within the next few days, given that  many parliamentarians are already on vacation?    [Parent] Well, I believe the vacation period will end  between  now and 13 June. The vacation period will come to an end and the  Chamber of Deputies will return to work. Its vacation will come  to an end and everything will return to normal.    [Correspondent] Do you not believe, nonetheless, that there  will be opposition toward the unofficial office?    [Parent] Do you mean the office of Bernard Sansaricq or ...?    [Correspondent, interrupting] That is it.    [Parent] Well, I think a time will come, a time when the  country can no longer carry on with this demagogy. I do not  think the country can carry on indefinitely while a small group  of people holds the country hostage, preventing the people's  choice from being respected. [end recording]</p>

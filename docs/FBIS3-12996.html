			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "On the Path to Conflict"] </F>   [Text] The confrontation, or perhaps even battle, with the  settlers in Hebron is only a question of time. It will either  come now or in another few months. The question is whether the  Government of Israel will decide right away, on the basis of the  security situation in the town, to issue an evacuation order  against the Jewish inhabitants.    The other possible date for a confrontation is in the  summer,  as July approaches. According to the Declaration of Principles  [DOP], a significant change must take place in the city in  another few months. It will be recalled that according to the  agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will redeploy no  later than on the eve of the elections to the authority (the  elections are to take place nine months after the DOP goes into  effect). The accord says that "in deploying its military  forces, Israel will be guided by the principle that its military  forces should be redeployed outside populated areas."    This means that IDF brigades will no longer be deployed in  the center of Hebron, just as IDF units will not be able to move  around the centers of Nabulus and Gaza, unless our aim is not to  implement the accord with the Palestinians. Under the current  security situation, there will be no choice but to offer the  Hebron settlers the opportunity to move to Qiryat Arba'. If any  of the Jewish settlers in Hebron believe that following the  massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs and the frequent  humiliation they cause their neighbors, their security will come  from the Palestinian police, they are being overly optimistic.  Israeli security experts do not share that view.    The reason for the evacuation is therefore one of security  rather than politics. When the ministers argue about the Jewish  presence in Hebron, most of them base the need to evacuate on  security reasons. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer, who was coordinator of activities in the  territories and the military commander of the West Bank, heads  the proposal for the evacuation of Hebron and bases it on the  need to defend the Jewish residents and not to please the  Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre. The ministers  who heard the reports by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq and Major  General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, got the  impression that they are also worried about the security aspect.  The Jews of Hebron have become a target, one of them said.  Immediately after the massacre, another security official  proposed to evacuate Hebron and Qiryat Arba', even temporarily.  He was concerned about the women and children. Everybody  listened, but his proposal was not discussed at that stage.    From a military viewpoint, we have reached an absurd  situation in Hebron. No precedent for the number of soldiers  required to defend the Hebron settlers can be found in the  history of border incidents or the defense of any other  settlement. The ministers were shocked by the figures quoted by  the chief of staff. Although we are in the midst of peace  negotiations, the defense of the Hebron settlers is more like  war deployment. There are times when numbers are not what  counts -- for instance, if there were a need to defend  Jerusalem. But that is not the case with Hebron, especially  since Qiryat Arba' is not far away. A top IDF commander must  tell the Hebron settlers candidly that it is very difficult to  provide them with the security they expect. If that situation  continues, it will not be enough to deploy in the town even a  large part of the soldiers serving in the entire West Bank, and  there might even be a need to expel Arabs from Hebron.    The forecast of Avraham Ahituv, who was Shin Bet chief in  the  late 1970's and before that headed its Arab Department, is being  realized. In the 1970's, some of the settlers began to  infiltrate into Arab Hebron without permission. Some took  unbridled actions even back then. Until that time, the  situation between the two populations had been relatively calm.  Ahituv came to Prime Minister Menahem Begin and told him that  he was worried about "the infiltration into Hebron." He told  Begin that we had arrived at a modus vivendi in the Cave of the  Patriarchs and that there were good foundations for coexistence,  but that the infiltration into Hebron might cause problems, for  the security forces as well. He told Begin that this is what  will hurt his party's basic tenet that Jews and Arabs can live  together in peace under Israeli rule in Eretz Yisra'el. The  entry into Hebron will only increase the friction and hatred,  and clashes will become unavoidable.    I dare to guess that if Rabin were told that the Hebron  settlers would leave now of their own free will, he would  welcome it. He is not pleased that the proposal was raised by  ministers, because this may hurt the negotiations. At least two  ministers are ready to discuss evacuating the settlers from  Hebron within the framework of the negotiations with the  Palestinians. At least another eight ministers are prepared to  support an Israeli-initiated evacuation.    The Americans view it from a different angle. They are  concerned about 'Arafat's growing weakness, the risk to the  peace negotiations, and the inadequate steps Israel took  following the massacre. In their view, Israel must immediately  make a unilateral move to put the talks back on track. The  evacuation of Hebron for security reasons would be such an  example, and their representatives are showing interest in it.  Rabin will definitely be asked about it during his visit to  Washington.    But even the Americans, like the Palestinians, understand  that you cannot ask Refa'el Eytan to join the coalition and,  with the same breath, order the evacuation of the Jewish  settlers from Hebron.</p>

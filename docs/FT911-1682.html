			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Brewery donates site for Edinburgh tourist project SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle Breweries is donating the 10-acre site of a former brewery next to Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh to help fund a tourist project aimed at enhancing the city's historic centre. Mr James Scott, of Scottish Enterprise, the new government body working for the development of the Scottish economy, said the donation of the land by S&amp;N and an adjoining 1.5-acre site by British Gas 'represents corporate generosity on a scale not seen before in Scotland'. Chartered surveyors said the land might be valued at up to Pounds 5m on the open market, depending on the purpose for which it was developed. It has been contaminated by industrial use. The centrepiece would be a Pounds 15m building named the Younger Universe after one of S&amp;N's brands of beer. It would house a visitor attraction entitled The Dynamic Earth, explaining the creation of the planet and the threats it faces. It might attract 500,000 visitors a year. The Younger Universe would be financed from the sale of the rest of the site to developers. The plan envisages building quality offices, small workshops, housing and a 150-bedroom hotel aimed at improving a rundown area of Edinburgh. S&amp;N is handing the site over to the Holyrood Brewery Foundation, a charitable trust, which will seek planning permission for the project. The cost of the entire development will be about Pounds 100m and it could be completed in 1994. Scottish Enterprise is making grants of more than Pounds 5m available, partly for site reclamation. Mr Alick Rankin, chairman of S&amp;N, said he was sure his shareholders would appreciate the company's decision not to sell the site. The donation was a recognition of the benefit the company had gained from this part of Edinburgh and was likely to contribute to the affluence of Scotland. Mr Michael Hopkins, the architect responsible for the new stand at Lord's cricket ground, is designing the Younger Universe. It will include a stretched membrane roof resembling a tent.</p>

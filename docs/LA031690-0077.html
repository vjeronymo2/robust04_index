			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> REPORTING ON DRUGS IN KGTV'S 'CARTEL CONNECTION' IS FIRST RATE  </P> <P> Reality permeates "The Cartel Connection," the hourlong KGTV (Channel 10)  special airing tonight at 9.  </P> <P> In a matter-of-fact, in-depth style rarely found in locally produced  programming, the show examines the production and distribution of cocaine,  tracing it from its manufacture in the mountains of South America to the  streets of Southern California. Reporter Mark Matthews and photographer Richard  Klein traveled to Peru, Bolivia, Columbia and Mexico to chronicle the business  of cocaine.  </P> <P> Instead of simply parroting State Department propaganda, or relying on the  cliches that often make up coverage of drug trafficking, Matthews and Klein  take it a step further. They ask tough questions and don't settle for  portraying the United States as the white knight fighting the good fight.  </P> <P> Reports of drug-growing operations in South America often stop at footage of a  Drug Enforcement Administration bust. However, in Peru and Bolvia, Matthews and  Klein got off the State Department tourist train to develop their own sources.  They talked to residents, venturing into the slums of Lima, to present the  interdependence, in terms of real people, of the economy and cocaine traffic.  </P> <P> The role of the American government in attempting to slow the industry is  depicted, but Matthews and Klein are not always satisfied with the answers  provided by official sources. From a herbicide that kills other crops as well  as coca plants, to American helicopters that at times sit unused because the  Peruvian government can't afford gasoline, the viewer is left with serious  questions about the effectiveness of U.S. programs.  </P> <P> In Colombia, where a "drug war" is in full swing, the local team touches all  the bases endlessly covered by the network news -- the opulent power of the  drug lords and the fear that affects all public officials -- but once again  they go a step further. Top-level Colombian officials are asked why it took so  long for Colombia to officially declare war on the drug lords.  </P> <P> And, again, they talk to everyday Colombians about the damage that U.S.  policies are having on the country's non-drug-related industries, such as the  coffee industry and tourism, although it seems hard to blame the United States  for Colombia's problems attracting tourists.  </P> <P> From Colombia, the trail continues through Mexico, where "90 percent" of the  expensive air system designed to stop smuggling comes up empty. Instead of just  depicting deficiencies, the program points out that measures to slow drugs  coming across the border are having some effect. They use a smuggler, not the  government, to confirm the facts.  </P> <P> A "mule" who was caught trying to bring cocaine across the border says that  someone making $8 to $10 an hour is going to find it tough to resist a $50,000  payday. That's reality.  </P> <P> In San Diego and Los Angeles, Matthews and Klein again break away from official  presentations to present a broader picture. They hit the streets to talk to an  active dealer, the type of enterprise reporting rarely undertaken by local news  operations.  </P> <P> Although most of "The Cartel Connection" has aired during Channel 10's regular  newscasts, it carries far more power as a single package, when the viewer can  follow the trail step by step. The big picture, the relationship of a poor  Peruvian farm worker to a crack addict in San Diego, becomes far clearer, as  does the huge scope of the problem.  </P> <P> "The Cartel Connection" exposes the complexities of what is truly an  international problem, created by rampant drug use in the United States,  without pulling any punches or accepting at face value the usual answers  provided by the involved governments.  </P></p>

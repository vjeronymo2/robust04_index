			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS BEAT UCLA FOR FIRST TITLE;  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL: CAL STATE LONG BEACH GETS AUTOMATIC BID TO NCAA FINAL FOUR. BRUINS  PROBABLY WILL MAKE TOURNAMENT, TOO.  </P> <P> Forget that both UCLA and Cal State Long Beach both were virtually assured  trips to the NCAA Final Four.  </P> <P> The big championship could wait.  </P> <P> The Bruins and 49ers apparently decided that a Western Intercollegiate  Volleyball Assn. title was enough to keep their interests.  </P> <P> In the center of the action in Saturday's tournament final at Cal State  Northridge was Jason Stimfig, Long Beach's spindly 6-foot freshman setter.  </P> <P> Stimfig, a walk-on from Manhattan Beach Mira Costa High, did not play his best  match of the season. In fact, he struggled so much in the third game that he  was temporarily replaced.  </P> <P> But he was around when it counted as the top-ranked 49ers rebounded to win  their first WIVA title, 15-10, 11-15, 3-15, 15-8, 15-9.  </P> <P> Stimfig, starting only his second big match of the season, ignited Long Beach  in the deciding game, which was played on point-per-play, quick-score format.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 5-5, Stimfig put down an over-the-shoulder dunk. On the  ensuing play, he made a big play at the net with a block for a point.  </P> <P> "I noticed it was a tired pass. It was just hanging there, so I hit it,"  Stimfig said of his dunk. "It was a real emotional turnaround."  </P> <P> Stimfig started the season as a redshirt but was activated by Coach Ray Ratelle  midway through the season.  </P> <P> "The more I looked at him in practice, I just knew he had to play for us,"  Ratelle said. "Of course, I didn't know he'd do what he's been doing."  </P> <P> During the second and third games Saturday, what he did was self-destruct.  </P> <P> On more than one occasion, 49er hitters breezed by without attempting a hit due  to miscommunication on the set.  </P> <P> From the bench, Stimfig calculated an adjustment, then made it work during the  final two games.  </P> <P> "They were squaring up on our star hitters," Stimfig said. "I had to move it  around more."  </P> <P> Freshman Brent Hilliard led the 49ers with 26 kills.  </P> <P> Long Beach (27-6) earned the WIVA's automatic bid to the Final Four with the  victory.  </P> <P> Third-ranked UCLA (23-5), the second-place finisher in a conference that has  delivered all 20 NCAA champions, should advance as a wild-card team. The Final  Four will be played May 4-5 at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.  </P> <P> UCLA has 13 national championships, but Long Beach will make its first  appearance since 1973.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Total fends off European recession TOTAL, the French oil group, yesterday announced a modest decline in net profits, to FFr1.8bn (Dollars 317.5m) from FFr1.9bn for the first half of 1993. The result underlines its resilience to recession in Europe. Turnover dipped from FFr68.76bn to FFr67.85bn, in what the company described as a difficult economic environment. Operating income profits, however, rose slightly from FFr3.4bn to FFr3.49bn. 'It was a good result given the economic background,' said Mr John Wellemeyer, oil industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. He forecast net profits of about FFr3.6bn for the full year. Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman of Total, said the results reflected a varied performance across the group's core businesses, and that the benefits of its 'refocusing' strategy, launched in 1990, would start to be felt from next year. He said the group had begun to seek alliances in gas distribution and electricity supply, and that this presented strong growth opportunities. In the first six months, the exploration and production division was hit by the decline in crude oil prices, from Dollars 19 per barrel to about Dollars 18.20. As a result, operating income fell to FFr1.19bn from FFr1.31bn in the first half of 1992. Oil production, excluding the Middle East, fell from 154,000 to 135,000 barrels per day. Gas production also fell, from 972m to 941m cu ft. per day. Total said the reductions reflected the impact of disposals. New developments in the second half would offset these declines. Its 1992 forecast for production growth of 50 per cent between 1990 and 1995 remained unaffected, the group said. The chemicals division, affected by the European recession and the downturn in the automotive and construction industries, also saw profits decline. Operating profits fell to FFr753m from FFr852m. The trading and Middle East division increased operating profits from FFr304m to FFr434m, reflecting an improvement in shipping rates in the first six months of the year. Mr Tchuruk also raised the prospect of a further sale of the French state's holding in the oil group. Although the government has said it wants to maintain its stake in Total at about 5 per cent, the effects of capital increases during the year have raised this to 8 per cent. The sale of the surplus 3 per cent, which is valued at about FFr2bn, could be made at any time, he said.</p>

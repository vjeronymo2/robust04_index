			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (5): Group A - Switzerland The Swiss have not appeared in the finals since 1966 and they have not won a game at this stage since 1954 when, as hosts, they beat Italy twice. Two good results against Italy in the qualifying rounds - a 2-2 draw away and a 1-0 home win - have brought them to the US. The Swiss have two of Europe's brightest young stars, striker Stephane Chapuisat (Borussia Dortmund) and midfielder Ciriaco Sforza (Kaiserslautern). They are among a growing group of young Swiss players playing in the Bundesliga, which also includes Adrian Knup (VfB Stuttgart) who averages two goals every three internationals. The team produced sparkling performances in the qualifying rounds, notably away to Italy where they led 2-0 with five minutes to go, but with qualification in their grasp their results worsened and in the end they pipped Portugal by just a point. The coach, Ray Hodgson, an Englishman, has a settled team but the bulk of his squad still plays in the Swiss league, where the level of competition is at best mediocre. The question is whether they will play up to the level of their best players or down to the level to which they are accustomed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Brigadier General G.J.M. </F> Bastiaans, head of the UN military observers in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, by Marjon van Royen in Zagreb on 27  April: "`Muslims Provoked Attack on Gorazde,' Netherlands UN  General Says"]    [Text] Zagreb, 27 Apr -- "It was the Muslims who provoked  the Serbian attack on Gorazde. The Serbs perhaps reacted  `excessively.' But ultimately it was the Muslims who pushed the  Bosnian Serb Army to the bloodbath of the civilian population of  Gorazde with continual provocations."    This was said by Netherlands Brigadier General G.J.M.  Bastiaans in his office in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  headquarters in Zagreb. General Bastiaans is the head of the UN  Military Observers (UNMO) in the former Yugoslavia. After the  limited air strikes on a number of Serbian tanks around Gorazde,  50 of his observers were taken hostage in the area by the  Bosnian Serbs.    But that is not the reason, Bastiaans said, why he had so  many questions about the eagerness of calls for tough action  against the Serbs in recent weeks. "Dropping lumps of iron has  consequences. The Serbs really do not think: Let us just accept  this. Air strikes change the relations. They end the  possibility of further negotiations. Anyone who had thought  that this was not true, really is not of this world," Bastiaans  said.    The general is convinced that there was a "propaganda  campaign" around Gorazde by the Muslims. Everyone, including  NATO, had walked into it with open eyes," he said. "They used  all the parties," Bastiaans continued. "The Muslims provoked  the Serbs with shootings and harassment to such a point that  they had little option other than using the heavy weapons."    When asked whether he thought that action should be taken in  Gorazde, Bastiaans answered: "That is perhaps what public  opinion in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world wants.  But you must not forget the role played by the Muslims in the  conflict.    Looking at it in purely military terms, the Muslims have  superiority of numbers and a lack of heavy weapons. With the  Bosnian Serbs, things are the other way around. Small arms  fire, as used by the Muslims, does not appeal to public opinion.  However, big bangs ringing in the ears of the civilian  population certainly do. If, as was also the case in Sarajevo,  you then ensure that the Serbs come under fire from within a  city, they will respond. In so doing, you can be sure that some  of the civilian population will be hit. That can then be filmed  later on. And it is not very nice to look at.    When it comes down to it, the problem with the Serbs is that  they overreact, that they do not dish out one big bang and then  say that things are settled. As a result they play right into  the hands of the Muslims."    [van Royen] What did the Muslims do to "provoke" the Serbs  so  acutely? Surely they are the injured party? After all, they  are the ones shut up in the reservations we call "safe areas."    [Bastiaans] Yes, but the party on top can also be  threatened.  By and large, the Serbs have respected all agreements pretty  well. It is just that time and time again they lose their cool  whenever they are challenged. Not for nothing does the NATO  communique contain that little sentence saying that the Muslims  must also stop shooting. Officially, the Muslims in the safe  areas must surrender their weapons. However, apart from in  Srebrenica, this has never happened.    Besides military and political considerations, the Serbian  attack on Gorazde is also tinged with a little bit of  frustration. The Serbs offered to negotiate with the Muslims,  but their offer was rejected. In the strip of no-man's land two  km around Gorazde, the Muslims have been digging like mad. They  are extending their trenches through that strip so as to gain as  great an advantage as possible. That is one of the methods that  is being used. You do not always have to start shooting to  provoke someone. So if you now suddenly draw just a 20-km  line, behind which the Serbs must pull back their heavy weapons,  then militarily speaking you have done everything to benefit the  Muslims. Compared with the situation as it was before, however,  the Muslims now have actually surrendered some territory. On  the other hand, you must not give the Serbs the impression that  the Muslims have won out in all respects.</p>

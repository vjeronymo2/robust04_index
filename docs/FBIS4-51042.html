			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Smith Kline, the fifth  largest American pharmaceuticals and medical products company,  has invested four million U.S. dollars in Tianjin ten years ago  and had made a total of 460 million yuan (about 50 million U.S.  dollars) in profits by the end of last year.    As China's second-largest pharmaceutical enterprise, the  Tianjin Smith Kline Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. is expected to  record another 670 million yuan in sales this year.    Occupying seven ha of land in the eastern suburbs of the  north China port city of Tianjin, the Sino-U.S. joint venture  is composed of a preparation plant and a raw materials plant.  The highway linking Tianjin with the factory was built  specially by Tianjin municipality for the enterprise.    With advanced technology from the American pharmaceutical  giant, the venture has developed several products which have  become household names across China, doubling its sales volume  since 1990.    So far, the joint venture has established over 100 sales  offices in 25 provinces and municipalities across China. Most  of the sales representatives have received special training from  the American company.    "Our unique method in sales is one of the most important  reasons for our success," said Zhang Zhi, deputy general manager  of the company, adding that the enormous Chinese market has  proved ideal for the method.    According to Zhang, the company will put a series of new  products onto the Chinese market this year so as to maintain its  competitiveness here.</p>

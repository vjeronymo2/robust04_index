			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NICKOLAI PADS STREET STOCK LEAD WITH MAIN EVENT VICTORY AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley may work for a local Ford dealer, but he sure  knows how to drive his Chevy.  </P> <P> Nickolai, the points leader in the Street Stock division, increased his lead  with a 25-lap main-event win Saturday night at Saugus Speedway before a crowd  of 4,344.  </P> <P> Nickolai also won a trophy dash and heat race earlier in the night, all in his  1970 Chevrolet Chevelle. But it wasn't easy.  </P> <P> "We blew the transmission on the figure 8 heat race," said Nickolai, who led  the whole way. "We kept it in, though. The thing was shaking and vibrating like  you wouldn't believe. On the restarts I started out in fourth gear just to keep  the RPMs down."  </P> <P> Dale White Jr., also of Simi Valley, finished second, just ahead of Rip Michels  of Arleta.  </P> <P> Brian Kelly of Arleta won the 15-lap Hobby Stock figure 8 main event, his sixth  feature race win of the season.  </P> <P> But in the 25-lap Hobby Stock main event, Thad Friday of Reseda held off  Kelly's late charge to win.  </P> <P> Friday passed Joe Barreras Jr. of Canyon Country, who had car trouble, on Lap  16 to win his second main event of the season.  </P> <P> Kelly finished second, followed by Shannon Flavin of West Hills and Scott Wade  of Burbank.  </P> <P> Joe Bolio won the 15-lap jalopy main event, passing North Hollywood's Robert  Wade, who finished second, on Lap 11. Wade had taken the lead from Andrew  Debiaso of Van Nuys on Lap 9 when Debiaso spun out.  </P> <P> John Kirby of Ventura handily won a 12-lap Street Stock semi-main event to  advance to the main event. Also advancing were Sue Pittinato of West Hills,  Brian Polzin of Saugus and Larry Ofria of Northridge.  </P> <P> Earlier in the night, Rick Crow of Canyon Country broke the track's  two-year-old oval qualifying record for Street Stocks with a time of 18.54. The  previous record, set in 1987 by John Cran, was 18.62.  </P> <P> Crow might have pushed his car too hard, however, as he blew his transmission.  Still, Crow was able to continue after borrowing a transmission from Craig  Rayburn.  </P> <P> Barreras, who entered the night eighth in Hobby Stock points, won a figure 8  heat race of Hobby Stock and Jalopy cars. Earlier, Barreras won a trophy dash  and another heat race.  </P></p>

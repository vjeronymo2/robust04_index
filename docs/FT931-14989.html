			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Insurers urged to counter fraud INSURERS must do more to tackle widespread fraud, loss adjusters have urged. The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters says that at least one in four household claims is inflated fraudulently, and insurance companies should beef up procedures for investigating claims. Mr Bev Fitzgerald, of the institute, said: 'Over the past three to four years there has been a slippage of standards at insurance companies. They have issued cheques too freely. There is a feeling among the public that 'I'd be daft not to'.' The concern follows a survey of the institute's 2,500 members, which showed that the vast majority of adjusters, who independently negotiate claims on behalf of insurance companies, felt the average householder fraudulently added at least 25 per cent to a claim. Eighty-five per cent of the 574 adjusters surveyed said insurance companies sometimes ignored their suspicions and 35 per cent said their suspicions were regularly ignored. Companies were starting to investigate claims on a random basis - after heavy losses in 1990 and 1991 - but such inquiries should become more thorough, Mr Fitzgerald said. Last June the Association of British Insurers said bogus and inflated claims had cost an estimated Pounds 400m in 1991. A Gallup poll disclosed a widespread belief that insurance fraud was extensive.</p>

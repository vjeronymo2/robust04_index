Who is that mysterious vagrant, a carrier  of the virus? Have they found the sources of the infection?    We were able to get in touch with Ludmilla Alekseyeva,  one of the chief specialists at Moscow's  Sanitary-Epidemiological Station.    ``The vagrant came here by chance,'' said Ludmilla  Alekseyeva. ``He has been in Moscow since 1989 and has no  documents. Where he lived is unknown. He spent 12 years in  prison, and all his clothes were pinned together. A Moscow  chauffeur hired him to guard his car while it was being  repaired. The vagrant was ill for a week without going to the  hospital. But when he became much worse and began vomiting, the  chauffeur called the ambulance.''    At the infectious disease hospital, cholera was suspected  immediately. An experienced professor was consulted. The  examination confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient is now  in a special department and is recovering. The unfortunate  chauffeur is also in the hospital but is, thank God, healthy.</p>

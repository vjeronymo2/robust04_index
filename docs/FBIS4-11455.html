			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 Apr (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today downplayed possible U.S. sanctions against Argentina if  the draft law on medicine patents is not approved.    Menem said that if the Bill Clinton government adopts this  measure "then it will be just bad luck; we have done what we  should have done. We have submitted the appropriate draft law  to Congress and it is now there."    He said that "this, of course, could cause some problems for  Argentina," although he said: "We have excellent relations with  the United States, and the world is not only NAFTA; the world is  also the EC and the other blocs that have been created in other  continents."    He then stressed that "Argentina and Mercosur [Common Market  of the South] are in a position to establish situations similar  to NAFTA with those blocs that have been created elsewhere."    "We will continue to try and get that draft approved and, of  course, we will lament it if they apply sanctions against  Argentina, but the country will in no way stop functioning," he  added.</p>

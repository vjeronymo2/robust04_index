			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sarah Griffiths, based on Datapro International </F> Telecommunications report: "Portugal: The Commercial and  Regulatory Environment"]    [Text] Although regarded as having one of the least  developed telecommunications infrastructures within the European  Community, Portugal has made great advances in the sphere of  telecommunications over the last four or five years and has  achieved a telephone main line density of 32 percent -- a figure  which, nevertheless, falls well below the Western European  average.    Portugal's first telecommunications service was a private  network which started in 1877, and later developed into the  Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company (established in 1887)  operating a local telephone service in Oporto and Lisbon. This  company subsequently became the public company, Telefones de  Lisboa e Porto (TLP), in 1968 -- still with the same regional  coverage. The Portuguese PTT was responsible for serving the  domestic telecommunications needs of the remaining regions of  the country -- this too became a public company in 1970.  Intercontinental connections (including telex, satellite, and  submarine cable links) are handled by Marconi Communicaoes  Globais (until recently known as Companhia Portuguesa Radio  Marconi, or CPRM, and currently in the process of changing its  name), which has been in operation since 1922.    During 1992, Portugal suffered alongside most of the rest of  Europe from the general recession with GDP growth estimated to  be less than 1.8 percent for the year (compared with 2.5 percent  for 1991). Portugal's population of just over 10.5 million  enjoys one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe,  standing at around 4.7 percent in early 1993. Inflation has  also been falling gradually over the last few years -- 8.9  percent at the end of 1992 and still falling.    Politically, Portugal has had a somewhat chequered history  until Mr. Anibal Cavaco Silva (together with his Social  Democratic party, the PSD) achieved his first general election  victory in 1987 -- followed by two subsequent re-election  victories. The next general election is due in 1995. Since  joining the European Community in 1986, although still one of  the lesser developed member states, Portugal has made  considerable progress propped up by a ready flow of EC  development grants.    According to ITU [International Telecommunications Union]  statistics for 1991, Portugal's record for investment in  telecommunications proportional to GDP is well out in front of  the rest of Europe (both East and West) at around 2.2 percent of  GDP. The European average is roughly 1.8 percent of GDP. This  illustrates Portugal's commitment to modernizing and developing  its telecommunications infrastructure -- as quickly as possible  -- in order to be able to cope with the increasingly competitive  global telecoms market.  <H5>  Regulation of Telecommunications </H5>   Major regulatory changes started to take place during the  early 1980's. Although under Law No. 188/81, issued in 1981,  the State still retained monopoly control over public post and  telecommunications services, it did liberalize the terminal  equipment market and acknowledged the need to make further  reforms. The law also created the Instituto das Comunicaoes de  Portugal (ICP) as an advisory body to the government, but the  ICP did not become the official regulatory body until 1989.    Mr. Fernando Mendes, the president of the ICP (the  Portuguese  telecommunications regulatory body), in his paper presented at  the ITU's Asia Telecom conference in Singapore in May 1993,  outlined the developments that have taken place in recent years  towards establishing an efficiently regulated telecommunications  industry. As a initial start in 1986, the Commission for the  Communications Institutional and Technological Development Study  (CEDITC) was set up to reassess the communications industry and  liberalization of services -- a process which involved  discussions with the public operators, trade unions, user  groups, and industry representatives. The main recommendations  included:    -- The separation of postal and telecommunications services    -- The creation of a financial holding company for the  postal  and telecommunications services within the CTT [Postal and  Telegraph Services of Portugal], as well as for the public  telecommunications operators, TLP and the former CPRM, with the  eventual aim of removing the cross-subsidization of postal  services    -- The gradual liberalization of basic services    -- The strengthening of the ICP's role as regulator    -- The move towards flexible tariffs for non basic services  and cost-related tariffs for basic services.    The Commission's recommendations were incorporated into the  government's program as of August 1987.    The development of Portuguese telecommunications legislation  (i.e., the CEDITC report and the Basic Telecommunications Law)  has been just one step ahead of the European Commission's  directives. This has made implementation that much more  straightforward and given support to the government's program  for telecommunications. The Basic Telecommunications Law, which  was approved by Parliament in September 1989, relates to  telecommunication network infrastructures and differentiates  between private and public.    -- Private telecommunications networks are owned by and for  the exclusive use of the organization -- e.g., for the armed  forces and railways, and private radio networks. The government  is responsible for authorizing such networks.    -- Public telecommunications falls into two categories: a)  networks for public use (i.e., the fixed telephone and telex  services, and a switched data transmission service), and b)  complementary networks and services, as well as mobile networks  (i.e., mobile cellular, paging, videotex, e-Mail, EDI  [Electronic Document Interchange], and trunked radio network  services), and value-added services (i.e., services which add  value to the basic or complementary services, such as audiotex,  public fax, voice mail services).    The Telecommunications Law established that, in the case of  public telecommunications, networks for public use were to be  operated on a monopoly basis, whilst complementary and  value-added services were to be gradually liberalized.    Towards the end of 1990, Laws No. 329/90 and No. 346/90 were  passed covering the regulation and conditions necessary for the  liberalization of these services. Value-added services may be  provided by any authorized operator, subject to certain  conditions regarding security, tariff levels, and information  content. Complementary services have been separated into mobile  and fixed services: mobile service provision is subject to  public tender and under government control, whilst fixed  services may be offered once a license has been granted.  Certain further conditions also prevail, such as the fact that  both fixed and mobile service operators may not transfer their  license to another operator within three years of setting up  operations. Nor may a licensed operator take more than a 10  percent holding in any other operator providing a similar  service.    During 1992, a number of laws have been passed affecting the  telecommunications sector and these include:    -- Law 88/92 (May 1992) established CN-Comunicaoes  Nacionais,  SGPS, SA as the holding company for all state holdings in the  communications sector (i.e., Telecom Portugal, TLP, Marconi  Comunicaoes Globais, and TDP -- Teledifusora de Portugal), as  well as postal operators.    -- Law 98/92 (May 1992) changed the status of the PTT,  CTT-Correios de Portugal (or CTT) making it a state-owned public  limited company.    -- Law 186/92 (August 1992) set up a Higher Committee for  Telecommunications to advise the government regarding  coordination of the different telecommunications systems in the  country.    -- Law 207/92 (October 1992) set up a new pricing scheme for  services provided by the public telecommunications operators.    -- Law 277/92 (December 1992) established the regulations  under which Telecom Portugal SA was to exist after separation  from the CTT.    With the introduction of competition, both private companies  and the three existing public telecommunications operators in  various collaborative ventures have applied for licenses to  operate. Altogether, as of May 1993, licenses had been granted  to two GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications] operators,  four paging operators, and two fixed data network operators.  Still under consideration were licenses for two trunked radio  networks, as well as authorization for around 13 value-added  services (e.g., video-conferencing, telex, videotex). As of  September 1993, there had been little further development.  However, as a result of a public tender, Radiomovil was awarded  a license to operate a trunked radio network in mid-1993. A  second operator's license should be awarded towards the end of  1993.    For some time, Portugal has been the only EC country not to  have introduced some form of tariff rebalancing. The public  operators have now begun to lower the price of long-distance  calls and increase the price of local and regional calls,  thereby bringing Portugal more into line with the rest of  Europe. Marconi Comunicaoes Globais embarked on rebalancing its  tariffs in 1992, with Telecom Portugal following suit in 1993.    Administration of the Portuguese telecommunications  environment is the responsibility of the Instituto das  Comunicaoes de Portugal (ICP -- with full authority finally  being granted in November 1989 (as a result of Law No. 283/89  being passed in the preceding August). The government nominates  the three members of the ICP's Board of Directors, who serve for  three years, with possible renomination at the end of this  period.    The ICP advises the government on the determination of  policy  and legislation, as well as having a series of more specific  regulatory duties, which include:    -- Standardization and type approvals    -- Radio electronic spectrum management, planning, and  supervision    -- Setting of tariffs    -- Monitoring the operating conditions and quality of the  basic telecommunications services (i.e., telephone, telex, and  data transmission service)    -- Allocation of licenses to operators of complementary and  value-added networks and services    -- International representation of Portugal in international  telecommunications organizations, such as ITU, CEPT [European  Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Offices], OECD, and  the EC.    With offices in Oporto, the Azores, and Madeira, the ICP  employs 270 people -- half of whom come from the CTT and are  involved in management of the radio spectrum. The annual budget  of around US$20 million is generated almost entirely from  spectrum tariffs.  <H5>  The PTT Today </H5>   There are three operators of public telecommunications  services in Portugal:    -- Telecom Portugal    -- Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP)    -- Marconi Comunicaoes Globais (until recently, Companhia  Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM).    Since the 1980's there has been a considerable rejuggling  within the Portuguese telecommunications sector. Figures 1 and  2 illustrate the changes that have been achieved over the past  decade.  <H5>  Telecom Portugal </H5>   The Portuguese PTT, CTT-Correios de Portugal, ceased being a  government department in 1970. In accordance with the Basic  Telecommunications Law (passed in 1989), the CTT's  telecommunications sector adopted the name Telecom Portugal SA  in March 1990 and formed an autonomous company. By mid-1991,  Telecom Portugal was responsible for its own budget and the  determination of strategies. In December 1992, Telecom Portugal  finally became a fully-fledged public limited company.  Telecom Portugal's remit is to provide the fixed telephone and  telex services for the whole of Portugal, with the exception of  the cities of Oporto and Lisbon. In addition, the operator  handles traffic to Europe and the Mediterranean region.  <H5>  Figure 1. Portugal's Telecommunications Sector, as of 1980 </H5>   The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications  oversees the Secretary of State for Communications who in turn  oversees both CTT and TLP. The Ministry of Finances administers  IPE, who in turn administers CPRM [Portuguese Radio Marconi  Company].    (Source: "Regulation of Portuguese Communications", Paper  presented by Mr. Fernando Mendes at the ITU's Asia Telecom '93  conference, held in May 1993.)    Financial results to the end of 1992, published by the CTT-  Correios de Portugal, include the figures for both postal  (Correios de Portugal) and telecommunication (Telecom Portugal)  service providers. Income from operations totaled 232.2 billion  escudos [Esc] for 1992 (compared with Esc205.0 billion in 1991).  Income from telecommunications services totaled Esc144.6  billion (Esc123.7 billion in 1991).    Telecom Portugal currently employs around 11,000 staff, but  there are plans to cut staff numbers by around 18 percent by the  end of 1994.  <H5>  Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) </H5>   Originally starting its operational activities in 1887 as  the  Anglo Portuguese Telephone Company (APT) under a franchise  contract, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) holds the monopoly  over the fixed telephone service within the Oporto and Lisbon  regions. Although TLP provides service coverage to barely 3  percent of the territory, this includes provision of services to  the most densely populated areas and the major business centers.  TLP is a 100 percent publicly owned company.    -- TLP's net profit for 1992 totaled Esc1,279.9 million  (down  from Esc1,472.4 million in 1991), with cashflow reaching Esc28.6  billion (an increase of 7 percent over 1991). Income from  operations jumped by 14 percent to Esc17.6 billion.    -- The number of employees fell by 2.5 percent during 1992  to  total 10,343. This brought the ratio of employees to main lines  to just over seven employees to 1,000 main lines.    Over the past few years, TLP's investment in the  infrastructure has been considerable. During 1992, investment  in telecommunications made up around 84 percent (Esc42,235  million) of the total Esc50,275 million -- 33 percent of which  went on switching and 41 percent on outside plant.    Like the other public operators, TLP is also concerned with  strengthening its involvement in the domestic telecommunications  market, and with the advent of competition it sees investment in  these competing operators as a strategic move. One such  investment is TLP's 50 percent holding in TELEPAC, which totaled  Esc2 billion -- 77 percent of the operator's total financial  investment of Esc2.6 billion for 1992.    Altogether, TLP holds stakes in 19 companies -- including a  number of joint-venture companies with one or both of the other  operators -- representing an overall investment of Esc6.3  billion. Figure 2 shows the structure of TLP.  <H5>  Figure 2. Portugal's Telecommunications Sector, as of 1993 </H5>   The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications  oversees the Secretary of State for Communications. Reporting  directly to the Secretary of State for Communications are CN-  Comunicacoes Nacionais (Financial Holding for Communications)  and Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal. CN-Comunicacoes  Nacionais oversees: Post, Telecom Portugal, TLP, CPRM and TDP.  Post, Telecom Portugal, TLP and CPRM are Reserved Areas (Post,  Fixed Telephone and Telex).    Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal oversees three  Competition Areas: a) Public Competition (Complementary),  comprising TMN [Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais], TLM,  TELEPAC, SEVATEL, CTT-Azores and CTT-Madeira; b) Private  Competition (Complementary), comprising Telecel, Telechamada,  Finacom, Contactel and Comnexo; and c) Private Competition  (Value- Added Services), comprising Televoz, Audiomedia, Mor  Audio Tel, On Street Marketing, STVA, Interinfo, Telebanco,  INMTEL, Teleworld.    Instituto das Comunicacoes de Portugal is also overseeing  (along with CN-Comunicacoes Nacionais) the reserved areas of  Post, Fixed Telephone and Telex. (Source: "Regulation of  Portuguese Communications", Paper presented by Mr. Fernando  Mendes at the ITU's Asia Telecom '93 conference, held in May,  1993.)  <H5>  Marconi Comunicaoes Globais </H5>   Starting operations under a franchise contract in 1922,  Marconi Comunicaoes Globais (until recently known as Companhia  Portuguesa Radio Marconi, or CPRM, and currently in the process  of changing its name) was originally set up to provide reliable  communications with offshore islands (i.e., the Azores and  Madeira) and Portuguese colonies and interests in Africa and the  Far East. The state has a controlling share of 51 percent in  Marconi Comunicaoes Globais.    Marconi Comunicaoes Globais is responsible for telex and  intercontinental communications, provided via satellite and  submarine cable networks which it has developed in partnership  with other international telecommunications operators. During  the 1990's, the company has become more diversified in its range  of services and has started to offer mobile communications,  value-added services, and business communications.    -- During 1992, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais generated income  of Esc42,561 million (Esc41,010 million in 1991) and net profits  of Esc3,671 million (Esc7,565 million in 1991). Cashflow stood  at Esc8,160 million -- down from Esc11,327 million in 1991.  Investments totaled Esc9,991 million, compared with Esc16,024  million in 1991.    -- For the first quarter of 1993, Marconi Comunicaoes  Globais  showed an increase in net profit (Esc1 billion) of 5 percent on  the 1992 first quarter results. Turnover for the period was  Esc10.4 billion. Of this figure, the telephone service  contributed Esc8.2 billion (up 8 percent on 1992) -- notable  given that the tariff rates were 21 percent lower during the  1993 first quarter than in 1992. Investment of Esc625 million  was also carried out during the 1993 first quarter, with the  majority channeled into the development of the global  telecommunications network.    -- For the first six months of 1993, the company reported  profits of Esc2 billion (up 11 percent on 1992) and cashflow of  Esc4.5 billion (up 12 percent on 1992).    During 1992, the demand for international telephony services  increased by 14 percent, whilst mobile, data, and  videoconferencing services showed increases of over 25 percent.  This growth was due largely to the increase in the network  capacity, as well as the introduction of new services for large  business customers (e.g., VPN [Virtual Private Network]  networks, ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] switching, high-speed  transmission, and frame relay services). A further result of  the tariff cuts during 1992, was a significant growth (16.9  percent) in intercontinental traffic.    In addition to the joint-venture companies formed with the  other public telecommunications operators, Marconi Comunicaoes  Globais has major holdings in a number of telecoms-related  companies:    -- Contactel -- (51 percent) Portugal's second paging  operator    -- Marconi SVA -- (90 percent) provider of value-added  services    -- Telesotto-Sociedade de Videotex, SA (45 percent)    -- Marconi-Sprint, Lda (51 percent) -- Set up in mid-1991,  this is US Sprint's first venture into the Portuguese market and  offers international voice and data services    -- SUBTEL-Sociedade Portuguesa de Cabos Submarinos  Telefonicos, Lda (50 percent)    Marconi Comunicaoes Globais is a global communications  company with operations in more than a dozen countries. With  headquarters in Lisbon, Marconi Comunicaoes Globais has six  international offices in Brussels (Belgium), Washington DC  (U.S.A.), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Macau, Angola, and Maputo  (Mozambique). Marconi Comunicaoes Globais' major international  joint-venture companies include:    -- Mobitel -- (49.5 percent) a company formed with a number  of local partners in Brazil, offering paging services. The  license was awarded at the start of 1992 and the service was  launched in September 1993.    -- Guine Telecom -- (51 percent) the operator of the  national  telephone network -- also the operator of a land mobile service  (launched in 1991) with national coverage in Guinea Bissao.    -- CST (Companhia Santomense de Telecommunicacoes), SARL  [Limited liability corporation] -- (51 percent) national  telephone network operator in Sao Tome and Principe.    -- CTM (Companhia de Telecomunicacoes de Macau), SARL -- (28  percent) national telephone network operator in Macau.    -- TELEDATA de Mocambique, Lda -- (50 percent) provider of  services including videotex and electronic mail in Mozambique.    -- Matrix -- provider of paging services in the Philippines,  Malaysia, and Thailand.  <H5>  The Onset of Competition and Joint Ventures </H5>   The 1990's have demanded that the three public  telecommunications operators become more prepared for  competition from private operators for customers. In  particular, the opening to competition of the markets for  digital cellular telephony, paging, data communications, and  value-added services has resulted in the three public  telecommunications operators combining forces in a number of  complementary service areas to form independent, autonomous  operations units -- such as TMN. Much of this reorganization is  taking place through the holding company, CN -- Comunicaoes  Nacionais. Further reorganization is planned, in particular the  TELEPAC consortium is expected to incorporate all data services  including videotex, as well as value-added services (e.g., those  currently offered by Servatel and Marconi-SVA).    -- Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN) -- jointly owned  by all three public service operators and licensed to operate  Portugal's mobile cellular telephone service.    -- TELEPAC-Services de Telecomunicacoes SA -- jointly owned  by TLP and Telecom Portugal and established during the course of  1992. It brings together the public data transmission and  videotex services formerly provided by the two operators.    -- Telemensagem -- jointly owned by Telecom Portugal (49  percent) and TLP (51 percent) and is licensed to operate the  existing public paging service.    -- SEVATEL -- a provider of electronic mail (MHS 400) and  electronic data interchange services. Both TLP (49 percent) and  Telecom Portugal (51 percent) are shareholders.    -- TEXTRAM -- a value-added services provider, specifically  offering videotex databases for road transport operators. Both  TLP (20 percent) and Telecom Portugal (20 percent) are  shareholders.  <H5>  The Telephone Network </H5>   While most of Portugal's European neighbors have been  concentrating on building networks fit for the 1990's, Portugal  still has a fair way to go before catching up. At 32 lines per  100 population, Portugal has one of the lowest telephone line  penetration levels in Western Europe -- although the level for  urban areas is somewhat higher.  <H5>  Telecom Portugal </H5>   In terms of network coverage, Telecom Portugal is the major  operator of public telecommunications services in Portugal, with  a network covering around 97 percent of the country and service  two-thirds of the population.    Due to the increase in demand for telecommunications,  Telecom  Portugal's installation of telephones has increased from 20,000  telephones each year at the beginning of the 1980's to 263,000  telephones in 1992. This has also reduced the numbers waiting  for telephone connections by 35 percent to 91,400 at the end of  1992 (141,700 at the end of 1991).    As a result, within Telecom Portugal's area of operation,  the  number of telephones has grown by 16 percent and telephone  density has almost doubled in the last four years to reach 25  telephones per 100 population in 1992 -- compared with 13  telephones per 100 population in 1988.    As well as expanding the network, Telecom Portugal has been  intent on modernization and, in particular, digitalization of  the network. Table 1 gives an overview of Telecom Portugal's  network infrastructure.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telecom Portugal; Network Infrastructure, 1990-92                          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |1991              |1992              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone Lines I-|212               |236               |263               |  |nstalled during Y-|                  |                  |                  |  |ear (thousands)   |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone Lines i-|1,158             |1,366             |1,581             |  |n Operation (thou-|                  |                  |                  |  |sands)            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone Density |18                |22                |25                |  |(per 100 populati-|                  |                  |                  |  |on)               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone Traffic(|10,509            |12,649            |14,759            |  |millions of Impul-|                  |                  |                  |  |ses)              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telex Lines in Op-|26                |21                |15                |  |eration (thousand-|                  |                  |                  |  |s)                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TELEPAC Circuit C-|7.0               |10.1              |10.6              |  |onnections (thous-|                  |                  |                  |  |ands)             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Dedicated Circuit |12.5              |14.5              |16.0              |  |Connections (thou-|                  |                  |                  |  |sands)            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Local Switching (-|34 percent        |48 percent        |58 percent        |  |Digital)          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Regional Transmis-|76 percent        |85 percent        |88 percent        |  |sion Switching (D-|                  |                  |                  |  |igital)           |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Interurban Transm-|44 percent        |56 percent        |68 percent        |  |ission Switching (|                  |                  |                  |  |Digital)          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |International Swi-|33 percent        |48 percent        |68 percent        |  |tching (Digital)  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Source: Telecom Portugal, August 1993.)                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Telefones de Lisboa e Porto (TLP) </H5>   TLP's network covers approximately 2,955 square kilometers  and serves around 3.7 million of the country's population based  in the Greater Lisbon (within 30 km of the center) and Greater  Oporto (within 20 km of the center) regions. With only 3  percent of the country, TLP nevertheless serves a strategic  market -- namely, 37 percent of the population and 60 percent of  the country's purchasing power; 80 percent of the country's  major businesses, including head offices; and Portugal's  political hub, TLP makes the claim that more than half of  Portugal's telephone traffic originates from TLP's customers.    During 1992, 235,000 lines were installed under the local  switching program and by the end of 1992, around 51 percent of  TLP's network was based on digital technology. TLP has also  been introducing digital transit switching equipment and aims to  have achieved almost 100 percent digitalization by 1995.    The volume of traffic has been increasing rapidly over the  trunk network, and to cater for this demand TLP has been  installing fiber-optic cable and digital channels. All urban  area exchanges are now connected by fiber-optic cable.  Introduction of fiber-optic cabling in the local network is to  be started during 1993. Table 2 gives a statistical overview of  TLP's basic network infrastructure.    In terms of the fixed telephone service, TLP connected  137,000 telephone lines during 1992. The telephone density  within the TLP's coverage area has increased considerably over  the last few years, and since 1990 the figure has jumped from 34  to 40 per 100 population at the end of 1992.    At the same time, great efforts have been made to reduce the  waiting time for connection, and at the end of 1992 this was  down to less than four months --compared with over ten months in  1989. With a density of 2.9 public call boxes per 1,000  population, TLP is introducing cardphones (currently accounting  for around 25 percent of the total) and call boxes which accept  ATM payment cards (around 16 percent at end of 1992). The TLP  has also managed to achieve 89 percent of repairs to call boxes  carried out within one day of being reported.    TLP is planning to introduce SDH [synchronous digital  hierarchy] transmission technology. With the intention of  launching two pilot networks in Oporto and Lisbon, TLP was  asking for equipment suppliers during 1992. At the same time,  the installation of two Metropolitan Area Networks (in Oporto  and Lisbon) was planned, which would allow provision of data,  voice, and image transmission at between 2 and 34M bps [million  bits per second] -- the project went out to international tender  during 1992.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TLP: Network Infrastructure Statistics                                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |1990              |1991              |1992              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FIXED TELEPHONE SERVICE:                                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone Lines C-|1,221             |1,328             |1,433             |  |onnected (thousan-|                  |                  |                  |  |ds)               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Telephone Lines p-|34                |37                |40                |  |er 100 Population*|                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Payphones (thousa-|7.9               |9.1               |10.4              |  |nds)              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Payphones per 1000|2.2               |2.5               |2.9               |  | Population*      |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |LEASED CIRCUIT SERVICE:                                                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total Leased Circ-|29.7              |32.7              |33.2              |  |uits (thousands)  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Data Transmission |8.9               |11.8              |14.9              |  |Circuits (thousan-|                  |                  |                  |  |ds)               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DIGITALIZATION:                                                            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Local Switching (-|27                |41                |51                |  |percent)          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transit Switching |63                |80                |90                |  |(percent)         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |INSTALLED INFRASTRUCTURE:                                                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Local Switching L-|250               |286               |235               |  |ines (thousands)  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Local Network, Op-|147               |180               |230               |  |erating Lines (th-|                  |                  |                  |  |ousands)          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Trunk Network, Di-|62                |64                |82                |  |gital Channels (t-|                  |                  |                  |  |housands)         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Trunk Network, Op-|797               |1,417             |3,972             |  |tic Fiber (km pai-|                  |                  |                  |  |rs)               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: * Corrected in accordance with 1991 Census published by the National |  |Institute of Statistics (INE).

As well as having several satellite  earth stations and its own radio communications network covering  Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira, Marconi Communiacoes Globais  participates directly in over 20 submarine cables around the  world.    During 1991/92, Marconi Communiacoes Globais extended its  international network infrastructure through its participation  in several major international ventures and agreements:    -- Construction and maintenance contracts for the SAT-2  (South Africa-Madeira-Canary Islands), TAT-11 (U.S.A., Europe),  and COLUMBUS II (Caribbean, Madeira, Europe) submarine cable  systems in 1991, as well as contracts for the TAT 12 and TAT 13  systems in 1992. The Eurafrica submarine cable system was  commercially launched in August 1992.    -- Inauguration of several satellite earth stations  including  Sintra VI (for long-distance traffic) and Sintra VII and VIII  (for business communications and broadcasting).    Marconi Communicaoes Globais is an active participant in  international satellite organizations INTELSAT, INMARSAT, and  EUTELSAT.  <H5>  Data Communications </H5>   The PSTN [public switched-telephone network] supports  transmission rates of 1,200 bps [bits per second] asynchronous  full duplex and up to 2,400 bps asynchronous half duplex.    Portugal's X.25 packet-switched network, TELEPAC, started on  an experimental basis in 1984 and opened to public service in  1985. Formerly known as Transdata, the TELEPAC network is  operated by the TELEPAC consortium (established in 1992), which  is a joint venture between Telecom Portugal and TLP -- each  responsible for operations in their respective geographical  areas. Both public operators currently own an equal share, but  it is probable that a third party may also eventually take a  share. As well as data transmission services, TELEPAC also  offers videotex services (launched in 1989) and private circuits  on a non-exclusive basis.    The TELEPAC network is based around three main centers:  Oporto, Coimbra, and Lisbon. Lisbon also has an international  transit code. The network conforms to ITU-T (formerly CCITT  [Consultative Committee of International Telephone and  Telegraph]) recommendations X.3, X.25, X.28, and X.75 protocols.  Access lines are available at speeds of up 19.2k (19,200] bps,  64k [64,000] bps, and 2M bps (in most central locations).  Towards the end of 1992, the TELEPAC network served an  estimated subscriber base of around 10,000 for data transmission  and videotex services. There are possibly plans to introduce  frame relay technology into the network.    Equipment for the network infrastructure has been supplied  by  various companies including Northern Telecom and Nokia (through  it's local distributor, Omnitecnica).  <H5>  Mobile Communications </H5>   Portugal's first mobile cellular telephone network was set  up  in 1988 when the then CTT awarded Siemens a contract to install  the infrastructure for a C-450 mobile radio system, called  Telemovel. Since Telemovel was launched, there has been a change  in the operation of public mobile communications with the  creation of Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN). TMN is a  joint-venture company involving all three public  telecommunications operators, and operates mobile services  throughout Portugal -- including the Telemovel cellular service.    More recently, there has been the award of two GSM operating  licenses. The demand for the GSM service has been dramatic and  within the first four months of operation there were more  subscribers than the old analog Telemovel system had attracted  in more than four years.    TMN was awarded the first GSM operating license and launched  its GSM service in October 1992. It is now looking to expand  its network infrastructure and in July 1993, awarded Motorola  ECID a contract to supply equipment for this expansion. TMN is  currently concentrating on coverage of the main commercial  centers, i.e., Lisbon and Oporto, for which Motorola is  providing sectored base stations. Coverage of Lisbon was due to  be completed during Summer 1993. Infrastructure equipment  (i.e., base station controllers, base transceiver stations, and  an operations and maintenance center) have already been supplied  by Motorola for TMN's service in the Algarve and Alentejo  regions.    In August 1991, the Portuguese government awarded the  U.S.-backed consortium, Telecel Comunicacoes Pessoais SA, the  license to operate a private GSM mobile telephone network in  Portugal. Telecel had been up against six other consortia in  the selection process and was strongly criticized at the time  for its unrealistically high investment and subscriber  projections. At the same time, it also caused anxiety in the  rest of Europe, that the chosen operator should be heavily  influenced by its non-European backer, Pacific Telesis, which  has a 23 percent stake. Telecel is a Portuguese company formed  by two major Portuguese financial groups, Espirito Santa and  Amorim. In addition to PacTel, the other shareholders are  Centrel, Efacec, and LCC.    Telecel's nationwide GSM network was officially inaugurated  in October 1992. At this initial stage, the network offered  coverage to around 80 percent of the population and permitted  the use of both transportable mobiles and hand-held telephones.  By 1996, the system should serve around 150,000 subscribers and  cover 85 percent of the territory.    Ericsson won the contract worth US$150 million to supply the  network, which is based on three switching nodes, three  operation and maintenance centers, a network management center,  and more than 100 base stations.  <H5>  Paging </H5>   In 1990, with backing from Telecom Portugal and TLP, a new  company, Telemensagem, launched Portugal's first public paging  service, Telebip. The initial coverage area was Lisbon, Oporto,  and part of the Algarve region. By the end of 1991, there were  some 6,200 subscribers.    Portugal's paging market has since been opened up to  competition from other operators, and as a result there are now  a total of four paging operators, including Telemensagem.    In October 1991, the Contactel consortium, in which Marconi  Communiacoes Globais has a 51 percent holding, took part in the  tender for a nationwide paging license in Portugal, and in April  1992 the consortium was awarded a license to operate the Contact  service. Other partners in Contactel are Telefonica (Spain) and  Matrix (Australia).    The Ericsson subsidiaries, Sociedade Ericsson de Portugal  and  Ericsson Magnetic, won the contract worth US$4.1 million to  install the infrastructure for Portugal's first privately  operated paging system. There are three phases of installation:  The first phase (completed early 1993) covered installation of  30 base stations and covered the metropolitan areas of Lisbon  and Oporto, as well as some rural regions. The other two paging  operators are Sinacom and Telechamada -- both have been in  operation since 1992.  <H5>  Text Services </H5>   Portugal's telex network, divided into eight zones, covers  the major cities of Lisbon, Coimbra, Braga, Faro, and Aviero, as  well as the islands of Madeira and the Azores. The telex links  to Madeira are over submarine cable and those to the Azores are  via satellite.    The use of facsimile services has grown rapidly in Portugal  over the last few years -- at the expense of the telex service.  Over 1992, there was a 33 percent growth in use. Telecom  Portugal and TLP jointly operate the Corfac public facsimile  service with offices located in the major cities.    One of Marconi Comunicaoes Globais' associate companies,  Marconi SVA, launched commercial operations of an e-mail service  -- Email 400 -- in Portugal in July 1992.  <H5>  ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] </H5>   Telecom Portugal's pre-ISDN service, Diginet, offers small  and medium-sized businesses access to the public switched  network through 2M bps digital links.    Telecom Portugal has been operating ISDN services to private  companies on an experimental basis until the start of 1993.  Both basic rate (2B+D) and primary rate (30B+D) access have  been available. A commercial launch of ISDN was planned for  Summer 1993.    TLP carried out a series of pilot trials in Lisbon and  Oporto  during 1991, with basic and primary rate accesses to a  restricted number of customers to test new signaling protocols.  TLP launched basic and primary rate access ISDN during 1992.    Both Telecom Portugal and TLP are committed to the  introduction of Euro-ISDN and this was reaffirmed at a meeting  of the 26 European operators in Bruges, Belgium, in June 1993.  The meeting was to finalize details regarding the launch of the  European digital network, which is due in December 1993.  <H5>  The Future </H5>   Portugal's immediate aims are to bring the telephone density  level up to the European average as quickly as possible, as well  as working towards removing the cross- subsidy that currently  exists between the telecommunication and the postal services  sectors. At the same time, increased competition within the  various telecommunications market sectors is the way ahead and  will be encouraged. It is envisaged that there will be a  reluctance on the part of the public service operators to the  changes that are likely to occur -- particularly when the result  will inevitably be an erosion of their market share.    Portugal is, nevertheless, moving in the same direction as  the rest of Europe -- albeit somewhat more slowly than most EC  countries. In June 1993, the members states of the EC agreed to  allow competition in domestic and international telephony  markets throughout the region by 1 January 1998. Having one of  the less developed telecommunications networks in the EC --  along with Ireland, Spain, and Greece -- Portugal has been  granted an extra five years to modernize the network  infrastructure before having to comply with the EC directive.    The move towards privatization of the operators is being  undertaken in a controlled manner. With one single holding  company for all three public telecommunications operators, the  idea is to coordinate the gradual introduction of private  capital into all of them -- rather than throw the market open to  competition. It is hoped that this will avoid the problem of  the most profitable sectors being eagerly skimmed off to leave  the state holding the remaining sectors. Although no timescale  has yet been set, there is speculation that the privatization  process will be set in motion during 1994.</p>

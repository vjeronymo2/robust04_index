			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> RAIL RIGHTS OF WAY FOCUS OF CITY STUDY  </P> <P> The city will study the potential for use of existing railroad rights of way  for light-rail service for commuters.  </P> <P> In a recent report to the City Council, City Manager Lee Risner noted that  other Orange County cities, including Santa Ana, Anaheim, Irvine, Costa Mesa,  Huntington Beach and Fullerton, are studying the use of light rail to reduce  traffic congestion.  </P> <P> "In view of all of the discussion regarding transportation, and since cities  are looking at light rail for public transport, it is probably not a good idea  to give up any rights of way at this time," Risner said.  </P> <P> Noting the lack of a freeway running parallel to Imperial Highway, Risner  suggested that a rail system might reduce traffic on Imperial and Whittier  Boulevard, both state highways.

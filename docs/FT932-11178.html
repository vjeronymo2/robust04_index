			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (2): Next year may see recovery - The Economy ANY economy that manages to survive the wrenching changes suffered by Bulgaria over the last three years must have a brighter future than meets the eye. This is the thought which sustains the country's economic managers and ordinary citizens as they slog through the fourth year of a painful readjustment that, on the basis of incomplete official statistics, has halved industrial output and reduced GDP per capita to a mere Dollars 980 a year. The assumption in this year's budget is of a further 3-4 per cent decline in GDP in 1993, accompanied by at least 60 per cent inflation and a further rise in unemployment to about 17 per cent by the end of the year. Independent economists expect inflation to remain around last year's 80 per cent level given the 18 per cent rise over the first quarter and the prospect of further inflationary surges with the reduction in energy subsidies planned for May and the introduction of VAT later this year. If all goes well, however, and that includes no extension of the Bosnian war to the wider Balkan arena and reasonable domestic political stability, the economy should start a slow but accelerating recovery early in 1994. Getting back onto a sustainable growth path depends largely on the government's ability to push this year's budget through a fractious parliament with its 7.9 per cent of GDP budget deficit ceiling intact. But it also requires pressing ahead with privatisation, tax reform and modernisation of the banking and financial sectors. Progress on all these fronts is required if the International Monetary Fund is to sign a new standby agreement. Such a signal of support from the IMF is needed to reassure potential investors and help smooth the path towards a debt reduction agreement with the London Club of commercial bank creditors to whom Bulgaria owes Dollars 8.5bn of the total Dollars 11bn foreign debt run up during the final years of the communist regime. As the OECD noted in its first economic assessment of Bulgaria last year: 'External debt is the sword of Damocles hanging over the Bulgarian economy.' Over the medium term, it added: 'Bulgaria will attract official capital inflows, foreign investment and trade credit only if a satisfactory solution to the problem of external debt is found.' Since reneging on its debts in 1990 Bulgaria, the former Soviet bloc country most dependent on trade with its Comecon partners, has been deprived of access to normal bank finance and unable to attract more than a minuscule amount of foreign investment. Unofficial estimates put total foreign investment over the last three years at around Dollars 100m, compared to the Dollars 5bn which has flowed into Hungary over this period. But substantial involvement by the World Bank, the IMF and other international institutions has led to the drawing up of substantial sectoral modernisation plans for key sectors such as telecommunications, nuclear safety and environmental protection. At last month's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development conference in London, improving the safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power complex was singled out as the first project for the recently formed nuclear safety facility. The prospect of substantial funding for infrastructure and development projects is starting to attract international companies. Siemens and Alcatel, for instance, are expected to set up new production facilities in Bulgaria. The country has a skilled electronics workforce but its domestic industry, heavily oriented on exports to the Soviet Union, virtually collapsed with the demise of Comecon. Good prospects for oil and gas prospecting in the east of the country and the Black Sea shelf have also lured British Gas, Texaco and other western energy companies while Rover of the UK has joined Greek and Turkish companies attracted not only by growth prospects in the 8.5m-strong domestic market but Bulgaria's long-standing trading contacts with the former Soviet Union and its membership of the recently-established Black Sea economic zone which includes Turkey and several of the former Soviet states. In March, Bulgaria signed a free trade agreement with Efta and an association agreement with the European Community which should facilitate the further re-orientation of Bulgarian trade to western markets. But the EC accords leave much to be desired, with special protocols still to be finalised covering sensitive sectors such as textiles, food and steel while wine, one of the few export success stories, is excluded from the arrangement. Even so, the latest agreements are welcome in a country which until 1989 conducted nearly 80 per cent of its trade with the socialist bloc and which is being forced to re-orientate its trade not only westward but also south and east to Greece, its EC neighbour, and above all to Turkey and the Middle East. Such a shift has been accompanied by much pain. Whole swathes of Bulgarian industry, initially built up with Soviet subsidies and equipment to serve the Soviet market, have been decimated. Giant chemical, metallurgical, engineering and electronics plants were deprived of their traditional markets overnight and, in the case of the electronics sector in particular, revealed as hopelessly obsolescent in the face of competition from south-east Asia. The same is true for the farming sector, which has been doubly hit both by the disappearance of the former inexhaustible Soviet demand for cheap wine, grain and processed foods and by a chaotic process of land restitution and privatisation. Longer term, the shift to market mechanisms and modernisation of its agro-industry should make much better use of the country's fertile land and clement climate. Meanwhile, the 50 per cent decline in industrial output, painful though it is, has exposed the nature of the old centrally-planned economy with its enforced dependence on Soviet raw materials and markets. The shift to a less energy-intensive and more productive economy based on service industries, light engineering, tourism and a modernised agro-industrial sector has started. The private sector, concentrated initially in trading and services, has not yet filled the gap left by the collapse of state industry. But its share has risen from around 5 per cent to an estimated 20-25 per cent of an overall lower GDP. Times are still hard but an economic transformation is under way in Bulgaria which mirrors, with a time lag, the reforms that have already changed the face of central Europe.</p>

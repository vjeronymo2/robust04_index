			<p>BFN     [Text] On 29 April, the Executive Council of the  Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB]  adopted a package of urgent measures aimed at overcoming the  destabilization of the financial system and the crisis in income  and production. An appendix to the package was adopted which  demands the government inform the parliament and the trade union  about commitments to international institutions, which affect  production in Bulgaria.    The Executive Council will convene the KNSB Coordinating  Council on 9 May. The goal is to report the result of the  warning strike and national protest rallies, conducted by 6 May,  to update the assessment of the sociopolitical situation in the  country, and determine the KNSB attitude toward the government.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ORDERED OVER THREATS AGAINST ACTOR  </P> <P> In a bedroom of a house in Camarillo, amid hundreds of videotapes of a  television comedy called "Family Ties," and thousands of photos of its star,  Michael J. Fox, she sat at a Sharp typewriter and wrote letters, prosecutors  say.  </P> <P> In a year's time, prosecutors allege, she mailed nearly 6,000 of them. In June  of 1988, 355 letters. In July, 816. Last January, 733. All addressed to Michael  J. Fox.  </P> <P> The letters landed in the mail room at Paramount Studios, at a post office box  in Studio City, at Fox's public relations firm. In capital letters and rows of  exclamation marks, they enunciated much the same theme: Michael, I will kill  you. I will kill your wife if you don't divorce her. I will kill your unborn  baby.  </P> <P> Twice, there were no letters -- just boxes of rabbit droppings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Liked' Fox  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Tina Marie Ledbetter, a 26-year-old shipping clerk who kept  rabbits in the garage, was ordered to stand trial on five counts of making  terrorist threats to the actor, someone she allegedly told an investigator she  "liked," and "wanted to get his attention."  </P> <P> In court, at last, she had it. Tina Ledbetter, who had apparently never been  any closer to Fox than seated invisibly in a studio audience during a taping of  "Family Ties," was less than a dozen feet from him.  </P> <P> He was on the witness stand, and she -- a pale woman in a blue jail-issue  jacket and green cotton dress -- sat at a table, taking notes and only rarely  glancing at him.  </P> <P> No, said Fox, in a half-hour of testimony, he had never seen her before. But  yes, he said, he "absolutely" took the threats seriously, after hearing about  them from his secretary and seeing some letters for himself. "I believe someone  intended to hurt my wife and myself and our child."  </P> <P> Fox co-wrote a whimsical piece in the current issue of "Esquire" about his  cloak-and-dagger efforts to evade the tabloid press at his wedding last year,  but it was clear Wednesday that there were grimmer underlying concerns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Quite Distraught'  </P> <P> In April, 1988, his then-fiancee, co-star Tracy Pollan, phoned him in Thailand  "in the middle of the night . . . crying" and "quite distraught" about the  letters, Fox testified.  </P> <P> "Primarily I was concerned for Tracy's safety, but also I was concerned for  myself as well." The threats "changed my life style extensively." He hired a  security agency, got extra security on the set. Pollan traveled under a false  name, he said.  </P> <P> If Ledbetter was not staring at the 27-year-old Emmy-winning actor, almost  everyone else on the crowded courtroom benches was -- along with others who had  to be content to peek in the courtroom windows.  </P> <P> Fox sighed as he flipped through five loose-leaf notebooks of letters, a  fraction of the total, each containing photocopies of the same missive, often  dozens a day.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Gruber noted that they charted a yearlong crescendo of  venom, from telling Fox to return to his old girlfriend to letters outraged at  his marriage and then furious that Pollan was pregnant. They "became a lot more  specific . . . a lot more angry and more threatening," Fox said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Divorce Tracy'  </P> <P> "You are a total (expletive) for marrying Tracy!" one letter went. Then,  "Divorce Tracy or you are dead! I am coming after you with a gun and I am going  to kill you if you don't divorce Tracy immediately!" And after she was  pregnant, "I'm going to kill you and that (expletives) bitch and that  (expletives) baby!"  </P> <P> "It got very frightening," Fox acknowledged. Afterward, Fox left as he had  come: through the judges' private corridor, in the company of two bodyguards.  </P> <P> Investigators had traced the parcels of rabbit feces, and district attorney's  investigator Gary Schram arrested Ledbetter in February, at her office in  Westlake Village. She "did admit she wrote the letters to Mr. Fox," Schram  testified Wednesday.  </P> <P> Inside her house were thousands more letters, Schram said. Postage for what she  had already sent cost at least $1,500. "She indicated she wanted to get (Fox's)  attention as her reason for sending the letters."  </P> <P> She said "that she hated (Pollan). She said she'd been becoming more angry week  by week, month by month . . .," Schram testified. "She did think about getting  a gun and shooting Tracy but never actually thought out how to do it."  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Rand Schrader ordered her held for trial without bail. Gruber  agreed that Ledbetter's entering a psychiatric facility as a condition of bail  is "certainly a viable alternative." Ledbetter, who has never been arrested  before, is in the psychiatric unit at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Mitchell Young called it a "difficult" case, one of the first  under a new law primarily drawn to stop gang intimidation of witnesses. The law  allows prosecution of anyone who makes a verbal threat of death or great bodily  injury, regardless of any intent to carry it out. Before, the law required  prosecutors to prove intent. No weapon was found.  </P></p>

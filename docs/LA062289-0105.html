			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $243-MILLION BUDGET, UTILITY TAX HIKE OKD  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council on Tuesday approved a $243-million budget for the  1989-90 fiscal year, which calls for 63 new employees and the first utility tax  hike in a decade.  </P> <P> Council members said they were worried about the 11% increase in the spending  plan and vowed to return to slow-growth spending patterns of previous years.  </P> <P> However, at their request, two new positions -- one in the Planning Department  and another in the Public Works Department -- were added to the 61 recommended  by City Manager David Ramsay. Last year, 13 new positions were included in the  budget.  </P> <P> The utility tax increase from 5% to 7% was originally approved in 1978, but the  council had postponed its implementation until this year. The council also  raised the cut-off level of maximum earnings from $7,500 to $10,500 a year for  low-income residents to be exempt from paying the tax.  </P></p>

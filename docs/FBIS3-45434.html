			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- China is opening  more onshore oil projects for international bidding in a bold  drive for expanded cooperation with foreign partners.    Wang Tao, president of China National Petroleum Corp.  (CNPC),  unveiled the second round of international bidding here today.    The first round for exploring oil and gas in the Tarim Basin  in China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ended last  year. An initial petroleum contract has been signed between the  CNPC and the Exxon and the Japan Oil Company group. More  commercial negotiations are under way.    Wang said the projects now open to foreign bidding fall into  two categories -- risk exploration and enhanced oil recovery  projects. Registration will begin on February 15, 1994.    In the first category, 26 exploration blocks in China's nine  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of  Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei,  Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin are inviting foreign bids.    According to Wang, oil resources in these blocks with a  total  area of 216,000 square kilometers are estimated at 6.2 billion  tons and natural gas resources at 800 billion cubic meters.    "This indicates a good prospect for exploration," Wang said.    He added that most blocks are located near industrial and  agricultural centers with convenient transportation  infrastructures, which will surely facilitate operations there.    Wang assured that international conventions and formulas for  product-sharing will be adopted in this round of bidding as in  the previous one. Foreign companies will be solely responsible  for all exploration risks in the contract blocks.    Commercial discoveries will be jointly developed by Chinese  and foreign partners while post-tax profits will be shared in  accordance with the terms and conditions set in the contracts.    Wang said the second category covers enhanced oil recovery  projects in 11 developed blocks scattered in the eight mature  oil fields of Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu,  Zhongyuan and Jilin.    Total oil-bearing area in the blocks is 190.2 square  kilometers with oil reserves of 380 million tons in place. The  recovery factor in these blocks varies from 18.3 to 85.3 percent  of the recoverable reserves, Wang told the conference.    Located within developed fields, with reliable resources,  complete infrastructures and guaranteed logistic support, these  projects are expected to be quick to produce results.    In the projects, foreign companies will shoulder risks  alone,  or together with the Chinese side, for pilot tests. The two  sides will be joint operators after stimulation methods are  chosen and share the incremental increases in oil following tax  payment.    Wang said foreign companies are free to forward their  tenders  individually or to bid through the formation of consortiums.    The registered foreign companies will start data review,  purchase data packages and make field trips from March 1 to  August 1, 1994. The bidding is scheduled to end on August 30,  1994, followed by bid evaluation.    Wang said China is looking for overseas cooperation in  downstream utilization of oil and gas, construction of  long-distance oil and gas pipelines and manufacturing of special  petroleum equipment as well as engineering and technical  services.    It will also seek foreign partners to explore and develop  oil  and gas resources outside China, Wang added.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR TEENS BY TEENS;  </P> <P> LA YOUTH PUBLICATION TAKES SERIOUS APPROACH TO SERVING AUDIENCE  </P> <P> Alleged police brutality of minority teens. A first-person account of childhood  molestation. Two pages crammed with articles on responsible sexuality.  </P> <P> That's pretty heady stuff for a group of high school journalists.  </P> <P> But it's regular fare in LA Youth, a publication put out by 100 or so high  school students from throughout Los Angeles County. With a citywide circulation  of 50,000, editors of the news tabloid say LA Youth gives teens a voice that  often is not heard in mainstream publications.  </P> <P> The paper, the youngest in a chain of teen-oriented publications across the  nation, is no stranger to hard-hitting news coverage that attracts attention  from teens and adults citywide.  </P> <P> But the current issue seems to have struck a particularly responsive chord.  </P> <P> Since publishing its June-July cover story on alleged police brutality,  staffers say they have fielded an avalanche of calls from interested adults and  high school students who say they too have been the victims of police abuse.  </P> <P> "We have received 250 phone calls about this issue," said Donna Myrow,  executive director of LA Youth. "We got calls from students interested in  joining the paper, students who wanted to share their experiences with the  police and teachers who wanted more copies. . . . We have never gotten such a  response."  </P> <P> The article, titled "Do Police Abuse Teens?," used a February confrontation in  Will Rogers State Historic Park between 26 youths and members of the Los  Angeles Police Department to focus on the larger issue of alleged police abuse.  </P> <P> Last month, lawyers for the youths filed a $5.2-million lawsuit against the  police officers and the city. Attorneys for the youths have said the incident,  which allegedly occurred Feb. 12, was racially motivated.  </P> <P> In writing the story, 16-year-old Josie Valderrama, a student at Sherman Oaks  Center for Enriched Studies High School, interviewed several gang members, some  of the alleged victims, church leaders, lawyers, the FBI and Los Angeles Police  Cmdr. William Booth.  </P> <P> Lt. Fred Nixon, the department's chief spokesman, said police are conducting an  internal investigation of the incident. Nixon would not comment further because  of the pending litigation. He said he has not seen a copy of LA Youth and  declined to comment on the article. Valderrama said she is surprised and  gratified by the attention the article has received -- including inquiries from  Time magazine and "Good Morning America."  </P> <P> "I don't think teens are valued much in society," Valderrama said. "Papers  seldom show us in a favorable light. I feel it is important to show that teens  do more than worry about SATs (aptitude tests) and hang out in shopping malls."  </P> <P> And that's what separates LA Youth from other papers, she said. The paper  focuses on issues that are pertinent to teen-agers.  </P> <P> Published six times a year by the Los Angeles bureau of Youth News Service, a  national nonprofit teen-oriented wire service, LA Youth is circulated to 97  high schools in the city and every public library, said Myrow, one of two paid  adult staff members. The other, Elizabeth Hartigan, a former reporter for the  Los Angeles Daily News, serves as editorial adviser for the young journalists.  </P> <P> The paper, which is going into its third year of publication, is part of a  growing network of teen-produced papers that began in Chicago in 1977 with the  creation of New Expression.  </P> <P> That publication was the first citywide high school publication in the country  written by and for teens, said Craig Trygstad, a co-founder of New Expression  and executive director of Youth Communication, the umbrella group for the youth  media network.  </P> <P> Now there are teen-oriented papers in Portland, Ore., New York, Toronto and  Wilmington, Del., Trygstad said. All participate in the Washington-based Youth  News Service, which feeds youth-related information to more than 500 schools  and corporate clients.  </P> <P> LA Youth has an operating budget of nearly $100,000, which comes from grants  given by foundations and companies ranging from the James Irvine Foundation to  American Airlines. Its one-room office at 6030 Wilshire Blvd. consists of three  computers, a typewriter and two phones.  </P> <P> The paper, which has no formal ties with the Los Angeles Unified School  District, is delivered to teachers who take responsibility for circulating it  to students.  </P> <P> "I think the paper is invaluable," said school board member Rita Walters. "The  paper demonstrates in a tangible way the importance of the Fourth Estate and  what a free press means to Democratic principles."  </P> <P> Any high school student with an interest in voicing an opinion or dealing with  a teen-related issue is encouraged to volunteer, Hartigan said. Staffers  stressed repeatedly during interviews that the paper offers a freedom that  seems absent from some area high school newspapers.  </P> <P> "If all the topics that were covered in their latest issue appeared in one  issue at some high school papers, the adviser would probably be looking for a  new assignment," said Dan Auiler, teacher and adviser for the Franklin Press at  Franklin High School in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

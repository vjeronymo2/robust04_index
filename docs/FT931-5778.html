			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Disillusion after golden decade: As unemployment and bankruptcies grow, the mood in Spain is turning against Gonzalez Just four months ago, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was musing that the election this year would be his last and that he would retire from office gracefully. Now he may not have that choice. The mood of the country is turning against him and, for the first time, there are doubts about how long he will remain in the Moncloa palace, his official residence. An emergency debate on rocketing unemployment in the Cortes, Spain's parliament, on Tuesday turned into a litany of accusations against him, and almost unanimous insistence from the opposition that he call an election immediately. He will not, but as recession deepens and there is little sign of economic recovery, Mr Gonzalez and Spain are in more trouble than they have been for a decade. Just over 10 years ago, in opposition, Mr Gonzalez was hurling insults across the Cortes debating chamber. The government was crumbling, riven by internal dissent and incapable of responding to the growing economic crisis. He was merciless. 'I would be ashamed to be running a country with 2m unemployed,' he is reported to have said a few months before winning his first term in office in 1982. He may feel differently now, however. Spain does not have 2m unemployed; it has more than 3m. With an election due before the end of November, Mr Gonzalez's Spanish Socialist Workers party is united only by its fear of defeat. The government's own polls show it losing 20 seats and, thus, its parliamentary majority. The latest polls were taken in November, three months before the National Statistics Institute revealed a record 3.05m Spaniards out of work. The figure was more than half a million more than the Gonzalez government had predicted at the beginning of the year. The government had also failed to deliver on its 1989 promise to create 1.2m jobs during this four-year legislature. As the economic outlook grows bleaker, Mr Gonzalez must be pondering the mistakes of his third term in office. He dithered for two years before starting the deregulation of Spanish industry, and making it easier to hire and fire workers. Even now, little deregulation has been undertaken and labour market reforms are stalled. In the past 12 months, he has hurried to recover lost ground and stumbled in the process. He has tried to equip Spain for European economic and monetary union by meeting the tough convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty. He has cut unemployment benefits, and wanted to reduce income tax. But as the 1992 budget deficit doubled over the previous year to a trillion pesetas, he had to abandon tax cuts in order to finance spiralling government debt. Speculation last autumn against currencies in the exchange rate mechanism led Spain into two devaluations to prevent an overvalued peseta from being forced to exit from the system. It has lost 16 per cent of its value against the D-Mark since last summer. Mr Gonzalez, long viewed as pragmatic for his market-oriented policies, is increasingly seen as dogmatic. His own party is criticising him for risking electoral defeat by not raising public spending, cutting interest rates or further devaluing the peseta - moves he says would threaten EC economic convergence. 'He is either being strangely principled for a politician or he has just run out of ideas,' says a leading businessman. But while the business community has turned against the government, its attacks on Mr Gonzalez are being led by the employers' umbrella body, the CEOE, and not by individuals. This is because there remains a possibility that the prime minister will form the next government. He still has some powerful cards to play to different audiences. His apparently tight fiscal stance is aimed at convincing the foreign financial institutions that trade in Spain's currency and debt that speculation against the peseta will be firmly resisted. But at home, the 1993 budget allows him some leeway. Spending is up by 9.3 per cent over last year's target while the economy is forecast to grow by less than 1 per cent. On the timing of the election, Mr Gonzalez also has the upper hand. He can wait until the end of November if he chooses. By then, Spain's inflation rate, now at an annual 5.4 per cent, should have slowed because of the recession and interest rates should have slipped below their current 13 per cent. Such developments might not make an immediate difference to employment, but the prime minister knows how to capitalise on even a little good news. Mr Gonzalez and and his finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, are a formidable duo. Faced with mounting calls for action on unemployment, the two last week quickly assembled a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.76bn) emergency plan to slow job losses by lengthening temporary job contracts and helping small businesses. They promised it would be financed mostly by the EC, but the Community has yet to be asked for the money. The package was attacked by the opposition in parliament on Tuesday as too little, too late. There is some merit in that view since the plan is unlikely to have much impact on the economy before the election, and may not even be implemented in full. There will probably be other such plans in coming months as the Socialists' political fortunes ebb. For Mr Gonzalez the challenge is to keep his most dangerous opponents - the conservative Partido Popular and the communist-led Izquierda Unida - at bay, while convincing his own party that power has not slipped away yet. It will not be easy: the party is split as a result of the economic downturn. A badly managed attempt to regulate strikes has thrown the Socialists' disarray into sharp relief in the past few weeks. Business welcomed a tough draft law presented to parliament by the government last year, but was shocked last month when a significantly watered-down version was forced through parliament after 'talks' between the party and the unions. Mr Jose Mara Cuevas, the CEOE president, called the new law 'a declaration of war', prompting Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga to promise it would be tightened up. This pledge angered the party and has done little to appease the business community, struggling under high interest rates. Receiverships have reached record levels (see chart). Galvanised by the government's troubles, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, the young PP leader, appears convinced he can topple Mr Gonzalez. Before Christmas, polls put his party just 5 points behind the Socialists. PP officials are convinced their political outlook has improved since then. For the first time in a decade, the conservatives have carved out an economic policy that may succeed in capturing the middle ground. It comprises a supply-side package of tax cuts, privatisations, elimination of industrial monopolies and infrastructure investment. Even the unions have not taken offence. But these are early days and Mr Aznar could stumble before Spain goes to the polls. Determined to win, he appeared last year to offer the leadership of any government he formed to the Catalan regionalists if they joined him. Last month, eager to capitalise on exchange rate troubles, he suggested that he would not be opposed to leaving the ERM, thus increasing pressure on the peseta. Leaving the mechanism is not PP policy. Overall, Mr Aznar tends to become side-tracked by the PP's political obsession - accusing the government of corruption. He faces the danger that the government will encourage the PP into focusing solely on this issue, something Mr Gonzalez could tackle quickly and efficiently, rather than on the economy, about which he can do little. Barring a decisive economic upturn, however, there seems little doubt that the Socialists will lose their parliamentary majority when Mr Gonzalez holds the election. It is also unlikely that he would serve another full term after forming a government. If they contain the loss to no more than 15 seats, they could still form a minority government. If they lose more than 15, they will have to form a coalition, with the Basque or Catalan regionalists or with the communist IU. The denouement of this political set-piece promises to be protracted. Spaniards know that the decade of democratic and economic development under Mr Gonzalez is drawing to a close. A home he is building in the smart suburb of Somosaguas, north of Madrid, is, say neighbours, being completed in great haste. It would be one of his lasting regrets if he were not able to finish the modernisation of the Spanish economy with the same dispatch.</p>

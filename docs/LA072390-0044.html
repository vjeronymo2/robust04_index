			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> J.R. BOND; EX-ROAD &amp; TRACK CHIEF  </P> <P> John R. Bond, former publisher and driving force behind the success of Road  &amp; Track magazine, has died. He was 77.  </P> <P> He died Friday at his home in Escondido after a long bout with emphysema.  </P> <P> Bond was well respected throughout the automotive world and had an  international reputation as an automotive journalist with a gift for writing  about technical matters in laymen's terms.  </P> <P> In 1949, Bond and his second wife, Elaine, bought Newport Beach-based Road  &amp; Track when it was a struggling, 2-year-old magazine on the brink of  folding.  </P> <P> "With a lot of hard work, they made it rise to what it is today," said Bond's  son, John R. Bond Jr.  </P> <P> Schooled as an automotive engineer who once designed motorcycles for Harley  Davidson, Bond owned the magazine until 1972, when he sold it to CBS.  </P> <P> As publisher, Bond instituted such staples of automotive journalism as the  technical road test.  </P> <P> "My father lived, breathed, slept, ate and dreamed cars," Bond Jr. said.  </P> <P> Bond maintained his interest in cars up until his death, filling his 30-car  garage with the vehicles he owned, his son said.  </P> <P> Besides his son, Bond is survived by his wife, Mercedes, a daughter, Marilee  Nudo, a sister, Virginia Bundy, and a brother, William Bond.  </P></p>

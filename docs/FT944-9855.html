			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / This Week: Time to knock out the gentlemen - Sport Boxing desperately awaits the second coming. Next spring, prisoner No 922335 leaves the Indiana Youth Detention Centre: Mike Tyson will be back on the street and quickly into the ring. 'I'm sure he'll fight within six to eight weeks of getting out,' predicts Frank Warren, the London fight promoter. 'He's below his fighting weight, in the gym every day, and his attitude is good.' When Warren tells you that Tyson's return to the ring is going to be a mega-industry and that his comeback fight could gross Dollars 100m on pay-per-view TV alone, it is probably best to ignore the numbers. Warren does, after all, have the UK TV rights to shift, and is a consummate salesman. He is also honest and intelligent enough to admit that boxing at present has a massive credibility problem. George Foreman, a sweating, heaving, 46-year-old tub of lard, is re-annointed world heavyweight champion in Las Vegas. In Hong Kong, promoters wrangle, boxers such as Frank Bruno stand idle, and a whole show goes down for lack of honest interest. Most bizarre of all, Chris Eubank, dressed like a character in an Ealing comedy, struts around the world fighting no-hopers and telling the tiny crowds they will be seeing nothing special since he hates to fight. His manager, Barry Hearn, an accountant turned snooker impresario, has sold Eubank's 10-fight sequence to Sky TV for Pounds 10m. So far the broadcaster has received only poor ratings and ridicule. 'It's a joke. Hearn took Kelvin McKenzie for a well-deserved ride. Pounds 10m quid down the drain,' laughs Warren. McKenzie was briefly joint head of BSkyB after leaving the editorship of The Sun. But Warren hates the damage this kind of fiasco does to a sport that is also a way of life. 'Eubank thinks he's clever to knock boxing, thinks it's what the public want to hear. But look at Gerald Ratner. He lost his money, his job, his family company just by insulting the customer. It's no different to Eubank telling the crowd he's going to give them a crap fight.' I went to see Warren to test a theory that boxing's real problem is not the sportsmen but the dilettante promoters who are taking it over, drawn by the potent mixture of blood and money. The notion came to me when I saw film producer John Daly (The Last Emperor and Platoon) trying to patch up the Hong Kong show he'd dreamt up. It became a nightmare. Not a punch was thrown (at least not in the ring). 'It's Vietnam here,' said a distraught Daly in the colony's Ritz Carlton Hotel, under siege from creditors, hoteliers and fighters. 'Basically, I just want to get out alive.' Five years ago I met Daly in Hollywood. The Oscar for Last Emperor sat on his desk. We drove to the Polo Lounge in his Mercedes sports soft-top and it was all 'Hi John' from the stars at lesser tables. But what he really wanted to talk about wasn't movies but Ali v Foreman in Zaire, 15 years earlier. Daly had been a player in the 'Rumble in the Jungle' promotion, and he always remembered it. Daly's partner in the Hong King venture was American promoter Bob Arum, a Harvard lawyer who was once an adviser to the Kennedys, was sent in to investigate boxing - and became a player. In contrast to the respectability of Arum is the fear and loathing with which Don King is regarded - mistakely, says Warren, who often acts as the Harlem preacher's London connection. 'If Don had run that fiasco in Hong Kong he'd have been crucified by the media, yet the Hollywood guys, the lawyers and the accountants, weaselled their way out of it, keeping their so-called integrity.' Unsettling those around him is undoubtedly part of King's business technique, along with the flamboyant hair and the costumes. In Kinshasa he turned up at the 1974 fight in African robes. 'If King put on a show in Alaska, he'd turn out with a sleigh and dogs,' said one observer at the Foreman comeback fight. Yet King delivers, for the audience and the boxers. 'Don's an easy target,' says Warren. 'He's black, he's loud, he's been to prison. But I'll bet he's made more black millionaires than anybody else in sport.' King also has a terrific grasp of the big picture, which the clowning often obscures. Between 1987 and 1992, when King virtually ran the big-time heavyweight division, there was a unified championship. Tyson was The Man. Since then it has fragmented into three different titles (four if one counts the peculiar WBO title). Lennox Lewis came as near as anyone this century to providing Britain with an undisputed world heavyweight champion. His talent was never in doubt. But American connections like Dan Duva and a London promoter who had never been to a boxing match until three years ago, combined in a bonfire of naivety to prevent Lewis unifying the title. Following his knock-out by Oliver McCall two months ago, he may never get the chance. Six months from now, boxing will probably be very different to the muddled, laughable scene we have now. Tyson faces no worthwhile opposition, and King and Warren will cut bigger deals on his success and celebrity than every before. 'We're going to keep the accountants and dabblers out of this,' promised Warren. It is time for the gentlemen to get out of the players' way.</p>

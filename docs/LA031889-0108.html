			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y.'S SHANNON INVADES L.A. RADIO  </P> <P> Westwood One's $54-million gamble in the hotly competitive Los Angeles radio  market went on the air at 5:03 a.m. Friday. "Pirate Radio" KQLZ-FM (100.3),  featuring a mix of classic hard rock, Top 40 and dance music, ended the 16-year  reign of KIQQ-FM, which for the past three years had been calling itself K-LITE  Radio.  </P> <P> With KQLZ and the premium price it paid to buy the station from Outlet  Communications, Westwood One has entered the Los Angeles ratings race in a  bombastic way. Westwood One president Norman Pattiz hired New York's top  morning deejay, Scott Shannon, to program and staff his new station.  </P> <P> Shannon, who will act as morning drive-time deejay as well as KQLZ's programmer  and a Westwood One vice president, denied reports that his contract with the  company is worth $15 million initially, but did say that it could be worth that  much if the station is successful.  </P> <P> "Ladies and gentlemen, at this time K-LITE signs off the air forever," said an  announcer who recommended that easy-listening music fans tune to four other Los  Angeles FM stations: KTWV (94.7), KJOI (98.7), KSRF (103.1) and KOST (103.5)  </P> <P> With that, K-LITE / KIQQ played its last soft hit: the 1958 chestnut "The End"  sung by Earl Grant.  </P> <P> "The staff and management of KIQQ were proud to serve you," the announcer said  as KIQQ left the air.  </P> <P> Following a two-minute sound mix featuring several of the legendary voices of  Los Angeles pop radio (B. Mitchell Reed, the Real Don Steele, Dave Diamond), a  dramatic voice proclaimed:  </P> <P> "And now, ladies and gentlemen, the beat goes on . . . roll tape. You are about  to witness the birth of a brand-new radio station. It's 5:03 a.m. KQLZ signs on  the air for the very first time. Signing on the air, this is the all new  KQLZ-FM Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Southern California, it's time to wake up. The mother ship has landed: Pirate  Radio 100.3. Welcome to the jungle."  </P> <P> Following the Guns N' Roses hit of that name, the new station's second  selection was, appropriately, "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones.  </P> <P> KQLZ is the second station bought by Culver City-based Westwood One, the  nation's largest supplier of syndicated radio programming. The company also  bought New York City's only country and Western station last year.  </P> <P> As part of the "Pirate Radio" gimmick, the station is temporarily broadcasting  from the back of a Westwood One warehouse, complete with "Pirate Radio"  scrawled over the control console where Shannon and other KQLZ deejays do their  announcing. In keeping with the "all-new" concept, no deejays currently on the  air in the Los Angeles market have been hired to man the KQLZ mikes.  </P> <P> Shannon will hold down the 6 to 10 a.m. slot, followed by former San Diego  deejay Whitney Allen from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., with Shadow Steele, from New  Orleans, taking over at 3 p.m. At 7 p.m., Atlanta deejay "Domino" takes the  microphone, followed by former Oxnard deejay Jimmy Page at 11 p.m. The  overnight shift from 2 to 6 a.m. features "Bubba the Love Monkey," described by  Shannon as "an unemployed guy from Odessa, Texas."  </P> <P> The station's general manager is Simon T, who comes to KQLZ from KCBQ-FM in San  Diego.  </P> <P> The so-called "Morning Zoo" comedy repertory format that made his station in  New York, Z-100, the most popular outlet on the East Coast, will not be  duplicated at KQLZ, Shannon said.  </P> <P> The new station was originally scheduled to go on the air in early April, but  Pattiz and Shannon decided to surprise the competition with their new format  Friday in order to put competing morning drive-time personalities off balance.  Several already had taken pre-emptive measures, however.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' top-rated rock station, KPWR-FM (105.9), recently adopted  Shannon's "Morning Zoo" name for its morning drive-time crew, headed by  deejay/actor Jay Thomas. Several other "Zoo" gimmicks and gags pioneered by  Shannon in New York, such as "the juke box from hell" and a "worst-to-first"  contest, have been implemented by rival stations, most notably the No. 2  station in Los Angeles, KIIS-FM (102.7).  </P> <P> "We're programming the two top-rated radio stations in Los Angeles and we're  not even on the air yet," said Shannon, referring to the "Morning Zoo" gimmicks  that he pioneered and that are now being used on KIIS and KPWR.  </P> <P> KPWR's Thomas told The Times that he welcomes Shannon's competition, while KIIS  deejay Rick Dees, the longtime morning ratings champ, declined to comment.  </P> <P> "There's enough (audience) out there for everybody," said KLSX-FM (97.1)  morning man Peter Tilden.  </P> <P> KIQQ became the third station in as many weeks to change its call letters. Last  week, KMPC-FM (101.9) became KEDG "The Edge," though it kept its same on-air  personalities and album rock format. Two weeks ago, KNX-FM (93.1) dropped its  call letters, most of its deejays and its progressive rock format in favor of  an oldies rock format. The new station is known as KODJ-FM.  </P> <P> KQLZ's "Pirate Radio" concept is taken from the renegade broadcast tradition  dating back more than 20 years, when ships in the North Sea transmitted rock  'n' roll into the British Isles from international waters where the British  government had no jurisdiction over what could be broadcast. More recently, a  pair of pirate stations popped up off Long Island in New York until the Federal  Communications Commission tracked them down and forced them off the air.  </P> <P> Westwood One's Pattiz is not so ingenuous as to try to pass off his new  $54-million station as shoestring radio, but he does maintain that KQLZ has the  unsafe overtones of an experimental operation.  </P> <P> Pattiz said Westwood One will be using its satellite, SatCom 1R, to send the  KQLZ signal out nationally to affiliates.  </P> <P> "This thing is really going to evolve," he said. "Everybody expects us to go  Top 40, but that's not what we're going to be. It'll have a harder edge to it.  It hasn't been done significantly anywhere else. This will not just be  attracting listeners from KIIS and Power (KPWR), but KLSX, KLOS and everybody  else on the dial too."  </P> <P> Ten minutes before he signed off, K-LITE overnight deejay Gary Butterworth  wished his audience an enjoyable Friday and played the last K-LITE promotional  insert:  </P> <P> "K-LITE: The station everybody at work can agree on."  </P></p>

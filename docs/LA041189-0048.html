			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> NAVAL DEPOT RED FOXES GIVEN A BRIEF REPRIEVE  </P> <P> A federal judge extended an order barring the Navy from killing or maiming red  foxes in a wildlife sanctuary at the Seal Beach Weapons Station until another  hearing on the matter Thursday in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher made the decision Monday to give federal  attorneys more time to gather evidence to support their contention that the red  foxes must be killed to protect two species of endangered birds that nest in  the 1,100-acre Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge on the military property.  </P> <P> An Orange County-based group, the Animal Lovers Volunteer Assn., sued the U.S.  Navy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1986 to stop the killing of  foxes, a predator not native to the area. The foxes, according to government  biologists, prey on the eggs of the light-footed clapper rail and the  California lest tern, two endangered bird species that inhabit the marshy  refuge.  </P> <P> Kelleher issued a temporary restraining order last week that allows the Navy to  continue trapping and removing the foxes, but he prohibited killing the  animals. Attorneys for Animal Lovers had sought the injunction after learning  that a handful of red foxes had been killed in recent weeks by federal  biologists.  </P> <P> Federal officials have argued that it has become increasingly difficult to find  homes outside the area for the foxes because of their predatory nature and  ability to breed rapidly.  </P> <P> In a statement released after Monday's hearing, U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner  said the federal government "intends to pursue all legal activities necessary  to protect" the birds in the sanctuary, including the removal of the foxes.  </P></p>

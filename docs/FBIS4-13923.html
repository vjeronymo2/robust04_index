			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ilyas Abu-Rizq, chairman of the Lebanese </F> General Labor Federation, by radio correspondent Antoine  Constantine in Beirut on 25 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Constantine] Chairman of the General Labor  Federation: There is a danger of a confrontation between your  federation and the security forces tomorrow. Can your  federation be held responsible for the results of the  demonstration under the current conditions in the country?    [Abu-Rizq] The government alone is responsible for such  dangers because the government's failure to implement the  agreement it ratified during the cabinet meeting is the cause of  this demonstration. The government signed an agreement granting  workers in both the public and private sectors their basic  rights. However, the government's failure to implement this  agreement has forced the General Labor Federation to resort to  its legitimate right to stage demonstrations. This right is  supported by human rights, the Lebanese Constitution, and  international laws. The government alone will be responsible  for anything that might occur during the demonstration or for  banning the demonstration. If the government does not want to  see security disturbances it must implement the agreement that  was reached five months ago. If it does, there will be no  demonstration. As long as the government fails to implement the  agreement the demonstration will take place.</p>

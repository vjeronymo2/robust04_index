			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: Gold still has glitter Sir, While we agree with Kenneth Gooding that it has been a chilly spring indeed for gold ('All that is gold no longer glisters', March 26), we would like to set against it the following information, not available to the market when Mr Gooding was researching his article. On the basis of those markets for which we have good data, 1991 global consumer demand for gold appears to have gone from strength to strength. In fact, preliminary results indicate that jewellery demand may have outstripped new mine production for the third year in a row. How can this be true with the stories about weak jewellery demand currently circulating in the market? Most gold traders look at the demand for unwrought gold in jewellery fabrication, which is closer to their own business than final consumer demand. But, obviously, consumer demand will dictate fabrication demand in the final analysis. While it is too early for us to assess the first quarter's state of fabrication off-take, seasonally adjusted, pessimism should be tempered with the understanding that in recent record-breaking years, first quarter fabrication looked anaemic at the time. Second, we continue to think of India as a source of strength and optimism for the future. When India swapped smuggled gold for foreign exchange last year, the resulting hue and cry led the government to redeem these swaps and even to increase its official gold reserves. The clear intent of the recent India-International Monetary Fund economic plan is to work with the Indian appetite for gold, rather than to try to fight it. While the gold price does tend to revert quite strongly to its underlying trend, in most recent years it has routinely outperformed equities in at least one quarter or longer.

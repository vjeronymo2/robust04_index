			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Ansaldo wins Mideast water contracts ANSALDO, the engineering subsidiary of the Italian state-controlled Finmeccanica group, has announced it has won four water treatment contracts in the Middle East totalling L325bn (Dollars 204m). The awards strengthen Ansaldo's presence in the Middle East, less than a week after it won a contract heading a consortium to build a L800bn power station and desalination plant in Abu Dhabi. The largest of the new contracts is for a L200bn project in Kuwait to produce 600,000 cubic metres a day of drinking water from existing desalination plants. Another for L62bn involves the supply of 22 water treatment plants in Cairo for the Egyptian Ministry of Reconstruction capable of processing 100,000 cubic metres of water a day. A third contract, worth L43bn, was awarded by the Saudi Agriculture and Water Ministry for the construction of a water storage and distribution system in the capital, Riyadh, for water coming from Gulf desalination plants. A further water treatment contract worth L20bn, with the Milan group Emit, was won in Damascus. W Midlands rail deal, Page 8</p>

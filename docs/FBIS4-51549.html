			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Japanese Cabinet ministers  in charge of economic affairs on Saturday agreed on a set of  measures on Japan's immediate economic management, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said.    At an emergency meeting to discuss the yen's recent surge  against the U.S. dollar, the ministers concurred on the need to  closely watch the developments in foreign currency markets and  to keep in touch with nations concerned, the top government  spokesman said.    They also agreed on the need to smoothly carry out a record  15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package unveiled in  February and seek to pass the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national  budget through the Diet as quickly as possible, Kumagai told a  news conference.    The ministers reportedly agreed the government should come  up  with more concrete measures to further open its markets by the  end of June on the basis of similar steps announced in March.    They also reaffirmed the need to chart a course for  comprehensive tax system reform by the end of June and push  necessary legislation through the Diet by the end of the year,  he said.    The hastily arranged meeting brought together Prime Minister  Hata, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata,  Koshiro Ishida, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency,  Yoshio Terasawa, head of the Economic Planning Agency.    Kumagai also attended the gathering on behalf of Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who left Tokyo earlier in the day to  attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  to be held in Nice, France, from Tuesday to Thursday.    Kumagai said the ministers shared the view that the  government should spur the nation's sustainable growth led by  domestic demand and cope with its massive trade surplus,  especially with the United States.    The emergency meeting came on the heels of the yen's sharp  rise to the 100 yen level to the dollar on overseas markets  Friday.    In New York, the U.S. dollar closed Friday at 101.55-65 yen  after plunging to a postwar low for the market of 100.65 yen.    The yen's recovery to the mid-101 yen level to the dollar  followed concerted interventions by Japanese and U.S. monetary  authorities.    It was the first time in eight months that the dollar dipped  to the 100 yen level. The dollar plummeted to a historic low of  100.40 yen in Tokyo last August.    In London, too, the dollar weakened against the yen, falling  below the 101 yen level in afternoon trading before finishing  the day at 101.45-55 yen, down 0.40 yen from the previous day's  late quote.</p>

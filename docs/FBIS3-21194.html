			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with RIKEN Director General Minoru Oda; </F> interviewer and date not given: ...]    [Text] Universities and public research organizations have  increasingly tried to have the details of research evaluated  (reviewed) by external scientists. The University of Tokyo  Science Department Physics Section and the Institute of Physical  and Chemical Research (RIKEN) are applying this and the research  institutes of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology  (AIST) are introducing the same type of system. Efforts are made  to avoid complacency and aim for the Center of Excellence (COE),  but will this truly change Japan's research organizations? RIKEN  Director General Minoru Oda was asked.  <H5>  Boards of Directors Also the Subject </H5>   NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: RIKEN has had a system for evaluation  of the results of research in the past. What was the goal of  this?    ODA: Researchers in charge are reviewed every seven years  and  leaders of the frontier research system are also reviewed in the  middle and at the end of the research period and are exposed to  severe evaluation. So, what about in terms of organization  management? In the board of directors about three and a half  years ago, the subject of possibly reviewing the board of  directors as well came up.    Immediately, my friend Professor Clark of the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology came for about one week, but the areas  of research in RIKEN are extensive. An advisory council of  fifteen people from in the five areas of physics, chemistry,  biology, engineering, and medicine was formed and was asked to  make a periodic review every two years.    NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: Can appropriate evaluation be made in  several days observation?    ODA: Two white papers showing in detail the management  mechanisms, research headings, and budgets were made and sent in  advance. Observation was for three days, but I think they saw  well. We showed all the weak and strong spots of RIKEN. Some  delegates said that research details were understood and became  references. They are also rivals in this research, but if a  sincere review is expected, we are resigned to show our  capacities without reserve. It was decided to replace one third  of the committee to avoid people saying what everyone else said.  <H5>  Without Strict Evaluation </H5>   NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: Though a special request was made of  the personnel system, there were no strict indications.    ODA: With indiscriminate praise for research results, one  feels inferior. The indication that public appeals for  researchers in charge (lifelong work) have expanded globally is  received seriously. Currently as well, we would like to open the  gate, conduct conferences in the institute in English, tear down  so-called walls, and invite superior human resources. Also, the  proposal to raise the age limit to employment of a general  researcher (less than 32 years of age as a rule) was a little  unexpected. The conscious customary rule is the promotion of  young people, but there may be ill effects if operated by hard  and fast regulations.    In a certain sense, public reports may draw thorns, but for  myself, straightforward opinions such as ``this research is not  important'' in notes or orally also contribute. The proposal  establishes committee meetings in the institute and would like  to be related to improvements.  <H5>  Difficulty in National Research Institutes </H5>   NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: The chief executive officer has  worked  on the review of the University of Tokyo and U.S. national  research institutes and also has experience on the ``evaluation  side.'' Are the opinions of outsiders really viable?    ODA: Whether a research organization is lively and whether  there are management problems are not understood from papers.  External review is important for activation. Of course, if  sufficient information is not disclosed, it is incomplete and  meaningless because of neglect. It is not said that the  accommodation of RIKEN was the maximum, but was made as clear as  possible. The attitude of the evaluation makes or breaks the  review.    RIKEN has a tradition of freely doing basic research and is  favored. Before, I was at a university, but at the university I  had autonomy and was afraid of external evaluation and contrary  proposals. There were many problems difficult to resolve just by  the efforts on the part of the university, such as the budget  and system. Even so we thought to expand the review system.    NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: The AIST National Institute for  Advanced Interdisciplinary Research will soon introduce external  evaluation.    ODA: This is basically good. But, generally the review of  national institutes is thought to be more difficult than for  universities. This is because even though the value of research  is not superior in national institutes, the themes are those  which must advance as national policy. The more facts are known,  straightforward review becomes difficult. Isn't there danger of  declaring it was done strictly and stopping?  <H5>  Viewpoint: Necessity to Remove Walls in the System </H5>   [Author Mikio Kamino]    The establishment of the advisory council is the so-called  ``parting gift'' of Director Oda who is retiring at the end of  this month. How to make the most of the review has become the  assignment. Because the University of Tokyo and RIKEN both honor  students, they have taken the plunge into review. In the future,  many other universities and public research organizations  criticized of ``lukewarm constitution'' will require strict  evaluation, but Mr. Oda also mentions that this is not so simple.    Universities and national research institutions introducing  external review may increase more, but it is necessary to open  the way to reforming systems such as personnel and budget since  it may just be a pose of researchers showing ``humility.'' This  will just burden with an assignment which cannot be solved and  nothing will change.</p>

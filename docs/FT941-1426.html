			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Tory agent will stand trial A Conservative party political agent was yesterday ordered to stand trial accused of falsifying a proxy vote. The High Court ruled that Barnet magistrates in north London 'perversely' blocked the trial of Mr Miles Parker in May by refusing an adjournment after prosecution lawyers had been misinformed about the time of the hearing. Mr Parker, of Edmonton, north London, had faced two summonses of falsifying a voter's postal ballot form and turning it into a proxy vote for a Conservative candidate in local elections.</p>

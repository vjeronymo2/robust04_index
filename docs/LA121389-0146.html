			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Motor City Blues: Film maker Michael Moore says pressure from General Motors  caused the Detroit Institute of Arts to cancel the Jan. 11 premiere of his film  "Roger and Me," a critically-hailed documentary that mocks GM Chairman Roger  Smith. Moore said the cancellation was "an act of censorship," but the  institute's director, Elliott Wilhelm, said the action was taken because Warner  Bros. couldn't guarantee that Moore would attend the opening of the film, which  shows how GM cutbacks have hurt Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich. Smith is on  the board of trustees of the DIA Founders Society and he and his wife are major  contributors. GM also makes cumulative contributions of $100,000 or more.  DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

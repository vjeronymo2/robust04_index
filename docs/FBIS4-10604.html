			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jujuy, 14 Apr (NA) -- The first decision Deputy  Oscar Agustin Perassi (Justicialist Party-Jujuy) made following  his installation as governor of Jujuy was to uphold the veto of  the wage hike previously passed by Jose Carlos Ficoseco, who has  gone on leave. [passage omitted]    Perassi replaces Ficoseco, who asked for a leave of absence  until after the Constituent Assembly empowered to amend the  Constitution concludes its sessions. Ficoseco was elected  delegate to this assembly on 10 April. [passage omitted]    Soon after being installed yesterday evening, Perassi  announced that he intends to reshuffle the provincial cabinet  "gradually." He ruled out the possibility of co-governing with  the other provincial parties, like the Jujuy Popular Movement,  the UCR [Radical Civic Union], and the Republican Force.  [passage omitted]</p>

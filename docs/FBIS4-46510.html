			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Inf. NA: "Strengthen Discipline and Learn To </F> Work in a New Way"]    [Text] The chief of the Main Directorate of Indoctrination  and Socio-Psychological Work of the Ministry of Defense,  Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, spoke to the attendees and  instructor personnel of the Scientific-Research and  Methodological Center of the main directorate on April 26. These  meetings with educational officers who are studying at the  two-month skills-enhancement courses have become a tradition.    Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar called the attention of  the officers to the political situation surrounding the Crimea,  and related in detail the work of the Ministry of Defense [MO]  delegation during the recent meeting of the ministers of defense  of Ukraine and Russia in Sevastopol.    Anatoliy Oleksiyovych, speaking of problems in the life and  activity of the military and the tasks of the bodies for  indoctrination and socio-psychological work, dwelled on such  important elements as mobilization readiness, the development of  new forms and methods of influencing the personnel, military  discipline and the training of cadres for indoctrination and  socio-psychological work.    He pointed out in particular that the work of the bodies for  VSPR [indoctrination and socio-psychological work] aimed at  resolving the tasks of mobilization readiness is proceeding too  slowly. This is explained by the fact, said Lieutenant-General  Anatoliy Kobzar, that we have squandered progressive work  experience in this area and appreciably weakened its base. The  task was posed to the officers in this regard, and directions  for activity were indicated, of teaching people during periods  of measures relating to mobilization readiness, gathering the  necessary information and creating a suitable  educational-materials base.    There are substantial areas of unfinished work that must be  eliminated in the functional duties of the deputy battalion and  company commanders for indoctrination and socio-psychological  work with regard to the training and indoctrination of the more  active core personnel from among conscript servicemen. It was  pointed out that these classes (actions at various levels of  combat readiness) should necessarily conclude with the combat  coordination of the subunits and the active personnel.    The chief of the Main Directorate for VSPR, speaking of the  development of new methods of influencing servicemen, emphasized  that we should have a creative approach to the indoctrination of  people, rather than simply carrying over mindlessly the forms  and methods of former party-political work, and make more  extensive use of television and radio, newspapers and journals  so as to create an information expanse not just within the Armed  Forces, but also all around them.    The capabilities of humanities training, the Centers for  Culture and Leisure, ethnic studies rooms and unit clubs are  also not being utilized to the full extent, the speaker pointed  out. Opportunities in the regions where units are stationed  should also be utilized more extensively in this regard.    Particular attention was devoted to the upsurge in military  discipline, and strengthening it.    Concern was expressed with regard to the fact that some  officers and warrant officers have been avoiding indoctrination  work with their subordinates, and are moreover themselves not  setting an example with regard to service.    The tasks of the educational officers flow out of this; they  should, figuratively speaking, take their place in battle in the  prevailing situation. This signifies that they should not stand  in for the work of the commanders, they should not duplicate  them, but should rather supplement that work with the specific  forms and methods that are characteristic of VSPR.    It was understood that the deputy commanders for VSPR, in  order to conduct indoctrination and socio-psychological work  successfully in the collectives, have to improve their own  knowledge and skills more actively, making maximum use for that  purpose of the opportunities of the Professional Training Day in  the units. All of the workers in indoctrination and  socio-psychological work must be given opportunities for  training on that day.    Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar answered the questions of  those in attendance after his speech.</p>

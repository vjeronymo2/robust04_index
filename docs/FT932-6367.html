			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dobson Park falls Pounds 714,000 into loss DOBSON PARK Industries, which recently merged its mining equipment business with a rival to survive the UK coal crisis, fell into the red in the first half with pre-tax losses of Pounds 714,000. The sharp swing from profits last year of Pounds 6.2m was primarily the result of the Pounds 4.36m book loss on the disposal of two businesses. However, the restructuring of the mining division and uncertainty over the future of the UK coal pits had also hit profits. Losses per share totalled 1.12p, against earnings of 3.32p. The interim dividend is cut from 1.9p to 1.2p. Net operating return was 39 per cent lower at Pounds 4.1m, on sales 27 per cent down to Pounds 71.8m. Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the group expected a much better performance from the mining division in the second half. The business had suffered a 50 per cent drop in net operating profits to Pounds 1.5m during the six months to April 3. Orders were running ahead of last year, the chairman said, and the joint venture with Meco International would easily achieve forecast turnover of Pounds 200m in 1993. Dobson Park, which is in the process of refocusing on its industrial electronics and mining businesses, sold its aerospace components operation and loss-making power tools subsidiary for a total Pounds 15m cash. Net debt after inclusion of the power tool proceeds would be Pounds 5.7m. Mr Kaye said the group hoped to expand the industrial electronics division in the UK to avoid potential ACT problems. Currently about 75 per cent of this division's sales come from overseas. Industrial electronics returned operating profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.4m) in the first half. Toys and plastics fell from Pounds 537,000 to Pounds 364,000.</p>

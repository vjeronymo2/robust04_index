			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Trizec delays vote on debt restructuring TRIZEC has delayed a vote on its CDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 926m) debt-restructuring plan to give securities holders more time to evaluate proposals made by the Calgary-based developer. The company said yesterday that meetings to approve the plan, which were scheduled for December 7, will not be held until at least early-1994. Trizec initially hoped to complete the restructuring by late-October. But Mr Derrick Tay, who represents an informal committee of debenture holders, said: 'We cannot be rushed.' Trizec's debts total CDollars 5.4bn. The plan is to relieve a heavy debt-servicing burden over the next two-three years by converting senior and junior debentures as well as preferred shares into common equity.</p>

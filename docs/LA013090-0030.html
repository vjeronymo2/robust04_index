			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WYNN TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR SAN DIEGO STATE  </P> <P> San Fernando High quarterback Michael Wynn has made an oral commitment to  attend San Diego State after he visited the Western Athletic Conference school  over the weekend.  </P> <P> Wynn, 6-foot-3, 205 pounds, had visited Washington but canceled trips to  Arizona State, Colorado and USC before choosing San Diego State.  </P> <P> "Friends said to me, 'Wow, you had a chance to go to USC,' but I just didn't  feel the place was right for me. San Diego State felt like home," he said  Monday.  </P> <P> Wynn's cousins, George and Sebastian Glaze, redshirted as freshmen in the fall  and served as Wynn's hosts over the weekend. George was an offensive lineman in  1988 at San Fernando and Sebastian played linebacker in '88 for Granada Hills.  </P> <P> San Diego State recruited Wynn as a quarterback while other schools had  considered Wynn at defensive back or wide receiver. "All I want is a shot at  quarterback and I feel I'll get a fair shake there," he said.  </P> <P> Wynn entered the 1989 season as one of the most highly regarded players in the  Valley area but endured a disappointing senior season. He completed 53 of 140  passes (37.8%) for 726 yards and four touchdowns. The Tigers, who were 5-6  overall, passed sparingly after they adopted the wishbone attack halfway  through the season.  </P> <P> As a junior, Wynn excelled in the team's multiple-set offense, completing 108  of 209 passes (51.7%) for 1,614 yards and 24 touchdowns.

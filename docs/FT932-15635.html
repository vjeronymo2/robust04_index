			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: French look to a new era - The prospects for arts minister Jacques Toubon THE SUMPTUOUS 18th-century corridors of the French culture ministry at the Palais Royal in Paris have been bustling with activity as Jack Lang, the former arts minister, moved out and Jacques Toubon, his successor, moved in. It is the end of an era for the arts in France. Lang, 53, with his curly locks and Thierry Mugler suits, has dominated the cultural scene for nearly a decade with his innovative policies, big budgets, lavish promotions and the grands projets, his monuments to modern architecture. Liberation, bible of the French intelligentsia, even dubbed the 1980s - l'epoch Lang, the Lang era. What happens now? Will the new conservative government provide the same level of financial support as the socialists? How will the arts be affected by the austerity measures announced by Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister? And how will Toubon match up to Lang? Toubon does, at least, want the job. Francois Leotard, culture minister in the last conservative government from 1986 to 1988, reluctantly accepted the portfolio only after President Francois Mitterrand had blocked his appointment as defence minister, the post he holds in the new cabinet. But the gregarious Toubon, 51, a casino croupier's son from Nice who entered politics from the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, is an arts enthusiast. He is also a confidant of Jacques Chirac, prime minister in the last conservative administration and now mayor of Paris, where he rivals even Lang in the extravagance of his arts budget. Toubon made an early play for the culture ministry by writing the conservatives' arts manifesto, beating off competition for the job from Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, and Bernard-Henri Levy, the 'pop' philosopher. The new minister's enthusiasm may not be enough. The chief concern of the arts community is the fate of the cultural budget, which rose rapidly in l'epoch Lang from 0.47 per cent of government expenditure in 1981, when Lang took office, to 0.98 per cent last year. Traditionally the conservatives have cut the budget. It fell from 0.93 per cent when Leotard arrived in 1986 to 0.81 per cent when he left in 1988. Lang was lucky. He presided over the culture ministry when the French economy was booming. Toubon is less fortunate. The economy is now sluggish and the conservatives have inherited a FFr226bn (Pounds 28.35bn) budget deficit. Balladur has asked his new cabinet to save FFr20bn from annual expenditure, some of which must come from the arts. Which areas will be most vulnerable? The grands projets are now completed. The only exception is the FFr7.2bn Tres Grande Bibliotheque, the controversial new national library designed by Dominique Perrault, which is still a hole in the ground. But Lang has already spent FFr4bn digging the hole, and Toubon has conceded that it will go ahead. However, there are likely to be far fewer new schemes. The Opera Bastille may find it difficult to persuade the conservatives to fund its plans for a 1,100 seat auditorium to stage smaller productions. The final phase of the FFr5.6bn Grand Louvre scheme, which involves renovating and extending the galleries of the Louvre museum and the neighbouring Musee des Arts Decoratifs, could also be curtailed. Toubon has hinted that the conservatives may cut contributions to the running costs of arts institutions, particularly in Paris. The Opera Bastille's FFr520m state subsidy may be vulnerable as the new opera has been clouded by controversy and lack-lustre reviews. The cuts could pose problems for some institutions. The conservatives will encourage them to raise extra money from corporate sponsorship. But French industry is now under financial pressure. Moreover, many big arts sponsors are state-controlled companies which may be less generous once they are sold off in the conservatives' privatisation programme. Toubon will do his best to mitigate the damage, and one of his strongest cards will be Lang who, although he has lost some of his lustre, is still France's most popular elected politician. He also had the advantage of being in power for so long that he had enough time to implement his policies. A great deal will depend on Toubon's own status within the cabinet. He has far less clout than his predecessor. Lang used the arts portfolio as a base from which to build a cultural 'super-ministry' including media, education and, eventually, the deputy prime ministership. Toubon only has the arts brief. Toubon's personal position is also more precarious. Lang had the inestimable advantage of being a favourite of President Mitterrand. The new arts minister's chief ally, Chirac, is not even in the cabinet, having gambled that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential elections will be better if he stays outside the government.</p>

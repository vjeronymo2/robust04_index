			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / CIA looks for a role as the cold war becomes history: Ken Warn sees the intelligence organisation under fire from all sides The Central Intelligence Agency is not alone these days in downsizing to meet changed international circumstances. But for the CIA, adapting to tighter budgets and rapidly changing intelligence needs is proving particularly painful. The organisation finds itself under fire from all sides, facing a hostile press, an expansionist Federal Bureau of Investigation, and even a threatened media onslaught from Mr Aldrich Ames, the CIA operative who admitted spying for Moscow for nearly 10 years and was sentenced to life imprisonment in April. In Congress there are those such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who believe the demise of the Soviet Union, the focus of CIA activity for most of its 50 years, means the agency has outlived its usefulness altogether. More than any other single problem, the agency is operating under the shadow of the Ames debacle. In an outspoken attack last week, Mr James Woolsey, CIA director, called Ames 'a malignant betrayer of his country  - who killed a number of people who helped the US and and the west win the cold war. He killed them just as surely as if he pulled the trigger of a revolver put to their heads in the basement of the Lubyanka prison.' Mr Ames is believed to be negotiating from his prison cell with the US media to launch an attack on his old employers. At his sentencing Mr Ames referred to US espionage as undertaken by the CIA and other agencies as 'a self-serving sham carried out by careerist bureaucrats'. Under the barrage of criticism, Mr Woolsey last week unveiled 'a comprehensive overhaul' of the way the CIA does business. That will include tightening personnel security in an effort to avoid another Ames case, along with a review of operations, analysis, science and technology, and administration. Mr Woolsey said he also wanted to change the CIA's culture, making managers more accountable for their mistakes and making the agency less of a closed, white male fraternity. Congress is preparing to investigate claims of discrimination by over 100 female agents and belated moves are under way to place women in more senior positions. The CIA is also making sharp cuts in staffing, both at its Langley, Virginia, headquarters and abroad, as funding dwindles. The closure of 15 stations in Africa was announced last month. The House of Representatives voted last week to keep the CIA budget secret for at least another year, but it is is estimated at about Dollars 3bn out of the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18bn) devoted to the US intelligence community. Much of the other Dollars 25bn goes to fund costly satellite and electronic espionage. Spending has been declining steeply in real terms since 1990. In his 18 months as CIA director, Mr Woolsey has already sought to shift the emphasis of CIA operations in the wake of the collapse of its principal foe. In a world of multiple threats of nuclear proliferation, terrorism, drug cartels, and doubts over the stability of Russia and China, he argues, the CIA is far from being a relic of the cold war. However, this new focus inevitably brings turf battles with other bodies such as the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration. In addition, Mr Woolsey has sought to make the CIA more responsive to US economic needs, attuning it to the Clinton administration's agenda. While denying absolutely that the agency conducts industrial espionage on behalf of US business, Mr Woolsey said the CIA would follow macro-economic developments more closely, particularly in Russia and China, and continue to monitor sales of dual-use technology. Tracking and objecting to foreign companies' efforts to 'bribe their way to contracts' in US export markets - which US companies are forbidden to do under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - saved US business 'several billion dollars a year' at a 'conservative' estimate, he said. Under its director Mr Louis Freeh, the FBI appears to have been one of the main beneficiaries of the CIA's difficulties. This month Mr Freeh opened an FBI office in Moscow while on an energetic swing through eastern Europe. The growing internationalisation of the FBI's crime-fighting efforts, looking at issues such as preventing the theft of former Soviet nuclear materials and weapons, strays directly into CIA territory. Following a review of counter-intelligence co-ordination ordered by President Bill Clinton after the Ames case, a senior FBI member was appointed to head a new counter-intelligence centre based at the CIA, in a blow to the agency's pride. Mr Woolsey's speech was his toughest response yet to his proliferating troubles. But it is not clear if any internal review, however thorough, will head off demands for an external root and branch investigation of US intelligence. In a defiant message to 'those who wish America ill', Mr Woolsey said: 'Let me be quite clear: we are changing but we are not going away. Do not equate a decline in resources and size with a decrease in vigilance. Do not confuse a re-assessment of our mission with a retreat from our responsibilities.'</p>

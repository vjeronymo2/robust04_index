			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA  </P> <P> How short is our memory regarding Nicaragua? Prevented by public opinion from  launching an invasion of Nicaragua, the Reagan government bought and created  mercenaries, the Contras.  </P> <P> When the law said, "don't arm the Contras," it was continued illegally. Caught  in the act, our government manages to supply the Contras, who still kill  civilians in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> The U.S. has strangled Nicaragua with a paralyzing embargo and CIA economic  sabotage.  </P> <P> Unable to defeat the Nicaraguan people in other ways, it's trying to rig the  upcoming elections. President Bush is asking $9 million over the next four  months to buy the Nicaraguan election (Part A, Oct. 17).  </P> <P> A small, poor country, receiving more than $5 American dollars per every man,  woman and child, could have a consequential impact.  </P> <P> Even so, the U.S. money will not be seen by thousands of poor, war-ravaged  people. $1.3 million will go to rent cars at $20 a day for presidential  candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's National Opposition Union party.  </P> <P> A U.S. senator is quoted as asking, "Do we really want free elections and fair  elections in Nicaragua, or do we want an election bought and paid for by the  U.S. government?"  </P> <P> HASKELL WEXLER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

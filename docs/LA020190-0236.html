			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EAST GERMAN SKATER WINS WOMEN'S TITLE  </P> <P> Evelyn Grossmann, who comes from Katarina Witt's hometown, stamped herself as a  successor to the East German star by coming from behind to win the women's  title at the European Figure Skating Championships today.  </P> <P> Grossmann, 18, beat a nervous Natalia Lebedeva of the Soviet Union, who led  going into the final free program, but fell three times and dropped to second.  </P> <P> Marina Kielmann of West Germany took third place.  </P> <P> In other events today, Czechoslovakia's Petr Barna moved in to a narrow lead in  the men's event after the original program, while world champions Marina  Klimova and Sergei Pononomarenko took command in the ice dance competition.  </P> <P> In a lackluster women's final, Grossmann had just enough to edge Lebedeva, who  was trying to become the first Soviet woman to win an individual crown.  </P> <P> Instead, Grossmann became the fifth East German woman to take a European title,  following Witt, Annett Poetzsch, Christine Errath and Gabriele Seyfert.  </P> <P> Skating to "Slaughter on 10th Avenue", Grossmann landed four triple jumps  cleanly. She earned marks of 5.4 to 5.7, which were good enough to take the  free program.  </P> <P> Grossmann was seventh in the European championships last year. Claudia Leistner  of West Germany, who has since turned pro, won in 1989. But Witt took the crown  six times before that.  </P> <P> "I am astounded I won the championship," Grossmann said. "I just came here  hoping for a medal."  </P></p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Russia's oil wealth comes from a black hole: Leyla Boulton describes the human and environmental degradation she found in the country's richest energy region THE RIVERS are poisoned, the streets have no pavements and some workers spend sub-zero winters living in caravans. This human misery is not that of some Third World country - it is at the heart of Russia's richest oil producing region. Nizhnevartovsk, a town of 280,000 people which sprang up with an oil boom 20 years ago, epitomises the paradox of the industry which is Russia's main source of hard currency: 'What workers produce here goes to maintain the whole country, and yet we live in such conditions because not enough of the wealth is spent on improving the lives of local people,' says Mr Ivan Gulyants, deputy head of the administration of the 118,000 sq km Nizhnevartovsk district. The Tyumen region, to which Nizhnevartovsk belongs, produces 60 per cent of Russia's oil. But after two decades of abuse from a system whose top priority was meeting centrally-planned output targets, the local environment is in a catastrophic state. And despite that sacrifice, oil production has fallen steadily in recent years - because of a shortage of equipment, investment and a demoralised workforce. Workers who went there from all around the Soviet Union to 'produce oil for the Motherland' have issued the latest of a series of strike threats which could bring the country to its knees. Angered by a nationwide shortage of banknotes which means their salaries have not been paid in full since April, they are also united with management in seeking payment for the oil they supply, as well as higher oil prices. So far the oilmen have never had to act on threats which they know would inflict further devastating losses on their own industry - but the fear is that their patience may not last. While peeling apartment blocks with broken windows exhibit old slogans such as 'Builders, Let's Complete Oil Installations Early', thousands more workers live in makeshift caravans with their families - enduring temperatures of minus 40 degrees Centigrade in winter and mosquito-ridden summers. A manager at one oilfield, Mr Vyacheslav Naidanov, says there is one oil spill a day on his territory because of ageing oil-pipes. If he had all the right equipment, he says, he could produce up to 5,000 tonnes a day instead of the 3,000 he achieves now. Of the 319 wells under his direction, 100 are idle for lack of basic parts and machinery. The territory is also littered with thick, stagnant black pools, some more than a decade old - dug by workers to dump oil and other rubbish as they opened up new wells. A walk along a small stretch of Mr Naidanov's Section Number 3 also reveals oil spills from accidents - caused mostly by bursting pipes - about every 20 metres. Local authorities, backed by a new republican law imposing stiff penalties, say they are now determined to do whatever it takes to make enterprises clean up their act - even if it means closing them. Mr Albert Radkin, from the regional environment protection committee, says the air and water pollution is already resulting in an increase in illnesses and in deformed and premature births. It is unlikely however, that much will improve in the near future. Although the oil industry should in theory come out on top from market reforms whose aim is to switch the economy to principles of demand and supply, its problems are compounded by the fact that while other prices have been freed, energy remains subject to price controls. After fierce political rows over what to do with the domestically-fixed oil price for fear that freeing it would impose untold hardship on the rest of the economy, the authorities now plan to approximate the state-controlled domestic price to world levels over the next two years. A tonne of oil now costs between Rbs1,800-Rbs2,200 - up from the ridiculous level of Rbs350 (the price of three bottles of vodka). But even the new price is not enough to cover the costs of the biggest state enterprise in the district, Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, which, with 50,000 employees, owes Rbs9bn to the bank. Even if it was paid the Rbs6bn owed to it by refineries, it would remain a net debtor. The debt crisis affecting most of Russia's state-owned enterprises is the result of managers' ability to continue trading with each other without paying for goods, rather than restructure in response to the government's restrictive financial policies. The solutions promoted by the government - re-organising enterprises so they function on market principles, and attracting foreign investment - are not going to work miracles overnight, even though foreign capital is already trickling in and leaner structures have already begun to emerge. One such new company is Chernogorneft, which broke away from Nizhnevartovskneftegaz two years ago and now leases its facilities from the government. It has already organised three joint ventures with foreign partners (this enables it to export more oil for hard currency) and has tried to motivate its 2,500 workers by giving them a stake in the enterprises. It too is in debt - but unlike Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, it would be a net creditor if other enterprises paid up. 'We worked for so many years out of enthusiasm to develop the present system,' said Ms Liubov Belova, head of Chernogorneft's ecology department. Now we are only just waking up to where this has led to.'</p>

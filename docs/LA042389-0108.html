			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATRICK KENNEDY DENIES PLANS FOR CONGRESS RACE  </P> <P> Freshman state Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy on Saturday surprised political experts  by declaring his interest in seeking reelection in Rhode Island rather than  turning his sights on Congress when he reaches the minimum age of 25 in 1992.  </P> <P> The son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who won his Rhode Island House  seat in an expensive campaign last year, had been widely expected to challenge  for one of the state's two Republican-held U.S. House seats.  </P></p>

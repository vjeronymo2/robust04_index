			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No other more effective control options for these VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from cleaning activities were found. Use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower-HAP or lower-vapor-pressure substitutes to minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative losses may be feasible, although this option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depends on the availability of a suitable replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Capture and control of fugitive emissions from the many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer, handling, and storage of solvents (and operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes) although conceivable, is impractical, making it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to invoke any quantifiable standard other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work practice requirements. Associated monitoring and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping are included for determining compliance. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an attempt to ensure that employees understand and comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirements, the proposed standards also require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each source to implement a training program for all involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Selection of the Format of the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Coating Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Most HAP emissions from coating operations in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry occur outdoors where the technology for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture has not been demonstrated. As a result the only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available technology for reducing emissions is to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of coatings with lower volatile content. Virtually all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the HAP and VOC contained in marine coatings are emitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the atmosphere during the course of application and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drying. Thus, an emission standard based on limiting both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP and VOC content of the coatings, as applied, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for these operations, particularly because any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional HAP and VOC that may be formed and emitted during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the curing process are detected and measured by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference measurement methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, the types of coatings used by the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were identified and maximum, never-to-be-exceeded HAP limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were selected for each of the several coating categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To allow additional flexibility, the ability to average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits across categories was also considered. Under an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaging approach, any coating regardless of volatile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic content, can be used as long as the volume weighted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average as applied VOHAP content, i.e., as measured by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference method, of all coatings does not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average calculated from their individual limits. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the limits, the Agency considered two types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averages: (1) Separate averages for coating within each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the coating categories and (2) a single average for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings used by a facility. The option of establishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits based on weighted averages of various coatings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different pollution content was abandoned when the industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that time and effort to plan, track, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate compliance would be too burdensome. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, the limits are based on never-to-be-exceeded VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents for 23 categories of coatings and permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``averaging'' for purposes of compliance under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. The proposed coating categories and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP limits are presented in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Handling, Transfer, and Storage of VOHAP Containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed work practice standards require that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations be carried out in such a manner that minimizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spills. For storage and transport, the proposed standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require use of containers that are normally closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide a measure of enforceability to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, each source will be required to indicate how it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to comply with the standards as part of the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification that is required of all sources under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 63 general provisions. After the Administrator or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designee negotiates and approves these compliance measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the operating permit program, each source will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a specific set of requirements for which compliance can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined by monitoring, observation and/or inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> D. Selection of Compliance Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule would require that existing sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply within 1 year after the effective date of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provides time for shipyards and coating manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to deplete most existing inventories of contemporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings. An existing unaffected area source that increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its emissions (or potential to emit) such that it becomes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major source would be required to comply within 1 year after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becoming a major source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

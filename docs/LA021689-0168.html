			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES;  </P> <P> CARSON COACH STEAMS OVER CAGE PLAYOFF MATCH  </P> <P> The L.A. City Section's longstanding policy of determining playoff spots before  the end of the regular season has at least one basketball coach up in arms.  </P> <P> Jay Park, coach of Carson's girls team, says it is unfair that the Colts,  ranked second in the City by The Times, will probably face top-ranked Crenshaw  in the second round of the 16-team 4-A Division playoffs.  </P> <P> "Try to figure that out," said a disgusted Park. "Why should we have to play  them so soon? I can see playing them at the Sports Arena (in the semifinals or  final), but to play them in the second round? That's asinine."  </P> <P> Unlike the CIF Southern Section, which determined playoff pairings after the  regular season, the L.A. City athletic office released its playoff brackets  last week. The brackets were filled according to league finish (Metro No. 1 vs.  Mid-Valley No. 2), and the appropriate teams were later placed in those spots.  </P> <P> Carson, the Pacific League champion, is seeded No. 2 and at the bottom of the  4-A bracket. Crenshaw, which tied Washington for the Southern League title but  lost a coin flip and became the league's No. 2 playoff entry, is matched in a  first-round game directly above Carson, meaning the highly regarded teams will  meet in the second round if both win playoff openers Friday.  </P> <P> This situation seemingly could have been avoided if the City had taken more  time setting up the bracket, but an administrator said the section has no plans  to change the system.  </P> <P> L.A. City athletic specialist Lee Joseph said the section predetermines playoff  spots according to league finish in order to give coaches a chance to scout  first-round opponents.  </P> <P> "This is something that's been done for years," Joseph said. "It's for scouting  purposes."  </P> <P> Concerning Carson's complaint, Joseph said: "I'd definitely like to see  Crenshaw and Carson meet in the semifinals, but it's one of those things. I  have no problem with our system."  </P> <P> Park believes Carson (17-3), which beat Crenshaw and Washington during  conference play, deserved the No. 1 seed in the playoffs after Crenshaw lost to  Washington last week. But, because it was predetermined that the Southern  League's No. 1 entry would be the top seed, that honor went to Washington.  </P> <P> Carson's girls are enjoying their best season, mainly because of the  exceptional play of junior forward Lala Lesa and senior guard Diane Miyake.  </P> <P> Lesa is averaging 15 points and 15 rebounds a game while Miyake averages 15  points and is among team leaders in rebounds, steals and assists.  </P> <P> The Colts, whose only conference loss came against Dorsey when three starters  were out with the flu, opens the L.A. City 4-A playoffs at 5:30 p.m. Friday at  home against Jordan.  </P> <P> Some coaches are critical of the City Section's boys 4-A Division bracket where  powerhouses Crenshaw (17-2) and Westchester (15-5) will meet in the second  round if they get past Friday's openers.  </P> <P> Westchester is ranked second in the L.A. City by The Times while Crenshaw is  fourth.  </P> <P> However, City sports specialist Lee Joseph says he likes the possible early  match-up.  </P> <P> "Personally, I don't think it's a bad draw," he said. "Westchester has talent,  but they haven't been playing up to capabilities. So why should I care about  them?"  </P> <P> Steve Carroll wanted a smooth break-in as Bishop Montgomery football coach, but  this wasn't what he had in mind.  </P> <P> The school weight room, which Carroll called "about the classiest thing we have  on campus," was burglarized early Friday of equipment worth an estimated  $6,272.  </P> <P> "Somebody backed a truck up and took about one-third of the weight room," said  Carroll, who was named the Knights' coach two weeks ago. "We had just gotten a  lot of new equipment and they took most of it. They pretty much knew what to  take."  </P> <P> He said half of the school's elaborate dumbbell set was stolen, along with  barbells, benches, weights and other equipment.  </P> <P> Carroll said Bishop Montgomery is asking for donations to help replace the  stolen equipment, which the school spent several years acquiring.  </P> <P> "We sunk a lot of money into that room," he said. "The bad thing about it is  that it hurts the kids. It will cost us a lot of money, but in the long run it  ends up costing the kids."  </P> <P> Anyone with information about the burglary or wishing to make donations can  contact Carroll at school at 540-2021.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills basketball Coach Cliff Warren, whose top-seeded Titans opened the  Southern Section 3-A playoffs Wednesday night, says there is no clear-cut  favorite for the division title.  </P> <P> "It's very competitive and very balanced," he said. "I've seen every team that  has been ranked (in the top 10) and anybody can beat anybody. It's like the Bay  League. There are at least 12 teams that can win it all."  </P> <P> Warren, who guided Rolling Hills to its third straight Bay League title, rates  La Canada, Morningside, Estancia of Costa Mesa, Savanna of Anaheim and  Brea-Olinda among the top contenders.  </P> <P> Chris Burton, former freshman basketball coach at Rolling Hills, partially  credits Warren for his success as the first-year coach at Fullerton High.  </P> <P> Fullerton finished the regular season with a 16-6 record and tied for the  Freeway League title under Burton, 23, the youngest head basketball coach in  Orange County. He said he was drawing technical fouls at Rolling Hills until  Warren took him aside.  </P> <P> "He said I had to calm down or I couldn't coach at Rolling Hills anymore."  </P> <P> Burton coached Rolling Hills' freshmen to winning records during the 1986 and  '87 seasons and is remembered with fondness by his former mentor.  </P> <P> "We never had any serious problems with Chris," Warren said. "We had to calm  him down a little bit, but he was a great coach for us."  </P> <P> Because of first-round byes, the number of South Bay teams opening the Southern  Section girls basketball playoffs tonight was cut in half.  </P> <P> Hawthorne, West Torrance, Bishop Montgomery, St. Bernard and St. Mary's Academy  of Inglewood will play first-round games at 7:30 tonight. Morningside, Palos  Verdes, North Torrance, Inglewood and Chadwick received passes into Saturday's  second round.  </P> <P> Hawthorne (16-9) will play host to Channel Islands (20-7) in a 5-AA Division  game. In 4-A, West (16-6) is at home against Pioneer (13-10) and Bishop  Montgomery (13-8) entertains Buena Park (11-10). In 3-A, St. Bernard (12-10) is  at home against Lompoc (15-8) and, in 2-AA, St. Mary's plays host to Notre Dame  Academy (7-9).  </P> <P> Morningside (25-1) and Palos Verdes (22-3), ranked No. 1 in the state in their  divisions by Cal-Hi Sports, are the top seeds in the 5-AA and 4-A playoffs.  Palos Verdes will play host to West on Saturday if the Warriors win tonight.  </P> <P> PREP NOTES -- Leo Hand, former head football coach at Servite High of Anaheim  and St. Anthony of Long Beach, has been named the new coach at Serra.

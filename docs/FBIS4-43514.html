			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Bundesrat </F> session in Bonn on 20 May: "Great Expectations"]    [Text] We are going to use the period of Germany's  European Unity [EU] presidency from 1 July to further  consolidate the European dimension of German foreign policy. In  particular we want to do this with France, which will take over  the presidency from us. We have agreed that as part of the  troika, in which we will find ourselves for one year, we will  tackle important European tasks in close partnership and  cooperation. The French foreign minister and I concur that the  German-French partnership remains a firm condition for European  unity and further integration.    Four features will characterize our EU presidency. First,  Europe needs a stimulus for modernization to enter the  information age, if we are to create future jobs in global  competition with North America and Asia. We Europeans will only  survive the changes if we change ourselves.    The rapid and determined implementation of the action plan  of  the Council of Europe in Brussels will be quite high on the  agenda of the Council of Europe in Essen. Therefore the  government considers it a priority matter to overcome the  obstacles to private initiative and self-responsibility among  citizens, especially in view of the difficult budget situation.  We must also not make citizens in Europe dependent solely or  primarily on the state.    Second, the prosperity gap between us and the countries of  Central Europe must be overcome, and our eastern neighbors must  be brought closer to the western zone of stability. During the  election campaigns, especially the European election campaign, I  have been trying to provide a single example that illustrates  what we are concerned with. An hourly wage in Leipzig and  Dresden, and I deliberately mention cities in the new laender,  is equal to half a day's wage in Budapest, a day's wage in  Poland, and a monthly wage in Kiev. That illustrates the  problems.    I will continue to inform our European partners that we  cannot suddenly tell the countries of Central and East Europe  that there is no room for them in our European home after we  have been telling them for decades to abandon communism and  their system and join the Western community.    Third, if we do not want to lose the support of our citizens  for Europe, we must urgently achieve progress in expanding  Europol and formulating a common refugee, asylum, and  immigration policy. That will be a decisive test for Europe.    Fourth, we must do everything we can to consolidate the EU  during our presidency and, in this respect, prepare for the 1996  government conference. We are dealing with more than just an  ideological dispute about whether the EU should consolidated or  whether it should be expanded. We are dealing with an issue  that will affect the future European Parliament, and with  justification.    Ladies and gentlemen, during our EU presidency we Germans  want to provide good examples. Many eyes will be fixed upon us  from 1 July onward, and there will be great expectations of us.  That concerns everyone, both the federation and the laender.  Therefore we must commit ourselves fully and perform our task  with zest.    The presidency's task will be to establish top priorities  that serve the interests of the community. These priorities  need not always converge with national priorities, but it has  been proved again and again that German interests are best serve  when they are implemented together with our partners. National  and European interests are always closely linked. That applies  to the French and Dutch no less than it applies to us, and that  will be the most important signpost for our presidency.</p>

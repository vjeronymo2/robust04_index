			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FLYERS SURGE PAST FALLING MAPLE LEAFS  </P> <P> Scott Mellanby's power-play goal early in the third period snapped a 1-1 tie  and sparked the Philadelphia Flyers to a 4-1 victory over the Toronto Maple  Leafs today.  </P> <P> Toronto lost for the fourth straight game and remained winless in 10 road games  this season.  </P> <P> Philadelphia, in second place in the Patrick Division, won its second straight  and closed to within five points of the idle New York Rangers.  </P> <P> Mellanby, who has nine goals this season, scored his first at home when he  tucked a back-hander between the pads of goalie Peter Ing at 4:03 of the final  period.  </P> <P> Rick Tocchet, who had a goal and an assist, dumped a pass to Keith Acton in the  slot and Acton found Mellanby alone just outside the goal mouth.  </P> <P> Derrick Smith made it 3-1 when he picked up a loose puck just inside the blue  line, skated in and beat Ing to the glove side from the left faceoff circle  with 12:13 left in the game.  </P> <P> Dale Kushner scored on a power play with nine seconds to play, slipping a shot  under Ing from just outside the crease to end the scoring.  </P> <P> Flyers' goalie Pete Peeters, making his 10th straight start, made eight saves  in the final period and turned back 22 shots in the game.  </P> <P> Toronto took a 1-0 lead just 20 seconds into the game when Luke Richardson  slapped a shot from just inside the blue line over Peeters' left shoulder.  </P> <P> Tocchet tied the game with his team-leading 15th goal. Tocchet took a pass from  Pelle Eklund while driving down the slot and slipped a shot between the pads of  Ing at 6:44 of the first period.  </P></p>

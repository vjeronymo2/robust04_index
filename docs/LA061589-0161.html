			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Iacocca Calls for Less Sex, Violence on TV: Lee A. Iacocca told television  executives to start censoring their shows or advertisers, including his own  Chrysler Corp., may pull their commercials. The Chrysler chairman said viewers  are tired of trash TV and are venting their rage on the big advertisers with  angry letters and boycotts. "I don't want to be the censor, I want you to do  it," he said in an address to the Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society. He  said the networks should tone down the "bedroom bingo" and violence and provide  more balance to controversial issues. Iacocca warned that companies such as  Chrysler, which spends $250 million a year on television, could withdraw  advertising from objectionable programming if steps are not taken to tone down  the sex and violence.  </P></p>

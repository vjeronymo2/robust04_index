			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Economics essential part of education Sir, Michael Prowse made several valid points in his discussion about the state of the education system in Britain and America ('Let's think boldly about education', March 21). He pointed out the absurdity of the fact that, under current educational guidelines, 'school children are required to study natural sciences but not economics, which . . . is far more relevant for daily life'. I totally agree, but how can we in Britain expect such a radical rethink of priorities when our secretary of state for education is someone who has publicly stated that religious knowledge should be compulsory for all secondary school students? The word 'economics' never passed his lips, probably because it never even crossed his mind. Unfortunately, the people with the power to update and improve our education system are still stuck in the 19th century. This is also demonstrated in the thinking behind the vocational courses being proposed by Sir Ron Dearing, the UK government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests. According to your article 'Business offered role in schools' (March 21), 'the aim is to encourage children who are less interested in academic subjects to gain skills and stay in full-time education'. In fact, if these courses are well thought out, they will attract a lot of interest from a broad range of students and not just those who are 'less interested in academic subjects'. Most young people want to learn the skills they need to be employable. These courses should at least provide some direction for them. At the moment they are groping in the dark.

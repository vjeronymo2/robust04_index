			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Observer: Pigeon spy As any self-respecting pigeon knows, Switzerland is not a bad place to fall sick or get hit. Any bird found injured while overflying the country is dispatched to the army's pigeon base in Bern, where it is revived, fed and sent on its way. But not for long. The Swiss army has decided to send its 30,000 carrier pigeons packing - and with it the international rescue service. For 77 years, the birds have rendered solid service in field communications. They take a mere 10 days to train; they have proved highly reliable in all weathers and over varied terrain; and they cannot be tapped or jammed. They are even well camouflaged. Civilians are indistinguishable from soldiers, the only clue being that the former are sent on mission in pairs. There has never been a case when at least one has not made its destination. While the feathered fowl normally made flights between just two command posts, they had been working up to tackling the greater challenge of three-way journeys. Disbanding the troop, meanwhile, saves SFr600,000 a year - which is hardly a fortune. But technology wins the day. The 266 pigeon trainers will be immediately redeployed, while the pigeons have a year's respite. Thereafter a lucky few may just be adopted by the federal civil service.</p>

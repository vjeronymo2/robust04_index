			<p>BFN     [Text] Now that the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] has left the coalition, it is certain the Hata government  will have to manage Diet affairs backed by a minority ruling  coalition. Government offices have now begun to worry about the  future of the new government. It is highly likely that Diet  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget bill and other pending  bills will be delayed. If arguments on tax reform become  complicated, this will adversely affect new policies to be  implemented with the fiscal 1995 budget. Because it is possible  that the current political confusion will slow down the pace of  deregulation, government offices have begun to worry that "the  policies we have formulated might be baffled."    On 26 April, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was covered with  an oppressive air. Although the SDPJ had remained reluctant to  agree on a consumption tax hike since the idea of introducing a  national welfare tax caused an uproar, the ministry has tried to  persuade the party to participate in tax reform debates the in  coalition's tax reform council meetings. When the ministry's  efforts were about to yield the desired results, the political  confusion occurred. MOF is shocked because it is now highly  likely that their efforts will go up in smoke. Its anxiety has  deepened, thinking, "The SDPJ may come to oppose the consumption  tax hike."    Some MOF officials have even begun to have ill feelings  about  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa,  who is thought to be "sympathetic to the MOF." They said: "His  way of doing things is not democratic. Is it really necessary  for him to do things in such a high-handed manner?" The Home  Affairs Ministry, which is calling for introducing regional  consumption taxes, is also concerned about the future of tax  reform.    The Economic Planning Agency is worried that if the House of  Representatives is dissolved, the product liability bill, which  was compiled jointly by nine ministries and agencies, might be  carried over to the next Diet session. If this happens, they  will not be able to carry out the initial plan to enforce the  law next summer. Meanwhile, the Health and Welfare Ministry is  anxious about the pension system reform bill, which includes a  proposal to raise the age at which people qualify for old-age  pensions.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has  submitted to the Diet a bill to promote deregulation of the gas  industry. It also plans to submit a bill on deregulation in the  electric power and oil industries. The ministry takes the  current situation seriously, saying, "The delay in enforcing  these laws will have negative effects on people's living." The  Transport Ministry also has pending bills. They are the bill to  revise the road transportation and vehicle law to abolish a  mandatory six-month car inspection and the bill to revise the  aviation law to obligate airliners to inform the government of  their planned air fare discounts.    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is  worried that the current political turmoil might affect its work  to formulate a new farm policy, including the revision of a food  control system, which is soon to be carried out on a full scale.  The ministry thinks "It is certain that a hot controversy will  rage in the Diet this autumn on the ratification of the Uruguay  Round agreement." It is also feared that although the Farm  Ministry holds a meeting of the Rice Price Council around June  every year, it will have to delay it this year due to the  political turmoil. Some people have begun to think that the  Farm Ministry will fail to not only decide rice prices but also  to launch its rice policy, and "this will affect government's  rice collection after the summer."</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWITZER FINDS NFL MORE APPEALING;  </P> <P> OKLAHOMA COACH CITES PROBLEMS WITH COLLEGE ATHLETES  </P> <P> Oklahoma football Coach Barry Switzer says he would be interested in joining  the National Football League because of problems he's experienced trying to  handle the college athletes of the 1980s.  </P> <P> "Coaching collegiate football (in the 1970s), you didn't have the problems you  do today," Switzer said during his radio show, which aired Thursday on the  Oklahoma News Network. "Obviously, it was more fun than it is today because of  all the problems."  </P> <P> In December, the Oklahoma football team was placed on three years' probation by  the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. for recruiting violations, and several  Sooner players have had recent brushes with the law.  </P> <P> "You've got the restrictions at NCAA. You've got the drug-alcohol abuse  problems that didn't exist at the magnitude that they do today," Switzer said.  "There's so many things that would make it much more enjoyable and easier to  coach in professional football.  </P> <P> "I enjoy still what I'm doing. There's only a few jobs in professional  football. There's hundreds of college jobs and there's only 28 NFL jobs. Of  those 28 NFL jobs, there's only a few really good jobs."  </P> <P> Switzer said during the show taped Wednesday that he had an opportunity for a  professional coaching job in the 1970s, but such a position would be more  attractive than in the past.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I've got some friends that have gone on and accepted head coaching  positions (in the pros)," Switzer said. "I would be more attuned today to  entertain any opportunity than I have been in the past."  </P> <P> What would it take to make him leave the Sooners?  </P> <P> "I think, obviously, the job opportunity," he said. "You always listen.  (Oklahoma basketball Coach) Billy Tubbs and I both have talked about the  professional ranks and the opportunities."  </P> <P> Switzer said he liked the thought of disciplining players with financial  penalties rather than unscheduled workouts.  </P> <P> "You don't want to worry about making a kid run stadium steps at 6 o'clock in  the morning if he cuts a class or is late for a meeting," Switzer said. "(In  the NFL), you just dock him 500 or a thousand bucks. It gets their attention.  If they want to continue to do that. That's great."  </P></p>

Speaking after a meeting with Acting Foreign Minister of  Moldova Ion Botnaru, he said the expansion of NATO to include  new members would be a simplistic solution. Kozyrev did not  contest the right of other countries to join the alliance but  "this could lead to the creation of new barriers in Europe if  implemented."    In his words, Russia's voice was heeded by NATO, Eastern and  Central Europe. This is a case illustrating that a short cut is  not always optimal, leading nowhere and to wrong decisions,  Kozyrev said. By contrast, he added, a longer road can lead to  the right destination.    The minister said the Partnership for Peace proposal had  been  discussed by Yeltsin and Clinton on Thursday and that both of  them were satisfied it implied partnership rather than  membership.    Kozyrev spoke of having discussed the problem with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier in the day. "It  is too early yet to say how the period of partnership will end,"  the minister said. "One option is to expand NATO by accepting  new members, including Russia, something we do not rule out," he  said. Other options are also possible, he said, including the  creation of broader security systems and the consolidation of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The minister called for  efforts to be taken in parallel in all those directions but all  of these must end up in greater stability and cooperation in  Europe.    For his part, Botnaru spoke of seeing his talks with the  Russian foreign minister as a step on the road to implementing  the Partnership for Peace plan.</p>

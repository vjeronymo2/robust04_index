			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Experience working with local agencies and their record-keeping systems; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A sufficient understanding of the MTO demonstration and the operational and research goals motivating the data collection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Abt Associates has extensive experience in the collection of data on-site. The field manager and site assistant positions will be staffed from Abt's national network of experienced field interviewers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Just prior to the beginning of the data collection, Abt will bring the field data collection team together for an intensive, two-day training session. Using a combination of written training materials and role-playing, the site assistants will be briefed on the participant instruments. They will also be thoroughly oriented to the agency data collection forms. In addition, the site assistants will receive a comprehensive discussion of the demonstration and its data collection needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The field manager will have responsibility for maintaining the quality and flow of the data collection at each site. To accomplish this, the field manager will attend the full three-day training session for staff from the five MTO sites. The field manager will also visit each site early in the data collection period, to become familiar with the MTO staff and operations at each PHA and NPO and work with the site assistant to provide the most effective support for the demonstration at the site. Throughout the data collection period, the field manager will maintain regular contact with the site assistants (no less frequently than once a week) and the MTO staff at the sites. The field manager in turn, will report to the data collection director at Abt on the progress of the data collection, any problems that arise, and potential solutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B3.2&blank;Expected Response Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because completion of the Enrollment Form and Baseline Survey is part of the process of applying for the MTO demonstration, and due to the assistance described in Section B3.1 above, response rates of virtually 100 percent are expected from participant respondents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to agency respondents, all PHAs and NPOs applying for the MTO demonstration in response to the NOFA have signed statements agreeing to cooperate with the special record-keeping and data collection requirements of the demonstration. There may be further special language to this effect in the grant agreements governing the award of counseling funds from HUD to the NPOs. These requirements, in combination with the assistance provided by the Contractor, should produce extremely high response rates on all instruments to be completed by the site agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B4&blank;Tests of Procedures or Methods/Results of Pre-testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's Contractor, Abt Associates, developed the data collection forms for this submission. Abt has consulted the PHAs and NPOs involved in MTO; staff from these organizations reviewed draft versions of the program operation forms (the Participant Tracking Logs, Participant Counseling Log, Program Cost Forms, and Landlord Outreach Logs) and provided feedback on their design and feasibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the Baseline Survey, the Contractor also reviewed numerous existing instruments and consulted with the Department's experts' panel. To the greatest extent possible, the MTO baseline survey uses tested questions from prior studies. Below is a list of the major topic areas included in the survey and the sources consulted for each area:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobility: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Gautreaux studies, James Rosenbaum and Susan Popkin, Northwestern University; Cincinnati Special Mobility program study, Paul Fischer, Lake Forest College; Greg Duncan, University of Michigan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Housing preference/attitudes toward living in white/mixed communities: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Detroit Area Study, Reynolds Farley, University of Michigan; Robert Crain, National Study of Black Americans, Columbia University; the Gautreaux studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Housing quality: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  National Housing Survey; Chicago Hardship Study, Christopher Jencks and Susan Mayer, Northwestern University/University of Chicago.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Motivation to move: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Gautreaux studies, Cincinnati Special Mobility Program study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fear of crime and victimization: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Gautreaux studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neighborhood condition: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  African-American Youth Behavior Project, Brian Flay, University of Illinois Chicago; Philadelphia Family Management Study, Frank Furstenburg and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, University of Pennsylvania; Susan Mayer, University of Chicago.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neighborhood resources: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Philadelphia Family Management Study, Frank Furstenburg; Susan Mayer, University of Chicago.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Social integration and social support: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Gautreaux studies; African-American Youth Behavior Project; Philadelphia Family Management Study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

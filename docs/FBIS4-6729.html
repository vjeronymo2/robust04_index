			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 21 April, Hans Blix, director  general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], sent a  message to North Korea expressing the IAEA position on North  Korea's proposal for the IAEA to witness the exchange of nuclear  fuel bars at its nuclear facilities.    It has been learned that Director General Blix said that the  witnessing of IAEA inspectors of the exchange of nuclear fuel  bars should be technically and perfectly carried out without any  obstruction. He also said the inspection of the radiochemical  laboratory, which was not carried out during the past  inspections, should be fully resumed as well.</p>

That it be recommended to the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation that it:    --step up supervision of the activity of commercial banks  and  credit institutions, ensuring that comprehensive checks on their  activity are carried out at least once every two years;    --in conjunction with interested organizations elaborate  within three months and submit to the Russian Federation  Government proposals for the development of consumer credit.    2.

It must be established that in cases envisaged by Russian  Federation legislation the safekeeping of deposits can be  guaranteed by the state using money from the federal fund for  insuring the assets of Russian Federation banking institutions  which attract the money of Russian Federation citizens.    3. That the Central Bank of the Russian Federation ensure  that its representatives and auditors take part in the work of  liquidation commissions when liquidating commercial banks,  including for insolvency (bankruptcy).    4.

The Russian Federation Government and the Central Bank of  the  Russian Federation must submit for approval within two weeks a  proposal on the procedure for implementing mutual representation.    5. That it be deemed intolerable for the organs of state  power of the Russian Federation components to adopt legislative  acts and carry out actions which violate the unity of the  Central Bank of the Russian Federation's system, proceeding from  the premise that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is a  federal bank and the regulation of its activity in accordance  with the Russian Federation Constitution comes within the  exclusive competence of the federal organs of state power.    6. That it be established that the restrictions envisaged by  point 1 of the Russian Federation president's 17 November 1993  Edict No. 1924 "On the Activity of Foreign Banks and Joint Banks  with the Participation of Funds Belonging to Nonresidents on  Russian Federation Territory" do not extend to: operations with  people who are residents under Russian Federation legislation  indicated in licenses issued by the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation before publication of this edict to foreign banks and  joint banks with the participation of funds belonging to  nonresidents; or with banks established on Russian Federation  territory which are from countries in the Russian Federation's  relations with whom agreements on the encouragement and  protection of capital investments that have come into force are  applied.    That there shall be agreement with the Central Bank of the  Russian Federation's proposal for the issue of licenses for the  improvement of banking operations for foreign banks and joint  banks with the participation of funds belonging to nonresidents  on Russian Federation territory on condition that the relevant  states observe the principle of reciprocity with regard to  Russian banks which open branches, offices, daughter companies,  and joint institutions abroad.    7.

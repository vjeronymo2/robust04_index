			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Marina Vartanyan: "Return </F> to Yerevan--1994"]    [Text]  <H5>  Armenia: So--What Is Going On There, Anyway?!" </H5>   A great many different things are being said in Moscow today  about Yerevan. That street warfare is taking place there. That  people are dropping on the sidewalks in full daylight from  hunger. That they have chopped down all the trees and are  burning the wood in their stoves.    As an eyewitness and direct participant in Yerevan life, let  me testify that life is not horrible in the city. Bombs are not  exploding in the streets, although entirely peaceful border  regions just a few dozen kilometers away (on the border with  Azerbaijan) are indeed subjected to bombardment almost daily,  and one can sometimes hear cannon fire in the very suburbs of  the Armenian capital.    People are not dropping on the sidewalks en masse from  hunger, although there are hunger-caused fainting spells--the  menu of the average Yerevan resident, living statistically on 80  cents a month (!), would certainly elicit shock even from the  citizen of Russia, who has seen quite a bit himself. The  shooting on the streets is no more frequent than in Moscow, and  "this shooting is not of the military variety, but results from  business disputes, or in the most extreme cases--from 'internal  political' disagreement."    What is indeed strange is the fact that one can quietly get  on a bus in the morning, or stop by a large department store or  the marketplace, and wind up leaving it under military escort,  finding oneself a couple of hours later at some military unit  under full military gear, with the most "unforeseeable  consequences" in store for the near future. This is the original  procedure we now have for effecting the spring call-up of our  green youth and "reservists." And we thought certain methods of  "social work" had been relegated to the past. No way--Homo  soveticus is today alive and well!    Then too, our life in Yerevan has certain quite evident  advantages. Consider "Herbalife," for example--an expensive  deal, and not without its side effects, they say, especially  judging from the intensity of the advertisements.    In Yerevan, all these contrivances are unnecessary.  Weight-watcher groups are operating quite effectively and have a  clientele totalling just about a million people. I have tried  them myself. In just over a year on one of these diets, your  correspondent managed to lose almost 20 kilograms, moving out of  two sizes--first "super-large," then "large." And there were no  ill effects, by the way.    Or consider the "Running Staircase" training apparatus. It  occupies first place on the list of American home sports  equipment. Incidentally, this machine costs fifteen hundred  bucks. And it has never occurred to the Americans that they  could save this entire amount--you just have to find a friend on  the 15th or 16th floor of any city high-rise and walk up the  stairs to visit him every day. Or you could move to this floor  yourself and not use the elevator--not because there is no  electricity, but purely for exercise. You get precisely the  desired effect--this too I have tried myself.    Yerevan residents have an advantage here that no amount of  bucks elsewhere can provide--they often have to make this trip  upstairs in pitch darkness, with a candle, sometimes carrying a  bucket of water, which naturally enhances the physical training  effect....    In short, we are surviving. To understand just how, read the  following and judge for yourself.  <H5>  What Do We Smell in the Smoke of the Motherland? </H5>   According to a variety of estimates, more than 300,000  people left Armenia last year alone. It is not difficult to  conjecture what this means for the 3 million living in the  republic.    Last winter (1993), one could smell anything and everything  in the "smoke of the Motherland." At that time we had virtually  the first Yerevan winter since the beginning of the blockade  WITHOUT ANYTHING--no light, gas, heat, fuel, regular food....  Yerevan residents were not quite ready for this, and they burned  everything they managed to come across in the pot-belly stoves  placed in window apertures. You cannot imagine what "went up in  smoke"--issues of OGONEK carefully saved up until now along with  post-perestroyka materials on the history of Russia that people  were unfamiliar with. They shredded NOVYY MIR, with Solzhenitsyn  and other lamenting emigrants, to feed the stove. They burned  tire covers, footwear, old clothing--just to be able to warm up,  boil a little water....    This winter (1994), those who remained in Yerevan waved  good-bye to everything and as summer passed stocked up on their  supply of decent stoves and, most importantly, of anything that  could be burned in them. Not a single piece of paper, packet, or  box of matches was discarded at home. And vehicles carrying  kerosene and firewood came into the cities. The firewood was  sometimes "locally produced," sometimes "imported." The  authorities quickly assessed the situation and prohibited local  chopping of wood. The price of a cubic meter of firewood then  jumped to $45 as early as the end of autumn, reached $70 at the  start of winter, then in the severe cold reached $80-$120 for a  cubic meter of split wood.    The meager ration (mainly of bread and culinary products  contrived from it that are rather strange to the outsider,  potatoes, and cereal) is perhaps not so bad for adults watching  their weight, but is of course entirely unsuitable for children.  And indeed, in no way can all Armenian families purchase even a  little firewood or kerosene, since the true average wage in  Armenia is no greater than 350 drams--this winter this was on  the order of $1.50.    As a result, as springtime approached hundreds of people  found themselves on the brink of physical exhaustion and  psychologically stressed. Many decided they would throw  everything away and leave. Restless lines of refugees with their  belongings stretched around the train stations and airports, in  numbers greater than the emigration waves during the days of  genocide.    We sometimes hear that it is not 300,000, but rather 800,000  who left--which we would greatly like to believe is an  exaggeration. The prospects are entirely real, however: One more  winter like that, and the flight from Armenia of her own  people--desperate, at breakneck speed--will take on truly  catastrophic proportions, with entirely predictable consequences.    There are precedents, unfortunately. In neighboring Turkey,  just a few dozen kilometers from Yerevan, stretches a vast,  woeful wasteland with the ruins and skeletons of majestic  Christian temples, of Ani, capital of the ancient, powerful  Armenian kingdom, whose people were forced into exile. Today no  one lives here or in the fairly large territory adjoining the  former capital city. From time to time Kurdish herdsmen drive  their livestock here to graze.    The task of halting the flight of Armenia's own people out  of  the country is today acquiring the scope of a task of state  proportions. There are various ways of accomplishing it, the  least productive of which are debates resounding from the  rostrums of diverse levels of pomp and authority. The most  productive consist of direct material assistance to the families  who reside today in Armenia.  <H5>  Who in the Final Analysis Are the Greater Capitalists--the </H5> "Misters" or the "Comrades"?    The political picture of Armenia is striking today in  its diversity.... and in the virtual indifference of its main  figures and groups to the true crisis situation that has taken  shape in the republic.    At the same time, entrepreneurs are emerging in the  political  arena. And it probably should be this way. Because it is they  who are today feeding the country to a significant degree,  delivering assortments of essential products and consumer goods,  while the state specializes only in bread, throwing out a stick  of butter or package of sugar or cereal from time to time to the  starving consumer. It is the entrepreneurs who are penetrating  the blockade and delivering their goods to those regions that  are engulfed in flame. It is they who are the first real doves  of peace negotiations--insofar as methods of people's diplomacy,  tried and true, bring trade to the border regions, and do so  rather successfully.    So it is. In this situation you would not even wish your  enemy to be positioned on today's Armenian political Mount  Olympus. But he who is there is forced to tow the mark. More  than a dozen parliamentary party factions and groups sit there  and defend their factional interests session after session with  a stubbornness that could be put to far better use.    Thus, a situation fairly traditional for the CIS countries  has today taken shape in Armenia, in which the standing of the  main political forces is not simply poor--the very concept of  "political party" elicits an unambiguous negative reaction from  residents. Against this background (also characteristic of many  regions of the CIS), the communists have received definite  dividends, simply as a certain homogeneous group evoking  nostalgic memories in many people of the Soviet way of life. But  even these gourmet feelings are not strong enough to justify  serious discussion of any enhanced standing of the Communist  Party in Armenia.    In contrast to most other regions of the CIS, there are in  Armenia the so-called "traditional" parties, i.e., entirely real  political forces which, during the period when the single-party  system reigned in the USSR, existed, developed, and replenished  their ranks and influence in the Armenian diaspora. Following  certain events, they simply "moved" to local territory--to  Armenia.    Two main parties are worthy of note when discussing  traditional Armenian parties--the "Ramkavar," or liberal  democrats (in no way to be confused with the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia]--two very different entities), and  "Dashnaktsutyun"--a socialist-oriented Armenian party whose  members address one another through conviction as  "comrade," no less. A contradiction has arisen here on the  question of the anticrisis programs of these parties, referred  to in this section's heading. The "Ramkavar" propose  introduction of a state monopoly on trade in bread and gasoline  as a top-priority anticrisis measure, an extremely prudent step  most likely under today's conditions. You would have to agree,  however, that this is quite reminiscent of the "regular goals of  the Soviet power." While the "Dashnaks" are fighting quite  energetically from the rostrums of parliament and elsewhere to  rule out any kind of arbitrary state rule. Although they are  "comrades." You go sort it out.    Nonetheless, in the "still, deep waters" in which the  Armenian political Mount Olympus presently finds itself, today's  social atmosphere is fraught with the danger that the prudent  and kindly Armenian people will suddenly get fed up with  tolerating the standard-of-living travesty that reigns today,  and then we may see quite a sudden end to lawful measures and  slogans. It is extremely difficult to conjecture which political  doctrine will suddenly capture the multitude....    God forbid we should turn into such a multitude, even for as  little as a day. If only because the multitude and war are  already extremely dangerous political neighbors....  <H5>  How Do You Live on R800 a Month? </H5>   An interesting question, of course. But it is in no way  rhetorical. It is precisely that--800 Russian rubles, converted  to 176 drams--which today constitutes the minimum wage in  Armenia.    Here it must be taken into account that, in the judgment of  independent experts, the minimum food-product consumer basket in  Armenia costs 4,293 drams! In other words, a citizen who has the  misfortune to be living on the minimum wage receives just 2.5  percent of the amount he himself needs (not including his  family!)--and this is only for food. But the average citizen,  statistically speaking, who receives 350 drams, acquires barely  5 percent of the minimum basket containing the nourishment  required by the life form known as Homo sapiens.    But in real life everything is not all that horrible--albeit  quite severe, of course. Many urban residents have started up  little gardens right in the city or have parcels of land. In the  Armenian countryside, where people have full ownership of the  land and have always been famous for efficient management, life  is self-contained. The city-dweller is also aided by commercial  structures, where the pay reaches the "unbelievable" amount of  3,000-4,000 drams (or, converted to Russian currency, on the  order of R20,000 a month). In this regard, the average price  index in Yerevan is 1.3-1.5 times greater than corresponding  prices in Russia. In other words, everything in Armenia (and I  am referring not to delicacies, but rather to the most basic  products) costs approximately one-and-a-half times more.    But naturally, not many people are receiving a wage of  3,000-4,000 drams--not the majority, in any case. This is VERY  high pay according to local standards. Even the president  receives less--his salary of 12 times the minimum wage comes to  just over 2,000 drams.    Thus, only 5-10 percent of the populace are able to permit  themselves such basic products as butter, cheese, sausage, and  eggs. The remainder must content themselves with bread and  cereal. Then there is a factor of special alarm for the future.  As a result of the sharp reduction in purchasing power of the  populace, many entrepreneurs who are bringing commodities into  the republic are taking losses and being forced to dump their  products. If a person receives a monthly wage sufficient to buy  1 kilogram of sugar--please tell me, what kind of consumer can  he be?! And what kind of purchasing power is there? Especially  since in Armenia, according to unofficial data, there are over  80,000 unemployed, of whom only a few thousand are registered  with the labor exchange with the right to unemployment  compensation.    So if you take into account the fact that winter supplies  have now run out for many people in Armenia--supplies purchased  some time ago, at the old, more acceptable prices, more than 50  percent of the republic's population is threatened with  starvation.    This is how we are living.

We should also not be hasty, if only because  we have yet to come to terms with property relations in the  Republic of Armenia," stated Vladimir Starikov, counselor and  minister of the Russian Federation Embassy in the Republic of  Armenia, in a conversation with this correspondent.    [Vartanyan] Vladimir Stepanovich, there have been persistent  rumors in Armenia recently to the effect that just about half of  Armenia has already obtained Russian citizenship or stood in  line at the embassy for this purpose. Is this true?    [Starikov] Rumors to the effect that 300,000-400,000 people  have already obtained Russian citizenship are untrue. Our  technical capabilities would not permit it, for one thing (only  three staff members are working at the consular section of the  embassy--they simply would not be able to examine and draw up  such a quantity of documents). From 80 to 100 cases at most can  be handled per week. As of this moment, just over 2,000  residents of the Republic of Armenia have obtained Russian  citizenship. The waiting list is such that processing will not  be completed until August of 1995.    [Vartanyan] How do you view the legal status of these newly  emerged citizens of Russia--people who have USSR passports at  present (insofar as the Law on Citizenship has not yet been  adopted in the Republic of Armenia) and who reside in Armenia?    [Starikov] The main problem here lies in the fact that the  question of dual citizenship has not been resolved. Therefore,  persons who obtain Russian citizenship and who presently reside  in Armenia may find themselves in the status of foreigner  in their own country--unless otherwise stipulated by  Armenian law. We will explain this in detail to persons who come  to us for information on the question of obtaining Russian  citizenship, and we will also explain that Russian citizenship  provides no advantages to people residing in the Republic of  Armenia. Quite the contrary: Foreigners everywhere have a status  somewhat different from citizens. Those who desire to obtain  Russian citizenship all the same--will obtain it.    [Vartanyan] On what legal basis?    [Starikov] The registration procedure currently in effect  for  obtaining Russian citizenship was introduced by the Russian  Federation Law on Citizenship, which entered into force 6  February 1992. This procedure is effective for a three-year  period. Citizens of Armenia will mainly be interested in point  "g" of Article 18 of this law. According to this article,  Russian Federation citizenship is afforded to former Soviet  citizens, including residents of Armenia, who possess USSR  passports.    [Vartanyan] A fact is a fact--the lines at the Russian  Embassy in Armenia are becoming longer and more persistent....    [Starikov] We even used the opportunity of a recent  interview  in a republic newspaper to appeal to people desiring to acquire  Russian citizenship, telling them not to resort to illegal  activities, not to exert pressure on consular section employees  in an attempt to speed up the application process.    [Vartanyan] How do you personally see the striving of a  large  number of people to leave Armenia, to sever ties with the  locations where they have long resided?    [Starikov] I believe that everyone should think twice before  applying at the consular section. We must not be ruled by the  emotions of the moment. There are problems in Russia too, and  they will be all the greater for people starting out there with  nothing. We have to try to resolve our problems here, where we  live. Russia cannot accept everybody.</p>

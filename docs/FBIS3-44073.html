			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   ANC To Win Election `Handsomely'--Johannesburg THE CITIZEN  in  English on 18 January in its page-6 editorial says "it is clear  from polls that the ANC [African National Congress] is going to  win handsomely." "Considering how confident the National Party  [NP] was of winning the election or gaining enough support to  curb the ANC in a government of national unity, the poll comes  as a shock to many of its followers (although previous polls  showed a similar trend in favour of the ANC). The NP's  confidence was misplaced from the outset. Not only did it not  take into account the historical fact that liberation  organisations win the elections in Africa, but it puts its faith  in a possible alliance of moderates that would counter ANC. In  the event the NP ended up with no allies, moderate or  otherwise." The NP's "biggest mistake was to seek an  accommodation with the ANC while ignoring the others."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Township Residents Urged To End Rent, Services Boycott--The  ending of the 10-year-old township rent and service charge  boycott, now endorsed by Nelson Mandela, "should mark the  beginning of a process to restore effective governance to South  Africa's dormitory towns," declares a page-12 editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 January. The "root  cause" of the township problem "is to be found in the misguided  conviction by the architects of apartheid that township  residents, without any industrial tax base or outside support,  could keep those areas financially viable." "Today many  townships are bereft of effective leadership and in a state of  administrative collapse. They are also burdened with a  collective R[rand]1.84 billion debt resulting from boycotts."  Residents are urged to heed Mandela's plea to end the boycott of  rents and service payments, and "concentrate on making the  townships governable."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Urged To Take Stand Against Hospital  Workers--Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 January in a  page-6 editorial notes that the sporadic strikes at various  hospitals "have been the result of disputes over a well-intended  gesture by the Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] in  granting a R[rand]500 bonus to staff at Baragwanath as a reward  for their efforts in trying circumstances last year." The bonus  was withdrawn when a similar payment was demanded by all and  sundry at other hospitals -- "a concession both unreasonable and  beyond the means of the TPA to pay." Hospital workers are  "threatening the future of hospital services. It won't be long  now before an ANC government is faced with this kind of union  trouble in the public service. How, we wonder, would it go about  implementing its new health policy if faced with the collapse of  services over a bonus to which staff were not entitled?" The  ANC is urged to take a "public stand against irresponsible  actions by public service trade union in essential services."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   Editorial Views ANC Election List--"The chief characteristic  of the ANC's list of candidates for the 27 April election is  that it is not representative of a single party. It  encompasses, rather, a broad alliance of known leaders from the  ANC itself, a whole group of communists, socialist trade union  leaders, homeland leaders, members of parliament from the  tricameral parliament, and even a few members from the  entertainment industry," begins a page-22 editorial in  Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 23 January. "With this  list the ANC is a step ahead of its opponents, among whom there  is no talk of election alliances, with others still debating  whether or not to participate in the election. In addition to  this, the ANC has already released important elements of its  policy documents, including health and economic policies. Both,  as expected, contain strong socialist elements." "What stands  out like a pole above water is that the ANC is dominated by a  spirit of ideological dogmatism in its quest to reintroduce  policies totally discredited in other parts of the world." "The  ANC does not give the impression that it is an opposition party  striving for power, but rather that it is a `liberation  organization' waiting impatiently to take over power." "This  psychosis must be stopped by opponents of the ANC. It should not  be allowed to pose arrogantly as the overwhelming favorite of  `the people' with the rest being seen as powerless, confused,  and disparate small enclaves of opposition."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Announcement on Afrikaner Election  `Misleading'--Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 1 January says in a page-8 editorial:  "The announcement in the Conservative Party mouthpiece,  PATRIOT, that an own election for `Boer Afrikaners' will be held  on or before 27 April would be funny were it not so tragically  misleading. In addition to the homeland dream by which voters  are being taken for a ride, right-wing leaders recently also  announced that an own cabinet and an own government would be put  in place as soon as the Transitional Executive Council began  functioning. Nothing, of course, came of that, as with so many  other right-wing escapist promises. One can, therefore, also  predict that nothing will come of this latest, absurd election  promise. Should 1 million people countrywide vote for a  homeland, and 20 million others vote for a new dispensation  under the new constitution, what will the former have proven?  Only that they are a minority who have no right to grab power  and territory. The tension within the Afrikaner National Front  hopefully indicates that there is a significant number of  right-wing Afrikaners who want to play a constructive role by  negotiating for their people, rather than threatening war all  day long."</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo urged to ease refinery imports Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday moved closer to lifting restrictions on oil product imports with the publication of a report recommending the deregulation of the oil industry. In an interim report submitted to the trade minister, a government advisory panel called for the abolition of a special law on oil product imports which has restricted imports to refiners. The report says the restriction has helped perpetuate substantial price differentials between domestic and overseas petrol prices, and recommends the easing of rules on petrol station construction. The panel's recommendation, which will form the basis for Miti policy, comes as prime minister Tsutomu Hata has urged ministries to come up with further deregulatory measures to resuscitate the sluggish Japanese economy. The Japanese government will compile a package of deregulatory measures by the end of this month to present to the Group of Seven summit in Naples next month as part of its efforts to meet international criticism that it must do more to stimulate its domestic economy and trim its current account surplus. Wide-ranging regulations covering the oil industry have come up for special criticism recently as responsible for shoring up the price of petrol. At the same time, Miti has been keen gradually to lift its protective shield over the oil industry, to strengthen the industry's competitiveness. Abolishing the special law would encourage trading houses and agricultural co-operatives to import oil products from regions such as the Middle East, Singapore and the US.</p>

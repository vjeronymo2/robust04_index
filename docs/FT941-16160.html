			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Uproar marks the inaugural session of Russia's parliament Russia yesterday inaugurated its first multi-party parliament. 'This is a disgrace,' muttered Mr Sergei Kovalyov, a veteran human rights campaigner and a leader of Russia's Choice, the radical reform bloc set up by leading reformist ministers. 'This is a joke,' fumed Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, after the morning session rowed for four hours over whether to take a break. 'This is not a joke,' disagreed Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the reformist Yabloko bloc. 'It's the beginning of democracy, of something like a parliament. The west had 200 to 300 years to develop democracy while we have had just a few.' Meanwhile, stung by accusations that he represents a serious threat to democracy, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, tried hard to project an image of respectability, but finally gave up and began shouting. To the applause of his Liberal Democrats, the second largest group in parliament after Russia's Choice, Mr Zhirinovsky ordered the chamber to stop trying to remove Mr Georgy Lukava - a member of his party who by virtue of being the oldest deputy was serving as temporary speaker. But Mr Zhirinovsky's help was not enough to stop the 68-year-old academic in military uniform from sinking into the parliamentary quicksand. Error followed error and Mr Lukava finally agreed to share his job with senior citizens from the other factions. Not that the parliament is short of experienced deputies, with the chamber reading like a Who's Who from its two predecessors. Most prominent was Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, speaker of the Soviet parliament accused of masterminding the 1991 coup d'etat against Mr Gorbachev. As Mr Lukava floundered away, many saw Mr Lukyanov as an ideal speaker for all his past sins. But after two years in jail and with possible charges still pending after the failure of the coup trial to come to any conclusions, he looked tired and fragile and said he had no desire to return to the speaker's chair. Meanwhile, the shadow of Mr Zhirinovsky and his likely alliance with the Communists, Agrarians, and ultra-nationalists, had the pro-democracy forces on high-alert, resorting to every filibuster they could think of to influence events. As the Liberal Democrats tried to hurry along procedural votes Russia's Choice first threatened to walk out and then refused to register its deputies, successfully depriving the assembly of a quorum and ensuring that the logistics of the new parliament were as chaotic as its first deliberations.</p>

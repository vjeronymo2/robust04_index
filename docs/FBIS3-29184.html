			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The South Korean Puppet Army Is a </F> Colonial, Hired Mercenary Army;" from the "Hour for South Korean  Soldiers" program]    [Text] Officers and men of the South Korean Army: The  South Korean Army has been invariably a colonial, hired  mercenary army for outside forces. After the military dictators  came to their doom a so-called civilian-led regime emerged. The  so-called civilian-led regime has babbled about so-called  military reform and the like. However, the so-called military  reform is nothing but an ostentatious slogan, and the puppet  army still remains a colonial, hired mercenary army for outside  forces.    The prerogative of supreme command of the puppet army is  still in the hands of the United States, and even the puppet  army officers' manual books stipulate that the puppet army's  imaginary enemy is precisely the North, following the U.S.  strategy of aggression against Korea.    There are many armies in the world. However, there is no  army  in the world, the prerogative of supreme command of which has  been completely divested of by outside forces and the nation of  which has been prescribed as an enemy.    A newspaper published by the Korean residents in a foreign  country wrote: The South Korean puppet army is not a national  army but an antinational army because it is the army which does  not serve the interests of the nation but exists only for  outside forces.    Even a former commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea  himself confessed that the South Korean Army is a hired  mercenary army of the United States, that it is an army  protecting U.S. investments in South Korea, and that it is an  army which can bear maximum effectiveness with minimum expenses.  The South Korean puppets themselves admit that their  prerogative of supreme command has been divested of and that  their army is nothing but a hired mercenary army controlled by  outside forces.    That the South Korean puppet army is aiming its rifle at  fellow countrymen is because it has become cheap cannon fodder  for outside forces. The South Korean puppet Army was used and is  being used as a shock brigade for outside forces' aggression  overseas because it is a colonial, hired mercenary army.    According to a recent report of the South Korean Munhwa  Broadcasting System, the South Korean puppets dispatched as many  as 312,850 South Korean puppet troops to Vietnam during the  Vietnam War as demanded by the United States, and among them  over 4,600 troops were killed in vain. Of course, this was the  figure reduced to the minimum by the puppets. How can these  hired mercenary troops which opposed fellow countrymen and took  part in slaughtering another nation according to the aggression  policy of outside forces be regarded as an army for the country,  for the nation, and for the people?    The South Korean puppets are propagating that although it  had  the disgrace of being the plunderer of power in the past the  army will not meddle in politics in the future nor will it be  used as riot- quelling troops [chinapkun] for political  purposes. However, the people never believe this.    The Kim Yong-sam ring clamored that the puppet army should  not become riot-quelling troops. However, this is, in fact, an  out-and-out lie.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is brutally suppressing those people  calling for reunification and, because of this, has been branded  as a civilian-led fascist ring. The civilian-led dictatorial  elements have gone so far as to designate the people calling for  the right of survival as the target of their suppression. Today  the people still vividly remember the fact that the previous  South Korean dictators barbarously murdered thousands of Kwangju  citizens by mobilizing the puppet army troops when the United  States issued them directives to brutally suppress the Kwangju  resistance in a bid to rescue the colonial fascist ruling system  from a crisis and to prevent civilians from attacking its  (?nuclear) base in Kwangju.    As his predecessors did, traitor Kim Yong-sam is playing the  role as a running dog and a guard protecting the colonial rule  by outside and nuclear weapons storehouses.    The puppet traitor committed the treacherous crime of  selling  the rice market, which is closely related to the destiny of the  six million South Korean farmers, to his U.S. boss in return for  his so-called international cooperative system formed to do harm  to fellow countrymen. He is now brutally suppressing the  struggle of farmers and young students against the opening of  the rice market. There is no guarantee that this pro-U.S.  flunkyist and national traitor will not trigger a war against  fellow countrymen by mobilizing the puppet army. There is also  no guarantee that he will not impose again such a bloody tragedy  as the Kwangju incident on the South Korean people.    Officers and men of the South Korean Army: You cannot escape  the digraceful destiny of being the colonial, hired mercenary  troops as long as a pro-U.S. flunkyist traitor and a  nation-seller such as traitor Kim Yong-sam keep hold on power in  South Korea.    Officers and men of the South Korean Army should not be  treated contemptuously as colonial, hired mercenary troops for  outside forces, being forced to endure a disgraceful destiny,  but should struggle against [pandae haeso ssawoya] outside  forces and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, their running dog, to  regain the divested national sovereignty and to seek the kind of  life a human being should lead.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over the past decade, FSIS has monitored the tremendous strides in modernizing the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS has determined that there are meat/bone separators and meat recovery systems that are fundamentally different than the machines used to manufacture MS(S). These differences occur in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of the process of separating skeletal muscle tissue from bone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Removal of Muscle Tissue From Livestock Bones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Machines that are classified as meat/bone separators have been developed that emulate the physical action of hand-held high-speed knives for the removal of skeletal muscle tissue from bone, e.g., the Wizard knife. The advances in meat/bone separation have led to recovery systems that separate meat from bone without crushing, grinding, or pulverizing bones such that the meat is removed by shaving, pressing, or scraping the muscle tissue from the bone surface similar to the action of the hand-held high-speed knives. Thus, this meat is obtained in much the same manner as that which is obtained using traditional hand-deboning techniques, where the bones emerge essentially intact and in natural physical conformation separately from the meat. For example, the most commonly used bones would include rib bones and loin bones and would be recognized as such when they emerge from the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS believes that the description of the bones from which muscle tissue has been removed as ``essentially intact'' is consistent with the description of the bones resulting from the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including high-speed mechanical knives, such as the Wizard knife. FSIS recognizes that even when meat is removed with the use of hand-operated knives, e.g., those used in the processing establishment, at the supermarket meat counter, or by the consumer, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close to the bone surface so as to unavoidably remove a minute amount of the bone's surface. FSIS has determined that this is a normal occurrence because of the difficulty in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations, and, as such, it is still in conformance with good manufacturing practices that render products safe and wholesome. Because the bones emerge from the advanced meat/bone separators in their natural shape and structure, i.e., with the connective tissue linkages that normally occur in bones, FSIS maintains that they are in natural physical conformation. Furthermore, under FSIS' longstanding boneless meat inspection procedure for meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, it is expected that the finished comminuted (i.e., ground) meat product made from the meat removed from livestock bones contains no bone perceptible to sight or touch. This result would be expected for meat derived from the advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, the mechanism of traditional mechanical deboning machines from which MS(S) results, involves mechanically separating and removing most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock through the application of high pressure to crush, grind, and pulverize bones from which most of the meat has already been removed, and then using high pressure to force the resulting paste through a sieve to separate bone particles and fragments that result from crushing and pulverizing bones during processing. Because of the mechanism of the machinery used to manufacture MS(S), bone and bone particles, including bone constituents such as bone marrow and certain minerals, are incorporated into the finished product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation on MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5 does not specify the type of equipment used to separate and remove bone because it is intended to cover the product manufactured by any such machinery that operates on the differing resistance of hard bone and soft tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices and whether or not bones are pre-broken before being fed into such equipment. However, the regulation on MS(S) is not intended to apply to whole pieces of muscle tissue which have been removed from livestock bones by mechanical or other means (47 FR 28223). FSIS has determined that the consistency of MS(S) and its content of bone, including bone marrow, and certain minerals, as well as muscle tissue, are materially different from those of ``meat,'' and that these differences have potential consequences for finished product quality and for health and safety which are addressed by the regulations for MS(S) (9 CFR 318.18, 319.5, and 319.6) and supported by the Agency's 1979 report on the health and safety aspects of mechanically deboned meat. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the report entitled, ``Health and Safety Aspects of the Use of Mechanically Deboned Meat, Final Report and Recommendations Select Panel'' and ``Health and Safety Aspects of the Use of Mechanically Deboned Meat, Volume II.

The  most recent figures come from the Interunion Department for  Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (DIEESE), which calculated  that last year there was a 16.98 percent increase in the number  of strikes in comparison with 1992, which results in an average  of 60.83 stoppages a month involving about 432,800 strikers.    "The successive declines that occurred in the unemployment  rate in Brazil starting in May, and an upward trend in a wide  variety of economic indicators made workers feel more secure and  more willing to demand their rights," said Eduardo Matosinho,  technical coordinator of DIEESE. In his view, workers were more  worried about losing their jobs in 1992 and so avoided  participating in strikes. According to DIEESE, in 1992 there was  an average of 52 walkouts a month, involving 234,900 strikers.

For calculation  purposes, a work day is considered to be eight hours for all categories.      Matosinho said the public sector was the main arena for work  stoppages and was responsible for the 84.22 percent increase in  the average number of strikers last year, compared with the  previous year. In May, we had the federal civil servant strike.  Then in August, the Minas Gerais state employees struck, as did  teachers in Sao Paulo State.    This past December, the number of strikes fell by 3.70  percent and the number of strikers by 74.71 percent, if compared  with the same month of the previous year. In all, there were 52  work stoppages involving 12,300 strikers, compared with the 54  strikes and 234,900 workers who walked out in December 1992.    December, according to the technical director, is an  atypical  month because most of the strikes were organized to protest  nonpayment of wages and worker entitlements. "In 1992, the  recession was worse and more companies had trouble paying their  employees the required `13th month' salary. Last year, however,  the strikes were organized by companies and demanded payment of  a `14th month.'"    Matosinho thinks the number of strikes this year will  probably be about the same as in 1993. "We will never see levels  as high as in 1989 and 1990," he said. According to DIEESE  figures, there was an average of 183 work stoppages a month in  1989, which dropped to 163 the following year.</p>

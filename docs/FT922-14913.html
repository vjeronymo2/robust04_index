			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour's fear of the dreaded 'D-word' IN Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party it has become known as the 'D-word'. Those brave or foolish enough to speculate about devaluation within Mr Kinnock's earshot receive the kind of reception that Mrs Margaret Thatcher once reserved for friends of European federalism. His mind has become as closed to the possibility of a post-election devaluation of the pound as was Mrs Thatcher's to the infamous 'F-word' which provided the trigger for her downfall as prime minister. As the election campaign has unfolded, Mr Kinnock has become firmer and firmer in his public rejection of the notion that a lower exchange rate might have a part to play in his economic strategy. Yesterday he underlined again that a Labour government would 'do what is necessary' to maintain sterling's parity within the European exchange rate mechanism. What is necessary includes, as a last resort, putting up interest rates. The logic behind such statements - echoed daily by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor - is obvious. If Mr Kinnock wins on April 9 it will be because he has persuaded enough of the electorate that his party has crafted at last a credible approach to running the economy. To admit that it might contemplate a fall in the pound's value would undercut decisively any such claim. Yet as the prospect of a Labour victory has increased, Mr Kinnock's public pronouncements on sterling have been mirrored by a hardening of his private thinking. Colleagues in the shadow cabinet - including those more favourably disposed to the notion that the pound might be overvalued - believe that Mr Kinnock in Downing Street would not change his mind. Like Mr Harold Wilson in the 1960s, he has become mesmerised by the notion that devaluation is not an option for a Labour government. It is a view that has been shaped by a coincidence of short-term political judgment and of his broader personal philosophy. Mr Kinnock conspicuously has not said that he believes that the rate at which Mr John Major set sterling's value against the D-Mark in October 1990 was the right one. Some of his closest advisers think that DM2.95 was too high. But the pragmatism that has persuaded him to reject the possibility in opposition has convinced Mr Kinnock that he could not devalue once in office. His argument - shared by Mr Smith - is that even if the exchange rate was set at too high a level in the ERM in 1990, the costs of realignment would far outweigh the benefits. By breaking its pre-election pledge, Labour would undermine immediately its credibility in financial markets. Instead of allowing a fall in interest rates, it would force borrowing costs higher, in turn wrecking the party's long-term programme to encourage investment. It might take years to regain the markets' trust. Devaluation would be interpreted also as a sign of weakness by union negotiators and the newly appointed ministers in Whitehall spending departments lined up against a Labour chancellor. It is here that the practicalities fit in with Mr Kinnock's broader political outlook. The experiences of his party's defeats in 1983 and 1987 have shaped an outlook instinctively repelled by soft options. His assessment of the past failures of his party, and of previous Labour governments, is that they were too easily seduced by 'alibis' - an instinctive preference to avoid taking hard decisions. Mr Kinnock's view is that devaluation would fit into that category - a temporary but ineffective and ultimately destructive refuge against economic reality. If Mr Kinnock wins, the financial markets cannot be guaranteed to take him at his word. If they demand a rise in interest rates as proof of his resolution, there will be some in his cabinet who will demand that the devaluation option is discussed. He can claim justly that the case for devaluation put in a recently leaked policy paper by one of Mr Smith's advisers has no official status. Mr Andrew Graham, the Oxford don, delivered the paper two years ago - before sterling had been put in the ERM and before the recession. Even so, its analysis - suggesting that a lower pound and a tighter fiscal policy would be the most effective way of re-establishing a more competitive economy - is shared by some of Mr Kinnock's colleagues. Mr Kinnock could of course follow Mr Wilson's example and forbid debate of devaluation in his cabinet. The most powerful of his colleagues would support him. They believe that even it it meant higher interest rates, the Labour leader would stick to the strategy. Not all, though, would be sure that it was a price worth paying.</p>

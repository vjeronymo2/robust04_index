			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ALPHABET' TRANSLATES INTO NOBLE FAILURE  </P> <P> After 10 years on the front lines of performance art, Sushi is still ferreting  out the new and different.  </P> <P> "From the Alphabet of Bones," the first of seven dance-oriented events included  in Sushi's multi-faceted 10th anniversary season, illustrates that search. In  this serious study of parallel languages, which premiered at Sushi's  second-story loft space Thursday night, even the basic alphabet is unique.  </P> <P> The birth of cutting-edge artworks can be painful and there is no guarantee  that the entire concept will work, or that individual elements will meld into a  unified whole. "From the Alphabet of Bones" is a noble failure, a project that  strives for brave new worlds but suffers from its own esoteric pursuits and  diversity of spirit.  </P> <P> Translating textual or visual material into movement and voice is not new. But  visual artist Joyce Cutler-Shaw, choreographer Nancy Karp, and composer Chaya  Czernowin definitely moved into uncharted territory when they attempted to find  equivalents to Cutler-Shaw's calligraphy (a symbolic language based on the  fragile skeletal structure of birds) in music and dance.  </P> <P> Their common purpose apparently was to call attention to environmental  concerns. Cutler-Shaw's bird imagery, seen as light projections on the floor  and backdrop, was selected as the metaphor.  </P> <P> However, instead of integrating the individual elements and creating some sort  of coherent entity, the artists offered their individual voices as a string of  disparate parts. The effect was a baffling whole that seemed to have been  assembled with scissors and paste pot.  </P> <P> The sequence began with a dance version of the bone alphabet, then evolved into  a spoken text written and recited by Cutler-Shaw. It culminated in the  disembodied sound structures created and sung by the composer.  </P> <P> According to the program notes, "the sequence from A to Z represents a journey  and reads as a visual dance." But that journey was long, labored, disjointed  and often incoherent.  </P> <P> The fascinating bird imagery that inspired the three-way collaboration failed  to achieve its potential of providing strong visual support. Although the  artist lined the back wall of the theater with an ominous assortment of caged  birds, the stage was bare. And the projections on the floor and backdrop never  revealed the power of some of the artist's original work.  </P> <P> In contrast, the spoken and sung texts were too protracted and visually  unexciting to be theatrically viable by themselves. Cutler-Shaw's poetic  recitation of the story of evolution and her impassioned evocation of  "unspeakable acts" (a joint reference to the Holocaust and the destruction of  wildlife) were moving but isolated from the rest of the performance.  </P> <P> Also isolated were Czernowin's primordial wails and hisses, an often  heart-wrenching vocabulary of wordless sounds that recalled the ear-piercing  sonic structures of post-modern pioneer Meredith Monk.  </P> <P> Monk suggests that the voice is a tool for activating, remembering and  discovering "pre-logical consciousness." Czernowin used her voice to achieve  this effect, but the musical portion was oppressively long and visually static.  Perhaps that was part of its message, but an active visual or kinetic thrust  was sorely needed.  </P> <P> Karp, a San Francisco-based choreographer, communicated the bone alphabet first  as a solo dance for herself and later as a duet for Deirdre Carrigan and Diane  McKallip. If Karp and her dancers were interpreting an alphabet, it was not  obvious. The rhythmic flow of interesting abstractions suggested, but never  mimicked, the movement of birds.  </P> <P> The dance was lyrical -- the lightest element in a dark work -- ending with a  painful plea for survival. The environmental sounds by Bill Fontana that  accompanied both dance episodes were another plus.  </P> <P> Eventually these three talented artists may be able to use their newly created  alphabets to explore the theme of survival with more theatricality. For now,  however, "From the Alphabet of Bones" is a flightless bird waiting for a chance  to soar.  </P> <P> The performance will repeat at Sushi Performance Gallery at 8 o'clock tonight  and Sunday.  </P></p>

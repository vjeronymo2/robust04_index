			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Observer: Under the hammer? Rumours that Lord Gowrie's days as chairman of Sotheby's non-American operations are numbered are doing the rounds again - a product of the enduring cultural chasm between the establishment figures who dominate the London saleroom and Sotheby's president Alfred Taubman, the US shopping mall tycoon, who bought the company to please his wife. The arrival last October of former Hollywood producer Roger Faxon as a cost-cutting managing director in London left Lord Gowrie concentrating his talents on selling Sotheby's to the rich and famous and using his contacts to acquire goods for sale in competition with the sharpened-up Christie's. But now the promotional job has disappeared as well with the arrival of Luke Rittner, former boss of the Arts Council, as head of corporate affairs. Lord Gowrie is still a great asset at Sotheby's - which he joined in 1987 after quitting the government because he could not live on his ministerial salary  -and the London operation has withstood the recession better than the New York end. On the other side of the Atlantic, the whispers concentrate on Taubman. He is believed to be wearying of the social whirl that comes with owning the world's biggest auction house. More to the point he has been raising cash this year and there is even talk that he may depart before Gowrie.</p>

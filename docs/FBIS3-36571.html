			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tatyana Khudyakova report: "Incomes Rise But So Does </F> Number of Poor People"]    [Text] The Labor Ministry has summarized some results of  the year of 1993, just ended, and has categorized as  achievements the stabilization of Russians' living standards and  the nonappearance of mass unemployment.    However great the temptation, we must nonetheless not be too  quick to rejoice. According to official data published by the  same Labor Ministry, last year the population's money incomes  increased 9 percent. Evidently the incomes only of the section  of the population whose incomes are 27 times higher than those  of the lowest paid people.    The main bulk of Russians (77 percent) had incomes lower  than  double the subsistence wage, which was 50,000 rubles [R] in  December. One-third of this number were below even the  subsistence wage. According to an expert assessment about 13  percent of people on low incomes were frankly suffering from  malnutrition.    If it is considered that things are no worse than in 1992,  that means that a certain stabilization of incomes is taking  place. Although specialists claim that new paupers have appeared  in Russia. They are citizens who are perfectly able to work but  whose incomes do not sustain any sort of life, since they are  below the subsistence wage.    The labor market situation looks like the calm before the  storm. Official unemployment continues to be negligible and  does not exceed 1 percent of the number of employed people. But  so-called hidden unemployment is increasing -- according to  various assessments, between 4 and 7 million people are not  working full days or are on unpaid administrative leave.    Wages are a headache for the government. This powerful  engine of progress has lost all sense in our country. People in  work are not happy because by December wages had increased 700  percent while prices had increased 900 percent. The government  is concerned because the monthly wage increases are blatantly  inflationary. Money is being pumped into the consumer market  thanks to endless increases in prices for energy, transport, raw  materials, and so on. Manpower is still cheap, but it seems  that quantity and quality of labor will not be in demand as  economic categories for a while yet.    But a new phenomenon has been discovered. The average  industrial wage is R140,000, while the average wage in, for  example, commercial banks is R1.5 million. That is not all.  Leaders of enterprises, even of those which have long had one  foot in the grave, are concluding contracts with themselves and  setting wages that are sometimes 100 times higher than the  average wage of workers at the same enterprise. How can this be  combated? It is rumored that the government intends to put an  end to this outrage but does not yet know how to do it.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (11): Different views from the hill - The European Experience / Spain IESE and Esade, the two most internationally renowned business schools in Spain, are perched on the same hill just 10 to 15 minutes from the centre of Barcelona. Their similar geographical location, however, masks fundamental differences which go beyond Esade's famous association with the Jesuits and rival IESE's link with the traditionalist Roman Catholic organisation, Opus Dei. Founded in 1958 IESE (the International Graduate School of Management of the University of Navarra) is a Harvard-inspired institution devoted to post-experience MBA education and the training of senior executives. Esade, founded in the same year, provides these services, too, but it concentrates much of its effort on younger students straight from school who typically follow a 5 year management course modelled on the French grandes ecoles system. The different focus has helped shape separate philosophies, visible in the schools' product mix, attitudes to teaching, and international strategies. At one level, their relationship appears to be one of relaxed co-existence. A question for the harsher and less predictable economic climate of the mid 1990s, though, is the extent to which rivalry will be sharpened in areas such as MBA and executive education, where there is overlap. As Paul McDonough, MBA admissions director at IESE puts it: 'In the late 1980s people like myself just had to sit back and wait for the applications to roll in. Now schools have to make more of an effort. Certainly the general level of interest is down, but we are benefiting from the different aspects of our programme and from people's desire to learn about the Spanish and European economies'. Last September there were 360 applications for 65 places on the English-language section of the two year full-time MBA course. Lluis Puges, director general of Esade, concedes that economic pressures, and the proliferation of smaller domestically-oriented Spanish schools offering short programmes, have had an impact on Esade's MBA applications. Nevertheless, he is happy with the current size of the full time MBA class (around 180 per year, including 40 in the English speaking section). Esade is trying hardest to expand in specialised courses for executives and tailor-made programmes for companies. As Puges explains, there are three main benefits: 'Our faculty gets better exposure to current management problems, it improves the chances that they will hire our people, and it fosters loyalty and repeat business from our company customers.' A reputation for top executive training lies at the heart of nearby IESE's formidable strength. About 600 senior managers attend the school's part-time programmes each year, accounting for 49 per cent of its income. This success is based on IESE's enviably close links with the local business community. These are based in part on the its influential and highly active alumni network. (A recent survey showed that an internationally high 45 per cent of its former students contribute to school activities). As Carlos Cavalle, dean of IESE, points out, there are equally important forms of collaboration with the school's non-alumni customers, through IESE's joint advisory board, its joint (research) committee, and its associate company status. This gives members regular input into educational issues. Cavalle emphasises the primacy of corporate connections in IESE's overall strategy. 'We actually started the school by setting up a senior executive programme first. We thought this was an excellent way of developing the faculty, the MBA market and research.' Some Spanish business schools, says Esade's Puges, are being forced to cut their budgets by as much as 20 per cent this year. Puges says he is not hiring any new faculty members. 'I am trying to keep it the same.' The challenge, he says, is to find new markets both at home (through more executive education) and abroad. (Esade's new international programme in business law is one current example). Puges reflects that the changes forced on schools may be more fundamental. 'When change follows a pattern, it is relatively easy to look ahead,' he explains, 'but for me the great difficulty is that we are on the point of a big breakthrough, which means you have to dream. That is difficult for business schools, because it is the realm of artists and philosophers. If we can somehow combine dreaming with rational thinking the result could be very positive.' If business schools are to do more to solve society's problems, Puges further believes they must be more focused on helping entrepreneurs and less obsessed with serving multinationals. Back at IESE Pedro Nueno, the school's widely respected professor of strategy, sounds optimistic. He says the recession, 'uncovers new types of need which we have been addressing.' Change has increased the pressures on IESE's staff, but Nueno emphasises that the school's total throughput is increasing and that it is still hiring and training new faculty. Much of IESE's success lies in the decision five years ago to go global, as Carlos Cavalle puts it. IESE, for example, has teamed up with the University of Michigan, one of the leading US schools in executive education, to offer a two week course in Switzerland. Where others talk gloomily of their experience in Eastern Europe, Cavalle says that on the contrary the international faculty development programme, run jointly with ISA in Paris and Bocconi University in Italy, is working well. 'It is much better to train the faculty than to try to teach executives directly,' he suggests. He admits that Moscow has been more difficult but ' by choosing the universities of Prague, Warsaw and Budapest we are working with the best'.</p>

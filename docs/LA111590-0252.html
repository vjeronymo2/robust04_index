			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLICE PULL PLUG ON TOLL-FREE POT NUMBER IN N.Y.  </P> <P> Police said today they have pulled the plug on 1-800-WANT-POT, a toll-free  telephone number for a $30,000-a-day drug operation that used bicycle  messengers to deliver marijuana anywhere in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Police said they arrested Michael Cesar, 48, who described himself as "the Pope  of Pot," and five bicycle messengers Wednesday in the Greenwich Village shop  where the service was based.  </P> <P> When customers dialed 1-800-WANT-POT, a bicycle messenger would be dispatched  from a comic book store, police spokesman Capt. Stephen Davis said. He said the  messenger would bring one-eighth of an ounce of the drug for $50 to any  Manhattan location.  </P> <P> "These people got marijuana delivered like most people send out for coffee,"  prosecutor Sterling Johnson said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "Beijing Set for Massive </F> Share Issue"]    [Text] Beijing plans to publicly issue 175 million shares  of four State companies starting this Sunday.    The move, which is to take place over three days, is the  first such offering by the capital.    Li Junhua, Director of the Beijing Municipal Commission for  Economic Restructuring, said the listing is an important step in  improving management and the shareholding system at State-owned  enterprises.    It is expected to raise more than 1 billion yuan ($114  million) for the Beijing Department Store (Group) Company  Limited, the Beiren Printing Machinery Company Limited, the  Beijing Light Bus Company Limited and the Beijing Town County  Trade Centre Company Limited.    The four companies are expected to be listed on the Shanghai  Stock Exchange. But the date of the listing has not yet been  announced.    Those who want to buy shares must deposit money for  half-year  terms in banks in Beijing.    The receipts they receive will then be entered in a lottery  to decide who can buy shares.    The Beiren company, China's biggest printing machinery  producer, plans to float 35 million shares.    Money collected from the issuance will be invested in buying  advanced technology, developing new products and building new  plants, company representatives said.    Beiren earned 133.56 million yuan ($15.35 million) in  profits  last year and floated 100 million shares on the Hong Kong Stock  Exchange last July.    The Beijing Light Bus Company Limited, which is expected to  issue 40 million shares, is one of China's top auto-makers.    It registered a profit of 22.32 million yuan ($2.57 million)  last year and makes 17 percent of the country's light buses.  And it expects to make 37.5 million yuan ($4.31 million) in  profits this year.    Funds raised through the issuance are set for technical  renovation, buildlng a branch factory and importing foreign  technology.    The Beijing Department Store, built in 1955 and the second  largest retailer in the capital, chalked up a sales volume of  1.11 billion yuan ($127.59 million) last year. It is ready to  float 50 million shares.    Beijing Town and County Trade Centre, a rising star in the  capital's commercial industry made 52 million yuan ($5.9  million) in profits last year. It plans to issue 50 million  shares.    Li said the time is ripe for Beijing to issue shares since  the city has made substantial achievements in recent years. As  of March 10, Beijing had 204 shareholding companies.    The number of securities companies has also grown rapidly.  By the end of last year, 34 financial institutions in the city  opened securities businesses and 114 securities trading outlets  opened, Li said.    Moreover, more than 40,000 Beijing residents own stocks, he  said.    Meanwhile, rising bank savings have helped with listing  shares, Li said.    By February, the city's individual savings deposits had  reached 63.2 billion yuan ($7.26 billion).    In addition, he said the country's efforts at drafting laws  and regulations in the securities industry have improved the  environment for listing shares.    Beijing has two companies listed on the Shanghai Stock  Exchange. But Tianlong and Tianqiao, a waste recycling company  and a retailer, did not follow standard practice and float their  shares first.</p>

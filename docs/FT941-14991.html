			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Cash may bring new rail link bids Some large contractors that previously had expressed little interest in bidding for contracts to build the Channel tunnel rail link said yesterday they would reassess their position after reports that the government was prepared to provide up to Pounds 1.5bn to encourage private-sector investment in the Pounds 3bn project. The reports said the Treasury had changed its view and was now prepared to countenance a substantial contribution to the project. Previously it had been thought that only Pounds 300m-Pounds 500m of public-sector money would be available to build the line. Construction companies said ministers' disappointment at the low response by private-sector investors had prompted the rethink on the size of the public-sector contribution. Mr Keith Clarke, chief executive of Eurorail, a consortium of Trafalgar House, BICC and GEC, one of the few groups to have expressed a formal interest in developing the line, said: 'We have always taken the view that a substantial non-user grant would be needed to make private investment viable in such a large and complex project.' Tarmac, the large UK construction company, has yet to express a formal interest. It said yesterday that it would be reassessing its position. Amec, another large construction group in a similar position, said a number of issues would need to be resolved before it would consider a bid. John Laing, which is building a privately financed road toll bridge across the River Severn, said it 'was monitoring the situation'. At least two other private-sector groups are understood to be considering a bid. One is thought to be led by Hochtief, a German construction company with UK interests. Ove Arup, the UK consulting engineer, is also thought to be considering forming a consortium to invest in the development. Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, confirmed yesterday that it had received a final bill for Pounds 2.6bn from contractors building the tunnel. The formal claim from contractors had been submitted as a result of a request from Eurotunnel and there was no reason why this should prompt legal action. The Pounds 2.6bn represented Pounds 1.8bn at 1985 prices and 60 per cent had been paid already, Eurotunnel said.</p>

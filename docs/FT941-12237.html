			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Rifkind to visit Bosnia UK defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind is to fly to Bosnia next weekend to see the 2,300 troops Britain has pledged to keep there until the end of winter but not indefinitely, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports. Mr Rifkind, who has said Britain will not unilaterally pull its troops out of Bosnia before consulting its allies, made his most recent visit to the region last August. British troops have been there since November 1992. Mr Rifkind is due to meet the new UN commander in Bosnia, Lt Gen Sir Michael Rose, a Briton, in Sarajevo. Debate over Britain's long-term role in the conflict was fuelled on Friday by the murder of a British aid worker.</p>

Pankov; UDC 681.31:535] </F>   [Abstract] A new approach is examined for designing  parallel specialized photo-matrix LSIC, employing  metal-dielectric- semiconductor (MDS) technology, capable of not  only reception, photoelectric conversion and storage of logic  signals, but their parallel logic-arithmetic processing as well.  The results are reported of a new photo-matrix LSIC PMAMD  (Photo-Matrix Associative Memory Device) for realization of  parallel data search methods from optical memory organized by  pages. High speeds of photoelectric transformation of the data  of optical pages and their parallel processing is successfully  combined in this LSIC with a high reliability and interference  rejection of photoelectric transformation during the data flow,  divergence of optical parameters of the page images,  nonuniformity of the light background, electrophysical  parameters of the photoelectronic LSIC crystals, and also  nonuniformities produced by technology of the LSIC  manufacturing. The structural diagram of the proposed  photoelectronic LSIC PMAMD is provided. Testing of experimental  samples of the PMAMD demonstrated that with the optical signal  power 5x10[.sup]-8[/]W/Bit, the photo-sensitivity of the  PMAMD elementary cells (not less than 10[.sup]-13[/], can  produce a 100 Mbit/s rate of the data flow at the optical input  to the PMAMD .

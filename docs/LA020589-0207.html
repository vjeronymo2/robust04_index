			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MURPHY OFF TARGET BUT MOORPARK HITS MARK IN 79-59 WIN  </P> <P> Just when Steve Murphy was about to etch his name into the Moorpark College  record book, Murphy's Law intervened.  </P> <P> And everything that could go wrong did.  </P> <P> Murphy, who was chasing Steve Ornelaz's record for consecutive free throws,  stepped to the line with 13:23 remaining in Moorpark's 79-59 Western State  Conference victory over Glendale on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Murphy had made 25 free throws in a row over an 8-game span -- 2 shy of  Ornelaz's mark of 27 set during the 1978-79 season. But Murphy had not shot a  free throw in nearly 3 games, and he was feeling the pressure.  </P> <P> "I can't say it wasn't on my mind when I went to the line," Murphy said.  "Everyone looked at me and kind of winked."  </P> <P> Murphy bounced the ball twice, set, then swished the first free throw to give  the Raiders a 50-40 lead. He followed the same procedure for the second shot,  but it was long and off to the right.  </P> <P> "I felt comfortable, but I knew when I released it, it was off to the right,"  Murphy said. "It had to end somewhere. I guess I'll start a new streak now."  </P> <P> Eleven seconds later, Murphy fouled Glendale's Justin Lord and was whistled for  a technical foul when he complained about the call. He eventually fouled out  with 4:11 to play, after scoring 3 points.  </P> <P> Murphy was about the only Raider who didn't have a good night. Moorpark (16-10,  6-4 in conference play), playing what Raider Coach Al Nordquist called "one of  our better games all year," broke open a tight game by shooting 64% percent in  the second half while visiting Glendale (15-10, 6-4) struggled offensively.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros, who trailed, 35-31, at halftime, made only 10 of 33 shots in the  second half (30%).  </P> <P> "We shot awful, we passed awful, and we executed awful," Glendale Coach Brian  Beauchemin said. "If I could find the reasons for it, I'd bottle them, sell  them, and I wouldn't have to do this crap."  </P> <P> Moorpark, which was led by sophomore Alex Porter (a game-high 20 points and 12  rebounds), got a big boost from its freshmen, 3 of whom scored in double  figures. Sean Young scored 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting, including a pair of  3-point shots, and swingman Damion Dicus added 12 points.  </P> <P> Charlie Cangelosi (11 points) and Greg Taylor (6 points, 7 rebounds), another  freshman, also contributed.  </P></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Arts: Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens - Theatre An immensely powerful performance is taking place at the King's Head theatre in Islington. Whether every night will be a potent as the first probably depends on the audience. In the end there are 33 characters on stage - a record for this theatre. Sitting and standing to capacity, the audience on Monday could only outnumber the cast by about three to one. And it is on this total proximity, almost identification, between performers and watchers that Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens depends for its force. Do not be put off by the title. The operative word is elegies. The victims of Aids (for that is what the piece is about) range widely and include a cute little girl with a pigtail, infected by a parent; what looks like a septuagenarian charlady; and a minister of the church who thinks it was best when they all stayed in the closet as well as the more obvious candidates. All suffer; all die. Elegies achieves its effect by letting them come on one after another. When they have done their bit, they take their place back-stage as on the Quilt which commemorates Aids victims in individual panels which has been publicly shown in Washington DC. The result is like a medieval tableau recording victims of the plague. Yet it is not gloomy. If there is a criticism of Elegies, it is that there is an ambivalence about whether it is celebrating the good times that have been had, despite the consequences, or is a lament that they ever took place. The answer seems to be a bit of both, but that the suffering has brought a lot of unexpected people together. Elegies is conducted in rhyming couplets and is, in parts, a musical. Some of the verse is crude: 'Now that I have kicked the bucket, All I have to say is f-it.' Much of it is effective: 'What is it doctor, is it Aids? His studied silence spoke in spades.' The songs are uniformly good. 'My Brother Lived in San Francisco' may be reminiscent of a 1960s hit that praised the same city, but the reference must be intentional and captures the change from flower people to sufferers. The final song, 'Learning to Let Go', which means learning to die in peace, is sensational and is encored several times over. The show is very American. The principal influences come from California and New York City; so does the tinge of sentimentality. But it is convincingly played here as if Britain has the same problems of pain and the need for sympathy. The piece is written and directed by Bill Russell and the music is by Janet Hood. It is worth seeing alongside Steven Sondheim's Assassins at the Donmar Warehouse. Both are about dancing with death, yet both have a peculiar vitality.

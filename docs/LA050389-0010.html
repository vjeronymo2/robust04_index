			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH'S PROPOSED CUTS STIR PROTEST  </P> <P> About 250 mental health advocates gathered in front of the County  Administration Building on Tuesday to protest Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed  $200-million cut in state mental health funding, a move that could shrink San  Diego's $45-million share by up to one-third next year.  </P> <P> Representatives of the San Diego Coalition for Mental Health, carrying homemade  signs that read: "This Could Be You" and "Mental Illness is a No Fault  Disability," rallied during a county supervisors meeting that was held outside  to accommodate the crowd.  </P> <P> Bob Lerner, a county spokesman, said the supervisors wanted to join the rally  to "make a statement" showing their support. All five supervisors, amid cheers  and applause, signed a resolution opposing the proposed reduction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Throw It in State's Lap  </P> <P> If the cut is approved, Supervisor Susan Golding said, the county could decide  to turn over operation of San Diego's mental health programs to the state.  </P> <P> "If requirements put on mental health programs operated by the county are so  stringent . . . then we can't operate them. We're really at the limit," she  said. "That's very dramatic, but the state has the ultimate responsibility."  </P> <P> The governor's proposed cut would reduce the county's mental health budget by  up to $16 million. Describing the situation as a "state of emergency," Golding  said reductions in an already tight mental health budget would mean putting  more mentally ill on the street and cutting back on outpatient care.  </P> <P> "I don't see how we can continue to do it. I'm not interested in running (a  county mental health system) without adequate funding," she said.  </P> <P> "We remain 57th out of 58 counties (in per capita state financing for mental  health), while being the second-biggest county in the entire state," she told  coalition members. "San Diego is not alone, but we're just about the worst  off."  </P> <P> Supervisor Brian Bilbray said: "The state of California thinks equality is  giving each person in San Diego a little over $13 for mental health . . . .  This is not just a mental health issue, this is not just a money issue, this is  a civil rights issue." By contrast, San Francisco receives about $41 per  capita.  </P> <P> The county filed suit against the state three years ago, alleging that the  state's allocation of money for mental health care and drug and alcohol  rehabilitation programs violates the constitutional rights of San Diego County  citizens. The suit, which is still pending, says people in San Diego have less  access to these services than Los Angeles or San Francisco citizens.  </P></p>

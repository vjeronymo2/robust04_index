			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Attorney General Carlos </F> Gustavo Arrieta by unidentified reporter; from ``Caracol's 0600  to 0900'' newscast--live]    [Text] The big news in the last few hours was a news  conference by Prosecutor General Dr. Gustavo de Greiff  yesterday. Dr. de Greiff clearly refuted U.S. Senator John Kerry  and revealed the text of a letter his office sent Kerry days ago  indicating the mistakes and untruths presumably contained in the  senator's statements on the drug trafficking problem in our  country and on the efforts of the Prosecutor General's Office.    The prosecutor general also criticized the national  government and--if you read between the lines--the Justice  Ministry. De Greiff told reporters that the justice  minister--on behalf of the executive branch--defended [words  indistinct], as it is commonly said, before Congress, a bill  that would later become the nation's new penal code, which is  the center of controversy right now.    De Greiff also lashed out at certain media, accusing them of  not having read the documents in question. He accused the media  of distorting his position toward La Quica [Dandeny Munoz  Mosquera] and the letter he sent the U.S. judge handling the  case. In sum, the prosecutor's decision not to step down will  leave much to be done and ample material for comment by the  media.    Prosecutor General de Greiff urged the national government  to  work together against the drug trafficking cartels. He recalled  that the executive branch worked intensively in discussing the  issues and drafting the penal procedural code. As previously  mentioned, the prosecutor general criticized the justice  minister and said he does not understand why a decision that was  discussed and jointly adopted is now being criticized.    That collaboration, that harmony among the various branches  of public power to establish a common front against drug  trafficking, was also demanded in due time by an official who  has appeared to be conciliatory, who has served as a bridge in  the reestablishment of talks between the prosecutor general and  the president as well as with the justice minister. We are  talking about Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. Good  morning, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta.    Arrieta: Good morning. How are you?    Reporter: What is your opinion about the documents  revealed to the general public yesterday by Prosecutor General  Gustavo de Greiff and about his news conference, especially the  last part of it, when he requests greater harmony and  cooperation among the branches of government to fight drug  trafficking.    Arrieta: I think it is the most important part of  the document. I am talking about the latter part, where the  prosecutor general urges the executive branch to cooperate in  the entire process, with the criminal policy, with the surrender  policy. He pledged to do his part. De Greiff also reaffirmed  his determination to continue fighting drug trafficking.    We all want to deal with the core of the problem [words  indistinct] in the past months. I think that if the Prosecutor  General's Office is clearly determined to contribute and  participate in the [words indistinct], then we have taken an  important step toward breaking the deadlock.    Reporter: The media have reported that the  prosecutor general agreed, as the president did this week, with  the presentation of a bill to Congress to reform certain rules  of the penal procedural code. You met yesterday morning for  several hours with Prosecutor General de Greiff. Were you able  to discuss which chapters or issues of that penal procedural  code should be reformed?    Arrieta: Frankly, this was an idea we had  discussed on several occasions. We also discussed it with  certain government officials and, fortunately for the country,  there has been progress.    There is a consensus on the need to review certain points of  the penal code and the code on penal procedures. The penal code  brings together a series of legal provisions which, as I  mentioned, are dispersed in more than 50 or 60 regulations. We  need to review sentences and adjust certain aspects of the code  on penal procedures that I think merit review, such as that  which concerns automatic advantages [ventajas automaticas] and  the implementation of certain benefits.    I dare say that there is almost a consensus, and I expect  our  proposal to be accepted so we can form a working group that will  be able to quickly present a coherent draft to Congress. We  cannot make mistakes. We will take a week to do things right,  but I do hope that we will be in the position--I repeat--to  present a draft to Congress in two or three months with the  suggestions we have made plus those that the Prosecutor's Office  feels are important, because Congress believes that it is vital  that this draft be presented correctly.    Reporter: Based on what you just said, we can  surmise that there are three basic aspects: the [word  indistinct] of 50 or 60 regulations that are dispersed in  various codes; the review of sentences that seem to be too  short--there is a consensus about that in the country; and the  review of what you termed automatic advantages and certain  benefits for those who turn themselves in. Are there points of  disagreement?    Arrieta: As for [words indistinct], I do not think  there is any discrepancy. In that specific aspect, I do not  think there is any disagreement; on the contrary, there is a  consensus. I feel it is also important to mention the famous  Article 369E, which was so controversial in its own time. Do  you remember a couple of months ago when it was implied that  certain people were being investigated by the prosecutor general.    Reporter: Is there a consensus on reforms to  Article 369E? Does the justice minister, who so vigorously  defended the way it was drafted at Congress, agree with it?    Arrieta: [Words indistinct] a small disagreement  but precisely the work of the commission, made up by the group I  mentioned, is aimed at ironing out differences so we can present  a project on which we all agree.    Reporter: Could domestic and foreign critics be  right in saying that we are lax in dealing with drug traffickers.    Arrieta: I think we must realize that the  surrender policy and the methods by which it is implemented have  had excellent results, but they have also created some problems.  We must learn from our mistakes to improve the process. No one  thought we would would perform miracles in one or two years. An  important procedure was designed and it has had some clear  results. We must learn from the mistakes made in the  implementation of this policy. We must perfect the process  until we have tools that will strengthen the state and allow us  to have a clear and effective criminal policy within our laws.    When we talk about doing a review, it does not mean that  what  we did before did not work. It is something we must keep  working on to fine tune these tools until they are right for the  purposes for which they were intended.    Reporter: So you are telling us that we need a  legal interpretation of how the principle of favorableness  [principio de favorabilidad] of the criminal code will be  applied in the event that standards that are currently  considered favorable are reformed, making them stronger and more  strict for people who are going to be tried.    Arrieta: You are right, just as you usually are  when you comment on legal matters. The truth is that the  principle of favorableness implies that some of the changes,  especially substantial ones, could be applied only for crimes  committed in the future. This is important because it has a  preventive effect, an effect that could be useful for the  country.    Reporter: What can be done so that U.S. officials,  so Mr. Kerry or the U.S. attorney general, can agree with [words  indistinct] penal code?    Arrieta: I truly do not believe [words indistinct]  agree or disagree because Colombia is independent in that sense.  I think the basic problem with the United States is a lack of  communication. They should understand the vicissitudes, the  difficulties, and the characteristics inherent to our national  problems. I do not think they simply want us to have  legislation that is similar or comparable to the existing  legislation because the circumstances are very different. The  idea is to come up with legislation that will be in keeping with  our situation and that will give us the tools to fight crime and  prevent impunity. I believe that [words indistinct] they will  understand in the end. If one looks back one will find that  there were very controversial decisions in the judiciary which  could seem weak, but when they are analyzed under the current  laws, they were not controversial per se, such as the [name  indistinct] case, the case of the Ochoas, which involved [word  indistinct] that, within the Colombian context, were very  negative but in the end, the North Americans understood. That is  why I say that the problem is not whether they accept or reject  it, because Colombia is independent in these matters. It is a  problem of [words indistinct] in consensus. [Words indistinct]  in the face of controversial decisions [words indistinct] two or  three behind [words indistinct] reasonably explain why certain  decisions were made, and they understood in the end. [passage  indistinct] have been asking [words indistinct] for coherence  among all those concerned with this issue because [words  indistinct] can present a united front with wise and reasonable  explanations there is no reason to [words indistinct]. Our  experience in these matters shows that the North Americans have  not been [words indistinct] we have been the problem and thus we  must think about our own laws in terms of our own criteria and  what is best.    Reporter: With all due respect, Mr. Attorney  General, one can understand correspondence and opinions coming  and going between Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and Mrs.  Reno. What one cannot understand, as a Colombian, is why pay so  much attention to what Senator John Kerry has to say? Who is  Sen. John Kerry? He is a U.S. senator, he is a very important  person, he is very respectable, he is a writer for THE  WASHINGTON POST, and so on, but is that enough to have a whole  country paralyzed, to have its people divided and waiting for  what a U.S. senator has to say?    Arrieta: That is why it is important to nip this  in the bud. I found his statements yesterday interesting, from a  certain standpoint. He defined the true dimensions of the  problem and highlighted the basic fact that he is does not have  a full understanding of some areas. I do agree with you, but  this is not just any old senator. He is the chairman of the  Senate Narcotics Commission. Nevertheless, I believe that as we  move on and we explain these things to this fellow, we will  surely be able to solve the problem in the end. In general  terms, though, I do agree with you on this.    Reporter: Thank you sir. I have three different  issues here. First, is it true that the Attorney General's  Office has almost taken over the Administrative Department of  Civil Aeronautics?    Arrieta: I would not really say takeover is the  appropriate term. We have been working closely with them and we  have had the full cooperation of the department's directors in  solving several delicate problems. There were in fact a great  many problems regarding investigation and such, so we decided to  implement a permanent surveillance system. This was not just to  solve the internal problems we found in security, corruption,  and mismanagement in the area of licensing. Through this  surveillance operation, without affecting the investigative  process, we expect to assist them in the implementation of  corrective measures within the department, in order for it to  operate much better. To that end, I repeat, we have had the  full cooperation of the department's administrative personnel.  We are very pleased about this, because we can find the  solutions if we continue to work together. We have found  several very serious problems there and this cooperation system  has allowed them to explain the situation. We will continue to  have a permanent presence and continuous surveillance there.    Reporter: Another question. Is the prosecutor  general getting his way, from a legal point of view, following  the decision to transport five of Pablo Escobar's former  lieutenants to participate in judicial proceedings going on  Antioquia?    Arrieta: I do not think so, Dario. I do not thing  anyone is getting their way. I think that this is a way of  finding understanding among the parties. On the one hand we  have the prosecutor general's wish to have these people in  Medellin so the proceedings can progress. The government is  getting its way as well, because there will not be a mass  transfer, but one person at a time. That way we will not see  any of the public security problems they believe could have  occurred. I believe that what we are seeing here is a  negotiated solution which tries to avert any possible public  disturbance, while serving the prosecutor general's legal  purposes. I do not think, then, that anyone is getting his way.    Reporter: Very well, we will have individual  transfers. Will their stay at the Itagui Prison, in Medellin,  be temporary or indefinite?    Arrieta: I believe it will just be temporary,  Dario, until certain legal activities are completed, to ensure  normal progress of the various cases. As soon as they finish  they will return to Bogota, unless the conditions that led the  government to object to the transfers still prevail.    Reporter: We thank you for this interview with  Caracol, Mr. Attorney General. The last issue has to do with  the order issued by the Attorney General's Office and carried  out by the Armed Forces and the president. This was the  dismissal of Gen. Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales. You had a full  year to overturn the special prosecutor's sentence following the  investigation and the legal proceedings. Why did you decide not  to overturn that ruling? Why did you ratify your predecessor's  ruling?    Arrieta: I think it is important that we set the  record straight on this issue. This office could not legally  overturn my predecessor's ruling. Legally, given the  circumstances at that specific time, the ruling could not be  revoked, whether I agreed with it or not. According to the law,  once a case is filed under the jurisdiction of the  administrative legal authorities, and that authority rules on  the charges, their ruling cannot be revoked. The attorney  general could not legally revoke the ruling, whether he agreed  with it or not.    Reporter: Under the law and in your mind, did you  agree with your predecessor's ruling?    Arrieta: Dario, it is very difficult for me to  answer that, but let me say what I have said on several  occasions. When we examined the case we found that there were  certain additional issues that should have been investigated,  particularly in two areas. The first question was which higher  ranking officer gave Gen. Arias Cabrales certain orders  regarding the operation? I do not mean civilian authorities; I  mean the military authorities that participated in the  operation, besides Gen. Cabrales. Then there is a question of  who was involved in the specific action that prompted the  Attorney General's Office to investigate--the events that took  place in the restroom located between the third and fourth  floors of the Justice Palace.    I think it is important to make one point here, Dario. When  the Attorney General's Office examined the case, it did not  examine the operation in general. Many believe that the  office's decision was against the reaction, the use of the  tanks, the fierceness, the violence, and so on, and that is just  not true. The ruling has to do with the specific and precise  events that took place on 6 and 7 November--particularly 7  November--in the restroom between the third and fourth floors.    Reporter: You mean the alleged abuses and  excessive use of force the Armed Forces displayed?    Arrieta: Dario, the Attorney General's Office  argued that when these events took place, the Palace had almost  been recovered and there was almost no resistance. The hostages  were concentrated at specific locations and the rebels were also  grouped together. The Attorney General's Office found what went  on in the restroom between the third and fourth floors merited  some degree of admonishment. The troops opened a hole in the  wall using dynamite or a rocket and shot into the room with a  machine gun, against rebels and hostages alike. The Attorney  General's Office ruled against that specific line of action.  That is why the attorney general sentenced Gen. Arias Cabrales.    Reporter: It was not because he followed orders  from higher ranking civilian and military authorities, but for  that specific incident?    Arrieta: I think the debate has wandered off in  that direction. The orders he received are not in question. No  one said that obeying orders frees you from all responsibility,  as long as these orders are carried within the law. I cannot  but agree with the justice minister, because I do not believe  there was a specific and direct order to open fire with a  machine gun into a room containing 60 or 70 people. That is the  part that has created the controversy. There is a question of  whether Gen. Arias Cabrales is in fact directly responsible for  these specific acts and I have found no specific evidence in the  file to prove that. This is why I am in no position to give you  a specific answer to your question. I do believe it would be  beneficial to offer the people a more detailed explanation about  why the Attorney General's Office made this decision.    Reporter: Why has the president remained so  silent. At the time he was a congressman and a spokesman for  presidential candidate Virgilio Barco. He strongly criticized  Former President Belisario Betancur, the minister of defense,  and other high government officials for having issued the orders?    Arrieta: Dario, I cannot answer that question.    Reporter: Thank you, Attorney General Carlos  Gustavo Arrieta, for accepting this interview for Caracol.</p>

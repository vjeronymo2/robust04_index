			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Observer: Home to roost Full marks to the environment department for trying to find a silver lining in the cloud of the latest stats on house re-possessions. The official interpretation was that the figures were welcome, re-possessions having fallen 42 per cent since their peak. The claim rebounded, however, when housing professionals noted that even the most optimistic gloss that can be put on the data is that re-possessions in the second half of 1992 were 19 per cent below the all-time record hit in the last six months of 1991. Hence red faces at the department. It appears that the vaunted 42 per cent drop relates to possession orders made by the courts. Yet, as the Lord Chancellor's staff pointed out on publishing the court statistics: 'The figures do NOT indicate how many houses have been re-possessed . . .' For the record, last year's figures were the second highest ever, 10 times higher than a decade ago. Households with payments over six months in arrears also increased by 28 per cent to a record of over a third of a million. Whatever became of the action to stop most of the re-possessions, which the prime minister promised on Desert Island Discs last year?</p>

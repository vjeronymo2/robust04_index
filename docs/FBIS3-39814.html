			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Competition Commissioner Karel Van </F> Miert by Jacques Docquiert and Jean-Michel Laney; place and date  not given: "Van Miert: `We Do Not Have a View of Competition  Limited To the Community Market'" -- first paragraph is LES  ECHOS introduction]    [Text] The "boss" of competition in Brussels, Commissioner  Karel Van Miert, explained in an interview with LES ECHOS that  the single market remains structurally imbalanced and only an  amendment of the treaty would make it possible to remedy the  situation, especially in cases involving dumping. However,  while he affirmed that the legal rules of competition must be  strictly applied without being able to take account of other  criteria, he also assured that the Commission -- a collegial  body -- is able to assume its political responsibilities -- as  the Vallourec affair proved. The only path for Bull and Air  France is a drastic recovery plan, which often means significant  cuts in capacity. More generally, he expressed his desire for a  better world trade organization that integrated the requirement  for competition, and deplored the handling of the GATT  negotiations, which held back our strategic interests in  industry.    [LES ECHOS] What inflection have you given to competition  policy? What have you achieved, and what are your goals?    [Van Miert] I have tried to act pragmatically, without  taking  ideological sides. First of all, the very concept of  "competition" had to be thrashed out and it also had to be a  sound definition. Then it was possible to include other  elements in so far as that was possible, but without endangering  the coherence of demand: We must treat everyone the same.    For example, as regards state aid, we cannot say "yes" in  one  case and "no" in another comparable case. The hard thing is  staying consistent while sticking to economic reality.    [LES ECHOS] Does that mean that there are new criteria that  go beyond merely analyzing the competition?    [Van Miert] In the liquid crystals sector, we have  authorized  joint ventures between three large groups because this is a  world market. Even from the competition point of view, this  attitude was preferable: The question is knowing whether  tomorrow there will be European companies that can measure up to  the Japanese. We do not have a view strictly limited to the  Community market. This is especially true in the  telecommunications sector, or even in the aviation sector, where  you have to look at what is happening outside the Community.    [LES ECHOS] Does that mean that you are introducing elements  of social dumping with regard to wage costs?    [Van Miert] No. We can only apply the rules of the Single  Act, in which, unfortunately, important elements of a situation  in a given market are not all taken into account. When judging  cases of state aid or competition, there is no minimum rule that  must be complied with regarding wages. This is also true in the  monetary sector. What are the rules when a country devalues its  currency? In the area of taxation, social affairs, and monetary  affairs, the game is not equal even within our single market.  This is a structural defect.    [LES ECHOS] Do you think this must be corrected?    [Van Miert] It must be corrected because the game is  partially biased. The Commission can only work within the  framework of the treaty given to it. Sometimes our instruments  are not enough. Let us take the steel sector: If you must pay  state aid while at the same time obtaining unanimity, i.e.,  negotiate with governments that have a veto right, that is like  a referee going up to a player on the field and asking him if he  can give him a penalty.    [LES ECHOS] So, should a new treaty be negotiated?    [Van Miert] We must not be naive about a market. Everyone  uses the texts and possibilities available to him. If a match  is to be acceptable, everyone has to follow the same rules and  there must be a referee capable of enforcing the rules. We are  not there yet.    The single market is not balanced structurally. It can be  modified either through Community legislation, or by amendments  to the treaty. With monetary union, there will be the necessary  provisions. Are there minimum rules for all those who use the  social aspect to unravel other peoples' policies? That is the  question.    [LES ECHOS] How do you analyze the French Government's  attitude in the Bull matter?    [Van Miert] When I took over this file, France, as well as  other countries, was in the midst of an election campaign. It  is often difficult to take things into consideration. Generally  speaking the Commission observes a certain amount of  self-restraint. Once the new government was in place, I had  very good meetings with Gerard Longuet, and I was pleased with  that. We have a relationship based on mutual confidence. He  thought he was in a position to send us a restructuring plan in  good and due form before the summer vacation. As it turned out,  that was not realistic. Then there was a change of management,  and -- from one extension to the next -- Bull could no longer  survive without another substantial injection of money. This is  illegal. If there is "bailout" aid, the company can be financed  during a period of time so that it will survive. But that was  not allowed. "Normal" aid can only be given via the  Commission's approval of a restructuring plan that organizes a  return to profitability. It seems to me that we cannot doubt  the French authorities' desire to do what it must to ensure that  the company becomes viable and a candidate for privatization.  However, to get out of the illegal situation, we quickly need a  restructuring plan making it possible to judge the validity of  the return to viability. In the meantime, there can no longer  be any state aid.    [LES ECHOS] Can you specify what ensures that this will be a  restructuring plan you feel is reliable?    [Van Miert] It is up to the French authorities to  demonstrate  this. It is not up to the Commission to impose a plan.    [LES ECHOS] But what are the criteria for it?    [Van Miert] The first criterion is that after a capital  injection, there can no longer be any aid. This is the  criterion we used for the airlines. One must be able to  demonstrate that we can assume, in good faith, that this will be  the case. In terms of a reduction in capacity, this means --  because normally our rules insist that there is a reduction in  capacity even if it is not absolute -- that there must be proof  that all the factors that made the company lose this incredible  amount of money have been eliminated.    [LES ECHOS] You gave the French Government one month to  submit a plan. It still has two weeks.    [Van Miert] The situation is clear. There can be no more  capital injections or aid until the Commission has had a chance  to decide on a restructuring plan.    [LES ECHOS] You are telling Bull that it has reached the  maximum limit of money from which it can benefit.    [Van Miert] More than that...because an illegal situation  now  exists.    [LES ECHOS] Do you think there will be a quick decision  about  Air France?    [Van Miert] Air France CEO [chief executive officer]  Christian Blanc said that there would be a plan in good and due  form within a few weeks, as was the case with Sabena, Aer  Lingus, and Iberia, all of which have already experienced  similar operations. However, this sort of commitment is a last  chance. It is a single operation. It can only be used once.  Christian Blanc is aware of this. Here too, there must be a  credible plan.    [LES ECHOS] As regards the recovery of Air France, do you  think it would be legitimate to take into account the wage  differences between British Airways and Air France?    [Van Miert] No, because we have no rule governing that.  Nor can we do that within a single country. In Bremen,  Germany, wages are roughly 55 percent what they are in  Stuttgart. On the other hand, the Commission can take action in  different ways. If we introduce a minimum level of rules in the  social domain, we must first do what is necessary to ensure that  they are complied with. If that is not the case, it would  become unfair competition.    [LES ECHOS] A report to the "wise men" commissioned by the  Commission suggests making plans for exceptional aid, especially  if the aim of such aid is to privatize the company.    [Van Miert] That is the opinion of the wise men. The  Commission cannot become mixed up in a debate on whether or not  we should privatize, since that is the domain of the national  authorities. However, it is true that if the national  authorities want to privatize, as is the case with Bull, then  that is a sign of the seriousness of their desire to reorganize  the company. The significance of this is not lost on the  Commission -- quite the opposite. But it is not up to us to  demand this.    [LES ECHOS] In a recent case, the Vallourec matter, we had  the impression that you were disowned by the Commission since  you were in favor of banning the merger, while in the end the  Commission decided to authorize it.    [Van Miert] There were eight in favor, eight against, and  one  abstention. So just one vote was needed. As for the analysis  itself, I was in no way disowned. On the contrary, it is in the  decision. However, there was a difference of opinion regarding  the "threat" of East Europe. Certain colleagues said: "They  will be ready pretty soon and will therefore be serious  competitors," while our analysis did not confirm this opinion in  the foreseeable future. The differences of opinion had their  roots in that.    [LES ECHOS] As for the announced sanctions against the steel  sector, is there not too big an economic gap between the period  of events aimed at and the immediate economic reality?    [Van Miert] The Commission is not at liberty to close its  eyes for reasons of circumstance. This infraction should be  separated from the current handling of the steel crisis. If we  had to approach things differently, the time would never be  right. The examination procedure is long and complex. The  proven facts are very serious. Incidentally, the steel sector  has benefitted from a certain amount of leniency. As for the  fines, payment can be spread over a period of five years.    [LES ECHOS] What future do you see for state monopolies,  especially in the telecommunications sector?    [Van Miert] As regards antitrust legislation, we must take  action to create the most normal market conditions. With  telecommunications, the goal is deregulate local telephone  communications for the vast majority of the member states  (except for Ireland and Portugal, which have been granted an  extra extension) beginning 1 January 1998. Infrastructure is  another problem, and one which remains to be discussed.  However, here too, in several member states things are moving  very quickly. There is going to be a second telecommunications  firm in Germany. So why in Belgium should Belgacom still be  able to maintain a monopoly? The very foundation of the  monopoly has been eroded. The political elements are in place  to accompany this development in the telecommunications sector,  except as regards infrastructure. There will be a Community  market and, for certain services, a world market.    [LES ECHOS] Can the same reasoning be used for the import or  export of electricity?    [Van Miert] In a single market, it is clear that monopolies  on the import and export of energy between the member states do  not correspond to the fundamental principle. Increasingly,  there are complaints where it is hard to say that the applicants  are wrong. Thus, a company set up in the Netherlands must pay a  lot more for its electricity than on the other side of the  border.    [LES ECHOS] Are you prepared to have the notion of the  public  utility included in the jurisprudence?    [Van Miert] Definitely. I have no problem with that. In any  case, even in the event of privatization, we must be able to  maintain the concept of universal service. None of that is in  question. There must be a gateway between the state monopoly  and universal service. The situation is evolving for  electricity because the French Government is prepared to review  its positions.    [LES ECHOS] How do you judge the GATT negotiations?    [Van Miert] I was greatly in favor of the cultural  exception.  That is also a lesson for the French, because it must be  understood that there are other cultures in Europe that are  defending themselves against the others. However, in more  general terms, I regret the fact we got wrapped up in  agriculture because it prevented us from doing a better job of  deciding what is the strongest industrial strategy for the  future. The negotiations were hemmed in by agriculture and  culture. Our strategic interests were not given concrete form  in sectors where exports can be maximized. We accepted because  we were cornered. There was a response concerning tariffs, but  there was none at all in many other areas, such as the  environment or the social domain, or even in the behavior of  countries like Japan where it is difficult to gain access to the  market in a number of sectors -- not because of tariffs or  legislation, but because of the behavior of a sector or a lack  of competition policy. Even if they have legislation in this  area, it is not enforced. We should now side with the Americans  against the Japanese. The game must be balanced sufficiently at  world level, with a degree of openness that is measured not  merely in terms of tariffs, but also in terms of other  obstacles. For the time being, nobody is obliged to have a  competition policy, so let us at least discuss that.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The final meeting in the Abkhazian-Georgian peace  talks was held in Geneva yesterday. Despite maximum efforts  made by Georgia, participants in this round of talks failed to  reach a compromise over the definition of a political status for  Abkhazia. The next round of talks will be held in Moscow on 10  May. Russia will probably be able to influence Abkhazia at  home. It has apparently had a chance of this before, too, but  evidently waited for an appropriate moment and circumstances.    A compromise formula suggested by Russia and the United  Nations will be discussed during the Moscow round of talks.  This formula, which was proposed back in Geneva but not  discussed, says that Abkhazia will be a subject which will be  granted sovereign rights within a union state. There was not  sufficient time for this formula to be discussed during the  Geneva round of talks. However, sovereign rights and a union  state sound a little suspicious. At least, this does not sound  very encouraging for Georgia. It seems that the Georgian side  is forced to recede from its positions both on the battlefield  and at the negotiating table.    According to an official version, two documents will  comprise  the basis of the Moscow discussions. These will be the UN and  Russian suggestions on the political and legislative basics of  an all-embracing settlement and the establishment of a  coordinating commission with the participation of the  negotiating parties as well as UN and Russian diplomats. The  coordinating commission is expected to be assigned to handle  practical issues pertaining to supply, transport, and  communications.    To cut a long story short, yet another round of negotiations  is still to come and there is still something to pin hopes on.    Aleksandre Kavsadze, the Georgian head of state's personal  envoy, is in hopeful mood, believing that there is a chance to  come to an agreement about the deployment of peacekeeping forces  in the conflict zone. He has added that Georgia insists on the  deployment of these forces across the whole territory of the  conflict in order to secure the safe return of Georgian refugees  to their homes.</p>

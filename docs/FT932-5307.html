			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Arts: Return of the big Mak - Deanna Petherbridge visits the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts Mak - big Mak, new Mak, wonder Mak - has just re-opened in Vienna after extensive refurbishing. Mak is the acronym for the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts and, inspired by radical concepts of museum presentation, 11 artists have been brought in to design the new gallery installations. The results are daring, controversial and beautiful. This is the latest in a series of museum and historic building renovations (the Albertina is the next in line) which have returned Vienna to a state of magnificence. Mak, however, is not just a refurbished building but an innovative and informed response to the big museum question: how to make a historic collection relevant to present day concerns. Originally named the 'Austrian Museum for Art and Industry' in 1864, the museum was modelled on London's Victoria and Albert Museum and housed in a custom-designed neo-Renaissance building on the Stubenring. As well as its magnificent furniture, woodwork, glass and ceramics it has valuable Islamic and East Asian art and carpets and a large library and archive, including that of the Wiener Werkstatte. Since the appointment of Peter Noever as director in 1986, contemporary exhibitions and installations by international artists have made this one of Vienna's liveliest venues. Magdalena Jetelov, some years ago filled the decaying central courtyard with mounds of red sand as if the museum were adrift in a desert and Vito Acconci is now exhibiting a grand and intriguing installation, 'The City Inside Us', which subverts the architectural language of the building - an often unsubstantiated claim of installation artists. 'Mak intends to play its part as a responsible social institution in the formation of cultural values,' writes Noever in the new museum guide. Part of reconstituting such values was to invite contemporary artists to collaborate with curators in the selection and re-presentation of the collection rather than to use architects. The notion of Donald Judd, high priest of minimalism, making an installation of ornate Baroque, Rococo and Classical furniture and objects might seem bizarre, and Judd's catalogue statement reveals some uneasiness. Nevertheless his placing of a few carefully chosen pieces of baroque furniture and decorative panels within a vast marbled space is seductive and frees the spectator to enjoy the period elaboration of each piece away from associated clutter. Judd's dialectic of opposites - more wrapped within less  -finds central expression in the the free-standing room within a room, the 18th-century porcelain chamber from the Dubsky Palace in Brno, whose glowing rococo interior is encased within a cool stucco exterior. The gallery is topped with its original skylight by the 19th-century architect Heinrich von Ferstel, and the cleaned neo-Renaissance surround also gains richness in this clear aestheticised space. All 11 gallery installations depend on a high degree of selectivity, but Judd's presentation highlights a dilemma. Most contemporary museums, with rarefied displays of a few objects, rotate them. But with intervention from artists, the choice of objects is presumably sacrosanct and unchangeable. However, each gallery has a study room for the visitor who wants to explore further. The limitation of choice is avoided in the Wiener Werkstatte gallery designed by Viennese sculptor Heimo Zobernig with curator Elisabeth Schmuttermeier, which presents the museum's entire holdings. The artist has designated the gallery space as a simple spatial geometry of orange, white and grey/black (colours associated with the movement), reflecting the underlying geometric impulse of the 1903 design workshop of Josef Hoffman and his partners. The workshop archive (including designs on paper, fabric samples, photographs and model books) is arranged in a double level of shelved cupboards along one wall, and decorative objects are exhibited in an array of historic display cabinets. In the 'Historicism and Art Nouveau' gallery, New York artist Barbara Bloom shows Thonet bentwood chairs to witty advantage by placing them in two rows down the sides of the long gallery, behind translucent screens. The chairs' sinuous curves are projected on to the screens as linear shadows, and the spectator, viewing either the chair or its typical silhouette is encouraged to bridge that sometimes difficult-to-grasp gap between two-dimensional design and object, between the conceptual and the experiential. American 'hot property' Jenny Holzer has been let loose on the Biedermeier and Empire style gallery with curator Christian Witt-Dorring. This has not turned into a subversion of 19th-century bourgeois values, as the original architecture marries all too cosily with furniture from its own time. However there is something discomforting about the array of heterogeneous furniture dispiritedly displayed along the terracotta walls and in a line down the centre of the gallery, which challenges standard notions of museum theatrics. The difficult dynamics of super-selectivity rather than encyclopaedic display are seen to best advantage in the '20th-century design and architecture' gallery, designed by Viennese sculptor Manfred Wakolbinger with Peter Noever as curator. Contemporary chairs, including Frank Gehry's 1988 witty corrugated cardboard 'Hole in One' chair, architectural models, drawings and a room installation by Jasper Morrison (part fictive, part real), are given real and psychological space in this gallery, stylistically a sort of insouciantly minimal post-modernism. In Mak's visual world, so carefully articulated in relation to history and contemporary critical debates, there are no insuperable boundaries between Austrian and international artists, between high and low art, scholar and artist, maker and curator. The museum presents a Utopian moment which has come at a very interesting juncture in Austria's cultural and geographic reconstitution. It remains to be seen whether the public will forego the joys of traditional serendipity for such sophisticated games.</p>

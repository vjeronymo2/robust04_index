			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Gibbon slips to Pounds 973,000 midway Falling prices meant Gibbon Group, the printing inks concern, reported a marginal drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 980,000 to Pounds 973,000 for the six months to September 30, despite a rise in turnover from Pounds 12.7m to Pounds 13.6m. Mr Michael Gibbon, chairman, said he believed that the industry could no longer suffer price restraint, though he added that a 5 per cent increase was now imminent. Profits were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 89,000). Mr Gibbon said unbudgeted costs had arisen from the reorganisation of the group's Colorcentres into Supacentres, together with computerisation of all its sales outlets. With earnings per share at 6.4p (6.3p) the interim dividend has been held at 2.2p.</p>

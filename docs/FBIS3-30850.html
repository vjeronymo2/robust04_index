			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Army Chief of Staff Major  General Jiri Nekvasil said today that aerial bombardments in  Bosnia would give the war in the former Yugoslavia a new  dimension.    The high state of NATO weaponry would allow very precise and  selective bombardment, he said: "From a technical point of  view, it's no problem." Much more complicated is to evaluate  the results of such a strike and what sense it would make, what  it would solve and what would happen afterward. This is the  reason it is being weighed by so many parties.    It is also necessary to consider what could happen to  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces already on the ground in  Bosnia. "The number of warring parties could go up to four," he  said, adding UNPROFOR to the Croats, Serbs, and Muslims already  at war. "The UN Peacekeeping Forces are not armed enough to  stand up to everything which could follow a probable aerial  attack," he concluded.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Brazil to cut wide range of tariffs Brazil is to lower import tariffs on up to 13,000 items, as part of the government's efforts to fight inflation. The tariff reductions were due to take effect from January 1, so as to coincide with the opening of the Mercosur trade pact's customs union. Instead, the government will lower tariffs now to stimulate imports and stop domestic producers raising prices. Brazil's maximum import tariff will fall from 35 per cent to 20 per cent, once the measure takes effect, probably this week. The average tariff, which has been falling since the country started opening its economy to competition in 1990, will drop to 14 per cent, compared to about 20 per cent two years ago. According to the finance ministry, increased imports will help add to domestic supply and avert bottlenecks in the economy. Since the new Brazilian currency, the Real, was launched in July, inflation has fallen sharply and led to an increase in consumer spending. Some economists are now worried about possible shortages and price rises. Higher imports will also add to demand for US dollars. The Real is linked to the dollar but, since its launch, it has appreciated 15 per cent against the US currency as investment has flowed into Brazil. This has mainly been directed at the stock market, where investors are excited about the prospects of the former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso winning the presidential election on October 3. The Real's strength is starting to worry manufacturers, who say that exports could suffer. The main sectors affected by the tariff reductions include cars and consumer goods. The government has not accepted calls for import quotas from Brazil's car-makers, whose workers remained on strike yesterday over a pay claim.</p>

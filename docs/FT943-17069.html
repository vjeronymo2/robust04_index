			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Japan's new PM calls in conservatives: Thirteen cabinet posts go to traditional political foes Japan's new Socialist prime minister yesterday took a step to the right, by selecting a cabinet dominated by conservatives and pledging to work for stable economic growth. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, elected the first left-wing leader for 47 years on Wednesday night, yesterday allotted 13 cabinet posts - including foreign affairs, international trade and industry and defence - to the Liberal Democratic party, his traditional enemy and the largest member of his three-party coalition. Two seats, including the Finance Ministry, went to the smallest coalition partner, the New Harbinger party, which is devoted to cutting income tax. Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party took three cabinet posts. Mr Murayama, on the moderate wing of a deeply-divided SDP, promised to continue previous governments' policies of political reform and economic deregulation. This suggests that the recent red-tape cutting package, the final act of the former government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, will survive intact. The prime minister also called for international co-operation to stem the rise of the yen, which touched Y98.75 in Tokyo yesterday, fuelling fears that resulting damage to Japan's export earnings might choke the early stages of recovery. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the new finance minister, said he would seek a multi-year income tax cut, to be financed by lower public spending, rather than through a rise in sales tax as proposed by the Finance Ministry. The unexpected victory of the three-party alliance, dominated by the older generation of politicians, prompted varying degrees of puzzlement and alarm from the US, Japanese business leaders and Tokyo's influential bureaucrats. They fear the new government will restrain Japan's halting economic liberalisation and be an inexperienced advocate of its foreign interests. The LDP and SDP, in government and opposition for 38 years until last summer, have few policies in common, although they have a history of backroom parliamentary co-operation on some matters. 'I am shocked,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren business federation. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, said: 'Mr Murayama's capability as prime minister is unknown. But we call for his leadership to overcome this chaotic situation.' However, a US official in Tokyo believed the LDP would be a 'tempering influence'. China and South Korea warmly welcomed the new government, a reflection of their close links with the SDP. The downfall of the former coalition, after two months in power, left the opposition in disarray. Mr Shoichiro Ozawa, the previous government's strategist, offered to resign as secretary-general of Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party, to take the blame. However, party leaders persuaded him to stay. Former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa said he was interested in forming an alliance with LDP and SDP defectors, while Mr Toshiki Kaifu, an LDP elder who left his old party to stand unsuccessfully against Mr Murayama, said he might form a new party.  ------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEW CABINET  ------------------------------------------------------------- Prime Minister                         Tomiichi Murayama (SDP) Deputy Premier/Foreign Minister               Yohei Kono (LDP) Agriculture, Forestry &amp; Fisheries       Taichiro Okawara (LDP) Chief Cabinet Secretary                    Kozo Igarashi (SDP) Construction                                Koken Nosaka (SDP) Education                                   Kaoru Yosano (LDP) Finance                               Masayoshi Takemura (NHP) Health &amp; Welfare                             Shoichi Ide (NHP) Home Affairs                               Hiromu Nonaka (LDP) International Trade &amp; Industry         Ryutaro Hashimoto (LDP) Justice                                       Isao Maeda (LDP) Labour                                    Manso Hamamoto (SDP) Posts &amp; Telecommunications                     Shun Oide (SDP) Transport                                  Shizuka Kamei (LDP)  ------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS-GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES (STATE MINISTERS):  ------------------------------------------------------------- Defence                              Tokuichiro Tamazawa (LDP) Economic Planning                        Masahiko Komura (LDP) Environment                                 Shin Sakurai (LDP) Hokkaido/Okinawa Development             Sadatoshi Ozato (LDP) Management, Co-ordination               Tsuruo Yamaguchi (SDP) National Land                              Kiyoshi Ozawa (LDP) Science &amp; Technology                       Makiko Tanaka (LDP)  ------------------------------------------------------------- LDP = Liberal Democratic party SDP = Social Democratic party NHP = New Harbinger party  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

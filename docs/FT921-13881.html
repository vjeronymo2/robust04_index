			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / As they say in Europe: The lesser evil EVENTS IN Algeria were dutifully followed in the serious British papers but their treatment reflected a lack of passionate involvement. However, there was a general feeling that parties which gain most votes in an election should be allowed to take power, however undesirable the victors may be. The British have a long experience of elections with unfortunate outcomes and have not resorted to tanks to show their displeasure. This facile approach did not prevail elsewhere. With millions of Algerians at home and the threat of more to come the French papers agonised over the election and its failure to be consummated. Le Monde, of course, had to bring a dead philosopher into it: 'Addressing the Jesuits, Pascal had, in his time, already posed the problem clearly: 'You demand in the name of our principles, liberties which you refuse in the name of yours.' Doesn't that formula apply marvellously to the Islamic Salvation Front?' The Algerian army is also seen as 'Jesuits' by the standards of Pascal. It gets muddling, but one can see the point. The paper concluded hesitantly that in fact what the army had done was just not acceptable, however horrid an Islamic fundamentalist regime might turn out to be. 'Perhaps one ought to take the risk of allowing the FIS to take power - and probably waste it - and face up to harsh economic realities.' Now, the Jesuits started life in Spain and the Madrid daily El Pais seems to have been through their mill. It thought the Algerian army had done the right thing. 'In a fully democratic country, with regular mechanisms to guarantee and control procedures, such a course could be criticised from the point of view of its evident finality. But it is in fact a question of creating those very same structures. In such conditions the chosen course is the least bad of those available.' Curiously, back in Paris, Le Figaro pondered those same words: 'The lesser evil?' was the interrogative headline over Thierry Desjardins' editorial. 'For the first time in contemporary history, democrats everywhere welcome a coup d'etat with evident satisfaction,' he confidently asserted, adding that, had the elections gone ahead, the FIS would have won and Algeria would have adopted the 'lifestyle of seventh century Medina.' Surely the point is that the Algerians might want to live in seventh century Medina? Brushing that problem aside, Desjardins concluded: 'What attitude should we adopt? Nothing obliges us to choose between the two evils and rejoice in 'the lesser evil.' In this case the famous 'neither-nor' is forced on us. Neither the dictatorship of the mullahs, nor that of the military. But, after all, it is not our business.' This is very important, for Desjardins has signed a death warrant for leader writers. He is too good a journalist to show it. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also avoided commiting itself and retreated into an historical analysis, but the implication is the same. It is not just Algeria where we can no longer take sides, there is Russia versus Ukraine, the Georgian civil war, South Africa and a dozen other quarrels which, as my employers put it, 'lack ideological resonance.' Where have all the good guys gone? As a result we are in for a frightful period of fair mindedness, fence-sitting and statements of the obvious as papers try to clarify the minds of their readers and forsake the Manichaean struggles of the past. * * * Many may be unfamiliar with the New Banality. Fortunately, two examples are to hand. They both dealt with President Bush's trip to Japan and read like 'George catches Tokyo tummy on his holidays.' The Hamburg Welt am Sonntag wrote: 'Presumably it was only an attack of intestinal 'flu which rendered Bush unconscious for a few seconds. But the video pictures of the collapsing President have made an impression on the American electorate.' A Flemish daily, De Standaard, of Antwerp, went still further in the quest for even-handedness: 'Because his trip had electoral implications, his gastro-enteritis took on an added electoral significance. Admittedly a democrat can also get gastro-enteritis, as Bush said afterwards, but his fainting shown on all televisions during a foreign trip demonstrated clearly that the President, who aspires to a second term in office, at 67, in spite of his healthy appearance, is not the youngest of persons any more.' Well, you can't say fairer than that. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

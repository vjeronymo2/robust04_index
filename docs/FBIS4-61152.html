			<p>BFN     [Text] As we already reported, Rasul Guliyev, chairman of  the republic's Supreme Soviet, has visited Bardinskiy and  Geranboy [Shaumyanovskiy] rayons.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli] The  powerful attacks launched by Armenia's armed units since 10  April have considerably aggravated the situation in regions of  our republic adjacent to the frontline such as in Terterskiy,  Geramboy, and Bardinskiy.    The visit of Rasul Guliyev, speaker of parliament, to  Bardinskiy and Geranboy rayons was linked to the existing  sociopolitical situation.    During a short meeting at the Bardinskiy Rayon executive  administration, in which Deputy Prime Minister Ali Takhmazov  [name and title as received], and Defense Minister Mamedrafi  Mamedov also took part, the situation in the region was  discussed and the necessary instructions were issued. It became  clear that compared to our fighting sons, the number of  deserters who flee from the frontlines and are engaged in  destructive activity in the cities is not small.    During the meeting at the Geranboy Rayon administration  building, the region's problems were discussed. The necessary  instructions were issued for a speedy solution to the problems.    After familiarizing himself with the refugees' living  conditions in Barda, the chairman of the republic's Supreme  Soviet, Rasul Guliyev said:    [Guliyev] The situation is very grave, because Azerbaijan is  alone in this struggle. We must state this openly and face it.  That is, there is no other state that will give much support to  the Azerbaijan state and people.    You know who is helping the Armenians. This is a known fact.  That is, it is impossible that the Armenian Armed Forces could  be so superior to the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. In my opinion,  this is impossible. Also, the economic potential of the  Armenians does not make it possible for them to wage a prolonged  war against us. But, undoubtedly, there are many who provide  support to the Armenians. Armenia has a powerful diaspora.  Though the Armenians are dispersed all over the world, they  keep in touch with each other. There is a certain uniting party  among the Armenians living outside Armenia and in Armenia. All  these are facts. In addition, there are other forces who  support the Armenians and give them arms and military hardware.    Therefore, Azerbaijan is now in a grave, dangerous  situation.  To be more correct, Azerbaijan has no strength (?now).  Azerbaijan has been in a terribly grave condition for the last  six years. Ways should be sought to extricate ourselves from  this situation. That is, this cannot go on like this for long.    Therefore, my personal efforts of late have been directed at  solving this problem peacefully. And this is how it could be  solved peacefully: There should be a cease-fire, and after that  the Armed Forces of Armenia and Daghlyk-Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh] should withdraw to the present borders of  Daghlyk-Karabakh. That is, they should leave Azerbaijani lands.  After that, a certain zone -- this is known as [words  indistinct] zone -- should be created between the armed forces  of Daghlyk-Karabakh and Azerbaijani Armed Forces. International  observers and international armed forces should be stationed in  this zone.    After this stage, our refugees should return to their own  homes. And, only after that will we start talks on the so-called  status of Daghlyk-Karabakh. I consider this to be the optimal  path because it preserves the [words indistinct]. All these  developments will be completed within 35 to 40 days. That is,  if we begin the cease-fire today, the Armenians must leave our  lands within 35 to 40 days. We are taking steps in this  direction.    [Elikhanbeyli] The chairman of the parliament also met with  the officers and soldiers of the military unit.    [Guliyev] In recent days I was in Moscow. We have to solve  this problem peacefully. We will solve it peacefully. That is,  the war cannot go on for long. The war is having disastrous  consequences for the Azerbaijani people. I am sure that you  will not abandon even an inch of land to the enemy.    [Elikhanbeyli] The head of the parliament returned to Baku  yesterday. [end recording]</p>

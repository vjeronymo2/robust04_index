			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tian Ying: "Inspectors Seek Overseas Ties"] </F>   [Text] Trade inspectors hope to increase ties with foreign  counterparts, officials said yesterday at a national conference  in Beijing.    As a first step, more inspection joint ventures will be set  up nationwide this year, said Tian Runzhi, newly-appointed  director of the State Administration of Import and Export  Commodities Inspection.    This will provide valuable experience and teach management  methods to Chinese inspectors, he said.    The administration also plans to invite foreign experts to  open courses and send Chinese abroad for training.    In addition, more laboratories are to work closer with  Chinese commodity inspection officials to check imported goods.  <H5>  Plans </H5>   Plans also include signing an agreement with Israel and  Russia and a letter-of-intent with UL [Underwriters'  Laboratory], the top inspection body in the United States.    Contacts will also be strengthened with Singapore, the  Republic of Korea, Australia, Japan, Britain, Italy and the  European Community.    Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are also seeking to strengthen  links with the mainland.    Tian said at the conference that Chinese inspection  organizations must continue to reform their operations.    One step will turn several modern labs and research  institutes into independent facilities to check goods and the  property of foreign-funded enterprises.    New inspection sites will also be built in cities and ports  where foreign trade has soared, Tian said.    Inspectors will particularly focus on high-volume export  commodities that cover safety, hygiene and environmental  protection.    And both central and local administrations will continue to  issue licences and hygiene certificates.    According to the Measures for Management of Foreign  Investment and Property Evaluation that went into effect on May  1, officials are required to make objective and accurate  appraisals.    According to Tian, Chinese inspection bureaus last year  inspected 1.37 million import and export shipments valued at  $75.2 billion. About 24,000 were found to be subpar, about half  of which were for export.    The bureau said raw oil, steel, iron, digital watches,  computers and cameras exported by Chinese companies passed  inspection.    Among imports, all toys, washing-machines, edible oil and  vacuum cleaners passed quality checks.</p>

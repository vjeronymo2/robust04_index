			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Huang Zhiling from the "Opinion" page: "Hi-tech </F> Imports Safeguarded by State Patent Law"]    [Text] Strict measures are needed to prevent intellectual  fraud of technological imports, said an official from the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).    China started drafting laws on intellectual property  protection at the advent of reform in 1979, said Zhao Chunhua,  deputy director of MOFTEC's Department of Science and Technology.    A Trademark Law became effective in 1982, a Patent Law in  1984, a Copyright Law in 1991 and an Anti-Unethical Competition  Law in 1993.    Marking the advent of China's legal system on intellectual  property, the four laws also provide a legal basis for  protecting intellectual property of imported technology.    If the supplier fails to provide sufficient proof of holding  the rights of that patented technology, it will be banned from  entering China--even if this would mean the loss of potentially  huge profits, Zhao said.    Before importing any patented foreign technology, the  Chinese  recipient is required to sign a contract with the foreign  supplier specifying the scope and duration of the use of the  technology.    The move is aimed at preventing proliferation of the use of  the patented foreign technology, said Zhao.    Since secrecy is all important to technological advantage, a  foreign supplier is allowed to impose reasonable restrictions on  people who have access to the technological know-how, and place  reasonable restrictions on areas where products made with that  know-how are sold, said Zhao.    Computer software is of particular concern in this regard.    Protection of computer software is included in the Copyright  Law. And in 1991, the more specific Regulations on Computer  Software Protection were passed.    In recent years, the licensed trade volume of computer  software has increased around the world. China's trade volume  in computer software has soared beyond several hundred million  dollars.    In computer software import, China permits foreign software  owners to register their own accord in computer software  registration and management centres in China.    Prohibition and punishment will result from pirating foreign  computer software, said Zhao.    If disputes over intellectual property arise over imported  technology, the two parties concerned should first try to  negotiate an amicable settlement themselves.    "If negotiations fail," Zhao said, "they may request  arbitration, or start legal proceedings in the intellectual  property divisions of Chinese courts."    Last July, the Beijing Higher People's Court and the Beijing  Intermediate People's Court set up China's first intellectual  property divisions in their courts.    Five provinces and eight cities have followed Beijing's  example by establishing special courts to deal with legal  proceedings arising from intellectual property disputes.    Between 1986 and 1993, the courts handled over 3,500 cases  of  intellectual property violation. Of these, 1,783 involved  patent rights, 1,168 copyrights and 554 trademarks.    According to Zhao, a Sino-U.S. negotiation agency has been  set up under the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade.    "The agency provides a place where disputes pertaining to  intellectual property are mediated regularly, thus playing a  role in settling disputes over intellectual property between the  two countries," said Zhao.    In recent years, China has witnessed a rapid expansion of  imported technology.    Disputes regarding intellectual property did arise in the  course. But the disputes were few in number, and were settled  through negotiations, said Zhao.    To improve protection of intellectual property in technology  imports, authorities concerned are drafting Regulations on  Technology Imports and Exports of the People's Republic of China.    The regulations are aimed at bringing technology trade  closer  to international conventions, said Zhao.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- A senior leader from a  mainland non-governmental organization sent a letter Thursday  [17 June] to his counterpart in Taiwan, expressing hopes to meet  again soon with the head of the Taiwan-based organization.    Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), based on the mainland, wrote  to Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the board and secretary general of  the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), saying that  the latest developments in relations across the straits called  for an urgent meeting between the two organizations.    Wang said that the contacts between them would help further  increase understanding, remove misunderstandings, overcome  differences and promote cooperation.    The proposed talks, he said, could explore ways to forge  closer contacts and expand cooperation. Wang proposed that they  should meet in Taipei, or elsewhere if Ku prefers. Wang  recalled that in a letter earlier this year he had invited Ku to  Beijing for talks in late spring or early summer, and that  sources then said that Ku would be happy to meet Wang on the  mainland. Ku also wrote recently in an article expressing his  wish to strengthen contacts.    In his letter, Wang said that the Wang-Ku talks a year ago  had ushered in an important historical step in the development  of relations across the straits, adding that exchanges in  various sectors have been developing vigorously, marking the  progress made in the five talks to settle the remaining issues  in the agreements reached between Wang and Ku during their talks  in Singapore.    Wang especially noted that the talks between Tang Shubei and  Chiao Jen-ho early this year had reached a high degree of common  understanding concerning talks on routine issues, and had  drafted an outline for this year's talks between the two  organisations.    He said the relations across the straits had been affected  by  the Qiandao Lake tragedy which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan  tourists. But Wang spoke highly of Ku's positive and rational  stand to safeguard the relations across the straits.    "Amidst the rumors and misunderstandings, we should  intensify  our efforts to push ahead with the talks and exchanges between  the two sides," Wang wrote.    This would be in line with the original intention and would  consolidate the achievements already made, and therefore calls  for talks between high-ranking leaders of the ARATS and SEF as  soon as possible, Wang added.</p>

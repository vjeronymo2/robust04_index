			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cadastre: Serb Soldiers Deep Inside </F> Republic of Macedonia Territory"]    [Text] The Serbian soldiers who have taken positions on  the strategic peak Straza, with an altitude of 1,703 meters, in  the locality of Cupino Brdo, near Kriva Palanka, have penetrated  between 550 and 600 meters into the territory of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].  This can be concluded from the cadastre of the Kriva Palanka  Geodesy administration. The sketches of this region, according  to the Kriva Palanka Geodesy administration, were made in 1967,  and processed in 1968.    According to these sketches, that is, the one from the  cadastre county of Luke, of the Kriva Palanka local assembly,  the peak Straza, with [words indistinct] elevations at 1,702 and  1,703.5 meters above sea level, is at a distance of 550 meters  air line from the neighboring cadastre county of Surdulica,  which is on FRY territory.    Today's VECER writes that there is still no official  information as to what is happening on the peak Straza and when  the Serbian soldiers came there. It is found out that the  members of the Macedonian Army, who control the border region,  have sent information to the Defense Ministry, however, it has  still not been officially issued.    There are some assumptions that the Serbian soldiers have  been at these positions for about a month, and they were first  noticed by the villagers from Podrzikonj and Luke, who were not  allowed by the Serbian soldiers to approach their land parcels,  which are in the immediate vicinity of the border. After the  news about the Serbian positions on Macedonian territory, NATO  observation patrols, made up of U.S. soldiers, stationed  themselves near the Macedonian Army camp, two days ago, and  their intention is to stay in this volatile region for a while.</p>

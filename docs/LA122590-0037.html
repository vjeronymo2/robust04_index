			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLUTIONS TO A CHRISTMAS DILEMMA  </P> <P> The answer to "What can non-Christian children do?" is enjoy the festival and  join in the fun.  </P> <P> We enjoyed all cultural festivals held in the streets of New York. The same  enjoyment should apply in the schools. The Oktoberfest, Chinese New Year, Mardi  Gras, Italian, Greek, Irish, etc., all festivals should be respected, preserved  and enjoyed in America. People spend thousands of dollars and time their  vacations to coincide with foreign festivals. We are lucky, we have them in our  own back yard.  </P> <P> EDWARD COLLINS, Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Dial 'C' for customers - A food supplier who found clients in the Yellow pages 'I STARTED with only a domestic fridge and a freezer in my own home. I had a copy of the Yellow Pages, hired a mobile telephone, and drove around, looking for customers. In the first week, my turnover was Pounds 439.' That was the start, back in October, 1989, of Ian McFarlane's entry into the food business. Since then, his company, selling chilled victuals to hotels, restaurants and delicatessens has notched up sales of Pounds 225,000 in its second full year. While McFarlane's salary remains modest, and the business's overall profit margin a skimpy 10 per cent, Glendower Foods has supplied the 25-year-old with a new career. 'I trained in hotel management and was working for a surveying company in the City valuing hotels,' McFarlane said. 'The company has gone out of business, but I left it before then. I got bored.' Someone advised him that a niche existed supplying smoked salmon. A trader at London's Billingsgate fish market generously gave McFarlane the name of his Scottish supplier. Pounds 300 purchased the fridge and freezer. McFarlane realised straightaway that a 30 per cent margin was available, selling the fish. Within a month, he also realised that the advice was duff. The niche was minnow-sized, too small to supply a living. Subsequent events only confirmed this. 'So many people are smoking salmon, the market is flooded. The whole thing has been blown apart. Margins on fresh salmon are also very tight, partly because the Norwegians are dumping.' Operating then from a flat in a village outside Oxford, McFarlane began adding frozen prawns and home-made cakes. Last year, Glendower Foods moved into a small retail building in the beautiful village of Ardington, near Didcot, and, this year, to a 1,000-square-foot unit in the same village. Its handsome inventory of products - encapsulated in a bound 'menu' with coloured pictures - now includes pate and marinated goat's cheese, duck breasts and foie gras, Spanish sausages and gravad lax, as well as cooking chocolate, oils, vinegars, ice-cream and yoghurts. 'Turnover this year will be just short of Pounds 500,000. We would hope, within the next two years or so, to get up to Pounds 1m or more.' Glendower offers about 500 different foods, uses 40 suppliers, and has 150 or so regular customers. Hotels take up to 70 per cent of supplies, restaurants a further 15 per cent, and delis a similar amount. McFarlane runs the business from a small office, using an IBM computer purchased for Pounds 2,600, and a Pounds 400 fax. There is a staff of three. 'Each one has a particular set of customers. It's very important to keep personal contacts. Most customers will be visited at least three times a year.' The village is part of the Lockinge Estate, from which Glendower rents the property for Pounds 6,250 a year on a nine-year lease. McFarlane has spent Pounds 8,000 on three walk-in freezer and cooler units. A Mercedes delivery van cost Pounds 12,000, with a further Pounds 6,000 absorbed in the conversion of it to a freezer vehicle. The company also runs a second van. During its first year, Glendower generated a gross return of 29 per cent and a pre-tax profit return of 16.5 per cent. Since then, expansion of the business - done without any real recourse to the banks - depressed margins to 10 per cent. Last year, it made a gross profit of Pounds 66,000 on its turnover of Pounds 225,000, and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 22,000. McFarlane expects a pre-tax return of less than 10 per cent again this year. His salary was Pounds 13,600 last year. Net profits have also been hurt by the general trading climate. McFarlane says: 'All chefs are being told by their food and beverage managers to 'hit targets or you are out'. They have become much more aggressive at getting in products at good prices.' The average restaurant gross margin of selling food at the dining table to buying it in is 60 to 68 per cent. He is still extracting customers from Yellow Pages and hotel and restaurant guides, as well as by cold calling. 'One of the worst things about the business is that you do lose customers to other suppliers. We used to get customers on price, but I think we now sell on customer service.' As an example of what it sells, Glendower offers, excluding VAT, a four-litre tub of raspberry and rhubarb ice-cream for Pounds 7.25, sliced side of smoked salmon at Pounds 7 a pound, and 250 grammes of Jersey-milk Bonchester cheese for Pounds 3.40. Glendower is also the local distributor for New Covent Garden soups. McFarlane says the company suffers almost no food wastage. Some items, like fresh fish, usually leave his premises the day after they are delivered. As with so many businesses, though, the owner of Glendower has never been on a business course. 'My biggest drawback is that I have struggled to find things out because I've never worked in distribution before. You know - where to get supplies, what margins to seek. I've learned on the hoof. The most difficult thing is knowing when to take a risk. Bringing into the business someone new, or buying a van, can each cost Pounds 20,000.' One point McFarlane is already conscious of is what to do with the business if its sales start climbing towards Pounds 2m. 'You think you could sell it and that would relieve you of all the problems associated with expansion. I've got the feeling, though, that I'll stick with it.'

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commonwealth regulation establishes HC, CO, and CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  pass/fail exhaust standards for the idle test procedure for each applicable model year and vehicle type. The idle exhaust standards adopted by the Commonwealth conform to EPA established standards and are approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pennsylvania regulation applies one set of start-up transient emission standards and two sets of permanent transient emission standards for all vehicle types, i.e. LDGT, LDGT1, LDGT2 and Tier 1 vehicles. The Commonwealth regulation fails to provide Phase 2 standards for all vehicle types and model years. The net result of this is that the Commonwealth emission standards that apply to LDGT1 and LDGT2 vehicles are more stringent than federal requirement, which is approvable; however, the Commonwealth emission standards applied to Tier 1 vehicles in the Commonwealth's regulation do not meet the minimum federal requirements. The SIP states that the Commonwealth will be amending their regulation to replace the existing standards with the standards found in the July 1993 version of the EPA I/M document referenced above and further states that the changes can be accomplished by the end of calendar year 1994. EPA interprets this language as a commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to amend the Commonwealth's regulation by December 31, 1994 to incorporate the emission standards from the EPA document. Since the release of the July version of the EPA document, a final version, dated April 1994, has been released which contains minor changes from the July 1993 version. EPA believes that the Commonwealth can incorporate the minor changes from the final version into their regulation amendments. EPA is proposing to find that the test standard requirements of the federal regulation are satisfied based on the condition that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the amended Commonwealth's regulation incorporating the Tier 1 and Phase 2 emission standards from the final version of EPA I/M document referenced above. EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to revise its regulations consistent with this finding. The effective date of these regulation amendments must coincide with the start date of the enhanced I/M program. If the Commonwealth fails to fulfill this condition by December 31, 1994, EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to promulgate the test procedures and related requirements found in the final version of the EPA I/M document referenced above as official I/M tests in part 85 of the CFR. Any changes made during the rulemaking process, which EPA believes would be minimal, should also be made in the Pennsylvania regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commonwealth regulation establishes evaporative purge and pressure test standards which conform to EPA established standards and are approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pennsylvania regulation provides start-up emission standards for the transient test that apply during calendar year 1995 and 1996. The schedule for implementation of these start-up emission standards is approvable. The Pennsylvania regulation provides for two sets of permanent emission standards for the transient test, one set which applies from 1997 through 2001 and the second set which applies in calendar year 2002 and on. The schedule for implementation of the permanent standards is approvable and was used in the performance standard modeling demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commonwealth's regulation also requires vehicles that have been altered from their original certified configuration (i.e. engine or fuel switching) to be tested in the same manner as other subject vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Test Equipment_40 CFR Part 51.358  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Computerized test systems are required for performing any measurement on subject vehicles. The federal I/M regulation requires that the state SIP submittal include written technical specifications for all test equipment used in the program. The specifications shall describe the emission analysis process, the necessary test equipment, the required features, and written acceptance testing criteria and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Shapovalov "Commentary": "Russia-United States: </F> Time To Call a Time-Out?"]    [Text] At first glance, the "case" of Mr. and Mrs. Ames,  who allegedly worked first for the Soviet Union and then for  Russia, is taking a sinister turn. Panic even has begun to  loom: A rupture in American-Russian relations is said to be  inevitable.    The development of events has indeed taken a dangerous turn.  James Morrris, counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (he is a  representative of the CIA, don't be surprised -- Moscow and  Washington have reached an accord whereby they don't keep secret  who the chief representatives of their special services are) has  been officially declared persona non grata.    But why actually has such a furor been created? Have Russia  and the United States really reached an accord that the two  sides stop intelligence activity? Nothing of the kind.  Moreover, the calls to intensify such activity in relation to  Russia and to give it priority status are growing in Congress.  Nor does the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service  [FIS] hide the fact that it too is engaged in such work -- not  with the aim of undermining the United States (the political  intelligence service is scarcely up to that) but out of a desire  to learn what the trends are on the banks of the Potomac, who  wants Russia to fall apart and who wants it to remain intact,  and who is trying to play the Ukrainian or other cards. For its  part, the United States takes an interest in what is being done  in our country and which parties and forces are seeking power.    The Americans advance the argument that the Ames' presence  in  the CIA has undermined U.S. security. Excuse me, but, given  that Aldrich was recruiting agents in Russia, whose security is  actually at stake here?    However, once the "case" of the Ames couple had blown up it  immediately began to retreat into the background. Something  quite different began to predominate. Unhappy that Russia had  taken the initiative in resolving the Bosnian crisis, some  people began grumbling: Look, the Russian bear is awaking  again. At the same time a broad hint was dropped: The United  States is a country which has not just special commitments but  also special rights in the world. And Russia meanwhile should  not conduct intelligence activity in the States, it should not  engage in intelligence at all. In general, as you can see, we  have back-to-front logic here. True, you do also hear in the  United States the voices of people like, for example, ex-CIA  Director William Colby, who take a realistic and sensible line.  But the problem is that they are immediately put down for  allegedly acting unpatriotically.    Clearly, the position of those people in the United States  ready to blame the Clinton administration for having recklessly  and naively expanded relations with Russia is strengthening.  Now the "case" of the Ames couple has become known it is  necessary to correct the mistakes made, that is to say, call a  time-out in relations with Russia. It is essential to take a  closer look at what is happening over there.    Being gentlemen, Russian intelligence officers appreciate  that the CIA (professional solidarity is no doubt in play here)  is now experiencing a psychological trauma, being under strong  pressure from the FBI, the legislative bodies, and, finally, the  taxpayers (we pay our money in and it then ends up in the  pockets of traitors). Preserving a sense of tact, CIA Director  James Woolsey is seeking not to fuel the situation. But certain  circles in the United States are very persistent and are  inclined perhaps to revive elements characteristic of the period  of confrontation and to shift purely professional questions (the  questions of the special services) into the sphere of state  relations.    The Russian FIS rejects any gloating whatsoever over the  situation in which CIA staffers find themselves and is ready to  engage in dialogue and discussion on these painful issues. It  is no secret that there is a lot the Americans don't like about  current practice, but their Russian counterparts have their own  complaints too. It is well known, in particular, that the  bugging of Russian Federation representatives has not stopped.  V. Bakatin handed over important documents to the American  side, but nothing has been received in return to date. The  intensive recruiting of Russian citizens by the U.S. special  services also disturbs Moscow.    In short, both the Russian FIS and the CIA favor  cooperation,  but cooperation with necessary consideration of national  interests. They favor cooperation on an equal footing. This  has to be a two-way street. Any other approach is tantamount to  requiring the other side to surrender its position while  allegedly on a level playing field.</p>

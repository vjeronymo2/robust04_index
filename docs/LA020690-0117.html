			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ATTENTION: President Bush's proposed U.S. troop reduction in Europe, which came  up in budget hearings Monday (A4), may have less impact on military recruiting  in Orange County than elsewhere. . . . There were just over 1,000 regular Army  and reserve enlistments here in 1989. . . . A bigger draw than a guaranteed  posting in Europe, local recruiters say, is the Army's college fund, which can  yield $25,000 in tax-free tuition for four years of service.

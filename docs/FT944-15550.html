			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Accountants need to be 'proactive' - Legal Briefs Accountants need to be more proactive in the services they provide to lawyers. This is the finding of a survey of law firms by accountants Baker Tilley and The Lawyer magazine. Lawyers do not rate the financial advice they receive from accountants very highly, with only 43 per cent of respondents considering it to be good or excellent. A number of firms said accountancy documents were too technical and should be simpler and more precise. Lawyers are also unhappy at the level of fees charged by accountants. More than 30 per cent of respondents thought these were high or very high. According to Baker Tilley, this is 'a surprisingly high statistic from a profession which operates a similar fee structure'.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> A Detroit judge ordered former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin to jail  because he showed up five hours late for a hearing. Ruffin, who was in court on  a probation violation charge, was scheduled for a 9 a.m. hearing Monday, but  when Ruffin, 48, arrived just before 2 p.m., the judge ordered Ruffin to spend  the night in jail. Monday's hearing was scheduled to decide whether Ruffin  should undergo drug treatment instead of serving a jail sentence after a drug  test last week was positive for opiates. Ruffin, 48, was convicted in May,  1988, for misdemeanor possession of cocaine. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM  </P> <P> With the Administration having put another $300 billion defense budget on the  table, it is both frightening and humiliating to realize that we can't protect  one Marine lieutenant colonel from a gang of thugs. What is the use of  strategic and tactical weapons and planning for their use if the real threat is  by terrorists against individual citizens. Are the decision-makers (a term I  use in only its broadest sense) so enamored by our own technology that we place  so little value on individuals?  </P> <P> I wonder if Lt. Col. Higgins thought about B-2s or cruise missiles as he was  about to be hanged. If the government feels it's in our best interest to  participate in a game played out in a corner of the world where ICBMs, SLBMs  and financial diplomacy mean nothing, I think it's about time that we learn to  play by the rules of the game. The alternative is the status quo: Our $300  billion a year defense system undone by $2 worth of rope and a video camera.  </P> <P> TOM MOUREAU  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ** 1/2 "THE RISE OF NENEH CHERRY" NENEH CHERRY BMG VIDEO VIDEOCASSETTE  ($16.98): A PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED LASER DISCS, BOOKS AND  VIDEOCASSETTES. RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC.)  </P> <P> This is everything you ever wanted to know about Cherry, who emerged last year  as a promising soul singer and rapper -- plus a whole lot you didn't want to  know.  </P> <P> While a welcome change from simple clip compilations that offer no extras, this  65-minute video verges on information overload -- trivial information. Do you  really want to see her being made up for photo sessions or exchanging inanities  with adoring fans during radio station chats? The behind-the scenes footage,  while occassionally amusing, is self-serving. Surprisingly, the performance  segments, featuring songs like her hit "Buffalo Stance" and "Inner City Mama,"  aren't the main focus. That may have been a wise decision, because Cherry seems  to have limited talent. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

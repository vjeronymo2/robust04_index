			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] China's coal industry is growing at the fastest rate  in the 14 years of the nation's economic reform, according to an  article in the January 3 issue of PEOPLE's daily by Wang Senhao,  Minister of the Coal Industry.    In his article, Wang offered his ideas on how to remodel the  industry for the market economy.    The output of raw coal increased from 618 million tons in  1978 to 1.11 billion tons in 1992, an average annual rise of  about 35.5 million tons. The hefty increase has ensured a  relatively good supply of coal for the nation.    Advanced coal-mining technologies have also been introduced.  The mechanization of mining rose from 33 percent in 1978 to 72  percent in 1992.    The coal industry, a pillar of the economy, was hamstrung  under the central planning system, Wang said. Laden with the  problems created by a planned economy, the industry is finding  it difficult to gear itself up for a free market.    An excess of workers in State coal mines has resulted in  inefficiency and deficits. The major mines, which together  produce 480 million tons, employ 3.6 million people, far above  the world average staffing level.    Furthermore, the railroads cannot meet the demands of rising  coal production.    Wang recommends a comprehensive development strategy for the  industry that would invite investment from abroad and other  sectors of the country's economy.    The central government has set a target of producing 1.5  billion tons of coal by the year 2000.    That means China must raise production by about 400 million  tons in the next six years.    "It will be a very tough task to achieve the goal," Wang  said.    Wang called for investment through various channels such as  the power, chemical, railway and metallurgical industries.  Meanwhile, the central government should continue increasing its  investment in developing major coal mines. Collectively-owned  mines in townships should also be encouraged, Wang said.    China should also try to attract foreign investors to help  develop coal mines in China.    Wang suggested that coal producers be encouraged to set up  their own processing firms or power stations to alleviate the  pressure on railroads. This could help coal producing firms  integrate themselves into the market economy.    Unbalanced distribution combined with central planning  helped  turn coal-rich Northwest China into a major producer and  exporter. The number of employees continued to increase even as  mines were exhausted, and the result was inefficiency.    The coal industry must be updated. Employees of mining  enterprises must be put to better use and surplus workers  allowed to enter the service industry, Wang said. Sideline  businesses may help lift coal mines out of their quandary.    A responsibility system or a shareholding system should be  introduced in some profitable coal enterprises. This may help  extricate them from the rigid control of government, Wang said.  Those producers not included should also try to improve their  management.    Wang held that China should increase its exports of coal.  The  nation exported 20 million tons of coal in 1992, only 1.8  percent of its output. He attributed the meagre exports to the  monopoly of the China National Coal Import and Export  Corporation.    As a remedy, Wang said coal producers, especially the major  ones, should gradually be allowed to export their products  directly. Wang recommended establishing a China Chamber of  Commerce of Coal Import and Export to take charge of export  policy-making and other tasks such as setting the minimum prices  and price fluctuation ranges.    In addition, the chamber of commerce could collect data from  the international market and study the management of domestic  producers to help improve efficiency.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A SHORT HISTORY OF DIETARY HABITS OF U.S. PRESIDENTS  </P> <P> This is a story about politics and pork rinds. Government and grapes. The  history of the U.S. presidency bulges with interesting tales about the food  that fueled our country's chief executives.  </P> <P> If you thought that nutrition was the brainchild of the 1980s, you'll be  surprised to learn that President James Garfield popularized the term more than  100 years ago. Somebody had to do it. The two previous Administrations served  almost as many courses at state dinners as there were stars on the flag. A  typical menu wallowed in thick sauces, rich desserts and enough foreign words  to open a language school.  </P> <P> When Garfield took office, he insisted on simple, wholesome food. Guests sat  down to such basic, no-nonsense fare as "Mrs. Garfield's White Loaf Bread" and  "Extra-Fluffy Mashed Potatoes." Garfield's tenure lasted only a few months;  given a chance, he might have started the oat bran fad early.  </P> <P> Our country has a long, if misguided, tradition of equating rich dishes with  elegant dining. It is probably not any President's fault that when we cook for  company, we add whipping cream to everything but the roast. Still, some popular  notions about entertaining date back to a time when the White House led the  social scene.  </P> <P> Presidential styles vary, but a heavy entertaining schedule seems to come with  the territory. When George Washington was President, he held a reception every  Tuesday, a congressional dinner each Thursday and frequent state banquets. On  Friday nights, his wife, Martha, took over the drawing room for yet another  gathering. Refreshments or meals were served at all these events.  </P> <P> Away from the demands of their public host role, our Presidents have been  individuals with diverse palates and a varying commitment to good health. Some  rode horses or took brisk walks each morning. Others exercised most vigorously  with a knife and fork.  </P> <P> Like many people of their time, William and Ida McKinley believed in getting  the day off to a substantial start. Large portions of eggs, hot breads,  potatoes, steak or chops, fish, fruit and coffee were standard morning fare. In  "The Presidents' Cookbook," researchers Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks say  lunch and dinner at the McKinleys ran the rather short gamut from abundant to  Gargantuan.  </P> <P> William Howard Taft weighed 332 pounds at his inauguration. Between enormous  meals, he nibbled salted almonds. Under doctor's orders to reduce his daily  breakfast steak from 12 ounces to eight, Taft complied . . . when his wife was  there to watch him.  </P> <P> Of course, then as now, diet was just one part of a President's life style.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to compare other ages," said Dr. John LaRosa, dean of clinical  affairs at George Washington University's Medical School. "People lived  differently. They walked more, and fewer people in the upper classes smoked  cigarettes. The impact of a high-cholesterol diet may have been different." In  fact, the rate of heart disease was actually lower, he says.  </P> <P> Not since Thomas Jefferson introduced waffles and ice cream has any President  intentionally raised eating to the level of a real issue. However, historians  have retained enough tidbits about presidential diet to rate a separate  category on "Jeopardy." Would-be contestants interested in boning up are  referred to "The Presidents' Cookbook" and "The First Ladies Cook Book," with  historical text by Margaret Klapthor Brown.  </P> <P> For example:  </P> <P> Calvin Coolidge kept crackers and preserves at his elbow for a convenient  snack.  </P> <P> James Buchanan liked grapes so much that he tended an arbor at the White House.  </P> <P> Zachary Taylor's three favorite foods were fried oysters, stewed oysters and  roasted oysters.  </P> <P> Ulysses S. Grant once said: "I refuse to eat anything that goes about on two  legs."  </P> <P> As executive chef for five recent presidents, Henry Haller found modern first  families to be weight-conscious and open to nutritional advice. When  interviewed for an article in Weight Watchers Magazine, Haller identified a  dilemma many less-famous cooks will recognize: removing the sodium and fat from  favorite dishes without making them taste like recipe cards.  </P> <P> Haller succeeded by seasoning with herbs instead of salt and substituting  low-fat ingredients wherever possible. That meant using bouillon instead of  cream in chipped beef for Lyndon Johnson, who topped his Western salad with  low-calorie dressing when dining privately.  </P> <P> LBJ's hearty Texas appetite got the better of him at times. The Johnsons'  family cook, Zephyr Wright, is said to have left a note under LBJ's plate: "Eat  what I put in front of you, and don't ask for any more, and don't complain."  </P> <P> From Southern fried chicken for the Carters to light, California cuisine for  the Reagans, menus reflected regional tastes during Haller's 21 years on the  job. The American palate expanded accordingly. When you think about  presidential influence, consider how many more people now know that okra is  something you can eat.  </P> <P> Even before there was scientific evidence to back him up, Jefferson attributed  his long life to eating many vegetables and little animal fat. One person's  health doesn't constitute proof, but studies of whole populations suggest that  diet contributes to the clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks. It  turns out that this forefather knew best.  </P> <P> So how about those pork rinds, the twice-fried munchie that President Bush made  famous?  </P> <P> "It's OK to eat almost anything if the quantity doesn't break the bank as far  as total intake of fat and cholesterol goes," LaRosa said. "You have to  consider the total diet, not just one snack."  </P></p>

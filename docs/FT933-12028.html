			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / London's tax burden criticised LONDONERS AND those working in London pay Pounds 8bn a year more in taxes than is spent by central and local government in the capital, according to a report to be published on Friday by the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City of London. The report, by Professor Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says that the transfer of resources out of London on such a scale will reduce the rate of growth in the UK economy. The findings will provide further ammunition for businesses and London pressure groups campaigning for more of the taxes paid in London to be ploughed back into the capital's economy through an increase in public investment in transport infrastructure. The report says that investment in transport projects such as the modernisation of the London Underground would increase GDP more than if the same amounts were spent on social and other programmes elsewhere in the UK. All countries have parts that are more prosperous than others and make a net contribution to public finances, the report says. The contribution made by London is unusually large, however. By adding to business costs it will damage London's economic prospects in competing with other European cities as a financial centre. That, it is argued, will reduce the rate of growth in the rest of the economy, which is heavily reliant on London's prosperity. The report says nearly 3m jobs outside London depend wholly or partly on supplying the capital. The report says that if greater London were an independent state its GDP would be more than Pounds 70bn - larger than four EC member states and comparable with that of Hong Kong. It would also have a healthy trade surplus. Exports of goods and services to the rest of the UK and the world exceeded imports by Pounds 10.6bn in 1989. 'In broad terms, London's economy is based on services, a high proportion of which is exported,' said Prof McWilliams. 'It largely consumes manufactured goods, a high proportion of which is imported.' The fact that taxes paid have exceeded public expenditure in the capital for decades is partly because people working in London have higher earnings. The average job in London generates 43 per cent more income-based tax than the average job in the UK. Current public spending in London in relation to GDP is only 74 per cent of the national average, however. Prof McWilliams says this is because much of public spending goes on social support and relatively little on supporting business. The report says: 'Without the London contribution, the UK public sector borrowing requirement would be 10.6 per cent of non-London GDP - higher than any other OECD country other than Italy.'

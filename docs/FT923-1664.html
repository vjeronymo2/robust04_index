			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: HSBC plans changes at top - Purves to step down as chief executive but retain chairmanship A NEW chief executive officer for HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland Bank, is likely be appointed early in the New Year, Hongkong Bank said yesterday. 60-year-old Mr William Purves, currently chairman and chief executive, will relinquish day-to-day management of the group while retaining the post of executive chairman, he indicated in an interview with the South China Morning Post yesterday. The front runners for the group chief executive position are all Hongkong Bank men and hold positions on the bank's 'policy unit', or executive management board. The two front-runners appear to be Mr John Bond, executive director for the Americas, who is considered the front runner inside the bank after turning around Marine Midland, the group's formerly ailing US subsidiary, and Mr Paul Selway-Swift, who is responsible for the group's operations in Hong Kong and China and was promoted to the main board earlier this summer. Mr Bernard Asher, executive director of capital markets, and Mr John Strickland, executive director in charge of information technology, are also possibilities. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, while highly rated personally by Mr Purves, is considered as a remote outsider, partly because of his age, but also because Midland is seen as the junior partner in the merger of the two groups. It was a condition of Bank of England approval for Hongkong Bank's takeover of Midland that senior HSBC management be resident in London. Timing of the management shuffle is linked to a change in HSBC's tax residency; the group becomes a UK tax resident on January 1. Mr Purves, who does not move to London until August or September next year, will stay on as executive chairman during the transition period. He has said he will serve in that role thereafter for as long as the board of the bank deems fit. It is expected that Mr Purves will hold the chairmanship of HSBC for some years to come. In his interview with the Post, Mr Purves said the merger with Midland was going 'remarkably well'. He said a great deal had been achieved in a short time but that a lot remained to be done at Midland where Mr Pearse was 'getting on well with it'. 'We have a policy of delegating responsibility to individuals depending on experience,' he said. 'The bank is not run by committees. This is something that is a change for Midland. There were many more committees and many more committee decisions were being made in Midland than we had. 'But I think they are welcoming the change. I think Mr Pearse himself is not a great committee man.'</p>

Razakov, director of the State Committee for National  Security press service; place and date not given: "Military  Counterintelligence in Kyrgyzstan. What Does It Do?"]    [Text] The Directorate of Military  Counterintelligence was organized for the first time in the  State Committee for National Security [GKNB] of the Republic of  Kyrgyzstan a little more than a year ago. Considering that one  frequently hears talk of late regarding an alleged increase in  the staff of employees of the security organs, we decided to  meet with Colonel Madalbek Moldashev, chief of the GKNB  Directorate of Military Counterintelligence.    [Razakov] Madalbek Moldashevich, as we know, there was a  counterintelligence subunit in the system of the USSR KGB for a  long time, and now there is one in the republic GKNB. What  prompted the creation of yet another structure: the Directorate  of Military Counterintelligence.    [Moldashev] The disintegration of the former USSR forced a  reexamination of the problems of guaranteeing the national  security of each of the republics. In addition, the  military-political situation, the operational situation, the  condition of the economy, and strategic tasks for strengthening  the territorial integrity and independence of the state were  taken into account.    Previously in the USSR Armed Forces, work was conducted in a  centralized way by special departments that were directly  subordinate to the USSR KGB. There were no military  counterintelligence organs in the KGB structures of the former  Union republics.    The formation by each of the republics of their own Armed  Forces made it necessary for all national intelligence services  to revise the concept of guaranteeing state security as a whole  and to establish their own structures of military  counterintelligence organs. By a decision of the government, the  Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of the GKNB was  organized in August last year.    [Razakov] Is this a concession to fashion and a copying of  the activity of near and distant neighbors, or is it a search  for new positions in the structure of the GKNB?    [Moldashev] In the period of the division of the USSR Armed  Forces into national forces and the disintegration of the USSR  KGB (1990-1992), for a number of subjective and objective  reasons the activity of counterintelligence organs on the  territory of the former Union republics practically stopped, and  in individual cases their work was of a formal nature. Military  counterintelligence personnel, like many army servicemen, were  engaged only in arranging personal matters, and began to leave  Kyrgyzstan in a massive way. A situation of lack of control  developed in military units and subunits, and even  permissiveness in some places.    In such a situation, our "talented" compatriots quickly  devised (with the active participation of high-ranking military  chiefs and representatives of the shadow economy) a clever  mechanism for the sale of military equipment, theft and  appropriation of weapons and ammunition, sale of military  property at cheap prices, and the transport of material  valuables outside the republic's boundaries. Abuse of service  position became a daily occurrence. Military discipline fell  sharply. The situation in the army environment heated up because  of failure to resolve social and everyday problems. The danger  of the emergence of groups of lawbreakers among servicemen and  their getting together with organized crime increased.    Moreover, the newly created armed forces of a sovereign  republic should be reliably guarded against the subversive  activity of foreign intelligence services, criminal  encroachments, and also from the involvement of servicemen in  antistate and antisocial activity.    [Razakov] Could you briefly disclose the mechanism of thefts  and abuses in the army?    [Moldashev] The arsenal of methods used is very broad. In  particular, in the period indicated above about 200 units of  various kinds of army motor vehicles were sold to private  persons and cooperative enterprises. Fake documents, invalid  stamps, and figurehead persons were employed, new vehicles were  written off as obsolete ahead of time, there was registration  only of documents--given the absence of the motor vehicles  themselves, accounting data was artificially muddled up, record  and accounting documents were destroyed ahead of schedule, etc.    Semiautomatic combat weapons with ammunition were sold at a  symbolic price to military and civilian persons who quickly  became members of a hunting society.    Servicemen were sent on so-called official business outside  the republic on service motor vehicles and transported stolen  military property on the way using the pretext that it was  household goods, and the vehicle was lost without a trace in the  vast expanse of a previously united fatherland.    [Razakov] But will military counterintelligence not replace  organs of the MVD or the military procurator?    [Moldashev] In no way. On the whole, counterintelligence is  intended to give warning of and prevent state crimes in military  units and formations placed by legislation of the republic  within the purview of organs of national security, and it does  not duplicate the functions of either command elements, the  procuracy, or the militia.    We cooperate closely with the aforementioned organs in the  course of preliminary inquiry as well as in investigations. For  example, in December last year in Bishkek a motor vehicle was  blown up with the participation of a serviceman; one person was  killed and a second incurred serious injuries. Organs of  military counterintelligence, the MVD, GKNB subunits, and the  military procuracy joined in the operational investigation and  the legal procedure measures, which produced positive results.    This kind of "tandem" in activity, in which each side worked  out its own questions, is a frequent practice in the  investigation of stolen or seized weapons, in the prevention of  illegal exports of material valuables, etc.    [Razakov] Could you shed light on the "main thrust" of the  directorate that you manage?    [Moldashev] It is obvious that all the negative processes  that occur in society are reflected in the armed forces as if in  a mirror. Among servicemen (considering the self-discipline,  access to armaments, combat qualifications, low material level,  domestic disorder, and other factors), social problems take on a  special acuteness, which representatives of the crime-conducive  environment attempt to exploit.    In comparison with the "so-called stagnation period,"  interest on the part of individual persons in combat arms,  ammunition, and equipment has constantly increased inasmuch as  they are becoming not only a weapon of violence but also a  subject of profit. In contrast to past years of armed conflict  in Tajikistan, the Caucasus has increased the demand for army  equipment, and "hunter-gatherers" from these regions have become  frequent. Therefore, we are undertaking all measures to erect  barriers on the probable routes of thefts, seizures, losses,  sales, and illegal exports of weapons, munitions, and equipment.    The ever-increasing flow of incoming drugs represents a  great  danger for the army in connection with a weakening of the regime  of protection of the Afghan-Tajik border. The timely blocking of  drug entry and distribution channels is one of our urgent tasks.    On behalf of stability in society we are obligated to guard  servicemen from the spreading influence of Islamic  fundamentalism and not to permit them to become drawn into  extremist groups--given a respectful attitude toward everyone's  religious convictions.    The presence in the army of various armaments, combat  equipment, and explosives does not exclude attempts on the part  of individual persons to employ them for sabotage and terrorist  purposes. In the whole world extremist groups see the resolution  of political, social, and personal problems in terror, or in  sabotage. Therefore, the fight against terrorist and sabotage  phenomena among troops and their surroundings has not lost its  urgency for us.    I have talked only about some aspects of our work, inasmuch  as, despite the atmosphere of glasnost, there are still spheres  of our work that should not be divulged.    [Razakov] What are the results of the activity of your  employees?    [Moldashev] Together with the organs of the MVD and the  military procuracy it has been possible to expose and stop a  number of criminal acts. On the basis of information sent by the  Directorate of the VKR [military counterintelligence] to MVD  organs, more than a dozen criminal cases have been initiated.  Employees of the republic military counterintelligence have  uncovered more than a dozen units of firearms and more than  15,000 munitions of various calibers, which were unaccounted for  and could have been stolen, at depots of military units.    In the course of operational-search measures conducted  jointly with organs of the MVD, the procuracy, and GKNB  subunits, stolen assault rifles, pistols, cartridges, combat  grenades, and bayonet-knives for assault rifles have been  confiscated from criminals and returned to the troops.    The VKR branch of the Osh garrison has uncovered cases of  plundering of the motor pool, with the subsequent sale of  assemblies and parts removed from motor vehicles. The loss  caused by the culprits has been restored.    Attempts by a number of officers, who were leaving for a new  place of service, to transport outside the republic's boundaries  stolen military equipment in the sum of more than 2 million  rubles [R] in 1991 prices have been suppressed. In the  investigative stage a number of other materials in similar kinds  of crimes are being found.    In August 1993, owing to joint measures adopted in a timely  way, the illegal transport beyond the borders of the republic of  military equipment, armaments, and ammunition of an Air Defense  subunit deployed in the south was prevented.    Employees of this same branch in cooperation with organs of  the procuracy arrested an officers of the military commissariat  during the acquisition of bribes by means of extortion.    In July 1993 information was received concerning imminent  conflict between a group of sergeants and newly called-up  soldiers on the grounds of nonregulation treatment. To take  revenge, the latter were preparing a physical reprisal against  the offenders, and as a sign of protest against the commanders  for failure to take steps to stop the tyranny were planning to  set fire to the barracks. The timely measures that were taken  made it possible to prevent an emergency situation and  neutralize the conflict. The military procuracy is conducting an  investigation into this case.    Work conducted by us to guard about 800 kilograms of  precious  metals in used up parts and assemblies in troop units made it  possible to prevent their theft or illegal acquisition by  questionable commercial structures. It is too early to talk  about a number of materials that are in production and are  undergoing a double-check.    [Razakov] At present all law enforcement organs are  experiencing a shortage of qualified personnel, including the  GKNB, due to the departure of experienced employees. Apparently,  your directorate is not an exception? How is the personnel  problem being resolved?    [Moldashev] Selection of candidates is being conducted among  officers of the active military service or the reserve. We are  enlisting graduates of civilian VUZ's [higher educational  institution]. Despite a not very high salary, the absence of  apartments, and the need to move from a long-occupied place,  there are quite a few who want to become military  counterintelligence personnel, which indicates that many people  are not indifferent to the fate of our young state and the  future of our society. However, not everyone is able to pass our  "exams" successfully and become enlisted.    Our collective is interethnic. In personnel selection we  distance ourselves from tribalism, protectionism, and  regionalism. In processing for service and assessment of the  work of each employee, the primary criteria are devotion to  duty, readiness to serve the fatherland, personal and work  characteristics, and also objective indicators of effective  service activity.    There are undoubtedly also officers among the military  counterintelligence personnel who desire to serve in other  regions. We are not dramatizing such attempts, understanding the  vital interests of those who are departing.    Our directorate is also experiencing an acute shortage of  qualified personnel. At the present time two-thirds of our  employees do not have operational work experience. Their  professional formation is being delayed because of absence of  special knowledge, which was previously acquired in academic  training institutions of the USSR KGB.    Due to economic difficulties we are still unable to send our  personnel for training in other CIS republics.    Therefore, under the pressure of circumstances short courses  have started to function in the GKNB, in which the students go  through initial counterintelligence training. We are confident  that life will force us to have our own full-fledged training  base.    Thus, military counterintelligence, the GKNB, as well as  society on the whole, are living through difficult times, in  which the resolution of small questions is transformed into  problems that are difficult to overcome.    [Razakov] Madalbek Moldashevich, we cannot avoid the  traditional question: How did you end up being the chief of the  directorate?    [Moldashev] After receiving a special higher education in  Novosibirsk and Moscow, I served for a long time in military  counterintelligence. I took part in combat operations in  Afghanistan for more than three years. I devoted many of my 45  years of life to intelligence work and pedagogical activity.    Thus, I am a relatively new person in Kyrgyzstan, inasmuch  as  all my previous service was spent within the borders of the  former state.    In April 1992 I decided to return to the motherland and  render as much assistance as possible to the formation of our  own sovereign state. Taking into account my knowledge,  professional and vital experience, and the practice of my  previous service, the leadership of the GKNB entrusted me with  the creation of a military counterintelligence structure, on  whose formation I am working to this day.</p>

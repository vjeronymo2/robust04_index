This is the reaction  by a high-ranking officer at the NATO air force base in  Geilenkirchen at the German-Dutch border to the question about  experiences regarding flights by the NATO reconnaissance planes  over Austria. However, he also stresses that cooperation with  the Austrian authorities basically works well on this matter.    NATO's request to Austria for simpler permits has, however,  practically no chance of being approved until the elections, in  the view of Vienna government circles, because giving up the  duty to request permits for every single overflight would  presuppose an amendment to the law. The respective regulations  are contained in the Aviation Law and the Decree on Flights  Across the Borders. An amendment to the law, however, would  give rise to a discussion about neutrality, which is not desired  by the Austrian Government.    Since 12 April 1993 NATO has been monitoring the no-fly zone  over Bosnia-Herzegovina on the order of the United Nations and,  for this purpose, it had flown more than 10,600 missions by 24  January. One main element of this airspace monitoring is NATO's  early warning fleet, which consists of 18 planes of the E-3A  type. The main base of the AWACS planes (AWACS stands for  Airborne Warning and Control System) for the Bosnian missions is  the NATO base in Geilenkirchen as well as the external landing  sites of Preveza in Greece and Trapani in Italy.    If the AWACS planes take off from Geilenkirchen for one of  their Bosnian monitoring missions, which take place at great  height over the Adriatic and Hungary, the flight across Austria  is the shortest route. Even though Vienna has given permission  for the NATO overflights, which take place at the order of the  United Nations, every single flight must be approved by the  Austrian authorities. According to NATO officers in  Geilenkirchen, this applies to two routine flights per day plus  special daily flights.    The individual permit for each of these overflights to be  given by Vienna is applied for by Luxembourg, where the AWACS  planes are registered. This becomes particularly complicated in  the case of special flights for emergencies. In order to  circumvent this bureaucratic procedure, NATO therefore wants a  general overflight permit from Austria. In contrast to Vienna,  the Swiss Government (Federal Council) has given such a general  permit for half a year for the time being. Bern justifies this  with the principle of solidarity with the peace-loving  international community, which does not contradict neutrality.  The UN mission in the former Yugoslavia is not a martial act  but a police action by the international community, Bern argues.    The NATO air force offices in Geilenkirchen hope that  Austria, too, will adopt this view and make their missions for  monitoring the Bosnian airspace easier by means of a "global  permit." Concerning the second Austrian demand, that the AWACS  planes must switch off their military radar equipment during the  overflight, they say succinctly: "This is no problem for us."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC granted VECTRA's request for an exemption to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabricate the transfer cask before issuance of the Certificate of Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under its NRC-approved quality assurance program. NRC's exemption decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made a special effort to clarify that fabrication was entirely at VECTRA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial risk and did not ensure favorable consideration of VECTRA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. The NRC's finding, based on the SAR for the Standardized NUHOMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the NRC's SER, concluded that beginning fabrication before the issuance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Certificate of Compliance would pose no undue risk to public health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety. Use of the transfer cask is dependent on satisfactory completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC's certification process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff carefully considers the public comments received in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemakings to determine whether changes are needed to the proposed rule. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted elsewhere in this notice, several public comments received in this and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other cask-approval rulemakings have resulted in changes to the SER and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance. For this reason, the public comments provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful inputs to the NRC's safety approval process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted a Regulatory Guide outlining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of an SAR for cask certification (CSAR). Requirements for a CSAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been clarified. Specific criteria for a TR (TSAR) by a vendor for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generic Certificate of Compliance need to be set.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regulatory Guide 3.61, ``Standard Format and Content for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Topical Safety Analysis Report for a Spent Fuel Dry Storage Cask,'' dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 1989, provides guidance for the preparation of a TSAR. Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guide 3.62, ``Standard Format and Content for the Safety Analysis Report for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Onsite Storage of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' dated February 1989, provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance in preparing an SAR locating an ISFSI at a reactor site. Both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Guides identify similar information that can be potentially useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prospective applicants for cask certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to know why Pacific Nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divested itself of any ownership or relationship to the VSC design in January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992. How does this affect proprietary material shared in these two closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related designs? How does it affect their relationship to the DOE MPC system?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The key individual involved in the design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of the VSC&hyph;24, who was also involved in the design and development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the NUHOMS design, left Pacific Nuclear and formed a new company, Pacific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sierra Nuclear, for the commercial manufacture and marketing of the VSC&hyph;24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage system. The NRC has experienced no difficulty obtaining the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety information, including proprietary information or answers to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questions from either firm, either before or after divestiture. The NRC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not aware of any relationship between the vendors. In addition, the NRC fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed the health and safety aspects of each vendor's cask design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independently. The NRC did not rely on any assumed relationship between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two vendors. Concerning their relationship to the DOE MPC system, each vendor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has to establish its own relationship with DOE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to know how long any model of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS has been used and if fuel has been taken out and evaluated. Has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24P or 52B ever been used anywhere and for how long? If not, this is a test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a new cask at a reactor site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NUHOMS&hyph;24P is being used at Duke Power Company,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oconee Nuclear Station, under a site-specific license issued January 29, 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Station,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a site-specific license issued November 25, 1992. Monitoring and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance of the system is being performed under the conditions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site-specific license. However, there has been no need for fuel to be removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

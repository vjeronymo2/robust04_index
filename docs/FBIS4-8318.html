			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April (CTK) -- The NATO air strikes on  Bosnian Serb positions on Sunday and Monday are a dangerous  game, foreign policy spokesman of the Democratic Left Party  (SDL) Zdenek Masopust said at a party press conference today.    NATO was looking for a new identity and was not yet able to  take into account that in the post-communist world Russia plays  an important role, he said. He emphasized that Russia should  not be humiliated for fear of "feeding nationalist extremism" in  the country.    NATO fighters attacked Bosnian Serb positions on Monday  afternoon in an attempt to prevent a Serb advance on the Bosnian  town of Gorazde, a UN designated "safe haven". The strike came  less than 24 hours after a Sunday strike against Bosnian Serbian  positions. Russia strongly protested against both attacks, as it  did against the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs besieging Sarajevo.    At the same conference SDL deputy Vladimir Rezac pointed out  possible conflicts between the post-1989 Land Law and its  amendments and the decrees of post-war Czechoslovak President  Eduard Benes. He said it is often overlooked that the Benes  decrees were ratified by the Czechoslovak parliament in 1946,  making them constitutional. Hence the return of land formerly  belonging to "German Nazis" living in Czechoslovakia who were  deprived of their land by the Benes decrees might be illegal, he  said.    Rezac referred in particular to the case of Karl Des Fours  Walderode, who was granted Czech citizenship again last year.  Walderode was a member of Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party,  adopted German citizenship in 1939 and joined the Wehrmacht.</p>

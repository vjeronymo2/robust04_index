Nikolai Koev) -- On his  way to Tirana Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov  stopped in Skopje and had almost two-hour talks with his  Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  counterpart Stevo Crvenkovski. Mr. Daskalov is due to pay an  official visit to Tirana. The two foreign ministers met at one  of the government residences in Skopje and discussed a wide  range of issues of mutual interest.    Foreign Minister Daskalov confirmed Bulgaria's principled  stand for establishing goodneighbourly relations in the region  of the Balkans and stressed the particular importance of  Bulgarian-Macedonian cooperation for the general political  climate in the region. Mr. Daskalov expressed satisfaction over  the decision of the Macedonian Government to speed up the  construction of the Kumanovo-Kriva Palanka-Gyueshevo railway  line which will make it possible to open a Bulgarian-Macedonian  railway corridor as part of the large East-West transport  project. The Bulgarian foreign minister also reiterated  Bulgaria's stand that the Balkan countries should refrain from  direct or indirect involvement in the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and should keep their neutrality in the  interest of a speedier solution of this conflict.    Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski stressed his  country's striving to pursue a constructive Balkan policy and  the importance of promoting Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. Mr.  Crvenkovski noted the need to activate bilateral trade and  economic relations as well as contacts in all spheres of mutual  interest.    The two sides agreed that Bulgaria and Macedonia have real  possibilities for establishing friendly relations in conformity  with international norms and standards and to emerge as a  stabilizing factor in the region of the Balkans.</p>

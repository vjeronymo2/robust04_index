Beijing has deployed extra police and state  security agents to keep tabs on dissidents, a number of whom  have been hauled in for day-long questioning during the past  week.    Sources in Beijing said that groups of well-known dissidents  had sent "private letters" to National People's Congress (NPC)  Chairman Qiao Shi demanding parliament put an end to "archaic  and undemocratic" laws and malpractices.    And yesterday, police in Tiananmen Square took away at least  two people who tried to distribute leaflets that apparently  called on the Communist Party and NPC members to speed up  democratisation. Among the letters sent to Mr Qiao, one decried  the series of statutes against "counter-revolutionary  activities" used to incarcerate the bulk of the country's  prisoners of conscience.    The dissident groups also urged the Eighth NPC, whose second  plenary session ends today, to repeal administrative regulations  empowering the police to detain suspects for months for "shelter  and investigation" and to lock people up in "re-education  through labour camps" for up to three years.    One petition said such practices violated the spirit of the  law by allowing the police to deprive the human rights of  citizens [as published] without going through the judicial  process.    Last Thursday, three dissidents, Zhou Duo, Liu Xiaobo, and  Min Qi, were subjected to six hours of questioning in relation  to a letter they had sent to the Public Security Ministry.    The document, dubbed "Petition 306", criticised the  authorities for detaining intellectuals before the arrival of  American Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The trio were  let off with a warning.    Sources in the dissident community said "scores" of friends  of dissident leader Wei Jingsheng were planning to hold a party  next Tuesday to mark the 15th anniversary of his imprisonment.    Police are understood to be determined to force the  organisers to give up their plans before Mr Wei, who had been  asked by police to leave town during Mr Christopher's visit,  returns to the capital later this week.    Witnesses at Tiananmen Square said at least two protesters  were arrested when they tried to distribute pamphlets as a group  of NPC delegates were walking out of the Great Hall of the  People.    One incident occurred on the north side of the square, near  the gate where the late Chairman Mao proclaimed the founding of  the communist state in 1949.    Another took place at the Monument to the People's Heroes in  the centre of the square.    Police scrambled to gather up all the pieces of paper. There  was no indication what the leaflets said.    One witness saw police throw a person into a car and drive  off immediately after the incident. Police took film away from  Manuel Ceneta, a photographer for Agence France Presse.    Later a government employee named Gao Hongmin visited the  office of a Western television network to show them copies of a  leaflet he said he wanted to distribute in Tiananmen Square  yesterday afternoon.    The leaflet called for a fully free market economy, gradual  steps towards democracy and a reversal of the official verdict  on the 1989 pro-democracy protests.    Gao, 44, said he was working alone and had no connection  with  the morning leaflet attempts.    He was grabbed by security agents on leaving the guarded  compound and thrust into a car.    Last night, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that  two  Chinese women "were stopped by other citizens for disturbing  public order this morning".    The wording suggested the women were arrested.    The Foreign Ministry statement said "it was improper for  foreign journalists to cover news in China without going through  necessary formalities".    Meanwhile, 500 intellectuals yesterday reportedly petitioned  Beijing to free more than 100 victims of Japanese war crimes who  were detained last Friday while protesting outside the Japanese  Embassy in Beijing on the eve of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's visit.    While Beijing police yesterday reportedly released most of  the detainees, who were elderly people from the provinces, they  held on to Tong Zeng, a veteran organiser of the war-reparations  movement.    The petition, addressed to the NPC, called for the immediate  release of Mr Tong and other detainees.    It said police last Friday had taken tough action against  protesters who had acted in a "peaceful and obedient manner"</p>

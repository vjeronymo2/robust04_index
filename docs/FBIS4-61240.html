			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Defense Industry Workers' Spring </F> Break"]    [Text] On the eve of May Day the directors of  Novosibirsk's defense enterprises have written a letter to the  president of the Russian Federation and the chairmen of the  Government of the Russian Federation, the Federation Council,  and the State Duma.    Today I.I. Indinok, chief of the administration of  Novosibirsk Oblast, having brought the message to Moscow, will  have handed it over to its addressees.    The essence of the letter is a cry of despair of the leaders  of the thousands-strong outfits of the "capital of Siberia,"  where, as we know, the majority of enterprises and also research  institutions represents the interests of the country's  military-industrial complex, which have found themselves on the  brink of ruin and, accordingly, stoppage as a result of the  policy of market reforms in general and the conversion of  "defense" in particular chosen by the leadership of Russia.    The exorbitant taxes, the artificially inflated price of  energy and transport services, the general nonpayments, where  the principal debtor is the state--this typical misfortune of  product manufacturers of all forms of ownership has proven to be  a genuine catastrophe for the defense enterprises, where the  decline in production, in recent months in particular, is  becoming an irreversible process.    "No state in the world has allowed this to happen...," the  directors exclaim, demanding the adoption of urgent, special  measures.    It is surprising that such a message was born after the  "Strategy for the Region's Economic Stabilization: Problems and  Solutions" workshop, which had only just been held in  Novosibirsk and in which Deputy Prime Minister S.M. Shakhray and  S.Yu. Glazyev, chairman of the Committee for Economic Policy of  the State Duma, took part. Whether the workshop "platform" was  not high enough. Whether the statesmen were of the wrong  "caliber." Whether at this time our economy together with our  wooden ruble has fallen several points further....    In any event, Novosibirsk's "defense" will "celebrate" May  Day until 11 May.    What then? Just wait, you defenders of the fatherland, for  the response.</p>

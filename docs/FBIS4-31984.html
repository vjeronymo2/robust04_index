The two sides agreed on all the questions they discussed  concerning the problems of the mutual interest. The Albanian  party insisted that the documents to be signed should refer to  Macedonia with the name that the United Nations has given to  this republic since Albania too has recognized its eastern  neighbour by this name. The press release said that there was  no personal approach on this question.    The minister of agriculture and food, Hasan Halili, who  headed the delegation, clarified that the stand of the  delegation was in conformity with that of the Albanian  Government on this issue. The press release informs the public  that issues about which the two delegations talked will be  reflected in a protocol which is expected to be signed soon.</p>

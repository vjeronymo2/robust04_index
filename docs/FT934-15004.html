			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Parties sign up to run in polls MORE than 90 organisations have registered to take part in Russian elections due on December 12, although politicians and observers expect parliament to be dominated by a handful of blocs. President Boris Yeltsin yesterday flatly ruled out simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections, as suggested by an aide on Tuesday. However, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, yesterday repeated the opinion of many in Mr Yeltsin's entourage that elections should be held on the same day. The president, in comments at the end of his visit to Tokyo, did leave open the possibility of a change in presidential elections from the announced date of June 12 next year, saying the new parliament would decide the date. Intense politicking is now going on between the leaders of various parties and groups in an effort to construct election coalitions - though the tendency at present seems towards fragmentation. The main liberal grouping, Russia's Choice, is due to hold a convention this weekend. Russia's Choice is headed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, and is likely to receive Mr Yeltsin's endorsement. However, two other pro-market groupings - the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, whose list is headed by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, and the August grouping, based on the Party of Economic Freedom headed by Mr Konstantin Borovoi - have so far declared they will run independently. The centre groupings are likely to include New Russia, which brings together Christian democratic and social democratic parties. Leaders of the communist and nationalist movements, many of whose parties are banned under the state of emergency due to end this weekend, have said they will participate, if necessary under the aegis of parties entitled to run.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Things appear to be going more Eurotunnel's way, which is just as well given that there is Pounds 100m of sorely needed equity riding on the warrants. The shares closed at 420p last night, just a touch above the 416p exercise price. Shareholders should not get too carried away, though. Yesterday's heartening arbitration decision should not be confused with the still unresolved negotiations with the contractors, while the impact of falling interest rates should not be exaggerated. Real interest rates are the key, and here Eurotunnel's projections still look optimistic.</p>

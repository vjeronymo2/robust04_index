			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Santa receives a call for rapid growth - Alan Cane predicts mobile phones will be popular gifts this festive season Electronic games and multimedia computers seem set to take a back seat this winter as a new British appetite expresses itself. It will be the Christmas of the mobile phone. 'It is going to be huge' said Mr Charles Dunstone, managing director of the Carphone Warehouse. 'The cellular phone market is taking on the characteristics of the brown goods business. The shops are busy on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and quiet for the rest of the week.' The UK mobile phone market is growing with a buoyancy few would have predicted a year ago. In the past 12 months, almost 1.2m new subscribers have joined the market bringing the total to more than 2.8m, or about 5 per cent of the potential market. More significantly, new cellular phone connections in the UK are continuing to outstrip connections to fixed networks. Only Sweden has proportionately more mobile phones among northern European countries. Analysts are now talking about a total of almost 10m subscribers to cellular services by the first months of 2000. Only a year ago, the prediction was less than 8m. And there has been remarkable price stability since Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive of Vodafone, the UK market leader, said in June that the company would make no cuts to its mobile phone tariffs this year. Competitors would risk profitability if they cut theirs, he said. Cellnet, Vodafone's principal but smaller competitor, agreed there was no need for further price cutting. This gave a signal to the market newcomers, Mercury One 2 One and Hutchison Microtel's Orange service, that there was no need for a price war in a fast growing market. Overall, it was the right prediction even if most of the growth in the market favours the traditional analogue networks provided by Vodafone and Cellnet over the new, high technology digital offerings from One 2 One and Orange. Mr Dunstone believes a combination of lack of familiar features and limited geographic coverage is acting against the digital networks. Cellnet, in particular, has performed strongly. However One 2 One and Orange are experiencing strong sales and stocks of Orange equipment are in short supply, Mr Dunstone said. Vodafone's interim results, expected today seem unlikely at first glance to reflect this strength with pre-tax profits only a little above the Pounds 175m recorded last year. Mr Kevin Langford, telecoms analyst with Flemings Research said there were three reasons for this apparently disappointing performance. The company has experienced higher than expected start-up losses abroad. It now operates networks in Australia, South Africa, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, Malta and Greece and has lost an estimated Pounds 50m to date in establishing these businesses. In addition it has experienced higher than expected 'churn', jargon for the number of subscribers who leave a network during the year expressed as a percentage of the average number of subscribers. Vodafone seems to be experiencing churn of about 29 per cent. Cellnet is seeing only about 24 per cent, according to Mr Langford. He said: 'High rates of churn can be a consequence of aggressive marketing by service providers to customers who then find little need for the service.' It can also be a consequence of fraud. Some 15,000 mobile phones are stolen in the UK every month. 'Rechipping' or changing the electrical identity of a phone by switching silicon chips so that calls can be made at somebody else's expense is already a serious problem. And finally the rapid growth of the UK market carries its own costs in the form of high payments for acquiring subscribers. Cellular phone operators generally help to expand the market and keep the cost of handsets to a minimum by paying manufacturers a subsidy on each telephone sold. Stripping out the overseas losses leaves Vodafone with a more convincing underlying growth rate of about 20 per cent. How is the new competition faring? The principal development over the past few months has been the launch in April of Orange, a service based on digital technology. It competes directly in technical terms with Mercury's One 2 One. The Mercury service was initially limited to the south-east of England where it has taken market share with the bold stratagem of offering free off-peak calls. According to One 2 One, its share of the market has grown from 3 per cent at the beginning of the year to almost 5 per cent, with more than 150,000 subscribers. It has now extended coverage to the West Midlands and expects to reach 60 per cent of the UK population by early 1997. It publishes no profit figures or estimates of revenue per subscriber. Neither, after only six months of operations, does Orange. Orange's approach is to differentiate itself from the competition by including separate lines for private and business use from the same phone and 'free' features such as caller identification. Orange expects to have 70 per cent of the country covered by the end of the year. Nobody expects today's hectic growth to continue for long. The business market is close to saturation and much of the new growth is coming from the residential sector which makes lower use of the phone. Rental prices, inevitably, must start falling again, adversely affecting profits. It will be a Merry Christmas but there may be headaches ahead in the new year.</p>

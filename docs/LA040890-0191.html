			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THREAT FROM DROUGHT  </P> <P> It has occurred to me that the water shortage is not the fault of the public's  using too much water. I agree we should not use water unwisely during these  times.  </P> <P> My question to the city councils and the Board of Supervisors: Why do you let  this happen?  </P> <P> As elected officials, your job is not to cave in to builders, city or county  staff, and investment groups that say in their EIRs that there is plenty of  water for now and all times. From now on, the EIR should include, "What effect  will the added use of water have on the residents of our area?" It should have  statements from the water providers saying that there will be enough water.  </P> <P> I call on all the people to call on their councilmen, local boards, planning  commissioners and ask them why they allowed this to happen.  </P> <P> LEO E. NICHOLS  </P> <P> Port Hueneme  </P></p>

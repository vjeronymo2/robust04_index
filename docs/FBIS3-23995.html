			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Gnatkov, candidate in Technical Sciences </F> (Soyuzmorniiproyekt): "The Development of USSR Seaports in  1981-1990"]    [Text] It is no secret that a serious situation has formed  in Russian ports today -- they are choking, failing to cope with  the influx of cargo, particularly foreign trade cargo, which is  processed only at 11 harbors. At the same time, the related  enterprises of the former USSR republics are experiencing a  shortage of freight flow, since the Russian commodity producers,  because of the customs barriers and the high fees for transit  through the territory of the Baltic countries and Ukraine, do  not want to have anything to do with them, and are trying to  ship or import the necessary products exclusively through  Russian ports. In order to evaluate our overall losses, it will  be of interest to become familiar with the development of the  seaports of the former Soviet Union in the decade preceding the  country's breakup.    The national economy's growing need for marine cargo  transport in 1981-1990 foreordained an increase in the  throughput capacities of the seaports, both through building new  ports and rebuilding and re-equipping the existing ones. In this  case, some berths were adapted for intensive processing of large  ships of new types.    Transshipment of dry cargo was mainly provided by 35  seaports, particularly the ports of Arkhangelsk, Murmansk,  Leningrad, Riga, Klaypeda, Novotallinn, Odessa, Ilichevsk,  Yuzhnyy, Mariupol, Nikolayev, Novorossiysk, Izmail, Reni,  Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Vostochnyy, Vanino, Kholm, Baku and  Krasnovodsk. The length of the mooring front for dry cargo  transshipping was increased by 15.5 percent, and the throughput  capacity -- by 27.7 percent. A large amount of the bulk cargo  was processed at eight ports, mainly at Ventspils, Novorossiysk,  Odessa, Tuapse, Aktau and Nakhodka. The throughput capacities of  their oil regions fully provided the existing cargo turnover  with oil products, although the berth structures of the Port of  Odessa's oil harbor needed rebuilding to take tankers with a  deadweight of 50,000-60,000 tonnes, and the approach channel of  the Port of Ventspils had to be deepened for the passage of  tankers and combined ships with a deadweight of about 100,000  tonnes.    The throughput capacity of the bulk cargo berths was  increased by 45 percent, with only a 14 percent increase in the  number of berths.    In addition, they succeeded in partially eliminating the  disproportion between the sizes of the ships and the depths in  the ports. For example, the number of berths with a depth of  9.75-11.5 m attained 25 percent of the total number, but those  with depths of over 11.5 m -- only a little over 6 percent,  which was clearly inadequate. A large number of the berths (44  percent) have depths up to 8.25 m, and several of them need  rebuilding.    Transshipping complexes were developed both through creating  new ones and rebuilding and re-equipping the existing  material-technical base of the ports. As a result, the  throughput capacity of commercial seaports rose by 15-16 million  tonnes. The main direction in improving their activity was  intensification of the loading-unloading operations, through  improving the technology and organization of complete service of  the fleet in the ports.    Despite the widescale distribution of container transport of  crated and piece goods, a tremendous products list of general  cargo remains which is not subject to containerization. To  increase the volume of its transshipment, methods of packaging,  the use of roll-trailers and complexes with a  computer-controlled system of belt conveyors and many others  have been developed.    Along with modernizing the transshipping units at seaports,  it is very important, for increased efficiency of fleet  operation, to improve its service -- supplying bunker fuel,  water, foodstuffs, etc. -- for maximum reduction of ship idle  times, above and beyond the cargo operations.    Specializing the maritime transport fleet according to the  nature of cargo being transported and type of transport  packaging, combined with increasing the intensiveness of  loading-unloading operations, has made possible a considerable  increase in the cargo capacity of the ships and, as a result, a  rise in their economic efficiency.    The increased size of ships designed primarily to transport  mass cargoes has required further intensification of  loading-unloading work, based on setting up specialized  complexes, equipped with a system of conveyor lines,  railcar-tippers or other means of high-speed processing of  railcars, powerful gantry cranes, reclaimers, container  unloaders and other means of mechanizing and automating cargo  operations.    The development at seaports of high-productivity specialized  units to transship mass cargoes and of deep-water berths, and  the formation of the corresponding operational harbors and  approach channels, cannot be effective unless these cargo flows  are concentrated in a small number of ports. It is for this  purpose that ports such as Yuzhnyy and Novotallinn, which now  find themselves outside Russia's borders, were built.    By the beginning of 1991, the fixed production capital of  the  seaports was estimated at 5,932 million rubles [R]. Here, the  largest relative share belonged to the ports of the Black  Sea-Azov and Danube basins -- 39.4 percent. The share of the Far  Eastern basin was 28.8 percent, of the Baltic -- 21.9 percent,  the Northern -- 7.3 percent and the Caspian basin -- 2.6  percent. The distribution of the ports' fixed capital among the  republics looked like this: for the Russian ports of the Black  Sea-Azov basin -- R388 million (16.6 percent), the Ukrainian  ports -- R1,819 million (78 percent), the Georgian ports -- R127  million (5.4 percent); the Russian ports on the Baltic basin --  R454 million (35 percent), and the remaining R675 million (65  percent) -- the ports of Lithuania (11 percent), Latvia (22.5  percent) and Estonia (31.5 percent).  <H5>  Specialized Complexes To Transship Bulk Cargo </H5>   The Port of Murmansk exports apatite concentrate  and iron ore. The specialized complex to transship apatite  concentrate can take ships with a deadweight up to 40,000 tonnes  and its loading productivity is 2,400 t/hr.    The industrial complex for the transshipment of apatite  concentrate includes a railroad unloading gallery, an apatite  concentrate warehouse, a shore-based loading gallery, loading  machines, a system of conveyor belts and transfer stations and a  central control post.    The apatite concentrate is transported from the Apatity  Station to the Port of Murmansk in special cars with an elevated  body. A consist of 87 cars, with a total freight capacity of  about 5,000 tonnes, is fed to the railroad tracks of the complex  and then nine cars at a time go to a double-track gallery, where  unloading is done as they move along it. Two hoppers with a  capacity of 540 tonnes each are placed under the railroad tracks  in the gallery. From here the freight goes by belt-conveyor  feeder to the main belt conveyors and then, depending on the  work variant, to the ship or to the warehouse.    The apatite concentrate warehouse, made in the form of a  longitudinal reinforced concrete hopper with two lower  longitudinal outlet slots and a roof on top, accommodates 25,000  tonnes of concentrate.    The iron ore berth at the Murmansk seaport can take ships  with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. The technical  productivity of the gantry cranes is 2,800 t/hr.    The Kandalaksha seaport specializes in  transshipping iron ore which arrives at the port by rail from  the deposits of the Kolskiy Peninsula, for further transport by  river ships to the Cherepovetsk Metallurgy Combine. The special  loading unit includes a system of belt conveyors, a  railcar-tipper and loading machines at the berths and warehouse.  The river ship loading rate reaches 3,000 t/hr.    The Ventspils seaport transships potassium salt to  seagoing ships by means of a specialized transshipping complex  constructed at the rebuilt deep-water berth. This complex has  two loading machines at the berth, with a total productivity of  3,000 t/hr, a pyramid-type storage warehouse and a system of  conveyor lines in enclosed galleries, and can take and process  ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. Its throughput  capacity is estimated at a level of 2.5-3.0 million tonnes a  year.    The first section of the Port of Novotallinn.  which includes complexes to transship grain and perishable wheat  products, was put into operation on the Baltic basin in 1989.    The grain complex is made up of a deep-water pier with two  berths, which can take ships with a deadweight of up to 100,000  tonnes, is equipped with conveyor lines to feed the grain into a  300,000-tonne capacity elevator located on the shore, and has  one berth (quay) to take bulk freighters with a deadweight of up  to 50,000 tonnes, at which grain can be both loaded and  unloaded. The total throughput capacity of the grain complex is  estimated on a level of 5-6 million tonnes a year.    The Odessa seaport has a specialized berth to take  ships with raw sugar transported in bulk. The berth is equipped  with gantry cranes and conveyor lines in galleries to feed the  sugar to the onshore warehouse. The technical productivity for  unloading sugar is 450 t/hr.    Modernization measures were carried out in 1985, making it  possible to increase the raw sugar unloading productivity.    Grain-carrying ships are unloaded at the Port of Odessa at a  specialized berth, equipped with conveyor lines, cranes and  pneumatic grain loaders. The pier was extended by 90 m, with the  necessary increase in depth at the berth, to take large  grain-carrying ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes.    The Nikolayev seaport has a special unit to load  ore onto seagoing ships, traveling to the ports of the Ukrainian  Danube Shipping Company -- Izmail and Reni, where the ore is  transshipped to river barges for delivery to countries on the  Danube.    The special transshipping complex includes a car-tipper to  unload the iron ore arriving by rail, a system of conveyor lines  to feed the ore to the warehouse or to the berth, and also  loading machines with a technical productivity reaching 3,000  t/hr.    The Port of Yuzhnyy. Construction of the port was  begun on the Adzharlykskiy estuary in 1974. Two berths were  built on its western shore for dry chemical cargo -- carbamide,  shipped for export (in bulk or in sacks) by means of special  units. These berths can take large ships with a deadweight of up  to 50,000 tonnes. Loading in bulk is done at a rate of 500 t/hr,  and in sacks -- 300 t/hr. A Korgoveyer type loading machine was  placed at the berth to load carbamide in sacks. Berths were also  built for transshipment of liquefied ammonia and superphosphoric  acid, as well as for methanol and nitrilic acid.    A transshipping complex with a total berth front of 650 m  was  erected on the eastern shore of the estuary for transshipment of  bulk cargoes, mainly ore and coal, and it can take three ships  with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes at the same time. There  is a possibility that two ships with a deadweight of 100,000  tonnes each can be accepted after the harbor area has been  deepened.    At the cordon and in the rear there are gantry cranes with a  large hoisting capacity, the Atlant type -- 20/32 tonnes, and  the Sokol type -- 16/32 tonnes, depending on the radius of the  boom. Railcars with bulk freight arriving at the port are  unloaded by means of car-tippers, and then it proceeds along the  conveyor belt system at the rear or cordon-side warehouse areas  for transfer to the ship by means of grab-bucket cranes. The  throughput capacity of this complex is estimated at 5-6 million  tonnes a year.    In addition, two transshipping complexes were built here to  take phosphorites off ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000  tonnes, and then ship them by rail. Each of these complexes  includes a berth, two transfer machines with a productivity of  1,200 t/hr and a warehouse with conveyor systems. Their total  throughput capacity is estimated at 4 million tonnes a year.    The Novorossiysk seaport transships the following  bulk cargoes: grain and raw sugar for import and cement for  export. The grain is processed at an elevator complex, which,  since its rebuilding, can take ships with a deadweight of up to  50,000 tonnes or 100,000 tonnes after they are unloaded in the  roads to 60,000 tonnes. The gross rate of unloading ships with a  deadweight of 30,000 tonnes is 16,200 t/ship-day.    The port has a special unit with a productivity of 450 t/hr  to unload raw-sugar from ships.    One of the berths of the cement area loads bulk cement onto  ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes.    The Mariupol seaport specializes in transshipping  coal arriving from the mines of the Donetsk basin to be shipped  both for export (primarily to the countries along the Danube)  and for coastal trading. The coal complex is equipped with a  special unit, consisting of a railcar-tipper, a system of  conveyor lines and two loading machines installed at one berth,  which load coal with a technical productivity of about 2,200  t/hr. At other berths of the coal complex, the coal is loaded by  grab-bucket gantry cranes. The port takes ships with a draft of  8.0-8.5 m.    The Poti seaport ships about 2 million tonnes of  manganese ore a year, both for coastal trading and for export.  Its berths can take ships with a deadweight up to 30,000 tonnes.    Bulk cargo in large quantities (mainly coal and ore) are  transshipped at the ports of the Ukrainian Danube Shipping  Company -- Reni and Izmail. These cargoes arrive from the ports  of Mariupol and Nikolayev in small ships (including ships for  combined sailing) and in winter partly by railroad, and are then  transshipped on river barges to travel along the Danube to ports  in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The coal and ore  are loaded by gantry cranes.    The Port of Vostochnyy in the Far Eastern basin has  special complexes to load coal onto seagoing ships with a  deadweight of up to 100,000 tonnes and a complex to load  industrial woodchips onto ships.    The first section of the coal complex, put into operation in  1980, includes a deep-water pier with two berths, where, by  means of a system of conveyor lines and two loading machines,  installed at one pier, ships are loaded with a technical  productivity of about 6,000 t/hr. After the second deep-water  coal pier berth is put into operation, the throughput capacity  of the complex will increase to 12 million tonnes a year.    Construction of a complex to transship potassium salt for  export, with a throughput capacity of about 2 million tonnes a  year, has been planned and begun. Large bulkers with a  deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes will be loaded here.  <H3>  Specialized Complexes To Transship Containers and Rolling  Equipment </H3>   The development of transport of containers and enlarged  cargo  pieces and of various wheeled and caterpillar equipment, as well  as the increased size of specialized container ships and  rolkers, has made it necessary to develop terminals equipped  with various types of container transshippers, and storage areas  with the corresponding dimensions and means of automated  loading-unloading operation control. These terminals have been  or are being developed at a number of major ports on all our  country's marine basins.    For example, the Port of Arkhangelsk built a new  area, Ekonomiya, for transshipment of general cargo with larger  pieces and special containers of the Norilsk Mining-Metallurgy  Combine, as well as standard 20-foot containers.    Large bulk container ships of the Mikhail Strekalovskiy  type,  and timber-carrier-pallet-carriers of the Nikolay Novikov type,  the draft of which should not exceed 9.0 m, will be moored in  this area.    Under reconstruction at the Port of Leningrad, is  the port's third area, at which modern deep-water berths were  built to receive and process large container carriers with a  capacity of about 1,200 containers, and rolkers of the Kapitan  Smirnov or Magnitogorsk type, with a capacity of about 60,000  m[.sup]3[/] and a draft of up to 10 m. This terminal includes  two berths, equipped with container loaders, and a storage area  to accommodate containers and wheeled equipment.    Container loaders of the gantry type, installed at the  berth,  will process the ships and deliver the containers to the  warehouse or to the berth, and truck-mounted container loaders  will also carry out warehousing operations. The  loading-unloading and warehouse operations at the terminal will  be implemented by an automated control system. Its throughput  capacity is about 150,000 units of containers and motor vehicles  a year.    The Port of Odessa has rebuilt the Karantinniy  mole, in the process of which deep-water berths were built to  take large ships. Berth and rear container loaders have been  installed there, and the area has been expanded and equipped to  store the containers. As a result, the mole's throughput  capacity is about 1.5 million tonnes of containerized cargo a  year.    Two specialized berths are now in operation at the Port  of Ilichevsk for container transshipment, with a throughput  capacity of about 1 million tonnes of containerized cargo a year.    A special new berth to transship motor vehicle equipment was  put into operation here in 1980.    The Port of Vostochnyy has three container berths.  Another such deepwater berth is now being built. All four  berths, each 300 m long, are designed to take (after dredging)  container carriers with a 2,500 container capacity, but right  now can take container carriers with a 1,200 container capacity  and rolkers with a capacity of about 1,300 containers. Gantry  loaders with a hoisting capacity of 30.5 tonnes each, with a  rail width of 32 m, have been installed at the existing berths.  Ten rows of containers are accommodated between the supports.  The warehouses accommodate four rows of container stacks,  serviced by gantry loaders. The total capacity of the warehouse  areas at two berths is about 10,000 containers.    Containers are delivered to the port and shipped from it by  railroad transport. A cargo front, serviced by double cantilever  gantry cranes with a rail width of 25 m, have been provided to  process the consists. The containers are moved by truck-tractor,  along the area of the complex between the basic commercial  facilities, on the port's semi-trailers. The semi-trailer is  designed to transport containers weighing up to 35 tonnes. The  container complex is computer-controlled.    A number of ports, including Vanino, Vladivostok, Nakhodka  and others, are rebuilding berths to accept and process large  container carriers.    Two container berths have been built at the Port of  Magadan. One of them has a special warehouse to store  containers, and is equipped with traveling bridges. This  warehouse makes it possible to carry out cargo operations in any  weather, which, under the conditions of the long and severe  winter, is very important.  <H5>  Special Berths To Transship Timber Cargoes </H5>   Timber cargoes, mainly for export, are loaded at ports of  the  Northern basin (Arkhangelsk, Igarka), the Baltic basin (St.  Petersburg, Vyborg, Kaliningrad), the Far Eastern basin  (Vladivostok, Posyet, Nakhodka, Vanino and the port centers of  the Amur estuary, as well as the port centers of Sakhalin and  the Port of Ust-Kamchatka).    All these ports take small and medium-sized ships with a  deadweight of up to 7,000 tonnes, and ports such as Arkhangelsk,  Igarka, Vostochnyy, Nakhodka and Vanino -- large  timber-carrier-pallet-carriers of the Nikolay Novikov type, with  a deadweight of about 14,000 tonnes.    The following data characterize the rate of loading timber  at  the main ports: at the Port of Nakhodka -- saw logs in  palletized form -- 1,700 t/ship-day, pulpwood (unpalletized) --  1,230 t/ship day; at the Port of Vostochnyy -- saw logs,  palletized -- 2,060 t/ship-day; at the Port of Vyborg --  pulpwood (unpalletized) -- 2,000 t/ship-day.  <H3>  Special Complexes To Transship Bulk Cargoes and Service  Tankers </H3>   The throughput capacities of the bulk oil complexes at  seaports fully ensures the development of today's cargo  turnover, with the exception of the oil-transshipment complex of  the Port of Odessa, which needs to rebuild the berth  structures, replace the pumping stations with more powerful  equipment and deepen the access channel.    The largest bulk oil complex at the Port of  Novorossiysk, Sheskharis, has deep-water berths, including  one berth to accept and unload supertankers with a deadweight up  to 200,000 tonnes. This berth can load the largest tankers of  the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, of the Krym type, with a  deadweight of 150,000 tonnes (draft 17 m), and combination ships  (bulk tankers) with a deadweight of 100,000-110,000 tonnes  (draft 15-17 m). The pumping system of this berth is designed to  perform the loading of crude oil tankers with a productivity of  about 20,000 t/hr.    The Tuapse seaport has six bulk berths, five of  which can take tankers with a deadweight of from 10,000 to  40,000 tonnes for loading, and one -- tankers with a deadweight  of up to 50,000 tonnes.    The oil-transshipping complex of the Batumi  seaport is designed to take tankers with a deadweight up to  30,000 tonnes, and transships about 5 million tonnes of  petroleum and petroleum products a year.    The oil-transshipping complex of the Port of  Ventspils includes three bulk-oil piers (two berths at each  one of them), which can take tankers of varying cargo capacity  (two piers -- with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes and a  third pier -- up to 100,000 tonnes). Liquefied petroleum gas is  also shipped for export through this complex.    The Klaypeda seaport has three bulk berths,  through which petroleum products are shipped on small and  medium-sized tankers with a deadweight of up to 25,000 tonnes,  and the cargo turnover is about 6 million tonnes a year.    The oil-transshipping complex of the Port of  Nakhodka has four berths, two of which are for small ships  and two for ships with a deadweight of 15,000 tonnes.    On the Caspian Sea, bulk oil cargoes are shipped via the  ports of Makhachkala, Aktay, Krasnovodsk, Baku and Apsheron.    In addition to the two existing oil berths, the Port of  Aktay has built two new berths with protecting structures,  which has made it possible to increase the throughput capacity  of the oil-transshipping complex from 5 million to 10 million  tonnes a year.    According to statistical data, in 1990 the total dry cargo  export of the Soviet Union republics was 75.7 million tonnes,  including: Russia -- 52.1 (69 percent), Ukraine -- 18.6 (24.4  percent), Belarus -- 1.58 (2.1 percent), Transcaucasus -- 1.59  (2.2 percent) and Kazakhstan -- 1.2 million tonnes (1.5 percent).    Of this volume, 34.7 million tonnes (46 percent) were  shipped  through Russian ports, and, moreover, its own share was 31.4 (90  percent), the Ukrainian share 2.2 (6.3 percent), Belarusian --  0.3 (1 percent); 29.2 (38.5 percent) was shipped through  Ukrainian ports, and in this case Russia's share was 12.2 (41.7  percent), Ukraine's -- 14.9 (51.5 percent), Belarusia's -- 1.1  (3.9 percent), Transcaucasus' -- 0.4 (1.3 percent) and  Kazakhstan's -- 0.3 million tonnes (1.1 percent).    Of the total amount of Russian dry cargo export, the  following commodities were transshipped through Ukrainian ports:  coal -- 3.5 million tonnes, chemicals -- 3.4, metals -- 2.5,  machines and equipment -- 0.44, ore -- 0.35 and other products  -- 1.6 million tonnes.    In 1990, about 8 million tonnes of dry cargo from Russia  were  exported through ports of the Baltic republics, including coal  -- 2.7, chemicals -- 2.3, others, including metals and cement --  about 3 million tonnes.    Of the total volume of dry cargo import in 1990, Russia  accounted for 28.9 million tonnes (45.8 percent), and, moreover,  13.7 million tonnes were processed through its ports, 8.8 --  through the ports of Ukraine and 6.4 million tonnes through the  ports of the Baltic republics. Predominant in the composition of  Russian dry cargo import arriving through Ukrainian ports were  grain -- 3.3 million tonnes, sugar -- 0.7, metals -- 1.6,  chemicals -- 0.25, machines and equipment -- 0.56, combined  feeds -- 0.5 and perishable goods -- 0.24 million tonnes. The  import of dry cargo for Russia coming through Baltic ports  consisted mainly of grain -- 3 million tonnes, perishables --  0.4, combined feeds -- 0.4 and also metals, machinery and  equipment -- 0.5 million tonnes.    Because of the breakup of the USSR, to export these volumes  of dry cargoes from Russia, the throughput capacities of the  Black Sea Ports are lacking -- 12.2 million tonnes, the Baltic  ports -- 8, and for import -- the Black Sea -- 8.8 and the  Baltic -- 6.2 million tonnes. According to the predictions of  Soyuzmorniiproyekt, the volume of Russian dry cargo import in  the next few years should increase from 28.9 to 42.5 million  tonnes, mainly due to grain -- 11.1, and sugar -- 3.2 million  tonnes. No increase is envisioned in dry cargo export volume.  Measures must therefore be worked out to develop the throughput  capacity of Russia's ports, both in the near future and in the  future up to the year 2000.    In 1980, Russia exported 96.2 million tonnes of bulk cargo  through its seaports, of which 42.5 million were transshipped  through seaports on the Black Sea -- Novorossiysk and Tuapse,  21.8 million -- the ports of Ukraine, and 30 million -- the  Baltic ports. According to predictions, a sharp cutback in the  export of petroleum and petroleum products is proposed from both  Russia and other oil-extracting republics. Because of this,  there is no need to develop oil ports on the Black Sea. On the  Baltic, however, the need obviously arises to build a bulk port  or use the ports of Ventspils and Klaypeda under certain  conditions.  <H6>  Photo Captions </H6>   1. p. 9: Far East.

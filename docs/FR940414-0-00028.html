The Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32470), FDA published a proposal, based on a petition from ADPI, 130 North Franklin St., Chicago, IL 60606, to amend the standard of identity for evaporated milk (21 CFR 131.130) to: (1) Reduce the minimum milkfat content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight; (2) reduce the minimum total milk solids content requirement from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight; and (3) add a minimum milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent by weight. Interested persons were given until September 21, 1992, to submit comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  II. Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The agency received seven responses, each containing one or more comments, from a consumer, a trade association, and several manufacturers. Six letters supported, and one opposed, the proposal. A summary of the opposing comments and the agency's responses follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  1. The comment contended that the solids content of fluid milk (producers' milk) has probably increased over the last 20 years, and that the proposed reduction in the minimum required milkfat and total milk solids content of evaporated milk is inconsistent with the intent of the standard of identity for evaporated milk, as well as the intent of the subsequent amendments, that the milkfat and milk solids-not-fat contents be reasonably related to those of the milk used in the manufacture of evaporated milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The agency disagrees with the comment. According to data supplied by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (Ref. 1), the composition of producers' milk has remained fairly constant through the 1970's and the 1980's. These data show that the yearly average milkfat content for all producers' milk, before standardization for beverage purposes, during the period 1970 to 1991 (Ref. 1) ranged between 3.64 percent and 3.68 percent, with an overall average of 3.66 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The agency does not agree that the change in compositional requirements is inconsistent with the intent of the evaporated milk standard. Throughout the history of the evaporated milk standard, the labeling of evaporated milk products and the instructional materials pertaining to the use of the food supplied to consumers by food manufacturers, trade associations, and USDA (Ref. 2), as well as policy statements by FDA, have described the food as a 2 to 1 concentrate of milk. Instructions on the label or in labeling of evaporated milk frequently show that the food is to be diluted with an equivalent portion of water for use in preparation of beverages made using the food. In addition, recipes for other foods often state that a can of evaporated milk may be diluted with a can of water for use in recipes calling for the addition of milk (Ref. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The standard of identity for milk in &sect;131.110 (21 CFR 131.110) defines minimum compositional requirements for the food of not less than 3.25 percent of milkfat and not less than 8.25 percent of milk solids not fat. The minimum compositional requirements for evaporated milk that FDA is adopting in this final rule (i.e., not less than 6.5 percent of milkfat, 16.5 percent of milk solids not fat, and 23 percent total milk solids) correspond to a twofold concentration of standardized milk and, thus, are directly related to those of milk. Because the change in compositional requirements accurately reflects the general understanding that evaporated milk is a twofold concentrate of milk, the agency finds that the change in the evaporated milk standard is consistent with the intent of the standard and, therefore, is revising the standard as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  2. The comment disagreed that the test results that ADPI submitted from a monadic (i.e., single-product evaluation) in-home use test were a reliable indication of real consumer preferences. The comment stated that monadic ratings are not accepted by organizations such as the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau to support product comparative claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA acknowledges the comment's concern that ADPI's in-home use test was not a conclusive demonstration that consumers preferred the lower fat, lower solids evaporated milk over the traditional standardized evaporated milk. However, ADPI submitted information in its petition on a total of three industry research tests on consumer perceptions of traditional standardized evaporated milk compared to evaporated milk manufactured to conform to the parameters for which ADPI had petitioned. The monadic in-home use test was only one of these tests. In the other two tests, each participant was able to evaluate both products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA has reviewed the studies that ADPI submitted (Ref. 3). The agency concludes that there was sufficient evidence to support ADPI's claim that consumers were unable to distinguish between the standardized evaporated milk and evaporated milk manufactured to conform to the petitioned parameters. Taken individually, the studies did not provide overwhelming data, but the combined weight of the three studies has convinced the agency that consumers' perceptions of the two products were not significantly different. Each test was performed under different circumstances (i.e., employing different evaluation techniques) and used a different representative sample of consumers. The studies examined a wide variety of possible consumer uses of evaporated milk in realistic, everyday situations. Additionally, these were separate studies employing within-subjects and between-subjects designs that came to identical conclusions. Based on all of the evidence in the petition, the agency finds that it can conclude that consumers are unable to discriminate between standardized evaporated milk and the evaporated milk manufactured to conform to the suggested parameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  3. The comment stated that the overwhelming use of evaporated milk is in recipes, and that it was not aware of anyone reconstituting evaporated milk for beverage use in the United States. The comment questioned whether consumers consider evaporated milk to be a 2:1 concentrate of fluid milk, and whether the amendment would make reconstitution for beverage use more convenient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The agency agrees that evaporated milk is used primarily as an ingredient of other foods. FDA notes that evaporated milk may be used in recipes, as manufactured, or in reconstituted form as a direct replacement for milk. Another significant use of evaporated milk is in coffee and tea (Ref. 4). Although the common consumption of reconstituted evaporated milk as a beverage is decreasing (Refs. 5 and 6), evaporated milk does replace fluid milk for beverage purposes in individual households as a result of commercial purchases, as well as through the USDA commodity distribution program; in institutions; and by participants in the USDA Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Ref. 4). In fact, one comment from a consumer stated that he and his family have used evaporated milk regularly in food recipes, in coffee, and in the preparation of beverage milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaporated milk has been touted as a 2:1 concentration of milk for many years (Ref. 7). A 2:1 concentrate is easier for consumers to reconstitute than a 2.3:1 concentrate because it is in whole units. In addition, as noted above, a 2:1 concentrate, when diluted, results in a product whose composition is the same as that for beverage milk. Therefore, FDA concludes that providing for a 2:1 concentrate of milk under the standard of identity for evaporated milk is in the best interest of consumers, and that the concerns raised by the comment are without merit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  4. The comment argued that a change in the standard of identity for evaporated milk is unnecessary because consumers that want a lower fat, lower cholesterol evaporated milk can purchase evaporated lowfat milk or evaporated skimmed milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA notes that consumers may continue to purchase evaporated lowfat milk or evaporated skimmed milk. However, comments from a manufacturer of evaporated milk that were submitted in support of the proposal stated that many of its customers have expressed an interest in lower fat and lower calorie foods, and that the amendment would afford it (the commenting manufacturer) the opportunity to meet the demands of this segment of the public. Furthermore, the fat reduction, although modest, is consistent with ``The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health'' (Ref. 8) and the National Academy of Sciences' report on ``Diet and Health, Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk'' (Ref. 9), which recommend that consumers reduce their consumption of fats and cholesterol. Therefore, FDA finds that the amended standard will benefit consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA also notes that the nutritional benefit is only one of several bases that support the amended standard. Therefore, FDA concludes that the argument raised by the comment is without merit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  5. The comment noted that the proposed reduction in the minimum required milkfat content and milk solids content in evaporated milk would make the U.S. standard of identity for evaporated milk inconsistent with the International Codex standard for evaporated milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA acknowledges that the amended standard is not identical to the International Codex standard for evaporated milk. The Codex standard requires that evaporated milk contain not less than 7.5 percent of milkfat and not less than 25 percent of total milk solids. Because the new requirements in the standard that FDA is adopting will establish lower values for minimum milkfat and minimum total milk solids content than those of the Codex standard for evaporated milk, products complying with the Codex standard will meet FDA's standard of identity. U.S. exporters of evaporated milk may need to reformulate their products if they are to be shipped to countries that require that the food comply with the minimum requirements of the Codex standard, but this fact provides no basis for not making the proposed change in the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Accordingly, after consideration of all comments, the agency is amending the standard of identity for evaporated milk in &sect;131.130(a) by reducing the minimum milkfat content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight, reducing the minimum total milk solids content requirement from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight, and establishing a minimum milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent by weight. FDA concludes that the amendments will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  III. Economic Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FDA has examined the economic implications of this final rule to amend the standard of identity for evaporated milk in 21 CFR part 131 as required by Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). E.O. 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health, and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the agency analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  On July 22, 1992, FDA analyzed the economic impact of the requirements that the agency is adopting under the previous E.O. 12291 and found that they would not have a significant impact on small business. The agency noted in the proposed rule that manufacturers may continue to process evaporated milks using current formulations. Thus, no changes are required in formulations unless manufacturers wish to reformulate their products. In the proposal, the agency tentatively concluded that the regulation would have zero costs associated with it. FDA has received no information or comments that would alter the tentative finding that it set out in the proposed rule that there is no substantive economic issue in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Thus, the agency finds that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  IV. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  V.

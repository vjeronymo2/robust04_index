Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic told reporters  after the first round of talks at Sarajevo Airport that the  document regulated all power disruptions in territories  controlled by all three sides.    The talks at Sarajevo Airport are part of an effort to  rebuild confidence among Bosnia's warring nations.    No agreement has been reached on another major issue -- the  release of five Serb doctors and three nurses arrested by the  Moslems in Sarajevo last week in an alleged attempt to flee a  Moslem-controlled quarter of the city.    "This issue should demonstrate the good will of the (Moslem)  side, and we regret to say that we shall be unable to accept any  agreement until this major issue has been resolved," said  Koljevic.    General Milan Gvero, assistant commander of the Bosnian Serb  Army, said the Moslem military authorities had been asked to  publicly withdraw their declaration of war on the Serbs in these  lands and to clearly call off all military operations, as  insistence on confidence-building is senseless if combat  operations continue.</p>

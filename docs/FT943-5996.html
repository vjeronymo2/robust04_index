			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Adviser's fine and costs total Pounds 73,000 Disciplinary charges relating to investment advertisements, maintaining proper records, and supervising staff have cost Knight Williams, one of the UK's largest financial advisers, more than Pounds 73,000. Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent financial advisers, yesterday announced a Pounds 50,000 fine - the second-largest it has levied  -and associated costs against KW. The penalty will be financed by a reduction in the dividend to shareholders. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, took the unusual step of issuing a statement. SIB said it had received an assurance from KW that full consideration would be given to any complaint made by a client, including complaints which had already been dealt with but where the customer wanted to reopen the issue. Two of the 10 charges related to investment advertisements, but most covered failings in client files. Fimbra said that there was not enough information on files to show that dealings with customers complied with regulatory rules about giving best advice, properly knowing the customer's needs and making suitable recommendations. KW yesterday issued a written statement saying it believed no clients had been financially disadvantaged, and that it was implementing procedures designed to ensure that the rule breaches did not recur. It refused to answer questions about the Fimbra fine or its statement.</p>

I did that out of the sense  of duty I feel for our readers. I had to see, with my own eyes,  without intermediaries, what is happening with Ion Iliescu. Has  he changed at all since his meeting two years ago, preceding the  electoral campaign, with journalists of various Bucharest  publications, a meeting I also had the honor of attending?  After the conclusion of the recent three-hour meeting, after  having listened to Iliescu -- who kept talking throughout the  meeting, from its very beginning to the end, interrupting, with  or without a reason, his partners -- my conclusion is absolutely  clear: The president has undergone a radical change. Two years  ago, he still had certain doubts. Whether to run for president  or not. Whether to turn right or left. Whether what he was  doing was right or wrong. Now, however, he has no doubts. Now,  he is firmly convinced that whatever he does is right. He is  firmly convinced that truth is on his side. He is convinced he  is right with respect to the domestic and international  orientations of the country, the political spectrum available at  home, and, what is even more, regarding the way in which dailies  should be run. The journalists, we poor devils, are coming from  the trenches of life. We know everyday reality, we have contact  with it directly, brutally, and not by way of briefings  elaborated by counselors. We know, in detail, all the dramatic  aspects of the current hard life in Romania. We know that  everything is stagnant. We know that there is an extremely grave  economic and political blockage. We know that prices are  increasing continually. We know all this from the hundreds of  letters and phonecalls addressed to us by our readers, as well  as from assessing our own situation: The circulation of our  dailies is dropping owing to the drastic reduction of the  people's purchasing power within the great economic difficulties  we are facing. After I had read the invitation sent to me by  Spokesman Traian Chebeleu, in which it was announced that the  president wishes to discuss the social, political, and economic  problems of the country with the directors and chief editors of  the major dailies, I thought that perhaps Ion Iliescu wishes to  learn, in a direct way, from the representatives of public  opinion, about what is actually going on in this country. This  proved to be a vain illusion. It was merely an illusion of mine  stemming from my conviction that not only in the case of  democracies, but also in dictatorships, the heads of state feel  the need to be well informed about the large- or small-scale  changes taking place in reality. If for no any other reason,  then just because the careers of all heads of states who have  neglected this have ended tragically. In this sense, Nicolae  Ceausescu is a very good example. However, Ion Iliescu did not  want to learn anything from us. First, because he did not  summon us to Cotroceni for us to tell him what we think he  should do, but rather for him to tell us what he thinks we  should do. From this point of view, all the time, I had the  impression that I was not attending a meeting with President Ion  Iliescu, but rather with the propaganda secretary Ion Iliescu.  That is, what we were attending was actually not a dialogue,  but rather a meeting (I must admit, with mineral water and  Coca-Cola being served, and every now and then we were also  allowed to utter a few words) in which we were given precious  recommendations. On how to be more profound. On how we could  become more polite to the presidential institution. On how we  should cease to resort to querelle in the press. (This French  word, meaning "quarrel," seems to be Ion Iliescu's latest  linguistic acquisition). Second, the president did not wish to  learn anything from us about what is happening in the country,  because he is firmly convinced that he knows everything that is  happening currently. That the decline in production has been  stopped. That we managed to survive without foreign financing.  That the Vacaroiu government is the best conceivable one in the  whole wide world. How about the rest? The rest is nothing but  malevolent things claimed by his adversaries. By the  opposition. By the press. Recently, I discussed the situation  in the country with many politicians. Not solely those of the  opposition, but also with those belonging to the rulers.  Throughout those talks, I have never experienced a denser  opaqueness with respect to the signals coming from the outside  than the one displayed by the president during our Monday  meeting. All our attempts trying to tell him that the people  are leading a rough life, that prices are extremely high, that  the phenomenon of corruption is expanding, and that the state  institutions are anything but open, were received by him with a  sullen distress akin to animosity. I am quite certain that,  while listening to our warnings, Ion Iliescu was trying to  figure out to which occult, destabilizing force the speaker  belonged to. Thus, after two years, I now found a person who  has definitively locked himself up in the tower of his own  truths. A man living among statistical figures and abstract  truths, a man who is unreachable even by the slightest breeze  from the outside. A man to be pitied, in a way.</p>

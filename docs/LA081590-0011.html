			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Harold J. (Bud) Brennan, who gained fame as the fan who came out of the stands  and tried to tackle football great Tom Harmon, has died of a heart attack. He  was 80.  </P> <P> Brennan gained minor fame on Sept. 28, 1940 as a spectator at Memorial Stadium  in Berkeley when Harmon's Michigan team came to play Cal and Harmon ran wild in  a 41-0 rout.  </P> <P> He ran the opening kickoff back 94 yards for a touchdown. He ran a punt back 72  yards for another touchdown. On the next Michigan play, Harmon broke loose, and  as he neared the goal line, Brennan raced out of the stands and attempted a  tackle at the three-yard line. Harmon evaded Brennan, a former player at  Oakland's Fremont High, and completed an 86-yard touchdown run.  </P></p>

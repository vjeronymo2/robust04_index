			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE: THE CLUB SCENE;  </P> <P> MEN WITH A MISSION;  </P> <P> NOT ALL A BUNCH OF MONDO DEPRESSO SNIVELERS IN BLACK, THE BAND HAS A SOCIAL  CONSCIENCE.  </P> <P> Let's talk about the good job you've been dreaming of, that of being a rock  god. The Mission U.K., which will be at the Ventura Theatre on Saturday night,  is continuing its tour after taking a couple of months off to watch the World  Cup. Hey, boss, I'm going to take off until October to root for the Dodgers --  just keep sending those checks to my P.O. box, OK? Yeah, right.  </P> <P> Anyway, in addition to having flexible hours, the Mission U.K. is also doing  just fine with its latest release, "Carved in Sand." Not all a bunch of mondo  depresso snivelers in black, the Mission U.K. is, in fact, on a mission -- the  band has a social conscience. The new album contains songs about child abuse  ("Amelia"), the dignity of labor ("The Grapes of Wrath") and even an  anti-addiction song ("Hungry Is the Hunter").  </P> <P> Formed four years ago in Leeds, England, by Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams, both  former guitarists from a band called the Sisters of Mercy, Mission U.K. has  since released four albums and will be making its second appearance at the  venerable Ventura Theatre. Intense, hook-filled guitar rock perhaps best  describes the Mission U.K., but let's let front man Hussey tell it:  </P> <P> How's the album and the tour going?  </P> <P> I don't know, but it's actually time to get started again. We've taken a few  months off to follow the World Cup -- England will be back in four years, one  way or another. We'll be doing about five shows in California.  </P> <P> Why the Mission U.K.? Is there also a Mission USSR or a Mission USA?  </P> <P> Oh no, there used to be a soul group in America called the Mission, and you  have a very different legal system than we do. We're intending to phase out the  U.K. gradually.  </P> <P> Your band was named for a Robert De Niro movie. Could the band just as easily  have been named the King of Comedy, Taxi Driver or the Deer Hunter?  </P> <P> No, we like the name. Besides, we only have four channels over here.  </P> <P> Your song "The Grapes of Wrath" is about a famous American movie without Robert  De Niro. Will there be songs about other classics, perhaps "Gunga Din," "It's a  Wonderful Life" or "Citizen Kane"?  </P> <P> I don't know, we just love "The Grapes of Wrath." I've got it on tape. We only  have four channels -- it's not like America.  </P> <P> How did the band get started?  </P> <P> It was a happy accident, really. After the Sisters of Mercy broke up, I just  wanted to continue working with Craig Adams. And since I was better looking and  had a better voice, I became the lead singer.  </P> <P> On your bio, you're quoted as saying you hate ignorance. Do most bands  perpetuate or combat ignorance?  </P> <P> Well, I'm not sure. But music can change people, and if you change enough  people. . . . The Beatles for example, changed people, but the effects weren't  felt for a number of years, even after they split up.  </P> <P> Is there a generic Mission U.K. fan?  </P> <P> Most of our fans are very much like us. There is, of course, the faction that's  dressed in black with spiked purple hair, but most of them are like us.  </P> <P> Where is the Mission U.K. most popular?  </P> <P> In Europe. Also we do well in California and the large cities -- the more  cosmopolitan places where people are more informed.  </P> <P> Why should people go see the Mission U.K.?  </P> <P> I don't know. I'm not sure I'd go myself. Actually, our live shows are never  the same twice -- we're quite capable of falling to pieces or putting on the  best show you've ever seen.  </P> <P> What's the best thing about being a rock god?  </P> <P> I suppose getting into clubs for free. And it's like all the years you've spent  struggling just to save up enough money to buy some guitar strings, and now all  these things are just handed to you on a plate. We're having a good time --  we've achieved all of our original goals. Everything is quite nice now.  </P> <P> Are there any current bands you like?  </P> <P> All About Eve, the Waterboys, the Cure, the Wonderstuff -- that's it.  </P></p>

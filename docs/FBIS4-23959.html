			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, June 19 (AFP) -- Nineteen Somali clan  leaders in the lower Juba region supporting two main warring  factions in the area signed a nine-point peace pact in southern  Somalia after a three-week peace conference at the port of  Kismaayo, a UN source said here on Sunday [19 June].    The accord, aimed at strengthening the ongoing ceasefire  accord, was signed on Saturday at Luglw-Goobweyu, some 20  kilometres (12 miles) outside Kismaayo.    The pact was endorsed by leaders of two warring factions in  southern Somalia, General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan of the  Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Osman Atoo, a representative  of General Mohamed Farah Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA).    The two leaders were cheered when they shook hands and  hugged  one another after the signing ceremony, which was preceded by a  peace march by residents of the area.    The two were due to endorse another nine-point statement  either on Sunday or Monday which would further pledge support  for Saturday's nine-point agreement, the source added.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Chibisov: "Economics in the Center of </F> Attention"]    [Text] The principle by which executive personnel are  judged is their knowledge of the sector's economics, their  ability to control them and thus ensure a stable financial state  for their collective and sector. Such was perhaps the leitmotif  of the sorters' conference conducted yesterday by Minister of  Railways G. Fadeyev. The results of 5 months' work of railroad  transportation were summarized, and the tasks to be completed in  the first half-year were defined.    But before analyzing the state of affairs in the sector, the  minister gave a briefing on the position of the Russian economy  as a whole. Production volume continues to fall. The output of  industrial products dropped below 55 percent. On this backdrop  the proportion of consumption expenses is increasing, and the  quantity of accumulated fixed capital and working capital is  decreasing. In April almost 5,000 enterprises were partially or  completely idle.    In this situation it was no accident that the RF president  recently published edicts on the most acute problems of economic  reform. The edicts have the greatest significance to  transportation, because the sector's economic position depends  on the state of the Russian economy as a whole. The strategy of  transportation activities adopted in December at an expanded  meeting of the board of the Ministry of Railways was adjusted in  the direction of tighter controls, and it is now producing  positive results. While shipments were carried out at a loss in  the first quarter, now the situation is changing. The profit  from shipments in April was 287 billion rubles, which made it  possible to cover the losses for January-March, and in general  for 4 months. A possibility for counting on profitable work  appeared. In 5 months, income was almost R7.8 trillion,  including 7 trillion from freight shipments. And operating  expenses were R6.9 trillion. Profit received from shipments made  it possible to raise profitability from 3.4 percent  (January-April) to 12 in 5 months, and to maintain the wage  level in accordance with the Tariff Agreement. Here is the  situation in terms of wages: While wages grew by 16.7 percent in  the national economy as a whole in 3 months, coming to R164,800  in March, in railroad transportation wages increased by 29  percent, coming to R280,000 in March (fifth place among the  economy's leading sectors), and the figure anticipated for May  is R323,000.    But this increment is tangible only when it gets into the  hands of the workers themselves in a timely manner. This is  where things aren't going so well. Some railroads were late in  paying wages. I recently spoke with mechanics at the Rtishchevo  Locomotive Depot. "We're living on credit," they said. "When you  get your paycheck, you pay off your debts and then go back to  living on credit. And the only wages we've gotten are those for  March." Locomotive crews of the Kochetovka Depot complained of  the same thing.    The Ministry of Railways planned to reach a normal level of  wage payment in the first half-year. The first deadline of the  railroads for paying off their debt to the workers was 20 May.  Unfortunately nine railroads, to include the North Caucasus,  Southeastern, Transbaykal and others, failed to reach the goal.  Some of them couldn't even find financing sources, at the same  time that their accounts payable are growing. This means that  debts are not being collected fully from clients.    Economization of operating expenses continues to be a sore  point. Eight hundred eighty-five electric locomotives and 841  diesel locomotives are being maintained on the railroads in  excess of the norms. Their maintenance alone has required  expenditure of R58 billion. The condition of the locomotive  fleet is low, especially in the South Urals, Krasnoyarsk and  Transbaykal railroads. Unplanned locomotive repairs "swallowed  up" 80 percent of all nonproductive expenditures in the 5  months. Losses have been suffered in railcar management. The  railcars of passenger trains are a third empty, but trains are  still being formed in the same old way. There are sharp  contrasts in the cost of a ride on commuter trains. Travel  through one zone requires payment of R270 on the Far Eastern  Railroad, 200 on the Kemerovo Railroad, 200 on the October  Railroad, 160 on the Northern and South Urals railroads, 50 on  the Moscow, Volga and Southeastern railroads, and R40 on the  Sverdlovsk and Transbaykal railroads. In the meantime the  expenses continue to pile up.    The problems of expediting freight and of tariff policy,  progress in fulfilling the Tariff Agreement, selection of  executive personnel, train traffic safety and other issues were  analyzed in detail at the conference.</p>

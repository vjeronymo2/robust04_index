			<p>BFN     [Text] The IMF Board unanimously approved yesterday a $173  million loan to Nicaragua to be dispensed over the next three  years, the Presidency's Communications Directorate announced  last night.    The IMF noted that among the reasons for granting the loan  is  the Nicaraguan Government's commitment to promote an economic  program "that will achieve 3 percent real growth in the Gross  Domestic Product next year," the source added.    The directorate added that "in a new commitment to  Nicaraguan  society the IMF sympathized with the social conditions of  Nicaragua's neediest" and that "the new ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] includes programs to upgrade  health and education," as well as a Social Investment Fund for  the benefit "of the hardest hit" sectors.    The Social Investment Fund is aimed at "the most vulnerable  segments of society" and will generate "more jobs, alleviate  poverty," and upgrade the conditions of those hit the hardest by  the war, the Directorate's communique indicated.    On another matter, the IMF said that "it has taken note" of  the Nicaraguan Government's view on the need to restructure its  foreign debt "under concessional terms." One can infer from  this that the international financial organization would support  the request the Nicaraguan Government will make along those  lines in September when it goes to negotiate with the Paris Club.    In the September meeting, the government will ask that all  the foreign debt stocks [preceding word in English] -- probably  as much as $500 million -- be forgiven. Although the foreign  debt to the Paris Club does not represent the bulk of what the  government owes, it is important because the countries that  belong to the Club are the ones currently granting the greatest  volume of financial aid to Nicaragua.    In addition, the IMF loan to Nicaragua is in keeping with  the  signing of the ESAF and World Bank agreements, as well as with  the results of the recently held meeting of the World Bank's  Consultative Group.</p>

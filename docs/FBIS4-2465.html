			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangxi  Province is undergoing a profound economic change in the wake of  two major state development projects.    Located at the junction of the Chang Jiang River and the  Beijing-Kowloon railway, both of which are under development,  Jiangxi has successfully absorbed overseas capital to fund its  economic take-off.    The province has used foreign funds to the tune of 838  million U.S. dollars since 1984. Of the sum, direct business  investment has exceeded the loans from governments of foreign  countries.    Before 1991, however, foreign investment in most joint  ventures was less than 300,000 U.S. dollars each. Most jobs  were labor-intensive at that time.    By last year, there were 59 such firms each with an  investment exceeding five million U.S. dollars. More firms were  in technology-intensive and export-oriented industries.    The investment structure has also become diversified to  embrace transportation, energy, raw materials and other areas of  infrastructure.    The joint ventures have also created jobs. More than 30,000  people were employed in newly-opened factories last year.    The introduction of new technology and management skills  have  upgraded local industries.    This year the province is determined to reform its  financial,  monetary, and foreign trade enterprises and offer more desirable  terms to foreign businessmen. It is also trying to obtain loans  from governments of foreign countries and international  financial organizations.</p>

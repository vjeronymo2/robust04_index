Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, made an ebullient speech at the soiree.    He said: Last year in 1993, the province ensured a stable  and coordinate development of the economy and social  undertakings. These achievements were brought about from the  concerted efforts of the people of various nationalities in the  province and were also cemented with the vast number of retired  cadres' sweat and blood. Many veteran comrades have experienced  the great causes of reform, opening up, and four modernizations;  positively suggested ways and means for reform and economic  construction; continued to maintain and carry forward the fine  traditions and work style of the party; constantly worked to  serve the society, the masses, and the grass roots; and made  great contributions to building the spiritual and material  civilizations of the province.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government, he sincerely expressed thanks to the  retired comrades in the province.

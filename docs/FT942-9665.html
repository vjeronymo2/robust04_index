			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Leading Article: European recovery Economic recovery in western Europe is well under way. The UK is in the van, after eight quarters of growth, and output is at last back at pre-recession levels. But others are catching up. This week's surprise reduction in the German discount rate, to 4.5 per cent, leaves room for more cuts in money market rates of interest. While continental rates may have further to fall, UK interest rates may well have reached the bottom of their cycle. By 1995, economic growth in Germany, France and Italy may also have overtaken that in the UK, as the European Commission predicted this week. This is by no means bad news for the UK. Higher taxes will reduce domestic consumer demand. Largely for this reason, the Commission forecasts that UK economic growth will slow from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in 1995. The UK will have to rely on demand abroad, for which a strong continental recovery will be essential. Unfortunately, that recovery is not very strong. In France, for example, gross domestic product has grown slowly since its trough in the first quarter of 1993 and is still 1.6 per cent below its peak in the first quarter of 1992. After falling by 0.8 per cent in 1993, it is forecast by the government to grow only 1.4 per cent this year. But recent evidence suggests it may do somewhat better than that. Manufacturing output has risen in each of the last four months. The number of non-farm employees rose in the first three months of 1994, this being the first quarterly rise since 1990. There was a slight rise in the annual rate of inflation, to 1.7 per cent, in April. But it remains very low, while monetary policy is still restrictive, because the Bank of France continues to align its monetary policy closely on that of Germany. This has meant lowering its intervention rate in line with reductions in Germany's repurchase (or 'repo' rate), even though economic conditions in France warrant more rapid reductions. Clear trend Although the continental recovery may not be strong, the trend is clear. The same is true of interest rates. In the US - and the UK - these are on their way upwards, or at least on the turn, while continental rates are still falling. The latter are likely to go below those in the UK quite soon. The latest cuts in interest rates should accelerate the continental recovery, though slowly, since monetary policy affects demand after a substantial delay. Its effect can be felt more quickly via the exchange rate. But this will not be important for Germany, which does a high proportion of its trade with countries that tie their exchange rates to the D-Mark. The US economic recovery, now in its fourth year, is further ahead than the British, which is why interest rates have already been increased, to head off inflation. The Federal funds rate now stands at 3 3/4 per cent. A further rise seems imminent, despite an unexpected decline in producer prices in April. If German monetary policy is loosened further, the Bundesbank's discount rate could fall below the US Federal funds rate later this year. This relative movement in national interest rates should also help correct the US dollar's current weakness, although this will depend on other factors, including the longer-term credibility of US monetary policy. Improved prospects The Bundesbank's latest reduction in lending rates is bound to improve the prospects for recovery throughout Europe. Many of its neighbours, notably France, desperately need this assistance. There is a question, however, about whether the move was justified by domestic German monetary conditions. It is not often that the Bundesbank's anti-inflation credibility is brought into question. But it is cutting rates deeply, despite continued rapid growth in the broad money supply (M3), which grew at an annualised seasonally adjusted rate of 15.4 per cent between the last quarter of 1993 and March. This is hugely above its 1994 target range of 4 to 6 per cent. The Bundesbank argues that the cut was justified by the domestic outlook for inflation, currently 3.1 per cent in west Germany. It also argues that the change should help reduce monetary growth, by encouraging investors to move funds from bank deposits into long-term funds. These arguments may well be right, but they also conflict with its traditional monetarism. Whether the Bundesbank is mistaken will not be known for some years. The immediate prospect for European economies is now fairly bright. They look set to enjoy a period of growth with relatively low inflation. This is, of course, good news. But unemployment remains disturbingly high. In the UK, even after two years of recovery, there are still 2.72m people out of work, 9.7 per cent of the workforce. In France the rate is higher still, as is true for Germany as a whole, though not west Germany. Renewed growth is welcome. It must not be used as an excuse for taking Europe's structural economic problems off the agenda.</p>

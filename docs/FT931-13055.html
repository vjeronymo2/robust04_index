			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Recruitment subsidies likely to have only a marginal impact Sir, Your leader on unemployment ('Harsh fare for the jobless', January 22) goes some way towards supporting the introduction of a new safety net of temporary work for the very long-term unemployed. However, you then suggest that employment subsidies might be a 'better option'. There is much to be said for the government testing out a system of recruitment subsidies to persuade more employers to recruit the very long-term unemployed. We should not, though, expect too much from the offer of subsidies; over the years, surveys among employers have shown that 'bribes' are likely to have little more than a marginal impact on their recruitment practices. It would be a mistake if they were to distract us from the need for a new policy framework for the long-term unemployed, based on a two-way contract between them and the government. The government should be prepared to offer the unemployed temporary work if they are unable to return to employment after 18 months on the register. In return, the long-term unemployed should only receive their income from society as a condition of undertaking this work. Such an approach commands wide respect among the long-term unemployed, as essentially fair, and immeasurably better than the status quo, which effectively traps many into a life outside the world of work. If there is any one lesson which we should learn from the severity of the current recession, it is surely that everyone in work, even the most highly skilled, should see themselves as a potential victim of unemployment - and, therefore, potentially a beneficiary of the new contract now needed, so urgently, between long-term unemployed people and society.

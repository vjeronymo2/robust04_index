			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Coal Investments bullish on prospects THE CHAIRMAN of Coal Investments, the former Geevor group whose shares will recommence trading tomorrow, has told shareholders that pits acquired by the company will make operating profits immediately. In a bullish statement, Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, also predicted that the steam coal market in England and Wales would exceed 50m tonnes by the middle of this decade, at the top end of market expectations. With imports expected to be low 'we are satisfied there is sufficient scope for several efficient mines to operate profitably alongside British Coal mines servicing core contracts (with generators).' The shares are returning to the market following their suspension 18 months ago at 4.75p. However, it is a considerably different company following Mr Edwards' appointment as chairman and a restructuring. A recent extraordinary meeting agreed the acquisition of a company which owns the Cwmguili mine in south Wales and the raising of Pounds 1.35m through a rights issue and shares placing. Coal Investments will acquire any rights that arise from applications made by Edwards Energy, a company owned by Mr Edwards, to operate five collieries owned by British Coal. Mr Edwards said the acquisition of mines should be complemented by the development of inter-related businesses, including coal distribution in the UK, coal trading overseas, and 'cautious investment' in coal mining overseas.</p>

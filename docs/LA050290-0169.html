			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WILLIAMS' SON APPEALS AWARD TO HALF SISTER  </P> <P> Country music star Hank Williams Jr. has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike  down "feel-good jurisprudence" that gave his half sister a claim to the estate  of their famous father.  </P> <P> Williams' lawyers contended in the filing that the state Supreme Court gave a  share of the late country music Hank Williams Sr.'s estate to his illegitimate  daughter, Jett Williams, even though the estate had been closed since 1975.  </P> <P> Williams also asked the court to hear an appeal of a New York appeals court  that, relying on the Alabama case, gave Jett Williams a share of continuing  music royalties stemming from songs written by her father.  </P> <P> Hank Williams Sr. died five days before his daughter was born in 1953 to Bobbie  Jett. The Alabama court noted that her paternity was not suggested to her until  1974, when she was a 21-year-old University of Alabama student.  </P> <P> For the next few years, her efforts to get documents from the state were  thwarted because the case had been sealed, along with evidence that lawyers had  been setting aside part of Hank Williams Sr.'s estate for her.  </P> <P> She launched her music career under the name Jett Williams, although she is  identified in court documents as Catherine Yvonne Stone.  </P></p>

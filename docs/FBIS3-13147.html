The allegation that  Hekmatyar is favoured by the government here is not really new.  It goes way back to the Zia years and the successive  governments that followed him when the concerned agencies  supposedly showed a preference for Hekmatyar, leading to the  conclusion of their partisanship. But that was in the past.  The present government's policy, as recently articulated by the  Prime Minister herself, is not to interfere in any way in  Afghanistan's infighting. But it seems the government here  needs to do more than making a simple statement of good intent  to ensure that the perception about Pakistan's alleged  interference or a partisan policy does not persist. Pakistan  has to outgrow that perception if it has to play the role of an  honest broker of peace in Afghanistan.    As things are, Hekmatyar does have an advantage over his  rival groups in that he is in control of territory that is  contiguous to Pakistan and thus aid supplies from this country  cannot reach Kabul without his consent. What it also means is  that, even if the Pakistani Government did not approve of it, he  could get the needed food and fuel from the illegal channels  that have traditionally been operational in the area. But for  that he would still need the money. Hence the question raised  by a Kabul government official, "If he is buying it, how is he  paying for it", needs a convincing answer. One seemingly simple  choice before the government of Pakistan is to wash its hands  completely of Afghanistan, which of course it cannot possibly  do, given the level of its own interests there. The other more  productive course for it would be to find ways and means of  having direct communication with the rival groups while  remaining strictly neutral. The recent efforts in that  direction made by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali though  commendable, are not enough. What is even more important, the  ISI and the Foreign Office should not be working at cross  purposes and if the ISI is not helping the cause of  reconciliation between rival groups and is actually, as alleged,  aggravating it, it must be reeducated as to the grave political  consequences such a role could lead to. The situation calls for  a detailed review of the country's Afghan policy at the highest  government level.</p>

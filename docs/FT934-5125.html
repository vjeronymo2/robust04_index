			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Strategy wins broad welcome - City reaction Leading economists in the City and in industry gave a broad welcome to a Budget that aimed to cut public borrowing without harming the economy. Adjectives such as 'constructive', 'sound' and even 'bold' were voiced in response to the policy measures announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. He gave relatively few economic forecasts, but these were generally in line with economists' own predictions. He was more cautious on the prospects for growth this year and next than other forecasters, but his inflation predictions were in line with others. Economists voiced some concern, however, over the large element of deferred taxation - cuts in mortgage relief and the married couples allowance should together generate some Pounds 1.7bn in 1995. One economist described the deferrals as a 'gamble on recovery'. There were also questions raised over whether Mr Clarke would be able to achieve the proposed Pounds 3.5bn in spending cuts in the coming year. The chancellor gave little guidance on inflation. He said it would remain within the government's target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and the prospect of a 2.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product next year was less than some outsiders' estimates. However, the increased tax burden of Pounds 1.75bn in the coming year was lighter than many had predicted and offset by higher-than-predicted public spending cuts of Pounds 3.5bn. Mr Clarke gave a solid commitment to slashing the government's debt burden to Pounds 38bn next year and reducing it by a further Pounds 17bn over the following two years. This compared with a consensus that the PSBR would fall to Pounds 40bn next year. Much of the PSBR reduction is expected to stem from lower inflation and a reduction in interest rate payments. Mr David Owen, UK economist for Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank said: 'The markets will like it. It doesn't impact on economic growth and yet reiterates the commitment to getting the public sector borrowing requirement down.' Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of forecasting at the Confederation of British Industry, applauded the restrained tax increases and the identification by Mr Clarke of European recession as the main barrier to recovery. Mr Richard Freeman, the chief economist for ICI, said: 'I thought the forecasts were very sensible especially the projection for 2 per cent growth within the OECD. 'The view that growth will be around 2.5 per cent is well in line with our expectations.' Mr Neil Mackinnon of Citibank said: 'As far as the Treasury's economic forecasts are concerned they are in line with our projections. The net tax increase can be absorbed by the economy without undermining the sustainability of the recovery and the inflation profile also looks encouraging given the absence of an extension to VAT.' However, he added, the tax increases due in fiscal 1995-1996 would 'certainly tend to dent growth'. Mr John Shepperd, UK economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese investment bank, agreed: 'Lamont tied Clarke's hands by imposing a deferred tax of Pounds 6.7bn. This is Lamont Mark Two and if he pulls it off he'll be a hero but it represents a fairly massive increase in personal tax. 'The Pounds 3.5bn in spending cuts was the rabbit out of the hat but one has to ask whether it is achievable.' Mr Roger Bootle, economist with Midland Global Markets, said: 'This was a bold Budget which was tougher and more imaginative than the markets had expected. The increase in tax this coming year taken together with Mr Lamont's proposals will take Pounds 8.5bn out of consumer's pockets. Whatever the governor of the Bank of England might want, another 0.5 per cent cut in interest rates is needed soon.' Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist with SG Warburg, said: 'We would approve of the growth forecast of 2.5 per cent.' He said his main worry ahead of the Budget was that consumer confidence would be dented, but he believes that is now unlikely to happen.</p>

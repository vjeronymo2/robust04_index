			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The pressure of gunboat diplomacy: Britain has offered the US two warships to help invade Haiti. Dominic Lawson asks what the fee is On the day that the Irish Republican Army announced a complete cessation of its 'military activities' - terrorism to you and me - another announcement gained rather less attention from the British media. It nonetheless also had consequences for British troops. In case you missed it in all the euphoria over the IRA's tactical withdrawal, here are the facts: on Wednesday the Foreign Office revealed that it had offered the services of two ships and a military training team to assist in a possible US invasion of Haiti. I'm sorry, I'll read that again: to assist in a possible United Nations invasion of Haiti. The Foreign Office has offered HMS Broadsword which last saw action in the Falklands War, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Oakleaf. Broadsword is, apparently, unsuited to naval gunfire support of an amphibious landing as it has no gun. However, a spokesman from the Ministry of Defence said (according to The Independent): 'If the Americans requested it, she might be replaced by a ship with a gun.' I should think the Americans jolly well will 'request it'. Guns are useful in such circumstances. You never know when you might need them. But what is going on here? What are we British doing offering materials and men to facilitate a dubiously motivated invasion of a godforsaken Caribbean island of no conceivable strategic interest to us? The trite answer is that our man at the UN put up his hand when the Security Council passed Resolution 940 which authorises member nations to 'use all necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership and to maintain and establish a secure and stable environment'. This is the usual post cold war charade, of course, in which the US uses a tame UN to give international legitimacy to the pursuit of its own very particular foreign policy objectives. We saw the same thing in Somalia, and  -though here the international interest was genuinely widespread - Kuwait. But it is not enough for the Americans to have Britain's signature to the policy they wish to carry out. They also want us to make the pretence of an 'international task force' even more believable by the actual involvement of non-American troops. And for some reason the State Department considers Britain the most useful stooge in such endeavours. This is not primarily because British troops are the best in the world, but because - as one former State Department official told me - 'you guys have a pretty good record'. In other words, direct military involvement by Japan or Germany, even were it feasible, would raise associations best forgotten. In Somalia, Britain did the absolute minimum, supplying one addled old Hercules transporter. The Americans were not at all pleased about that, but when one recalls what happened to the Pakistani troop contingent - 48 of them butchered by General Aideed's men - one can only be grateful. In the case of Haiti, the British response is slightly more accommodating. What is the reason? The same as always: the Foreign Office wants something in return from America. Perhaps an absence of criticism by President Clinton for the Major government's less than effusive reaction to the IRA's cease-fire? The precise details are, irrelevant. All we British can hope is that the trade-off is more in our favour than in the Americans'. This is simply the stuff of diplomacy, low and embarrassing as it undoubtedly is. Why, for example, did that arch third world groupy, Harold Wilson give vocal support to President Lyndon Johnson's military escapade in Vietnam. It was the quid pro quo for American support for the ailing pound. A quo pro quid, in other words. I quote from Ben Pimlott's masterly biography of Wilson: 'In December 1965 . . . the Foreign Secretary reported that recent British requests for American financial help had been met by a dry reminder from the White House that the British had not been very helpful over Cuba, and by an inquiry about when the first British battalion would be arriving in Vietnam.' Well, at least we wriggled out of that one. Dominic Lawson is Editor of the Spectator.</p>

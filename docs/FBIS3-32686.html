Del Valle said that Guatemala's intention is for the maximum  institution on world trade to voice its opinion on the legality  or illegality of the U.S. ruling with regard to the import of  this product. The agriculture minister indicated that the United  States has forced the large cigarette companies to purchase 75  percent of their tobacco needs from U.S. producers, thus  violating a GATT regulation. That measure, he noted, implies  that the nation's import of tobacco would be limited to 25  percent of consumption. This is the reason it was decided to  file the suit before the GATT so it may in turn issue its  opinion as to whether this measure is in keeping with its  mechanisms or not.    Gonzalez said that nations in Latin American, including  Brazil, that have been adversely affected by the U.S. measures  also joined in the suit. The foreign trade minister said that  Guatemala maintains close contact with these nations to set up a  structure similar to the one organized for the banana case, that  is, to unite Latin American positions in this regard.    In another turn of events, the foreign trade minister said  that the meeting slated for 7-8 February between Mexico and the  Central American Northern Triangle [El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras] has been postponed until a latter date that could be  21 February. Gonzalez indicated that the reason for suspension  of the meeting was that the Group of Three (Mexico, Colombia,  and Venezuela) did not reach an agreement. This situation  forced the Mexicans to request the meeting to be delayed to  analyze its current position.    To conclude, Gonzalez said that Guatemala's position is to  gain better access for our products in the Mexican market, as a  series of difficulties have been registered with merchandise  such as carton boxes, lamina [not further specified], and sugar.

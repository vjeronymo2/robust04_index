			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Rivals wide of unity goal IN AN uneasy attempt to display some club unity, Mr Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, the chairman and chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur Football club, joined ranks yesterday to promote the international Makita football tournament, Gillian Tett writes. It was their first joint appearance since Mr Sugar tried to sack Mr Venables. But with the court hearing on the sacking due next Tuesday, not even refereeing by a press manager, who banned questions on the battle, could entirely mask the animosity. Mr Sugar looking poker face, studiously ignored his rival but said that 'in spite of the difficulties that have been going on' he hoped the fans would support the tournament which Spurs will host next month. Mr Venables, who seemed relaxed and cheerful, echoed the sentiment. He said he hoped to be at Tottenham for the tournament, which will feature Spurs, Chelsea, Ajax and Lazio. The Spurs supporters club plans a boycott of the Makita tournament.</p>

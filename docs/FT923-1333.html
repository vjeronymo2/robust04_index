			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok heartened by period of political calm - Turnover has hit record levels Bangkok's bulls paused for breath yesterday, after a frenzy of buying which has generated record trading volumes on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and pushed the SET index up 29 per cent since troops killed at least 50 pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of the capital in May. Stockbrokers had been anticipating a mild correction this week, and yesterday the index closed 5.33 down at 863.42 in turnover of Bt18.56bn (Dollars 734m), following Monday's sharp rise in share prices in turnover of Bt22.64bn, the highest in the history of the exchange. Both foreign and local investors have been heartened by this month's election results and the formation of a coalition government under Mr Chuan Leekpai, the leader of the Democrat Party. The coalition is fragile, but the killings in May so discredited the armed forces and the political parties supporting them that Mr Chuan and his allies were able to win the election and leave Thailand's recalcitrant generals and corrupt politicians on the sidelines - for the time being at least. Even before the events of May, the Thai market was unsettled by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the Thai military coup of February 1991. Mr Graham Catterwell of Crosby Research said yesterday: 'We have had two years of instability and uncertainty. People have been itching, and waiting for the skies to clear; the skies have cleared, so they are off.' Foreign institutions, which had been underweight in the Thai market, have been heavy buyers of Thai stocks in the past fortnight, although some have begun to take profits from the bull run, while Thai speculators have piled into their favourite counters in the finance and securities sector. Local finance companies represent a leveraged bet on the market because higher volume increases their profits. The SET is growing week by week - a new unit trust and a leather company made their debut yesterday - and the exchange's computer system, so far, has handled the surge in volume without any significant problems. Trading is scheduled to be paper-free by the end of the year, a move which could make life difficult for foreign investors who sometimes hold shares designated for locals by using nominees, instead of paying premiums for the shares allocated to foreigners. In theory, the ultimate beneficial owner should be disclosed in the scripless trading system, but brokers have been assured that a way around the problem will be found to satisfy foreign demand for Thai shares. A new Securities and Exchange Commission is attempting to improve regulation of the market, and the addition of a SET afternoon trading session, greeted with a marked lack of enthusiasm when it was introduced in July, has proved a success. Forthcoming third-quarter results, particularly those of the increasingly busy finance companies, could extend the market rally, but some brokers are predicting a fall before the end of the year. Mr Scott Klimo, director of Thai research for Smith New Court, commented: 'This rally around election time was really fully anticipated. There are a lot of factors that are going to come together to push the market back down before the year is out.' Such problems include an abundant supply of office space which is likely to hit overvalued property shares, the probability of disagreements within Mr Chuan's coalition, and the possibility that Thailand's economic growth will be lower than the officially predicted 7.6 per cent. Opinions are divided on the extent to which transport and communications bottlenecks within Thailand, and the economic woes of the country's main export markets in America, Europe and Japan, will restrict Thai economic growth. Most brokers agree, however, that the shares of Thai companies in growing service industries such as insurance and banking, and in infrastructure-related businesses, remain good buys, and that Thailand is still looking at least as attractive as the other markets in the region as a prospect for 1993 and beyond.</p>

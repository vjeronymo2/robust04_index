			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] After the voting at the European  Parliament [which voted for Sweden's membership of the EU],  Prime Minister Carl Bildt was of course pleased.    [Begin recording] [Bildt] This is very good news, and this  means that the last formal obstacle to a quick signing of the  agreements that make our membership possible from the beginning  of next year has now been removed.    [Correspondent Tomas Ramberg] The biggest obstacle to your  ambitions to enter the European Union is still there, the  Swedish nation. Do you think this decision will have some  influence on opinion in Sweden?    [Bildt] I think that possibly it will. There have been many  who have always said that this will not succeed, it will  collapse because of this or that, and this was maybe the last  thing they had pinned some of their hopes on. [end recording]    [Announcer] The date of the national referendum where the  Swedish nation will make a decision on EU membership will be 13  November.</p>

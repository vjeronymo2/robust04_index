			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY REDISTRICTING PUT ON HOLD  </P> <P> There was only one major flaw in your editorial "Slow Down and Get It Right"  (Aug. 18) regarding the redistricting for the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The three-man conservative majority on the board is not now nor has it ever  been ready to reach a settlement.  </P> <P> It is content to squander millions of taxpayer dollars on this and other  lawsuits. It has an unlimited fund of money (the taxpayers), so why not? If  these men had to use their own personal funds, they would be reasonable and try  to reach an equitable settlement.  </P> <P> Those millions of dollars belong to the people of Los Angeles County and should  have been used to promote the people's welfare, education and mental  well-being. Five supervisors for a county the size of Los Angeles is absurd.  The Los Angeles City Council has more members.  </P> <P> ESTHER KRISMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

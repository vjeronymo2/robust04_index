Elevated values in the NBT test indicates, in most cases,  the presence of a bacterial infection. Neutrophil activity is  stimulated by latex or bacterial antigens to clarify the reserve  capabilities of the neutrophil. In earlier work, the researchers  studied the spontaneous NBT test in full-blown leptospirosis,  identifying a considerable elevation of mean NBT-test values.  Some patients, however, produced values that were below normal.  In the work reported here, the researchers observed 148  individuals with icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis in order to  study the possibility of using the NBT test to predict the  severity of the course of the disease and the probability of the  development of complications. The indices for the spontaneous  NBT test and the staphylococcus- stimulated NBT test were, in  fact, found to be a function of severity of course and  developing complications. Elevated values for the spontaneous  NBT test were typical of a mild or medium severity or for a  severe, but uncomplicated case. In patients with a severe form  of the disease, but low spontaneous NBT-test values, the absence  of staphylococcus stimulation served as a predictor of the  development of life-threatening complications. Leptospirosis  vaccine depressed NBT-test levels. Persistence of the depressive  effect in convalescents indicated a high probability of the  development of late complications.

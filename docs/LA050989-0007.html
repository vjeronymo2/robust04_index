			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL PLAY  </P> <P> Everyday we hear and read of the failures of our schools. I have just witnessed  a dramatic success. At an inner-city school -- Hobart Elementary -- I saw a  remarkable performance of "Twelve Angry People." The students almost all have  accents, Spanish, various Asian languages, but they understand and convey the  meaning of the speeches.  </P> <P> A gifted and dedicated young teacher, Rafe Esquith, each year produces  remarkable plays. The audience is as mixed as the performers. I don't know any  of the students at the school, but I go to the performances each year for the  pure joy of seeing students excel. How do we lure more dedicated young men and  women into the teaching profession?  </P> <P> ROSLYN B. SHAPIRO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

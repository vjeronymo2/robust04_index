			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Six years waiting for a flight - John Ridding explains why one man has made his home at Charles de Gaulle airport With his bags neatly piled on a luggage trolley, Merhan Karimi Nasseri appears just like any other passenger at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Reading a newspaper alongside a fellow traveller, he might be waiting for a flight to take him home for Christmas to New York, Brussels or Moscow. But Nasseri is not like the throng of businessmen and tourists milling around the airport terminal. While others, if they are unlucky, may face delays of several hours before boarding their aircraft, Nasseri has been awaiting his departure for more than six years. His desired destination is London. But his last attempt to fly there, in November 1988, met with failure. Without a passport, he was ordered to return to Paris. The French authorities, however, refuse to grant him citizenship. As a result, he has made Charles de Gaulle his home, becoming the world's hardiest transit passenger in an unfortunate episode in the annals of immigration. As Nasseri tells it, his tale is one of mishaps, misfortune and red tape. Expelled from Iran in 1977, following charges of anti-Shah activities he applied for refugee status in several European countries. In 1981 the UN High Commission for Refugees in Brussels granted his request for political asylum. He was furnished with papers allowing him to travel within countries which have signed the Geneva convention on human rights and apply for citizenship. In 1988, however, after several abortive attempts to enter Britain, he lost his refugee certificate at the Paris Gare du Nord railway station. Undeterred, he sought once more to travel to London on a British Airways flight. Without his travel documents, however, he was returned to Paris. What followed was a series of skirmishes with the French authorities. Nasseri was arrested three times for illegal entry into France and detained for brief spells in prisons in the Boulougne and Bobigny suburbs of Paris. Without a country of residence, however, he could not be deported. So he returned to Charles de Gaulle. In 1992, Christian Bourget, a well-known refugee lawyer took up Nasseri's case, successfully appealing against the verdict of illegal entry. 'The courts accepted that he had been granted refugee status in Belgium,' says Bourget. 'So the police leave him alone at Charles de Gaulle. They know there is no point in hauling him in.' The problem is that Bourget has met with less success in his dealings with the French immigration authorities. 'The administration refuses to give him citizenship or to supply him with the documents he needs to leave France,' says the lawyer. Nasseri wields an identification certificate which reads: 'nationality - to be determined'. His applications to enter Britain have also made little headway. From a file among his bags he produces a letter from the consular section of the British embassy in Brussels. 'Although I sympathise with you in your present predicament there is unfortunately nothing this office can do . . . I wonder whether the Belgian authorities can help you in this matter,' the letter reads. But officials in France, Belgium and London reject Nasseri's complaints. The UNHCR in Paris claims Nasseri could claim new documents from Brussels, which originally accepted his refugee status, or could gain access to duplicates of the documents. They say Nasseri is able to leave the airport but has decided not to, a claim which wins some support from Philippe Bargain, airport medical officer. 'I have offered to drive him to Brussels to try and sort things out, but he doesn't want to go,' says Bargain. 'He has found a cocoon at the airport. So he remains stationary in a place of transit.' Bourget says, however, that Nasseri remains in the airport because he is safe there. 'The police at the airport know him. If he travels into Paris he might get stopped and asked for his papers, which of course he doesn't have.' Nasseri says he will leave once he is able to travel to Britain. His attachment, he says, stems from a period of study at Bradford University in the 1970s and his birth in Soleiman, a part of Iran which was under British jurisdiction when Nasseri was born there in 1945. He wants to return to study and will wait, he says, as long as it takes. 'It could be months, it could be years. But I am optimistic.' In the meantime, he continues with his bizarre airport life. Meticulous and well kempt, he uses the airport facilities and travel packs from passengers for washing and trimming his Chaplinesque moustache. He sleeps on a bench between a Burger King and a cafeteria in the basement level of the futuristic Charles de Gaulle building. Despite his unworldly predicament, Nasseri is well abreast of the news. He keeps informed through a tiny radio supplied by Japan Air Lines and is an avid reader of the press. Today he is concerned by the prospects of ratification of the Gatt treaty on international trade and by events in Bosnia. 'After what has happened I doubt my course in Yugoslav studies still exists,' he says, referring to his stint at Bradford. For food, he receives meal tickets from airline staff or sympathetic passengers. Many write to him, care of the boutique basement area of terminal one, and the letters are kept in a file in one of his suitcases. A card delivered that day from Switzerland came with SFr10. It is addressed to Alfred, a name attributed by a court clerk, and by which he is commonly known. What he misses most is 'delicious food' and Marks and Spencer. 'I used to buy my clothes from there in London. I don't care much for airport clothes.' As for Christmas, he is waiting to see what turns up. 'Once I had Christmas dinner in the medical centre. Another time I was given champagne by British Airways,' he says, leafing through his diary. Behind him, the airport speakers announce a flight to London Heathrow. But he has heard it many times before.</p>

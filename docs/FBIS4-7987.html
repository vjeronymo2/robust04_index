			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 7 Apr (TANJUG) -- The UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] command in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] announced today that three UNPROFOR soldiers  detained by the Yugoslav Army on Monday entered Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia territory by mistake.    A statement said the UNPROFOR members "thought they were on  Macedonian territory" and were taken to the Yugoslav border  watchtower of Slavujevac "before they realized they were on FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] territory."    The statement says the blue helmets were allowed to return  to  Macedonia on the same day after several hours of questioning.    UNPROFOR sees this incident as a "minor" one, and believes  that its members crossed into Yugoslav territory because of "the  confusion over the exact location of the border line."</p>

The group, which officials said operated out of Maghnia on  the border with Morocco and which includes 22 defendants being  tried in their absence, is charged with smuggling arms into the  country and helping repatriate via Morocco Algerians who fought  for Afghan guerrilla groups against Soviet troops.    The trial is being heard in Oran before one of Algeria's  three special courts responsible for trying "terrorism and  subversion" cases.    The group is charged with "forming armed terrorist groups,  holding and selling weapons and explosives, and threatening the  security of the state."    Since they were set up a year ago, the three courts have  handed down more than 4,000 sentences, including 420 death  penalties.    Meanwhile security authorities here said six armed  fundamentalists were killed by government forces Thursday and  Friday in various parts of Algeria.    An armed gang had killed a teacher Tuesday while he took a  class in a village near Jijel, northeast Algeria, the  authorities said.    Islamic fundamentalists launched a guerrilla war against  Algerian authorities in December 1991 after the government  voided general elections which the since-outlawed Islamic  Salvation Front was poised to win.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antoaneta Puncheva] </F>   [Text] The National Coordinating Council of the SDS [Union  of Democratic Forces] today discussed the resolution of the SDS  parliamentary group analyzing the boycott of parliament and the  negative assessment of a large number of SDS deputies on taking  part in full parliamentary sessions on a selective basis. In  the view of the National Coordinating Council, in the future  authorized members of the SDS parliamentary group should enter  the plenary hall of parliament to represent SDS interests.  Today the SDS deputies hotly debated their strategy for three  hours, but failed to reach any decision.    The Ecoglasnost National Movement has disseminated an  address  in which it declares that it supports the decision adopted by  the Sixth SDS National Conference to boycott parliament and  conduct extraparliamentary actions.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Hersant takes Czech paper stake HERSANT, which owns the Paris-based daily Le Figaro, France Soir and 27 other smaller newspapers in France, has paid Dollars 22m to buy 48 per cent of Mlada Fronta Dnes, the best-selling daily in Czechoslovakia. Selling 400,000 copies a day, the daily became a private company owned by the employees in August 1990. Already known as relatively progressive before the revolution, it has gained support for its objective and wide-ranging coverage. Hersant already has a stake in the largest daily in Poland, Rezeszpospolita, and in seven other provincial dailies. In Hungary, its owns 49 per cent of Magyar Nemzet, the second largest daily and oldest in the country. In Czechoslovakia, the French group beat competitors from Italy, the US and Germany, including the powerful Algemeine Zeitung press group. Last year, a smaller media joint venture was forged when Eurexpansion, a holding company which includes the Groupe Expansion of France, and Business Week and Dow Jones of the US, bought 45 per cent of Hospodarske Noviny, the most influential economic daily in the country which sells 140,000 copies per issue. The Swiss media group Ringier, based in Lausanne, has also acquired a stake in a newspaper in the northern Bohemian town of Ostrava and has created an economic weekly called Cesky Profit. German companies, dominating foreign investment in the country, have been less successful in striking significant joint ventures in the press.</p>

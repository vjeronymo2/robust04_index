			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- President Ion  Iliescu, now on a visit in Athens, had meetings on 30 March  evening with numerous political, economic and banking  authorities, in a bid to crystallize possible directions to  follow in order to boost the relations between Romania and  Greece. After a meeting of information with representatives of  the Industrialists' Association and of the Chamber of Commerce  and Industry, talks were conducted with Hellenic Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias, with the defense minister G.Arsenis  and other members of the Hellenic cabinet. Offers were made by  either party as well as proposals. The evaluations are  encouraging. President Ion Iliescu said in his toast proposed  at the official dinner offered by Premier Papandreou that "for  more than one millennium, the two peoples have lived through the  same joys and misfortunes, in a region that has only rarely knew  quiet, rather relative at that. The friendship between the two  peoples is neither new nor changing. It has been built upon the  community of historical past characterized by equal wish for  freedom and equal sufferings for getting it.    ``Our political, economic, cultural-scientific relations and  in other domains of mutual interest have recorded a positive  evolution, beneficial to both peoples these last few years.    ``The talks conducted have singled out the two countries'  potential to intensify the Romanian-Hellenic collaboration. I  am thinking especially of the economy, where our collaboration  resources are still not taken best advantage of. I am sure that  during our visit and, in a few days, during the proceedings of  the joint Government Commission in Athens, new ideas will be  singled out as well as specific measures to expand the economic  collaboration and intensify commercial exchanges. I think you  will agree that the total volume of $153 million in 1993 --  which is the value of our commercial exchanges, is rather small.  We think nothing prevents us from expecting a far bigger  volum.''    The president assessed as exquisite the collaboration  between  the two countries on a regional and international plane.    "This time too, I am emphasizing our satisfaction at the  generous support given by the Greek friends to Romania in its  efforts for integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures", the  President said. "Greece has made an important contribution to  the Romania-European Union Association agreement and to our  country's admission to the Council of Europe. We are grateful  to the Hellenic Parliament, that was the first to ratify the  agreement of Romania's association with the European Union."    Referring to the very complex situation in the Balkans, the  Romanian president singled out the Romanian-Hellenic joint  preoccupations and efforts for the cause of peace, stability and  cooperation.    "The political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis is our  common desideratum," Iliescu said. "We think the same of the  undeserved tragedy of the peoples in the area of the  ex-Yugoslavia, and also the serious upsetting of the stability  in the area and even of peace more generally. You too, just  like us, have observed the economic embargo imposed on the  federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro - for  all tremendous costs our economies have incurred. But, in the  spirit of equity, our countries have justly requested that the  burden of the sanctions should be shared as equitably as  possible.    ``Romania is also vitally interested in the development of a  viable system of security in the continent, relying upon the  institutions of European vocation that have proven their ability  to ensure peace and quiet in Europe. We see the NATO decision  on Partnership for Peace as an element of consolidating our  security, equal security for all states in this part of the  continent in the new conditions created by the changes come  about in Central and East Europe.''    Referring to the Balkan Region, President Iliescu noted the  two countries' mutual wish that once the grave and complex  issues faced by the countries there are settled, there should be  a comeback to a normal situation allowing for broad regional  cooperation, of course, not separately, but as part and parcel  of the general processes of Euro-atlantic integration.    President Ion Iliescu hoped that the current top-level  political dialogue would open a new page in the history of the  excellent Romanian-Hellenic relations. "We are very confident  in the future of the relations of friendship and collaboration  between our countries."</p>

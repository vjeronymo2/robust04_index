			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC ponders next step in row with US - US withdrawal from trade procurement talks has put Sir Leon on the spot THE EC is studying all options - including retaliation - in response to the likely US decision on March 22 to bar European companies from winning certain federal contracts in telecommunications and power generation, the European Commission said yesterday. The Commission said Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external affairs, had yet to choose how to respond to the Clinton administration's unexpected withdrawal from talks on the procurement dispute due to open yesterday. But in response to threats of sanctions by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, an EC official said: 'We take him at his word.' Mr Kantor's abrupt decision to call off talks has escalated tensions already inflamed by EC-US disagreements on commercial aircraft subsidies, steel subsidies and the stalled Gatt Uruguay Round. It also has embarrassed Sir Leon, who had claimed that a recent trip to Washington had cemented relations with Mr Kantor. EC officials admitted yesterday that Mr Kantor had failed to make a courtesy call to Sir Leon ahead of last Friday's announcement. One Brussels official described Mr Kantor as 'unpredictable', while others said the unilateral withdrawal amounted to a spur-of-the-moment decision which had surprised the US negotiating team. Mr Kantor broke off negotiations after learning that the EC would not waive Article 29 in the EC utilities directive, which gives European companies a 3 per cent price preference over foreign bidders, while also giving favoured treatment to EC bidders offering more than 50 per cent local content. The EC is ready to waive Article 29, but only if the US agrees to waive buy-American provisions on federal and state contracts in water, gas, electrical and telecoms contracts. US demands that the Community waive the clause before yesterday's talks were tantamount to 'getting us to walk naked into the negotiating room', the EC said. Mr Kantor is due to visit Brussels for talks with Sir Leon on March 29, but the latest row had 'rewritten the agenda', an EC official said.</p>

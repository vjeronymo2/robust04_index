			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Observer: Home again Harry Oppenheimer, the grand old man of South African mining, would dearly love his Anglo American group to be back playing a big part in the Zambian copperbelt. And it sounds as if his wish may come true now Zambia's government is considering privatising ZCCM, the state-run copper giant. Given its historical ties with the area, Anglo is the obvious candidate to run the industry, and in S G Warburg it has a merchant bank with an inside track. Not only is Warburg close to Anglo currently, but it was advising the Zambian government when it nationalised Anglo's huge Zambian copper interests back in 1970. Not that Anglo will hold this against Warburg. The generous hard-currency nationalisation terms provided the foundation on which Anglo's offshore arm, Minorco, was built. Minorco's performance may have been less than dynamic, but it has certainly been a better investment than Zambian copper.</p>

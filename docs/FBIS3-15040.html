Ilyushenko actively  worked for the Interdepartmental Commission on Combating Crime  and Corruption which was gathering damning evidence against some  prominent figures of the Russian opposition, in particular  against Aleksandr Rutskoy. A check on the information gathered  by the Interdepartmental Commission was entrusted to the Moscow  Prosecutor's Office. Some time later, it concluded that the  charges of financial machinations against the former Russian  vice president were unsupportable. Following this, a decision  was made to institute a criminal libel suit. Theoretically,  those to be tried were former members of the above  Interdepartmental Commission, including Mr. Ilyushenko. One  high-ranking Moscow Prosecutor's Office staffer has promised to  speak to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on this score in greater detail.</p>

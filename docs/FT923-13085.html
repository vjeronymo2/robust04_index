			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory revolt over MPs' allowances THE GOVERNMENT suffered a resounding defeat last night when a full-scale Conservative backbench rebellion overturned its efforts to limit a rise in MPs' office expenses to Pounds 4,000. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, looked on, a crowded chamber stayed up into the early hours of the morning to vote by a overwhelming majority of 131 to authorise a rise of Pounds 11,000. The vote came despite the government austerity drive that last week held down senior civil service increases to 4 per cent instead of a 20 per cent figure recommended by the Top Salaries Review Baord. The scale of the government defeat - by 317 votes to 186 - clearly shocked senior ministers on the Treasury frontbench and party business managers. It will also severely undermine efforts to set an example to the country at a time when business is attempting to rein-in wage bills. Advocates of the higher office expenses insisted during an impassioned debate that the rise was not a salary increase for MPs, but merely an overdue rise, needed to ensure their office staff could handle ever-rising workloads. Nonetheless, the jubilant reaction to the government's defeat on both sides of the House constitutes a serious embarrassment at a time when tightened belts are the official order of the day. Defending the government's proposal to restrict the rise in allowances to 9.8 per cent, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the House, accepted that workloads had increased. But he added: 'Many other individuals are being asked to accept pay restraint or find it necessary to impose it on themselves.' A succession of MPs countered, however, that the call for restraint amounted to efforts by the executive to restrain legislators' abilities to serve their constituents and keep checks on the government.</p>

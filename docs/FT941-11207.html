			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Contested call for a patient with patience (2) Sir, What's up doc? I am] It is 2.20 am and I cannot sleep. But then I am a GP. I received my second call since I came to bed at 1.30am, from a patient who couldn't get to sleep. This was my third night without sleep. I suggested she could have contacted me at the surgery yesterday, or later today, and I could have provided her with appropriate treatment, but her problem was now. I pointed out that she was asking me to get up and visit her in the middle of the night because she couldn't sleep and needed to get up for work in the morning. I could not take a sleeping tablet in case I was called out again. I had to get up for work in the morning as well. She had no response to this. So I went to see her and gave her her sleeping tablet. I hope she is asleep, because I'm not. Dr Julia Riley, I heartily agree with you. It is time our patients began to take some responsibility for their own health and not pass it all on to the doctor.

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OCTD RIDERSHIP UP 17.4% LAST QUARTER  </P> <P> Despite a nickel increase in fares, ridership jumped 17.4% on Orange County  Transit District buses in the last quarter, setting a record.  </P> <P> Boardings totaled more than 11 million for the quarter, General Manager James  P. Reichert told the district's board of directors meeting Monday in Garden  Grove.  </P> <P> Revenue rose more than 15%, Reichert said. The nickel increase took effect July  1, raising the fare to 85 cents.  </P> <P> The ridership gains followed a record year in 1988-89.  </P> <P> "Our tremendous ridership growth shows in part that the community is responding  to the air-quality problem by choosing to share a ride rather than only using  their personal automobile," Reichert said. "It's especially important to note  that over two-thirds of our passengers are taking the bus to work, so Orange  County's tax dollars are being used productively."  </P> <P> About 30% of OCTD costs were covered by fares. Like all public bus systems,  OCTD is subsidized by taxpayers.  </P></p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Cyprus may face beds shortage as it woos the tourists TAKE your next holiday in Cyprus, a Pounds 1m advertising campaign told UK television viewers last year. With the Gulf war over and war-wracked Yugoslavia off the tourist map, the Cypriot effort was resoundingly successful. So successful indeed that travel companies now fear the number of Britons arriving in Cyprus this summer might exceed the beds available by as many as 50,000. The Cyprus Tourist Office is struggling to match demand and supply. UK travel companies and hoteliers in Cyprus are being warned that bookings are above expectations. Tour operators in other European countries are being told that the British, who traditionally account for more than 40 per cent of Cyprus's visitors, have already booked many of the rooms. Travel companies give the tourist office high marks for the speed with which it has acted. 'Of all the tourist offices, they're probably the most responsive,' says Mr Roger Allard, managing director of Owners Abroad, the UK holiday company. Other operators are worried, however. Mr George Marcall, sales director of Airtours, another large tour company, insists his customers will get the holiday they booked. He is not certain all operators can say the same. Alarm bells rang last month, when Cyprus's share of UK summer package holiday sales reached 12 per cent, double the previous year's level. The island's hoteliers were, however, hit by the Gulf war last year. Worried about another poor season, many sold the same bed to more than one tour operator to ensure that their hotels would be filled. Tour operators say this is not unusual. However if current sales trends continue, there could be 800,000 British package tourists this summer. Mr Orestis Rossides, the Cyprus Tourist Office's London director, says there are only about 750,00 beds available for them. Mr Rossides promises that no one will have to sleep on the beach. Tourists whose rooms fail to materialise will be moved to the less crowded establishments - with the hoteliers bearing the cost.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK arms exports at odds with 'good governance' objectives Sir, The debate about entanglement between arms and aid has to date missed an important point. Some policy makers and opinion formers seem to be assuming that, as long as there are no more explicit links between aid and arms exports, government policy is quite coherent. But last year, along with other OECD donors, Britain approved a set of policy orientations which, inter alia, urged donors to examine contradictions between their aid and development co-operation objectives and other external policies, 'including the promotion of exports of arms'. The UK has been in the forefront of promoting 'good governance', urging developing countries to reduce military expenditure. What steps has the government taken to scale down Britain's role as a leading arms exporter, in a way that will minimise the negative impact on exports and jobs? The foreign secretary's assurances that arms and aid have not been linked during his term of office is welcome. The next step should be for the government to make clear how, both domestically and multilaterally, it plans to address the gulf between the 'good governance' aspect of foreign policy and Britain's continued promotion of arms in developing countries.

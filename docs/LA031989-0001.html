			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTIMACY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA;  </P> <P> THE DREAMERS BY BRIAN HALL (HARPER &amp; ROW: $17.95; 288 PP.)  </P> <P> Set in Vienna in the mid-'80s, "The Dreamers" is a brilliant and unsettling  first novel that reverberates after its conclusion, suggesting the lives of the  central characters beyond the final pages of the book.  </P> <P> At first glance, it may appear that author Brian Hall attempts too much: AIDS,  interracial relationships, anti-Semitism, suicide, Hitler's influence on  Austria -- but all this is woven into the lives of the characters and becomes  the fabric of their experience. Hall is a remarkable young writer who has the  skill to explore significant issues without turning them into propaganda.  </P> <P> He portrays his male and female characters with equal conviction. At the core  of "The Dreamers" is the volatile relationship between Eric, a Harvard graduate  student on a Rudolph Wiederholt Memorial Fellowship, and Jutta, an Austrian  student at the University of Vienna and mother of a black child.  </P> <P> Reared by unloving grandparents who never touched her, Jutta has been attracted  to men who mistreat her and leave her. Eric doesn't fit into that category: He  accepts her and her 5-year-old son, Timo; he even does most of the housework in  the cluttered apartment on Lazarettgasse that she shares with two other women  and their small children.  </P> <P> Eric is very good at accepting -- after all, he's been conditioned since  childhood to adapt himself to the needs of others: research assistant to his  German-born father, "utterly truthful son" to his mother. "I only lied about  those things that no one could check, such as my feelings and desires."  </P> <P> He is in Vienna because he felt obligated to accept the fellowship that is  named after his dead father and based on his study on the "role of the common  German soldier during the years of Nazi rule," a story that concluded that  "Nazi Germany could have happened anywhere."  </P> <P> Nauseated by the recognition that now it has become his work, Eric drifts and  postpones his research on Austrian Nazi Party members from 1934 to 1938; he  feels like a fraud as he writes his monthly progress reports to the Brigham  Fellowship Committee. He is haunted by the disappearance of Jews in Vienna --  180,000 before the war, 600 at the end of the war -- and by the city's amnesia  when it comes to the war.  </P> <P> Having attempted suicide eight times, Jutta isn't frightened that Eric has  tested positive for exposure to AIDS and possibly is a carrier. She tells him,  "A danger like AIDS doesn't mean anything to me. It's too far in the future."  She sees his condition as "something romantic. . . . Perhaps she even hopes  that it is our condition now . . . a Liebestod."  </P> <P> What makes the sex scenes in "The Dreamers" disturbing, are not the graphic  details but Timo's presence. He "had seen us make love before and he had always  known his mother did this. . . . He never came to lie between us until it was  over. . . . He "undressed and crawled in naked with us, and I let him have his  mother to himself while I went out. . . ."  </P> <P> While Eric's relationship with Jutta becomes increasingly unhealthy, he  develops a strong, caring bond with Timo who, for the first time, lets himself  trust a man. Eric has long talks with him, listens to him, feeds birds with  him. In a moving resolution, Eric pulls free from the vortex of Jutta's  self-destruction and creates a safe place for Timo and himself.  </P> <P> Hall's writing is sure, swift and vibrant. Throughout "The Dreamers," his vivid  descriptions evoke the essence of Vienna: Schonbrunn Palace and other  historical buildings, the prostitutes who have to register and work legal  hours, guards carrying Uzi machine guns, and transvestites who "bum a light  from out of the evening shadows."  </P> <P> Most of the older Austrians are shown as provincial and prejudiced -- not the  best environment for Timo or for Eric's Jewish friend, Josh, a French horn  player from Georgia who stays in Vienna despite his contempt for the Austrians  and plays in the "Tonkunstler Orchestra, the same orchestra that Mozart used to  conduct." His wife Jun, a Japanese musician, can't find work in Vienna where  the orchestras are composed primarily of white males; she spends her days  "listening to the tapes of herself from old Japanese concerts."  </P> <P> "The Dreamers" is a complex novel about boundaries: a child in bed with his  mother and her lover, Jutta and Eric's struggle against co-dependency, four  adults and three children in the cramped apartment, Eric's lies to his mother  and the fellowship committee, even the boundaries Hitler violated in the  Anschluss when he annexed his homeland because of the enthusiastic welcome in  1938.  </P></p>

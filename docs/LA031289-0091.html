			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PLAN WOULD STREAMLINE DOMESTIC LITIGATION  </P> <P> In 18 years presiding over the family law department of Torrance Superior  Court, Commissioner Abraham Gorenfeld said he has seen too much time and money  wasted as divorcing couples struggle for the upper hand.  </P> <P> "I'd been on the (family court) assembly line -- 25 matters in the morning and  another 25 in the afternoon -- for 18 years," he said.  </P> <P> But it was not until last year, while he was convalescing after prostate  surgery, that he had time to survey "the big picture" and "knew the system  didn't make sense. So Gorenfeld summarized his thoughts on simplifying divorce  in an article published in December in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal  newspaper.  </P> <P> The article, "The Future of Family Law," suggested that lawyers should be  removed from divorce cases and replaced with neutral mediators, who would  settle issues ranging from division of community property to child support  payments.  </P> <P> Gorenfeld felt better use could be made of the nearly $1.5 million the county  spends each year to operate its 27 family law courts and for the fees paid by  husbands and wives to their lawyers.  </P> <P> The article has drawn scorn from divorce lawyers -- who say Gorenfeld's plan  would not protect the rights of husbands and wives -- and potential support  from Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, who has asked the county staff  to study it.  </P> <P> Couples who file for divorce in California must have their settlements approved  by a Superior Court judge. Court approval is merely a formality when the  settlement terms are not in dispute, but contested divorces can drag on for  months -- or even years -- with unsettled issues being decided in court.  </P> <P> In his article, Gorenfeld proposed that:  </P> <P> All couples in the state filing for divorce should have their cases heard by a  court-appointed mediator, rather than a judge.  </P> <P> The lawyers who would be appointed as mediators would be permitted to use  common sense in deciding what information to hear and not be limited to the  traditional rules of evidence.  </P> <P> Financial experts and family therapists would advise mediators, suggesting how  to split assets between couples and how to provide for custody of children and  visitation.  </P> <P> The mediators would help couples resolve cases. If unsuccessful, mediators  would set the terms of divorces. Their decisions would be binding.  </P> <P> Review by a Superior Court judge would be permitted in some cases, including  those involving disputed child custody and where more than $50,000 in community  property is at stake. Also, spouses would continue to appear before a judge, as  they do now, to have the terms of the divorce enforced.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Costs Cited  </P> <P> Gorenfeld said the proposal would streamline divorce, cutting the expense of  both husbands and wives hiring lawyers, appraisers and therapists. The  mediators would work with one set of unbiased appraisers and therapists, he  said.  </P> <P> Eliminating the traditional rules of evidence would prevent lengthy delays and  legal posturing that usually cloud the issues, Gorenfeld said.  </P> <P> The 74-year-old commissioner said mediators, also called conciliators, already  have shown their usefulness in settling one aspect of divorce -- child custody  and visitation.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Superior Court began mandatory mediation of such disputes in  1978. Mediators last year resolved 64% of the 6,901 cases that came before  them, said Hugh McIsaac, the county's director of Family Court Services. The  unsettled cases go to court.  </P> <P> County officials said it costs the taxpayers $3,237 a day to run each of the 27  family law courts, compared to the $462 a day for each of the 19 mediators and  accompanying overhead.  </P> <P> Essentially, Gorenfeld's plan would extend the domain of mediators from  decisions about child custody to rulings on alimony, community property and  child support payments.  </P> <P> Presently social workers are assigned by the county courts to mediate child  custody cases. Under Gorenfeld's plan, lawyers would mediate disputes over  community property, support payments and alimony. Mediators would ensure that  both parties in a divorce would have their legal rights protected, Gorenfeld  said.  </P> <P> In 1978, the county estimated that child custody mediation saved the taxpayers  nearly $150,000. Last year, child custody mediators settled five times as many  cases as a decade ago at an undetermined savings to the county, McIsaac said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opponents' Views  </P> <P> Several members of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. said Gorenfeld's proposal  oversimplifies divorce.  </P> <P> Attorney Joseph Taback, former chairman of the bar association's family law  section, said one lawyer working as a mediator cannot serve the interests of  two opposing parties.  </P> <P> "I think it's wrong to have one lawyer (or mediator) serving two clients,"  Taback said. "And I don't think that two lawyers necessarily means that it has  to be more adversarial."  </P> <P> Other lawyers said Gorenfeld is too quick to do away with rules of evidence  that are part of the law to prevent irrelevant and unfair factors from figuring  in a divorce settlement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hearsay Considerations  </P> <P> They said, for instance, that Gorenfeld's proposal would permit mediators to  consider hearsay evidence.  </P> <P> "In a child support case a wife might say, 'So-and-so says she knows (the  husband) has a second job and she always sees him with $100 bills in his  pocket,' " said one South Bay lawyer, who appears frequently in Gorenfeld's  court. "That's total hearsay."  </P> <P> Such second-hand statements are damaging because the person who claims to have  seen the $100 bills is not in court to be cross-examined, the lawyer said. Yet  she said an inexperienced mediator, not restricted by the rules of evidence,  might use such testimony to increase the husband's child-support payments.  </P> <P> Gerald Lichtig, chairman of the family law section, acknowledged that the  courts are overburdened but said that was not reason enough to throw out the  established system for divorces.  </P> <P> He said the executive committee for family law will meet later this month to  consider offering a response to Gorenfeld's ideas.  </P> <P> Another bar association member said: "There is a lot of groundswell in  opposition to this article. A lot of people think it's contrary to mainstream  beliefs on the rights of litigants."  </P></p>

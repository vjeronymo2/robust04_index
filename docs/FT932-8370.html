			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / LWT buys 14% stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV LONDON Weekend Television's parent company, LWT (Holdings), yesterday paid more than Pounds 14m in cash to acquire WH Smith's 14 per cent stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings, another ITV network broadcaster. The deal highlights the growing number of equity stakes independent television broadcasters hold in each other. Among these LWT also owns a 20 per cent stake in GMTV, the breakfast television franchise holder, as does Carlton Communications and Scottish Television. Carlton also has a 19.2 per cent stake in Central and Central has a 20 per cent stake in Meridian. At the same time LWT announced that it has been appointed by Yorkshire as its exclusive agent for the sale of advertising airtime next year. LWT paid 200p a share for WH Smith's entire holding of slightly more than 7.03m ordinary shares in Yorkshire and also agreed to acquire the 1.97m warrants held by the high street retailer for 40p each. The total purchase price for the shares and warrants was Pounds 14.9m and the deal completes the disposal of WH Smith's television and media interests. Under the terms of the initial five-year advertising sales contract, LWT will receive a fixed annual fee plus commission when Yorkshire's share of ITV advertising revenue increases above an agreed base point. Commenting upon the deal, Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman, said LWT had 'great confidence' in the ability of its sales team to increase Yorkshire's advertising revenue share, 'which will benefit LWT through the airtime sales contract and enhance the value of our investment in the company'. Both moves came as Yorkshire announced a decline in interim pre-tax profits which fell from a restated Pounds 9.63m to Pounds 3.79m in the six months to March 31. The decline reflects several special factors, including a further Pounds 1.37m charge to cover redundancy costs and the new ITV licence arrangements which started on January 1. The latest results, prepared using the new FRS3 accounting standard, also include Tyne Tees Television for the first time, which helped push advertising revenues up to Pounds 94.4m from Pounds 75.8m and increase turnover to Pounds 131.3m from Pounds 101.7m. Although advertising revenues increased, the company said the underlying performance was 'not as good as was expected'. Earnings per share fell to 4.7p from 16.8p, but the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.3p.</p>

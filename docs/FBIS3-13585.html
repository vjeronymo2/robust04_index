			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Polisario Front has rejected options A and C of  the report of the UN secretary-general presented yesterday to  the UN Security Council to break the deadlock in the peace  process in Western Sahara. The first option -- option A --  concerns the organization of a referendum of self-determination  next December without taking into account the reservations  voiced by the Polisario Front. The third option -- option C --  is the pure and simple withdrawal of the UN. This, according to  sources close to the Polisario, marks the failure of the United  Nations and can only lead to the escalation of the conflict and  war. As for option B, it envisages the continuation of  negotiations as from 30 June in an attempt to secure the  agreement of the two parties -- that is, Morocco and the  Polisario -- on the criteria of identification of electors  illegible to vote. The Polisario Front voiced reservations on  these options [A and C] as explained by the ambassador of  Western Sahara to Algiers:    [Begin recording] [Ambassador] The Saharans think that these  options need to be amended, that is the commission of  identification of voters should be linked to the so-called  compromise proposed by Butrus Butrus-Ghali. We think that this  compromise is the formulation of the concessions made by our  side. The UN Security Council should thus take into account the  reservations voiced by the Polisario Front, included in the  memorandum addressed to the UN special representative on 25  February.

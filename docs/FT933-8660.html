			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Profits success turns sour for insurance companies: Richard Lapper looks at accusations that the industry is making customers pay for its mistakes BRITAIN's big insurance companies came under fire this week - not for losing money as they have done during the past three years but for making profits at the expense of their customers. Three of the top five general insurance companies - General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance - reported healthy profits for the first six months of this year. The other two - Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance - will follow suit during the next four weeks. The profits represent a turnround for insurers that were hit by a combination of storm damage, subsidence, recession-related arson, theft and domestic losses between 1990 and 1992. The slump in the housing market produced a deluge of claims on domestic mortgage indemnity (DMI) policies. These insure building societies and mortgage lenders against losses on the sale of repossessed properties. The losses, unprecedented for most companies, prompted far-reaching rationalisation and thousands of job losses. Premiums have also been increased sharply. Royal Insurance, for example, increased its average motor rates by 21.2 per cent in 1991, by 22.1 per cent in 1992 and by 17.7 per cent this year. Royal's household policy owners faced average increases of more than 20 per cent over the past 2 1/2 years. More controversially, insurers have begun to change the way they price insurance, charging higher premiums for worse risks. Some owners of houses built on clay soils, which are prone to subsidence damage, have faced rises of more than 100 per cent. Drivers of fast or fashionable cars, regarded as targets for theft, have also paid higher premiums. Critics suggest that it is the sheer scale of these increases which allowed the companies to return to profit. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association, said consumers were 'footing the bill' for the companies' mistakes in the 1980s. 'Rather than looking at product design or reviewing errors of corporate judgment in the past, everything is loaded on to policyholders,' said Ms Eaglesham. She said errors had included the purchase of estate agencies and expansion into the domestic mortgage indemnity market at a time when underwriters assumed house prices could not fall. The criticisms find an echo within the insurance industry. Mr Mark Wood, managing director of Safeguard, one of the country's largest chains of independent insurance brokers, said: 'Past losses are a result of past pricing errors. There appears to be a complacent belief in some insurance companies that their product is completely price elastic. He added: 'Many of the big companies are returning to profit not by increasing efficiency and productivity growth but simply by increasing their prices.' Mr Wood suggested that turbulence in pricing could be increasing inefficiency. He said frequent price rises were leading more people to shop around, with the result that the industry was offering many price quotes that were not accepted. ''Churning' is leading to falls in productivity. It is a self-inflicted problem,' said Mr Wood, who estimates that the industry may be offering quotes on four times as many policies as it sells each year. The industry fiercely rejects such arguments. Mr Roy Elms, underwriting director of Royal Insurance, said: 'In the context of the UK market to suggest you can claw back DMI losses by increasing rates on other lines is absurd. The market just will not allow it.' Insurers also argue that UK consumers have historically enjoyed a good deal from their insurers, with cover generally wider than that available in most European countries. Many European home insurance policies do not cover against the risks of flood or subsidence, for example. Insurers accept that they must avoid sharp rises in prices in the future. Mr Elms, who took over responsibility for Royal's underwriting in 1991, said: 'One of the mistakes insurers made in the past is that they did not put prices up when there were clear indications that they should. The sensible thing to do is adjust prices little and often.' Insurers also argue that they have introduced much greater efficiency into their operations, pointing to falls in their expenses ratios, the industry yardstick which measures efficiency by comparing costs to premium income. Critics suggest that the reforms have been very limited in character and that relatively few companies have seriously tried to reorganise business processes. 'They are nibbling around at the edges,' said Mr Wood.

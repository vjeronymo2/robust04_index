			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CHINA SIGNS U.S. SATELLITE CONTRACT  </P> <P> China signed a $30-million contract today to launch an American-built  satellite, and officials said few obstacles remain in the way of Beijing's goal  of entering the lucrative commercial space market.  </P> <P> The scheduled 1990 launch of the telecommunications satellite Asiasat 1 has  been overshadowed by claims in the U.S. that technological secrets could be  leaked to Beijing during launches of Western satellites and that China's low  prices are unfair competition.  </P> <P> Terry Seddon, head of Asia Satellite Communications, told a news conference in  the Great Hall of the People that agreements on satellite security and pricing  signed by the United States and China late last year have allayed such fears.  </P> <P> The United States has granted the satellite an export license and a meeting of  Cocom -- a body which examines technology transfers to communist countries --  will discuss it later this month, he said. "We anticipate the results will be  favorable."  </P> <P> China has invited journalists and diplomats to its once top-secret Xichang  launch site in the mountains of Sichuan province, in the hope of attracting  more foreign custom for its Long March 3 carrier rockets.  </P></p>

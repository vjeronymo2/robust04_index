			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Brittan distances himself from dispute Sir Leon Brittan, European trade comissionner, yesterday sought to distance himself from the damaging trade dispute between the US and Japan by stressing that Europe did not intend to copy the US in its threat of punitive trade sanctions, Gillian Tett reports. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Brittan said that although Europe was extremely con-erned about its growing trade deficit with Japan, it intended to adopt a more collab-orative approach in seeking to reduce the deficit. He said the EU would seek to use a mixture of diplomatic pressure, backed by extensive trade monitoring to persuade the Japanese government to open its markets, he added, noting that in the last two years European exports to Japan have fallen by 4.5 per cent. Nevertheless, with many EU officials now increasingly concerned about the impact that the US row with Japan might have on the Gatt deal, Sir Leon yesterday called for a new trilateral initiative to discuss trade issues between Japan, the US and Europe.</p>

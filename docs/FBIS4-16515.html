			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- Saparmurat Niyazov and Leonid  Kravchuk have expressed their mutual aspirations to overcome the  difficulties that have arisen by taking both parties' interests  and mutual advantage into account. The presidents of  Turkmenistan and Ukraine met in Moscow today at the meeting of  CIS heads of state.    Agreement was reached that Turkmenistan would resume the  supply of natural gas to Ukraine from 15 April this year, since  the Ukrainian side has found an acceptable solution for paying  off its debts.    The presidents of the two countries approved an interstate  agreement which sets out a clear schedule for the settlement of  payments and reciprocal supplies from Ukraine. Thus, the first  payments amounting to $10 million have already been made and the  supply of goods and various products worth $60 million has  begun. According to the schedule, Ukraine will make payments of  $78 million and supply goods and various other products worth  $200 million every quarter.    During their conversation, the presidents spoke in favor of  actively continuing their dialogue and developing cooperation,  both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the CIS.</p>

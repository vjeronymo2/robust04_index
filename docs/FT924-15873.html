			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Dos Santos takes slim lead in Angola poll FIRST results in Angola's elections last night showed a narrow lead for President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of the ruling MPLA over his main rival Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel Unita movement. But thousands of results from many rural areas which Unita claim as its strongholds still had not been declared and Unita issued its own selective results from these areas showing a 2:1 lead for Mr Savimbi. The closeness of initial results raised the possibility of a second round of presidential elections if no candidate gets more than 50 per cent of the vote. The National Electoral Commission announced official results from 753 of the 5,800 polling stations, which showed Mr Dos Santos leading by 318,082 votes to Mr Savimbi's 166,058 after about 15 per cent of the votes had been officially counted. Mr Dos Santos was making a particularly strong showing in Luanda, Kwanza Sul, Huila and Bengo provinces. In the hotly contested central regions of Benguela, Bie and Huambo - which were always expected to be the critical battleground - Unita appeared to be ahead on the initial results declared. Mr Onofre Dos Santos, electoral commission chairman, said results from polling stations were arriving in Luanda at about 200-300 an hour and a definitive picture would not be clear till morning. Independent pollsters said their preliminary results showed Mr Dos Santos leading Mr Savimbi by 50 per cent to 38 per cent with other parties capturing about 11 per cent of the vote. The United Nations, European Community and other international observers yesterday congratulated the Angolan people for the peaceful two-day ballot, which exceeded all expectations. Miss Margaret Anstee, special representative of the UN secretary general, said the elections were generally peaceful and orderly, although the UN would wait a few days before making a final verification as to the freedom and fairness of the polls. The EC praised the conduct of the election and promised to send aid to the country. International monitors said they were confident that after promises given by the two leaders, both sides would respect the result of the elections.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRADCO SYSTEMS DELAYS MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  </P> <P> Gradco Systems Inc., a maker of copier and printer products, postponed its  annual shareholders meeting Friday and said it will fight an attempt by a tiny  New York publisher to seek representation on the Irvine firm's board of  directors.  </P> <P> New York-based Plenum Publishing Corp., which owns 8.9% of Gradco, said in a  filing last week that it plans to nominate at least one outside director to  Gradco's board. Gradco currently has no outside directors.  </P> <P> Plenum Chairman Martin E. Tash filed a civil lawsuit on Aug. 24 against Keith  B. Stewart, Gradco's chairman, and the company's directors for allegedly  granting themselves warrants to buy a 17% stake in the company's valuable new  Japanese subsidiary at below-market prices.  </P> <P> "We will solicit proxies to replace the board of directors of Gradco," said  Bernard Bressler, Plenum's corporate counsel and secretary. He said, however,  that the New York firm has no plans to acquire a controlling interest in  Gradco.  </P> <P> Gradco said it would seek to nominate its own outside director at the annual  meeting, which was abruptly rescheduled for Oct. 12.  </P> <P> In its suit filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, Plenum alleges  that Stewart and company directors conspired to misappropriate for their own  benefit one of the company's most valuable assets -- its Japanese subsidiary,  worth an estimated $100 million.  </P> <P> A Gradco spokesman declined to comment on the suit.  </P> <P> Besides Stewart, the suit names Gradco officers Joseph Sanchez, president and  chief operating officer, and Mark M. Takeuchi, president and chief executive of  Gradco Japan. It also names two company directors, Thomas J. O'Keefe and Horst  O. Sieben.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the scheme arose from Gradco's reorganization this  spring, in which it divided itself into two operating subsidiaries, Gradco  Printer Systems Inc., a money-losing printer products unit, and Gradco Japan  Ltd., which consisted of the company's lucrative copier products sales and was  96%-owned by the parent company.  </P> <P> As part of the restructuring, Gradco discontinued manufacturing in Santa Ana  and shifted its production to Japan and South Korea.  </P></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Price Waterhouse partner appointed finance director at Courtaulds Howard Evans, a partner at accountants Price Waterhouse, has been appointed finance director of chemicals company Courtaulds. He has had 10 years' involvement with Courtaulds at PW and has been in charge of the group's audit for the past year. Evans replaces Michael Pragnell, who becomes director responsible for Courtaulds' new polymer products division. He spent less than two years in the job, taking over in July 1992 from Richard Lapthorne who went to British Aerospace; previously he was responsible for Courtaulds' coatings activities. The reshuffle is the result of the regrouping of the company's activities into three business areas from April 1. As part of the reshuffle, current coatings and Far East director Eryl Morris becomes development director, responsible for planning, development, research and technology, and Neville Petersen, currently chief executive of European coatings activities, joins the board in charge of coatings activities worldwide, except the Far East.</p>

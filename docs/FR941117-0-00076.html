Assignment of a file number to a notification is for administrative convenience and does not constitute a determination that the notified action has been examined and not rejected by the FCC. Assignment of a file number does not preclude the return of a notification subsequently found to be defective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Defective notifications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A notification is defective if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) It is unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to questions, informational showings, or other matters of a formal character; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It notifies of an action that does not comply with one or more of the FCC rules; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) It notifies of an action for which an application for authorization is required; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) It is submitted without the required microfiche; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) It is untimely filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After a file number is assigned, each notification is reviewed. The purpose of this review is to identify notifications that are unacceptable (e.g. not signed, missing pages, improper or missing fee payment). Notifications found to be unacceptable may be returned to the licensee with a brief statement describing the deficiency. If a notification is found to be unacceptable, the FCC may direct the licensee to return the station to compliance with its previous license terms. Acceptable notifications are added to the appropriate station files. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.125  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Application for special temporary authorizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of Public Mobile Services stations, carriers may request special temporary authority (STA) to operate new or modified equipment. Such requests may be submitted as informal applications (see &sect;22.105) and must contain complete details about the proposed operation and the circumstances that fully justify and necessitate the grant of STA. Such requests should be filed in time to be received by the FCC at least 10 days prior to the date of proposed operation or, where an extension is sought, 10 days prior to the expiration date of the existing STA. Requests received less than 10 days prior to the desired date of operation may be given expedited considerations only if compelling reasons are given, in writing, for the delay in submitting the request. Otherwise, such late-filed requests are considered in turn, but action might not be taken prior to the desired date of operation. Requests for STAs must be accompanied by the proper filing fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grant without Public Notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  STAs may be granted without being listed in a Public Notice, or prior to 30 days after such listing, if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The STA is to be valid for 30 days or less and the applicant does not plan to file an application for regular authorization of the subject operation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The STA is to be valid for 60 days or less, pending the filing of an application for regular authorization of the subject operation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The STA is to allow interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service as previously authorized; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The STA is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

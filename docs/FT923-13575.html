			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tunstall settles out of court - Accountants to pay damages over Sound Diffusion rights issue ARTHUR YOUNG, the accountancy firm which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, has agreed to pay Pounds 1.35m in costs and damages in connection with its role as auditor and adviser to Sound Diffusion, the collapsed electrical equipment leasing company. Tunstall Group, the security and emergency communications equipment supplier, agreed to settle out of court with the accountants after a battle lasting more than two years in search of compensation following its subscription for a rights issue just seven months before Sound Diffusion went into receivership in December 1988. Mr Michael Dawson, Tunstall's chairman, has doggedly pursued his case in the belief that Arthur Young should not have approved the 1987 accounts because of over-stated profits caused by a breach of SSAP 21, the accounting standard dealing with leasing. He also argued that the firm failed in its role as advisers to a Pounds 9.5m rights issue in May 1988 which appeared to suggest that the new money was partly for future growth, when in fact it was essential to support the company's existing losses. However, Mr Nick Land, national managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young, stressed that the firm denied liability. 'We settled to finish the matter and to avoid it going on for a long time,' he said. Mr Dawson issued a writ in November 1989 and continued to put pressure on the accountants right up to the date of the court case, which was scheduled to begin on July 6. Ernst &amp; Young agreed to the payment shortly before that date. In his chairman's statement to the interim accounts for the six months to March 31 this year, Mr Dawson said Tunstall had made a provision of Pounds 670,000 in professional fees for the action to date. Tunstall sought damages for about Pounds 500,000 in rights for which it subscribed on its shareholding at the time of the issue, Pounds 1.2m for other shareholders' rights and Pounds 200,000 for rights it never exercised. In the event, it received full compensation for the first item, Pounds 250,000 towards the second and none on the third. If the case had made it to court, it might have filled an important hole in determining whether auditors have a responsibility to existing shareholders who subscribe for additional shares and buy others' rights in the market. While the settlement requires that neither of the two parties discuss details of the case, Tunstall's complaints can be derived from the highly critical report issued by the two Department of Trade and Industry inspectors on Sound Diffusion in February last year. The DTI report states that Sound Diffusion had recognised 'excessive selling profits' and 'materially over-stated' its balance sheet value in its accounts for the year to December 31 1987 by failing to adequately follow SSAP 21. The report also suggests that the rights issue prospectus was 'misleading' because it failed to point out that the new money was necessary for Sound Diffusion's survival, a fact not pointed out to shareholders in the final version which was circulated. The lead partner on the 1987 audit was Mr Paul Rutteman, now a partner with Ernst &amp; Young, an acknowledged expert on lease accounting and a member of two technical committees of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Yet as the DTI inspectors conclude: 'Arthur Young either failed to identify or otherwise accepted serious defects in the company's lease accounting practices and did not adequately audit the amount receivable under finance leases.' Ironically, Ernst &amp; Whinney was the auditor of Sound Diffusion before relinquishing the job to Arthur Young for the 1987 accounts after a dispute over the stated profits in the previous year. The merger of the two firms in 1989 means that partners from both sides will be involved in the settlement.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-DUFFY AIDE OFF THE HOOK FOR LEGAL FEES  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury has determined that a sheriff's lieutenant was not  personally responsible for $36,000 worth of legal fees the American Civil  Liberties Union won in a 1986 lawsuit against Sheriff John Duffy.  </P> <P> Lt. John Tenwolde, who worked as Duffy's public affairs spokesman at the time  of the lawsuit, co-signed on a $36,000 loan with Duffy to pay the ACLU after  the organization won a lawsuit that accused Duffy of misusing his office.  </P> <P> Duffy had on-duty deputies distribute postcards as part of a campaign to remove  former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird from the state Supreme Court. A  Superior Court judge ruled in 1986 that Duffy engaged in illegal political  activity.  </P> <P> Duffy was ordered to pay the ACLU's attorney fees and forwarded the bill to the  county. County attorneys refused, saying that taxpayers are not liable for the  costs because Duffy's conduct was outside the scope of his official duties.  </P> <P> Tenwolde co-signed on the loan because he played a major role in distributing  the anti-Bird cards, but he sued the county to recoup the money. The loan to  Duffy and Tenwolde was made by William Cowling II, Charles Cono and the late  Arthur Bloom -- all of whom were members of the San Diego County Honorary  Deputy Sheriff's Assn. Duffy failed to report the loan on his statement of  economic interest, as required by state law.  </P> <P> Tenwolde said he was gratified by the verdict. "The jury found I was  essentially performing my duty," he said.  </P></p>

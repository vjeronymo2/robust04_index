			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerald L'Ange] </F>   [Text] For the past five months Angola's MPLA [Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government and the UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] movement  have been engaging in peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia, that have  every appearance of being serious, but may well be largely sham.  The really serious business is being conducted on the  battlefield in Angola -- where South Africa mercenaries are now  fighting in a bizarre change of sides.    While the United Nations-brokered negotiations have made  some  progress, they have failed to reach any agreement that would end  the fighting. Neither side has yet reached a point where it  would see its interests best served by a political solution.  Though ordinary Angolans continue to suffer horribly, neither  political party is hurting badly enough to settle.    The MPLA at present has the advantage politically through  the  international support that followed its declared victory in the  1992 election. It is trying now to seize the military advantage  as well.    UNITA, increasingly friendless in the world, is now  dependent  on military successes to give it bargaining power in the  negotiations or, alternatively, to fulfill what some analysts  believe is the continuing ambition of its leader, Jonas Savimbi,  for a partition that would give him control of a new republic in  the south.    Undismayed by their long history of failure to smash UNITA,  the hawks in the MPLA see in the present situation yet another  chance to win total victory, even without Cuba's help. They are  going all out for a military solution, pushing the doves for the  moment into the background. The hardliners were emboldened by  the United States' decision to recognise the MPLA government and  by the international sanctions imposed against UNITA. While the  sanctions have made it difficult for UNITA to get munitions and  petrol, the MPLA has been spending millions of dollars of its  oil revenue on strengthening its armed forces.    More than R3,500 million [rand] is reportedly being spent on  buying weaponry from Europe, Brazil and China. The Lisbon  newspaper O INDEPENDENTE says the MPLA is in addition buying  R330 million worth of missiles and armoured assault vehicles  from North Korea.    According to the London newsletter AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, R140  million of the MPLA's military expenditure has gone on a  contract with the Pretoria-based firm Executive Outcomes to help  train commando units in counter-insurgency warfare. It is  presumably under this contract that the firm has hired the 500  former SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers who are now  reported to be serving with the MPLA in Angola.    When the South Africans first appeared on the MPLA side they  were said to have been engaged only as security guards to  protect strategic points such as the oil installations at Soyo  (which has since been captured by UNITA) and Cabinda, and they  certainly were once involved in this way. However, some have  recently been reported killed in action in areas far removed  from known security points.    UNITA said, for instance, that 12 South African mercenaries  were killed on March 16 in an action in Lunda Norte province,  between the Lovige and Luxa rivers, an area far from Soyo or  Luanda. This claim, if true, would indicate the involvement of  South African mercenaries in the MPLA's current efforts to drive  UNITA out of the diamond-mining area of Kafunfo in Lunda Norte.    UNITA says the South Africans are also being used in an  offensive against Soyo and that in both areas they are using  North Korean weapons, among others. It puts the number of South  African mercenaries at 2,000, but this could include Angolans  who formerly served with the SADF's 32 Battalion and with  Koevoet [crowbar; former South-West African police  counterinsurgency units] in Namibia.    Executive Outcomes' manager, Lafras Luitingh, was recently  quoted as saying: "The successes that the government soldiers  in Angola have had against UNITA are undoubtedly due to the  South Africans who are involved there." He may have been  referring to training, but the deaths of the South Africans  indicate that they are doing more than that.    It seems clear that former SADF soldiers who once fought  alongside UNITA against the MPLA and the Cubans are now fighting  against UNITA for the MPLA in a combat as well as a training  role. In effect, they are doing for the MPLA what the Cubans  once did, but on a smaller scale.    AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL says the new MPLA commando units, 2,000  men strong, are being used "in a an aggressive strategy,  employing long- range reconnaissance and self-sustaining  platoons reminiscent of the Rhodesian Selous Scouts'. It might  have added that these are equally reminiscent of the SADF Recce  units that operated with conspicuous success against the MPLA  and Cuban forces in Angola.    The MPLA's current offensive appears to have two main  objectives in the north: first, to drive UNITA out of the  Kafunfo diamond area and so deprive it of what is now its main  source of revenue; second, to cut or restrict UNITA's supply  lines from Zaire. And in the centre, the aim is to drive UNITA  out of Huambo, to where it has moved its capital from its former  headquarters in the bush at Jamba near the Caprivi Strip.    UNITA's diamond mining and military operations in Lunda  Norte  province are at present beyond effective range of MPLA aircraft,  and to overcome this disadvantage the MPLA has reportedly been  improving the airfield at Saurimo.    While UNITA is believed to have enough weaponry to wage a  guerilla war for several more years, it will find it  increasingly difficult to take on the MPLA in conventional  warfare or to hold the few cities it now controls. The MPLA  probably aims at least to drive its enemy back into the bush,  lessening its political clout and its ability to demand  concessions in the negotiations. The new commando units might  be especially useful at this stage.    So far, the MPLA offensive has produced no substantial  gains.  Nevertheless, UNITA's vulnerability to the MPLA tactics may have  been exposed when it made important concessions in the  negotiations, beginning with an acceptance of the fact, if not  the manner, of its defeat in the 1992 elections. Concessions  have been made by both sides in the Lusaka talks, and  significant progress has been made on military and political  issues. But the MPLA has steadfastly rejected UNITA's demand  for the governorship of the provinces in which it won the  majority of votes in the election. Since these include the  southern provinces of Huambo, Benguela and Cuando Cubango, the  MPLA understandably fears that control of them would enable  UNITA to secede.    Never far from the centre of the negotiations is the old  problem of how to fit the ambitious and strong-willed Dr Savimbi  into a new dispensation that must inevitably be built around a  government dominated by the MPLA. But that, too, will probably  have to await the outcome of the struggle now being waged on the  battlefield.</p>

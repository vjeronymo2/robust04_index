			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Walid Shuqayr: "Washington Presses for Lebanon's </F> Return to the Negotiations Without Waiting for Syria"]    [Text] Beirut -- Lebanese official sources have confirmed  to AL-HAYAH that the U.S. Administration has asked Lebanon to  resume bilateral negotiations with Israel without waiting for  Syria, to ensure that progress is made in the negotiations on  the Lebanese track.    The Lebanese official sources told AL-HAYAH that the U.S.  request was in fact a hint and that the Lebanese officials just  listened to the U.S. requests and hints and only said that they  were waiting for matters to become clearer on the other tracks  and for the situation to calm down on the military front and for  an end to the Israeli escalations.    Official sources also told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. reaction  to  that Lebanese position was advice "not to wait" because the  waiting policy is futile. The sources added that the U.S. side  did not conceal its view that the Lebanese policy of waiting for  progress on the Syrian track is "provoking the Israelis." The  official sources pointed out that the Americans believe that  matters are proceeding acceptably on the Syrian and Jordanian  tracks and are making some progress and that, therefore, it  would be natural to resume negotiations on the Lebanese track.  The Lebanese officials, however, prefer to make sure that all  is well on the Syrian track before taking any stand on the  resumption of negotiations on the Lebanese track. The Lebanese  official sources said that the U.S. side has for some time been  asking Lebanon to revive the negotiation sessions in Washington  but Lebanon's policy has been one of waiting until progress is  made before taking any steps in that respect.    The official sources also told AL-HAYAH that the U.S.  request, which was passed on along with the Israeli ultimatum  that "a relentless war" would be waged on Lebanon and all  Hizballah positions in Lebanon if the latter retaliated to the  raid on al-Biqa' with suicide operations inside [Israel] and  abroad, was what prompted President Ilyas al-Hirawi to say in a  speech last Thursday that "we will not single anyone out and  will not allow anyone to single us out," and which prompted  Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri to say yesterday that  Syria was the target of the aggression on al-Biqa', and also  prompted Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to declare the rejection  of separate peace.    Official sources say that there is increasing pressure on  Syria in connection with the negotiations, the aim being to  isolate it in order to soften its position by luring Jordan into  the bilateral negotiations, but that would in practice be very  difficult to do with Lebanon.</p>

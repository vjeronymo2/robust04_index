			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT ENCOURAGED IN  COCA-GROWING AREA--On 3 February Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS  reports that, during a seminar entitled "Investment  Opportunities in the Chapare," the Cochabamba Regional  Development Project (CORDEP), the Regional Alternative  Development Program (PDAR), and local businessmen agreed that  the area, which boasts good transportation and power  infrastructure and fledgling hotel, dairy, and alternative crop  industries, has potential for agro-industrial development.  According to the PDAR, the region's bananas, pineapples,  peppers, palmito, and passion fruit already have a secure  national market, international demand, and 48 percent  "profitability." Nevertheless, businessmen stressed that  "serious" investment is needed to develop these industries in  order to move away from a coca economy. LOS TIEMPOS of 2 March  reports that, this year, the PDAR will invest its $17 million  budget in various projects in the Chapare as part of the coca  reduction strategy. Of this figure, $8 million will go toward  improving 200 km of roads; agricultural production will receive  $6 million; and social projects, $3 million. This is a departure  from previous years when most of the PDAR's budget was destined  for the populations of the high valleys to stem their migration  into the Chapare coca-producing region. According to Santa Cruz  daily EL MUNDO of 9 February, Mario Soliz, national secretary  for social defense, assured peasants that, for each hectare of  surplus coca they "reduced," they would receive $2,000 from the  Directorate of Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO) and an  additional "compensatory bonus" of $500.    AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION FOR 1993--La Paz daily PRESENCIA of  27 February reports that, according to the 1993 national  Agricultural Survey by the National Statistical Institute, the  volume of agricultural production (6,353,632 metric tons) rose  2.3 percent from 1992. Overall cereal (corn, wheat, barley, and  sorghum) production rose by 16 percent, the most significant  increase being that of sorghum, which increased 157.4 percent  from 45,600 metric tons in 1992 to 117,400 metric tons in 1993.  Among commercial crops, soybeans enjoyed an "unprecedented  increase" of 47.6 percent while cotton production decreased by  20.4 percent. Santa Cruz Department was the country's main  agricultural producer, followed by La Paz and Cochabamba.  According to Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS of 19 February, Edgar  Talavera, the national secretary for agriculture and livestock,  said that the soybean five-year plan is in effect in Santa Cruz,  which aims at cultivating 1 million hectares for export and  surpassing in importance the "mining and hydrocarbon  industries." Santa Cruz daily EL MUNDO of 9 February reports  that a Colombian investor has just launched Bolivia's largest  soybean processing plant in Puerto Suarez, Santa Cruz  Department. The plant will have the capacity to process 350,000  tons of soybeans annually, enough to produce 65,000 tons of oil  and 270,000 tons of soybean flour. The National Secretariat for  Agriculture and Livestock estimates that $287 million will be  invested in the sector for 1994-1997. Eighty percent will be  financed by pledges made at the Consultative Group meeting for  Bolivia held in December 1993, and 20 percent of the funds will  come from the national budget for public investments. This plan,  according to PRESENCIA 4 February, is part of a larger 1994-2003  "Sectorial Strategy" to make agriculture and livestock raising  the driving force of economic development. LOS TIEMPOS also  reports that, according to the secretariat, agricultural  prospects for 1994 are "very encouraging in general"; the  country will be able to meet its food needs.    ORURO DEVELOPMENT PLANS--On 10 February, the Japanese  ambassador to Bolivia donated equipment and machinery worth $7.2  million for road maintenance and improvement in Oruro  Department. Cochabamba daily LOS TIEMPOS of 11 February reports  that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said that with this  important donation, one of the country's principal "export  corridors," the Oruro-Pisiga route, will be completed.  Furthermore, the Capitalization Plan is widely expected to  convert this depressed mining region into the country's new  railway center and a "pillar" of mineral smelting. According to  the 12 February issue of La Paz daily PRESENCIA DEL PAlS, the  president added that Oruro, as a transport center for exports  and a hub of regional integration, "may become the country's  most important region." In 1994 Oruro Department will also  receive $63 million from the government to be invested mainly in  social projects.    NEW THERMOELECTRIC PLANT--The Mataral thermoelectric plant  was inaugurated on 26 February. Situated 200 km from Santa Cruz  de Ia Sierra, it is estimated that this plant will provide  24-hour electrical service to 25,000 inhabitants across three  provinces of Santa Cruz Department. The plant was financed with  $5.5 million disbursed mainly by the Santa Cruz Regional  Development Corporation (CORDECRUZ) and USAID. [Santa Cruz EL  MUNDO 27 Feb]</p>

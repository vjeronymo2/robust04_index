			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE FROM THE HEART;  </P> <P> PADRES' PARENT DEDICATES SEASON TO A WOMAN WHO STOOD BY HIM  </P> <P> The old lady and the kid. That's what they were to each other.  </P> <P> Rhoda Polley was a retired legal secretary who had agreed to join the Padre  front office as a general manager's assistant, sorting contracts, filing papers  and, most of all, watching over young players. Mark Parent was a runny-nosed  17-year-old baseball player who never should have left his high school coach,  or his mother.  </P> <P> The year was 1979; her first, his first.  </P> <P> Remembers Polley: "He was the one who received about four perfumed letters  every day from his girlfriend. After delivering all those, I'm glad she finally  became his wife."  </P> <P> Remembers Parent: "She was the one person in the front office you could talk  to."  </P> <P> A couple of years passed, and it became obvious that the old lady and the kid  were not that much different. They were both role players, little-known  reserves. Neither was going to become a millionaire from this game. Neither was  going to be famous.  </P> <P> Polley learned the inner workings of the game and became as much an expert on  front-office procedure as any general manager. But Jack McKeon became her  general manager, and although he constantly tried to pass on the credit, he  became the folk hero. She got lost in all that cigar smoke.  </P> <P> Parent was a solid catcher missing the required flash. Every year he showed up  and played hard. But if the Padres ever noticed, they had a funny way of  showing it, running off to Latin America to sign more catchers than they now  know what to do with.  </P> <P> So the old lady and the kid formed a bond. They never talked about it or wrote  anything down. It was just there.  </P> <P> Once, when Parent was fed up with minor league life and decided to quit, Polley  talked him out of it. She then made a habit of sending along sweet notes every  winter with his contract, assuring him that he was being paid fairly, assuring  him he would one day make the big leagues.  </P> <P> He would see her every spring training. He would wave to her in the stands,  stay late talking to her in the office, promise her that, yes, one day he would  make it to the big leagues.  </P> <P> And today, Mark Parent has made it. He is beginning his second major league  season as one of baseball's better backup catchers. Soon his contracts will be  done in big negotiations with big agents.  </P> <P> But there's something missing. It's the old lady. Last week, the day after  another season opened, Rhoda Polley, 65, resigned, because she is suffering  from cancer.  </P> <P> If you were there, you might remember Polley from opening day. She was the  woman being helped to the pitcher's mound before the game by Parent, Garry  Templeton and Tim Flannery. She's the woman you've never heard of who threw out  the first ball.  </P> <P> Mark Parent would like you to hear about her. Hours after her resignation, he  hit a home run against the San Francisco Giants. As he crossed the plate into  the warm arms of teammates and loud cheers of fans, there was only one thing he  could think of. Is Rhoda watching?  </P> <P> "I was home, trying to watch on TV, but my sleeping pills got me, and I was  sleeping," Polley said the next day. "But I still saw him. I don't need to be  watching Mark to see him."  </P> <P> Parent hopes she keeps on watching. The kid has dedicated his season to Polley.  He figures she would do the same for him. That is, if she hadn't already done  the same for him.  </P> <P> Rhoda Polley is a baseball fan. She grew up in San Diego, and became so  enamored that she and her husband bought a house five minutes from the ballpark  so she could walk to games.  </P> <P> Her husband died in 1974. She retired from her job as a legal secretary and  became a baseball fanatic. She had no children, so she saw the Padres as her  children. She attended every spring game, every home game. She became a fan  fixture. Then one day in the spring of 1979, Bob Fontaine, then the general  manager, plopped down next to her in the Yuma box seats.  </P> <P> "He said he needed a secretary, somebody to help out," Polley remembers. "I  asked him, when do I start?"  </P> <P> She has since been through seven managers, three club presidents and two  full-time general managers. Her job was, among other things, to mail the  contracts and keep track of the incentive clauses in those contracts. She once  worked out the language in Alan Wiggins' guaranteed contract so that it made so  much sense, it was sent to the Players' Assn. as a model.  </P> <P> Oh yes, and she played mother to the Padres' minor leaguers.  </P> <P> "I got into a fight with a manager in double-A in 1982, and they wanted to  suspend me, and then send me down, and I told them to stick it," Parent  recalled. "I was on my way to quitting . . . and then Rhoda called. She told me  I was better than that. She told me I was blowing my one chance. She wanted me  to act like a man."  </P> <P> Recalled Polley: "I gave him this speech, and all he said was, 'Yes ma'am.' "  </P> <P> So Parent took the demotion to Class-A Salem. By the next year, he was back in  double A. And from then on, they shared a trust.  </P> <P> "She was a person in the front office I always believed," Parent said. "She  treated me like I was no different than Dave Winfield. During spring training,  she would holler at me from the stands, which was nice when you had nobody  else. She was much better for me than I ever was for her."  </P> <P> Not necessarily.  </P> <P> "Oh, but he was like one of my sons," Polley said. "He treated me like I was  special."  </P> <P> That's why she fretted this winter when, after being diagnosed as having  cancer, she could not reach Parent in the Dominican Republic, where he was  playing winter ball. It wasn't until Parent returned to the United States in  January and called her about spring training reservations -- and the annual  players' pool tournament she sponsors in Yuma -- that he heard about her  illness.  </P> <P> "It was funny, but she told me, and it was like I couldn't get her off the  phone fast enough," Parent said. "She told me I was the last person she would  tell, and it got all emotional . . . so I wanted her to hang up.  </P> <P> "I've never had anybody around me sick like this. I'm not sure how to handle  it."  </P> <P> The Padres showed how they handled it on opening day, when Polley threw out the  ball at owner Joan Kroc's request. After an off-season spending spree that may  put the Padres in contention, Kroc could have thrown that first pitch and  probably still would be hearing the cheers.  </P> <P> "But they asked me instead, and I got so excited," Polley said. "Imagine, me,  throwing out a first ball."  </P> <P> McKeon said: "It's the least we can do. Rhoda has constantly made my job  easier. I was a rookie general manager, and she guided me through the hard  times. I remember, and we all remember.  </P> <P> "If we get lucky enough to make the playoffs or World Series, you bet your life  she'll be right there with us. Even if I have to carry her there."  </P> <P> Although she needed help reaching the mound opening night, it was Polley who  carried the three players when, while still on the mound, they were surprised  by the loud noise from surprise pregame cannon shots.  </P> <P> "We heard this boom, and all of us jumped, but Rhoda," Parent said. "We all  hung on to her."  </P> <P> "Wrong," Polley said. "We hung on to each other."  </P> <P> Said Parent: "You have to understand, I really can't tell her I'm dedicating  this season to her. I don't know how to do it."  </P> <P> He paused. "Maybe I can just show her. I show her, she'll know."  </P></p>

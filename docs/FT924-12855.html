			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Bergonzi's Farewell - Opera NO ARTIST alive embodies what is sublime in Italian opera more truly than the veteran tenor Carlo Bergonzi; but many of us had not realised this until his farewell recital on Friday at Covent Garden. Listening to him, you are caught at once by music, words, feeling. The voice is produced with the ideal blend of tension and relaxation: both exciting and touching. Everything sounds spontaneous, and yet each phrase is a repository of stylistic wisdom. In few artists are expression and technique so perfectly fused. And all is generous, all eloquent. This is aristocratic singing, yet Bergonzi has no jot of superiority about him. Simply, he sings like a man of the people who has been ennobled by art. No one has ever gone to see Bergonzi act. In opera he used to be just as he still is in recital. He shifts his weight, he adjusts his clothes, he clears his throat, he stands, he delivers. This is, however, a singer we have needed to see, so effecting was the presence of the voice. He is always both public and private; he shows that in singing he communes both with his inner being and with us. On Friday, no sooner did he emerge between the great red curtains than a wall of cheers greeted him. It is 30 years since he made his debut at Covent Garden, almost 40 since his London debut, and some 45 since his original stage debut (as a baritone). Since the late 1970s his appearances have been less regular, and people have tended to speak of his singing in the past tense. Ideally accompanied by Vincenzo Scalera, he was in miraculously fresh voice  -seldom sounding older than 15 or more years ago, though often even wiser. And, in a thousand ways, he showed how great an artist he has always been. True, a few notes were under pitch - but not one that was not so musically sustained that it made its effect. A rich programme of songs and arias - Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Schubert, Tosti and more - had the full house caught helplessly between laughter and tears. For all who attended, this was one of the great evenings of our lives. A standing ovation hailed his final aria, and won six encores (with further standing ovations). When he inserted 'the' trill into 'O sole mio,' the house erupted to hear this gesture to Pavarotti and Co; but even more marvellous was how Bergonzi led us all back into the song itself, which he gave with an elegiac grandeur that harks back decades, to such tenors as Fernando de Lucia. Whether in the arias from Masnadieri, Lusisa Miller and L'Arlesina, or in taradiddle like 'Mamma,' he made every word and phrase communicate. When will we ever hear again Verdian recitative so alert with changing emotion? His singing exemplifies a whole lexicon of untranslatable Italian terms. Simply, the recital made us appreciate his art more fully than ever before.</p>

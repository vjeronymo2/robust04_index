			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW: FANNY PACKS AND FANS  </P> <P> Taking a hint from cyclists, skiers and campers, the street-wise are wearing  fanny packs -- also known as belt pouches, hip packs and walking packs. They  come in a wide range of sizes, shapes and colors, and hold everything from  portable phones, Walkmans and walkie-talkies to small change, wallets,  mid-shopping-day lunches or paperbacks.  </P> <P> Mike Lieberman, manager at Oshman's, says his fanny packs "are a very big  item," especially popular with people traveling to Europe. A few years ago,  Lieberman only saw campers buying them, but today the packs are popular for  everyday use.  </P> <P> Made by several manufacturers, including Outdoor Products, JanSport and Caribou  Mountaineering, the packs range in price from $4.99 to $19.99. They are  generally made of heavyweight nylon; some have multiple exterior pockets.  </P> <P> Says Art Heller, buyer at the Surprise Store in Tarzana: "We sell them to  everyone, from kids going to camp to 70-year-old men and women who wear them  when they walk." Some people fill the fanny packs with weights for a heightened  workout, says Heller, whose store "sells a lot of them," he says.  </P> <P> The fanny packs are hard to misplace, lightweight and probably more resistant  to theft than are purses or other pouches that are not strapped to the body.  </P> <P> According to one woman walking down Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks: "It  leaves my hands free for other things."  </P></p>

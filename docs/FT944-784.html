			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro takes over Polish bank for Dollars 10m ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, is to pay Dollars 10m for Interbank, a small, ailing Polish bank, and to inject Dollars 30m of capital over the next few years. The National Bank of Poland, the Polish central bank, took control of Interbank in October 1993 after losses had eroded its capital base. ABN Amro will in effect be rebuilding the bank from scratch by providing initial capital and promising support. In return, it will acquire a 98 per cent stake in the bank, which is to be renamed ABN Amro (Polska). The remaining 2 per cent was owned by small shareholders who declined to sell or who could not be traced, ABN Amro said. Interbank is based in Warsaw and has a branch office in Wyszkow. It had assets of about 242bn zlotys (Dollars 11m) and a workforce of 85 in mid-1994. The Polish bank is active in corporate and retail markets. ABN Amro said it had faced competition from other international banks for Interbank. The Polish central bank had talked to Deutsche Bank of Germany about a takeover.</p>

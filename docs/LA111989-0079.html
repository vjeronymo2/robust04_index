			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EUCALYPTUS TREES STIR IBERIAN ECOLOGY ALARM AS THEY SOAK UP WATER  </P> <P> Ecologists and farmers in Portugal and Spain are at war against spreading  eucalyptus trees. The enemy is a paper pulp industry that encourages the  planting of more and more of them.  </P> <P> Eucalyptus plantations are sprouting in the two countries as the industry seeks  a secure supply of the raw material it will need to meet the demand for paper  as the European Economic Community lowers trade barriers in 1992.  </P> <P> But farmers and ecologists claim that eucalyptus trees drink up too much water  from the soil, endangering traditional olive trees, chestnut and other  nut-bearing trees. They also maintain that the trees cause land erosion that  kills undergrowth vital to the survival of brown bears and other wildlife.  </P> <P> Cellulose producers dispute claims that the trees are harmful. They say  eucalyptus trees grow fast and are ideally suited to Iberian soil and climate  and that plantations will provide more export revenue and create jobs.  </P> <P> The arguments are passionate and tempers run high. In March, protesters in the  Portuguese town of Valpacos clashed with police when farmers tried to rip up  eucalyptus seedlings from a 396-acre private plantation.  </P> <P> The region is Portugal's poorest.  </P> <P> "We stopped them from planting more eucalyptus at Valpacos," said olive grower  Joao Silva. "If they try anywhere else . . . we'll do the same again, but  worse.  </P> <P> "If they want to plant eucalyptus, they should plant where there's plenty of  water. Here we don't even have enough to drink."  </P> <P> Environmentalists contend that the eucalyptus, brought from Australia in the  late 1800s, can turn fertile land into desert.  </P> <P> "The eucalyptus consumes more water than almost any other tree and impedes  other plants from growing nearby," said Santiago Martin Barajas, vice president  of the Federation of Spanish Wildlife Protection Groups.  </P> <P> "Portugal's interior, already poor, is being turned into a giant eucalyptus  plantation, and more people are moving toward the coast, leaving villages  deserted," said Serafim Riem, a spokesman for the Portuguese ecology group  Quercus.  </P> <P> The European Economic Community, which faces a paper shortage, imports $19.5  billion worth of wood annually.  </P> <P> Timber and pulp command high prices, and this encourages landowners to plant  eucalyptus, which can be harvested in 12 years, about half the time of more  traditional trees.  </P> <P> "Eucalyptus for us is green crude oil," said Luis Mira Amaral, industry and  energy minister for Portugal, where wood pulp, paper and cellulose account for  8% of yearly export earnings.  </P> <P> Spanish environmentalists fear that the European Economic Community will  subsidize massive eucalyptus plantings in northern Spain, where the mix of  Atlantic and Mediterranean climates favors growth.  </P> <P> Portuguese landowners already tap European Economic Community funds via the  government's Forestry Action Program. While assistance to traditional tree  planters is higher, the forestry program pays up to 30% of project costs for  small-scale eucalyptus plantations.  </P> <P> "Portugal has no other vocation," said Eliseu Baena, forestry director at  Caima, one of Portugal's four major cellulose producers.  </P> <P> "If landowners want to restore their lands, they're going to do it with a  profitable crop."  </P> <P> Baena acknowledged that eucalyptus trees should be planted away from springs or  rivers but denied that they erode soil or kill undergrowth vital to wildlife.  </P> <P> Antonio Navas, deputy director of Spain's Institute for Wildlife Preservation,  suggested that the environmentalists might be poorly informed.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been a clear debate," he said. "The eucalyptus is blamed for  causing diseases -- for being malignant."  </P> <P> According to Lisbon's General Directorate for Forestry, eucalyptus trees make  up only 11.3% of Portugal's forests, or about 4% of the country's total land  area of 35,600 square miles.  </P> <P> But eucalyptus leads the list of trees being planted in Portugal.  </P></p>

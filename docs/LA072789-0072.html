			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUDIT DETAILING METRO RAIL WOES SPARKS NEW TURF WAR  </P> <P> Reacting to an alarming new audit that shows Metro Rail at least four months  behind schedule and $135 million over budget, Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission officials moved Wednesday to wrest control of the troubled subway  project away from the Southern California Rapid Transit District.  </P> <P> Neil Peterson, executive director of the commission, called for the creation of  a single rail construction agency that would act as a subsidiary of the  commission, supervising construction of Metro Rail and all other county rail  projects.  </P> <P> The RTD, calling the move a "political" act, countered with its own audit that  showed sizable, but smaller, cost overruns in the construction of the first  4.4-mile leg of the subway.  </P> <P> The dueling audits amounted to opening salvos in what could mean a bitter turf  war between the two agencies over ultimate authority for Metro Rail's  construction. When completed, the subway will stretch from downtown Los Angeles  to North Hollywood, a distance of about 16 miles.  </P> <P> Peterson said at a news conference that he also plans to ask members of a Metro  Rail budget oversight panel to order major changes in the RTD's management and  planning of the subway program.  </P> <P> Commission officials said the Cost Reduction Panel has the authority to cut  costs when budget overruns exceed 10% of their original estimates -- the exact  figure of Metro Rail cost overruns reported by the new county audit.  </P> <P> Although the county audit, conducted by the independent firm of Deloitte/Kellog  Joint Venture, used the dry language of accountants to dampen its dire message,  Peterson sternly warned that inflated costs in the Metro Rail project have  already passed 10% of the $1.3 billion project.  </P> <P> "If we don't take immediate control of the budget and project schedule, we have  been advised that (the situation is) likely to deteriorate even more," Peterson  said.  </P> <P> Trying to blunt the impact of the county audit, the RTD responded by issuing  its own figures showing more modest cost overruns of between 5% and 8% of the  agency's original budget.  </P> <P> "By our consultant study," said RTD Board President Gordana Swanson, Metro Rail  "will not be $135 million over the original budget but somewhere between $64  and $102 million. We make no excuses for this."  </P> <P> Swanson questioned the commission's figures, calling them "blatantly untrue  statements."  </P> <P> But despite the rhetoric, the RTD's admission of cost overruns marked the first  time the agency has admitted that major impediments exist to Metro Rail's  progress. In the past, the RTD has insisted that the project would be completed  within its original budget and that subway service would start by September,  1993.  </P> <P> Instead, RTD officials acknowledged Wednesday that continuing difficulties  could delay the start of service of the first leg of Metro Rail by as much as  nine months. The RTD originally projected that the first phase of Metro Rail  construction would be finished by April, 1992, then revised that date to  September, 1993.  </P> <P> Swanson insisted that "a number of changes" would be necessary to minimize the  overruns and delays. But she and other RTD officials said the Transportation  Commission lacks "the expertise or quality to manage funding or construction  for rail."  </P> <P> In recent months, the agencies have escalated their criticism of each other  over how deeply the subway construction project is mired in difficulties.  </P> <P> While the RTD has consistently defended its approach, the commission has  insisted that control over the project should be withdrawn from the district.  The commission has even gone as far as promoting a state Senate bill that would  eliminate the RTD and place administration of Southern California's transit  lines in the hands of the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Joint Financing  </P> <P> Under current contracts, the commission will own the subway and the RTD will  operate the lines. It is financed by federal and local agencies.  </P> <P> But Peterson's call Wednesday to strip the RTD of its control of Metro Rail was  the strongest yet.  </P> <P> "Unless we take action now, the potential for future problems is much greater,"  Peterson said. "There's no likelihood of change unless we make these changes  now."  </P> <P> Peterson said he hopes that the RTD will agree to his call for a new subsidiary  agency. The agency would ensure "that 70 cents of every dollar is going to  construction," he said, "not 50 cents as is the case today."  </P> <P> Before such an agency could be created, the commission would need either  support from the city and RTD or the elimination of the transit district, a  move being considered in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Even if those steps are not taken, Peterson said he is already taking steps to  get action from the Metro Rail budget oversight panel. The panel, which  consists of representatives of the Transportation Commission, the RTD and the  city, can reduce costs if overruns exceed 10% of the original $1.3-billion  budget.  </P> <P> Commission officials said that even if the RTD member on the Cost Reduction  Panel disagrees with the need for action, the other two members can force the  agency to make changes.  </P> <P> "The RTD has to go along with what the majority on the panel agrees to," said  Richard Stanger, the commission's director of rail development.  </P> <P> Repeated calls to Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage for comment on the city's  position went unreturned.  </P> <P> But City Councilman Nate Holden, who has in the past warned of cost overruns,  blamed the RTD for Metro Rail's problems, saying: "We have to hold someone  responsible for mismanagement."  </P> <P> The commission's audit concluded that the RTD management of Metro Rail was  riddled with duplicated effort and "worked against timely decision making."  </P> <P> Adding to the political complications facing those overseeing the Metro Rail  project are rising complaints from many of the subway project's contractors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slow to Pay  </P> <P> The contractors hired to carry out drilling, tunneling, earth-moving and  structural shoring-up work in the Metro Rail project have criticized RTD's  management for reacting slowly to their claims for more compensation for work  already completed.  </P> <P> Webster G. Wiley, president of Foundation Excavation, a firm that handled all  the excavation and earth recompaction for the subway's main maintenance shop  building, was pessimistic about the outcome.  </P> <P> "I don't see how they can get it under budget," Wiley said, expressing  bitterness at claims for compensation that have gone unpaid.  </P> <P> "They hate each other," Wiley said of the two transportation agencies. "They're  both clowns."  </P> <P> Times staff writer John H. Lee contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIFFERENCE OF OPINION  </P> <P>  Comparisons between results of audits released Wednesday by the Los Angeles  County Transportation Commission and the Southern California Rapid Transit  District:  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="4.09IN:2.44IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> COMMISSION  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> RTD  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total estimated  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $135 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $64 million-  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> cost overrun  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $102 million  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Percentage estimate of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5% to 8%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> cost overuns above  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> original budget estimate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> for completion of first leg  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> of subway project  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Length of delay beyond  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4 months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9 months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> RTD's latest estimated  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> date for subway service  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> start (September, 1993)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P></p>

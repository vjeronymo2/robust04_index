			<p>BFN     [Text] Ginanjar Kartasasmita, minister of state for  national development planning and chairman of the National  Development Planning Board, says the government's foreign debts  up to 31 March 1994 reached U.S. $55 billion or 111 trillion  rupiah. Out of that amount, U.S. $38.2 billion belonged to soft  loans obtained from the Consultative Group for Indonesia [CGI],  while non-CGI loans amounted to U.S. $16.8 billion. Minister  Ginanjar Kartasasmita said this during a working meeting of  House Commission X [Roman ten] in Jakarta this afternoon. The  loans have almost entirely been used to finance projects in  various sectors and development programs set by the government.  The projects financed by the foreign loans are generally of  high priority. According to Minister Ginanjar, 9.5 trillion  rupiah of foreign aid has been earmarked for 655 projects during  the 1994-95 fiscal year year.</p>

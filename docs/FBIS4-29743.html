			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- More than half of small  Japanese manufacturers responding to a poll on their planned  overseas investments see China as their first choice, a Tokyo  Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey showed Monday [20 June].    The survey covered 2,300 small and midsize manufacturing  members of the chamber. Of the total, 22.1 percent, or 509  firms, responded.    According to results of the survey and observations of  industry analysts, Japan can expect further "hollowing out" of  its industrial base in the coming years. The analysts noted  that high domestic wages, coupled with an eroding international  competitive power due to the yen's rise, are prompting smaller  firms to set up shop in foreign countries.    Of the respondents, 24.2 percent said they have already set  up wholly owned subsidiaries abroad or acquired an equity stake  in overseas businesses.    The survey also found that 21.6 percent of the respondents  plan to invest abroad. Of these, 91.8 percent said they intend  to invest in Asian countries, with China ranking the highest in  popularity, followed by Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>

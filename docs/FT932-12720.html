			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Rowland reluctant to sell the Observer MR Tiny Rowland has told colleagues he does not want to sell the Observer, the newspaper he has controlled since 1981. Mr Rowland, joint chief executive with Mr Dieter Bock of Lonrho, the international conglomerate, still believes the paper is worth far more to the group in terms of influence than the Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m it is expected to lose this year. Last year it lost Pounds 14.9m. Mr Bock, Lonrho's biggest shareholder with 18.8 per cent, has decided to sell the Observer title and is believed to have the support of a number of other directors who are more interested in reducing costs than owning a lossmaking national newspaper. Mr Rowland's relectance to sell the newspaper, despite bids from Newspaper Publishing, publishers of rival The Independent and its Sunday stablemate, and The Guardian, could mark the first trial of strength between the two chief executives. One of Lonrho's financial advisers yesterday said Mr Bock is as determined as ever to dispose of the Observer. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, declined to comment. The group's shares yesterday rose 4p to 88 1/2 p on a day the market fell. A financier close to Lonrho said: 'The City is clearly pleased that Mr Bock is already making his presence felt by reducing the group's debt and tackling a loss-making operation.' No formal decision has been taken by the Observer board to sell. But if its parent decides to dispose of the title, then the arguments will centre on finding a solution that will protect the existence of Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper. A sale to Newspaper Publishing might be called a merger but would in effect end the Observer's 201 years as a separate title. In a Commons statement on Lonrho's purchase of the Observer in 1981, Mr John Biffen, then trade secretary, said Lonrho should consult the Observer board if it proposed to dispose of the paper at a future date. The Observer board meets on May 4, when the issue of the paper's future will be on the agenda.</p>

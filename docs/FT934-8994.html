			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Lonrho to have audit committee LONRHO yesterday took a significant step towards becoming a more transparent company when its board unanimously voted in favour of establishing an audit committee to review the group's finances. The boardroom showdown between Mr Tiny Rowland, who has run Lonrho for the past 30 years, and Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier appointed last year, appears to have ended in peace, at least temporarily, as the joint chief executives vowed to work together. Mr Bock has made it clear that he intends to press ahead with his plans to turn Lonrho into a more conventional company. The group's first non-executive directors for 20 years were welcomed to the board and will now take an active part in the remuneration committee, to assess pay in the company. Two of the new non-executives Mr Bock nominated to the board, Mr Peter Harper of Hanson, and Mr Stephen Walls of Albert Fisher, are to review the group's strategy as well as looking at the pay of senior directors. Mr Bock, who bought 18.8 per cent of Lonrho at the beginning of the year, is understood to be delighted that the personal acrimony between him and Mr Rowland now appears to be over. 'Peace has broken out on the Lonrho board,' said one ad-viser. The board also welcomed as a non-executive Sir John Leahy, former UK ambassador to South Africa who is close to Mr Rowland, and Mr Terence Wilkinson, managing director of Lonrho's South African interests who has been with the group since 1973, as an executive.</p>

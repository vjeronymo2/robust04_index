			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government firmed up its policy on 16  March to launch effective measures to ease "those regulations  that do not exist in other industrialized countries." The  government did this to promote market liberalization through  deregulation plans which should be drawn up by the end of March.  Specifically, the government wants to ease regulations which  are stricter than those of other Group of Seven (G-7) member  nations to the level of the G-7 by introducing a "ceiling  method" to make uniform reductions, at a time when budget drafts  are being compiled. To accomplish this, the government will  study the possibility of easing safety regulations, which are  considered a sacred area, and review various inspections --  including quality inspections on foreign cars and electric  appliances, customs safety inspections on imported food and  cosmetics, standards for construction work, and building codes  for the floor space of buildings in relation to the size of the  lots on which they stand. The government plans to specify the  measures in the second stage of market liberalization to be  announced in late June.    The "ceiling method" will be introduced to break the  deadlocked current situation in which deregulation is not being  promoted due to resistance from ministries and agencies which  have the right to issue licenses and permits.    First, all regulations will be divided into government  regulations, public and nonprofit foundations' regulations, and  private sector regulations. Then they will be further  classified into regulations which do not exist in other  developed countries but only in Japan, regulations which exist  in the United States and the European Union, and regulations  which exist in all other developed countries. After that, all  ministries and agencies will be asked to ease those regulations  which are peculiar only to Japan and over which they were  originally given the right to issue licenses and permits.  Fundamentally, the government plans to take measures designed  to ease the regulations which exist only in Japan to the level  of regulations in Europe and the United States, or otherwise  remove them completely.    The government will review its regulations in different ways  depending on their importance and the intensity of demands from  Europe and the United States. However, the reviews will be made  from the following viewpoints: 1) regulations, which exist only  in Japan, will be removed or otherwise the government will  clarify their contents if it is impossible to remove them; 2)  the government will try to match the building codes and  standards with those of other countries; and 3) data of  inspections made in other countries will be used in lieu of  customs inspections conducted by Japan when foreign goods are  imported.    In the case of European cars imported to Japan, for example,  inspections during the manufacturing process and inspections  upon completion are needed because the European Union requires  inspections during the manufacturing stage, and Japan requires  inspections on completed cars. Japan will now remove its  mandatory requirements for inspections on completed cars.  Moreover, Japan will accept North American construction  material standards without any change in an attempt to expand  imports of construction materials produced on the basis of North  American standards.    Japan restricts construction of special structure  two-storied  homes, saying the Building Standards Act is "not pertinent for  such technical inspections." However, the government will study  the possibility of easing or abolishing the regulations to make  its systems match the current situations in Europe and the  United States. Because of this, the government expects that  housing constructions will gather momentum.</p>

Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China and vice-premier of  the State Council, made these remarks during his recent  inspection of the mountainous regions of North China's Hebei  Province.    Li visited five middle and primary schools in Shijiazhuang,  capital of the province, Baoding city and Baoding Prefecture on  January 30-31.    He visited schoolrooms and teachers' dormitories and sent  regards to the teachers on behalf of the State Council. He  encouraged them to make greater contributions to education in  the countryside.    Rudimentary education concerns the quality of the entire  nation, Li stressed repeatedly during his trip. Governments at  all levels must perform rudimentary education work well in the  countryside in accordance with local conditions, he said. Li  also discussed with provincial officials the development and  reform of higher education, vocational education and adult  education during his stay in Hebei.    More than 800 million of China's 1.16 billion population  live  in the countryside.</p>

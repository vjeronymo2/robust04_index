			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec sprints back to Pounds 0.78m profit HI-TEC, the sports and leisure wear company 54 per cent owned by its founder Mr Frank van Wezel, returned to the black in the six months to July 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 776,000 against losses of Pounds 2.8m. Strong growth in the US helped the company record a 29 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 59.4m. Mr Peter Butler, finance director, said the profits improvement stemmed largely from the decision to close the European subsidiaries built up last year, thus eliminating annual losses of about Pounds 7.5m and fixed costs of some Pounds 3m. Mr Butler said the European footwear operation, which now relied on distributors to sell the Hi-Tec product, had broken even in the first half. However, the leisure wear division, Bad Boys, had incurred higher losses, leaving Hi-Tec with a Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.4m) deficit in continental Europe. In the US Hi-tec benefited from a trend away from white sports shoes towards light weight boots in earthy colours. The group, which claims 10 per cent of the Dollars 600m (Pounds 397m) light weight outdoor footwear market in the US, 'is really roaring away' Mr Butler said. Including currency gains, sales in the US doubled to Pounds 23.6m with profits jumping from Pounds 636,000 to Pounds 2.1m. Hi-Tec also boasted a better year in the UK because of the demise of the price war in the sports shoe market and a reduction in staff, stocks and debtors. 'As a result we have been able to get back a huge chunk of the margin we lost last year,' Mr Butler said. The UK and Irish division, which sells both sports shoes and the hiking boot, had returned a small profit of Pounds 793,000, against a loss of Pounds 861,000, on flat sales of Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 19.6m). The dividend was increased by 25 per cent to 1.25p. Earnings per share were 1.4p against losses of 4.86p. COMMENT The shares rose 4p to 64p following one of the most optimistic statements this group has made for some time. Yet this does not mean there is a queue of people waiting to buy into this tightly controlled company. Gearing remains at an uncomfortable 100 per cent plus, which almost certainly means an equity issue to raise cash for the rapidly growing US side. Then there are the nagging doubts following Hi-Tec's sudden tumble into loss last year and the sudden resignations of two powerful non-executive directors in March after just eight weeks in the job. These anxieties are unlikely to be dispelled until the final results at the earliest, leaving little upside in the immediate future. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 2.5m, leaving a prospective p/e of about 15 times.</p>

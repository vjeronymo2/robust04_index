			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Connally always in LBJ's shadow: Obituary JOHN Bowden Connally, who died on Tuesday at the age of 76, might have been the second coming of another legendary politician from Texas, Lyndon Baines Johnson, but in the end the most important national post he held was as US Treasury secretary from 1971-72. Silver haired and silver tongued, the Democrat-turned-Republican lawyer from Floresville, Texas, always aimed high and thought big. He cut his political spurs running LBJ's first campaign for the House and as his administrative assistant in the Senate in the late 1940s, and his business ones as a legal adviser to Mr Sid Richardson, the notorious Texas oilman, in the 1950s. With these connections and credentials, President John F Kennedy named him secretary of the navy in 1961. Two years later he was governor of his native home state. On November 23 that year in Dallas he was in the car in which the president was assassinated and he was himself severely wounded. Three times elected governor, he was nonetheless increasingly out of sorts with the national Democratic party as it swung to the left. In 1971, while retaining his nominal party loyalty, he took the extraordinary political gamble of accepting President Richard Nixon's invitation to become Treasury secretary. He only formally became a Republican after LBJ's death in 1973. The two years he served Mr Nixon were distinctive, to put it mildly, as he imposed his style and bluster on the US and the global economic community. Not only did he preside over the imposition of wage and price controls in 1971 but he also supervised the demise of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates when he took the US off the gold standard at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington in the same year. Mostly untainted by the Watergate affair, but not by subsequent financial scandals of his own, Mr Connally so impressed Mr Nixon that the president had to be dissuaded in 1972 from ditching vice-president Spiro Agnew in his favour. Mr Nixon returned the compliment in his final days by trying to block federal charges that Mr Connally had accepted illegal political donations from the milk lobby (he was subsequently acquitted). But by then it was already assumed that his sights were set on the White House itself. In this he never got far past the starting post, neither in 1976 nor, most ignominiously, in 1980 when he spent more than Dollars 12m from his own pocket and secured precisely one delegate to the Republican convention that year. He was heard making complimentary noises about a fellow Texan, Mr Ross Perot, in last year's election. The 1980s were generally a disaster. A real estate venture with a former Texas lieutenant governor went sour, forcing him to file for bankruptcy and to put up his considerable private collection of art, furniture and assorted mementoes for public auction. But he remained active in Texas politics until the Senate primary two months ago when he sought to prevent the victory of Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, installed this week as the new Republican senator. Mr Connally was always known for his quotability. One that has endured for for nearly 20 years was a famous blast against Japan, when he threatened that if he had his way their cars 'would never leave the docks at Yokohama'. His failure to achieve his ultimate ambition may be ascribed to several factors. He was a political turncoat and was thus spurned by Democrats, while never fully trusted by Republicans, and was ultimately upstaged by Mr Ronald Reagan, ironically also a turncoat but without Mr Connally's reputation as an opportunist. His financial wheeling and dealing, if very much in the Texas mould, also looked out of place in the post-Watergate era of a new morality. He ended where he began, in LBJ's long shadow, teaching an occasional class in political science at the department of the University of Texas named after the former president. It was said to be wildly popular.</p>

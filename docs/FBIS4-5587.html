			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, which won  the most shipping orders in 1993, has been supplanted by Japan  this year, the Korea Shipbuilders' Association (KSA) said Friday.    Korea received shipping orders worth 339,000 tons in  January-February and 672,000 tons in March to total 33 vessels,  or 1.01 million tons in the first quarter of the year, 97  percent of the 1.04 million tons recorded a year earlier.    Japan, on the other hand, won orders for 43 vessels, or 1.92  million tons in January-February.    Considering it landed almost all large ship orders in March,  Japan received nearly three times as many orders as Korea.    There is little profitability in Korea's workload as each  ship averages 30,600 tons, far below last year's 43,900 tons and  Japan's 44,900 tons.    Due to low-priced offers by the Japanese industry,  international ship prices slumped from 20 percent to 30 percent  this year from recent years.    Korean shipbuilders therefore tend to bid for small ships  and  leave the riskier and bigger vessels to their Japanese rivals,  KSA officials said.    The double-hull very large crude carrier (VLCC) that cost  100  million dollars two years ago now sells for 85 million dollars,  prompting Korean companies to avoid bidding for large ships, the  officials said.</p>

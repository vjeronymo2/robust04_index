			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Berlusconi weakened by an own-goal: The Italian premier will find it harder to control cabinet after the fiasco over the judiciary decree The remarkable winning run of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, has come to an end. Both his personal authority and his standing as a politician have been seriously dented by his mishandling of the controversial decree to limit the judiciary's power of arrest. The media magnate-turned-politician boxed himself into a corner from which there was only one viable exit - a humiliating compromise. The precise form of that compromise was still being hammered out yesterday between Mr Berlusconi and the two main partners of his Forza Italia party in the coalition, the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. But, in any event, the government must rework the legislation to avoid the disastrous impression created by the original decree that Mr Berlusconi and his colleagues were no longer interested in seeing corruption investigated and punished. If Mr Berlusconi had not chosen to back down in this way, his two-month-old right-wing government would almost certainly have collapsed. For this own-goal he only has himself and his political inexperience to blame. The decree, which came into effect last Thursday, sought to prevent improper use of arrest by magistrates. All too often during the anti-corruption investigations of the past two and a half years, preventive detention has been used not merely to stop people from fleeing the country or tampering with evidence. It has been a means of psychological pressure to obtain confessions, without which the corruption scandals would never have been brought to light. Mr Berlusconi's first miscalculation was to underestimate the reaction of the magistrates. The Milan magistrates' anti-corruption team led by Mr Antonio Di Pietro - who is so popular that Mr Berlusconi tried to persuade him to join the cabinet - resigned in protest. The magistrates claimed the new decree undermined their work and by the weekend hundreds of those held in detention on corruption charges had been allowed home on house arrest. These included Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health minister, while the decree removed the threat of imprisonment from Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader who has been ignoring an arrest warrant from his seaside villa at Hammamet, Tunisia. The premier's second error was to assume that his partners, having signed the decree, would remain loyal. Aso soon as the League and the MSI saw the hostile public reaction to the jails being emptied of the allegedly corrupt they began to wash their hands. Mr Roberto Maroni, the League's astute interior minister, immediately claimed he had been misled into signing the decree and called for it to be changed. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, then weighed in. Aware that his party had drawn much of its original support in the north precisely because of its anti-corruption stance, he threatened to pull his party out of the government. The third error was to rely too much on opinion polls. Mr Berlusconi's privately commissioned polls told him the public was no longer so interested in the corruption scandals. But it seems the questions did not include the crucial one: would the public tolerate the exodus from jail of those caught up in the corruption scandals? This aspect has particularly angered the public. Moreover the public, forever suspicious of something done in a hurry, smelt a rat in the use of a decree rather than a law which must first pass through parliament. A decree has immediate effect, subsequently approved by parliament. It seemed too much as if Mr Berlusconi was acting to protect his own interests. The magistrates are investigating several different aspects of operations within Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire that includes the alleged payment of illicit transfer fees for footballers at AC Milan and alleged corruption in the granting of television licences. These errors have combined to weaken the substantial power within the cabinet that Mr Berlusconi has accumulated since taking office in May. Mr Berlusconi's trump card has been his acknowledged popularity. He has used this to whip his dissident coalition members in the League into line. In so many words he has frequently threatened: 'Obey me or I'll call early elections.' The threat held good because the League and the MSI knew they risked seeing themselves being overwhelmed by Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia - perhaps even to the point of no longer needing both as allies. But on this occasion the threat has been without teeth. For their part, Mr Bossi and Mr Maroni have found in the ill-conceived decree an instrument with which to cut Mr Berlusconi down to size. Mr Maroni's claim to have been misled into signing the decree is unconvincing. But by opposing the decree, they have been seen as championing a much needed revision of the text. In particular, corruption cases affecting the public administration were considered in the decree as crimes insufficiently serious to merit preventive detention. This will be changed. The premier will no longer find it easy to run his cabinet in a presidential style. More importantly, with his prestige damaged Mr Berlusconi will be less sure of his public standing; and he will be thus less willing to wave the threat of early elections. Mr Berlusconi probably did himself further harm in the public eye by the way he retreated over the weekend to his villa at Arcore outside Milan like a wounded animal. From there on Monday he proceeded to call on Mr Emilio Fede, his most faithful admirer and anchorman on his Fininvest's TG4 news. Viewers were treated to a series of fawning questions which allowed Mr Berlusconi to let go his anger on his allies. A total of 32 minutes were calculated to have been given by Mr Berlusconi on Monday to his television channels - none to the RAI, the state broadcasting corporation. Yesterday Mr Fede again overdid himself in trying to portray his master as having saved the day by being magnanimous enough to give ground when others refused to compromise. Mr Berlusconi has indeed saved the government from collapse. But in making concessions he will find it harder to control an already disparate cabinet. And if the rebels have found one cause they may well now look for another. This could be Mr Berlusconi's conflict of interest with his media empire.</p>

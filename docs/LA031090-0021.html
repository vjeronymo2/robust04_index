			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO MAKE MORE DOLLARS  </P> <P> I couldn't believe what I was reading. Brian Weston (Viewpoint, March 3) wants  to get rid of Curtis Crayon, who has picked winners paying $253 more than Bob  Mieszerski, and replace him with "someone who knows what he is doing."  </P> <P> Then he calls Mieszerski's picks "rock-solid and professional." A person goes  to the track to make as much money as he can, not to see how many winners he  can pick.  </P> <P> WALTER HARRIS, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / French overnight rate lowered to 9.25% THE Bank of France yesterday took its biggest step towards lower interest rates since the effective flotation of the franc at the beginning of the month. However, it confirmed its gradual approach towards reducing borrowing costs. The central bank cut overnight lending rates to 9.25 per cent, half a point lower than the rate it set on Tuesday when it trimmed the 24-hour rate from 10 per cent. The 5-10 day borrowing rate, suspended during the currency crisis at the end of last month in an attempt to tighten liquidity and protect the franc, was unchanged at 10 per cent. Currency analysts in Paris said yesterday's move showed France was adopting a 'step-by-step' approach to interest rate cuts following the widening of the franc's fluctuation bands within the exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. 'The direction is downwards, but cautiously,' said one economist in Paris. 'The government is not going to do anything to scare the currency markets and has made it clear that it won't cut interest rates quickly as Britain did after it left the ERM.' The franc strengthened following the rate cut, rising by about one centime to close at FFr3.511 to the D-Mark. The French stock market, buoyed by the expectation of rate cuts, continued its rally yesterday. The CAC-40 index rose by 1.3 per cent to close at 2,167, its highest level since April 1990. The index has risen by more than 4 per cent since the franc's ERM fluctuation bands were widened, despite the slow progress towards reduced borrowing costs. France's cautious approach to interest rate cuts has puzzled some economists who believed the government would use its greater freedom within the ERM to cut interest rates quickly in an attempt to stimulate the economy. But Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has staked his credibility on maintaining a strong franc and is reluctant to risk a rapid depreciation of the currency by aggressive interest rate cuts.</p>

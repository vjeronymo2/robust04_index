			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  left here this morning for a three European nation tour that  will cover Austria, Germany and Romania.    Li will fly to Europe via Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region.    The Chinese premier was invited for the two-week trip by  Austrian Prime Minister Franz Vranitzky, German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, and Romanian President Ion Iliescu and Prime  Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    Meeting the press at the Great Hall of the People here prior  to his departure, Li Peng said that "the visit will help boost  the friendly relations and co-operation" between China and the  three European countries.    He said that China wishes to see further development in the  co- operation with them in economy, trade, science and  technology, education and other spheres.    During his current return visit, Li will exchange views in  depth with leaders of the three countries on both international  and bilateral relations, especially bilateral economic  co-operation.    Li expected that some governmental agreements and business  accords will be signed with the three countries during his trip.    Western Europe now has a population of over 370 million and  its total GNP has overtaken that of the United States, he noted.    In addition, it boasts advanced technologies, and has  adopted  a relatively open attitude toward technology transfer to China,  Li said.    China has had very good trade ties with the region, Li  stressed.    Li said there has been a long history of co-operation  between  Germany and China, and Germany ranks as China's biggest trade  partner in western Europe.    Li revealed that his entourage includes not only  high-ranking  officials, but also executives from over 30 large and key  enterprises in metallurgy, power, petrochemicals, automobiles,  machinery and trade. All of them have direct business links  with Germany and Austria.    Li expressed the belief that the visit would bring fruitful  results to the economic co-operation between China and the three  countries.    During his absence, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji will act as  premier.    The premier's entourage includes Vice-Premier Li Lanqing,  Minister Wang Zhongyu of the State Economic and Trade  Commission, Vice-Minister Ye Qing of the State Planning  Commission, minister Liu Qi of the metallurgical industry,  Director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council  Qi Huaiyuan and Vice-Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.

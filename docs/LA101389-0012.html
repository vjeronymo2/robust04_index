			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REDUCES ACTOR'S SENTENCE BY A YEAR  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Superior Court judge has reduced by one year the sentence of an  actor charged with felony drunk driving during a crash that injured a Studio  City man and his two sons.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Richard G. Kolostian, who sentenced Kenneth  Charles Swofford to 28 months in June, reduced the sentence by one year  Wednesday, saying it was a hardship on Swofford's family and that he had erred  in making the initial sentence so stiff.  </P> <P> Swofford's attorney, John Yzurdiaga, had requested the sentence reduction.  </P> <P> Swofford, 55, who played a high school principal in the television show "Fame,"  which aired in syndication until 1987, had pleaded no contest at an earlier  hearing to drunk-driving charges stemming from the Dec. 11 accident.  </P> <P> Swofford was driving west on Ventura Boulevard when his car swerved into  oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into a car driven by George Charous, 37,  of Studio City. Charous suffered a broken leg and fractured spine. His son,  Paul, 11, suffered a skull fracture, and his other son, Stephen, 6, suffered a  broken leg.  </P> <P> At the time of the initial sentencing, Kolostian noted that the actor had no  prior history of arrests or convictions, but the judge said he was going to  give Swofford a stiff sentence because "unless a first-time drunk driver is  sentenced to jail time, we won't have any effect on drunk drivers."  </P> <P> Under terms of a plea bargain, Kolostian could have given Swofford a maximum  sentence of four years.  </P> <P> Kolostian also ordered Swofford to pay $9,600 in restitution to the Charouses.  </P></p>

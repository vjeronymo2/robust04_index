			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Watmoughs slides to Pounds 8.1m WATMOUGHS, one of the UK's largest printers, yesterday reported a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 8.1m, for 1991. The decline was blamed on the lower volume of advertising revenues, mail order and retail sales, all of which were adversely affected by the recession. However, the company said the decline occurred in the first half, when profits dropped to Pounds 2.6m compared with Pounds 5m last time. A recovery was experienced in the second half, when profits reached Pounds 5.5m. The second half figures were also lifted by the group regaining the printing contract for the Saturday Times Review after losing it temporarily in the first half. Sales improved from Pounds 102m to Pounds 107m. Earnings per share fell to 21.34p (32.45p) and a final dividend of 8p is recommended making a total for the year of 10.5p (10.25p). The Pounds 22.3m rights issue in March was taken up by 89.8 per cent of share- holders with the balance placed with institutions. The shares yesterday rose 5p to 420p. The cash was used for a new gravure printing facility in Spain as part of the group's expansion on in continental Europe. Mr Patrick Walker, chairman, predicted that within three years 30 per cent of the group's sales would come from Spain, Hungary and exports from the UK. Exports for 1991 totalled Pounds 3.7m compared with Pounds 1.6m in 1990. Capital expend- iture increased to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 13.5m). Gearing at the year end was 30 per cent (borrowings of Pounds 19m) against 28 per cent last time.</p>

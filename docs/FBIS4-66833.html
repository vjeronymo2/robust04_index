			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Fathallah: "Mubarak's Initiatives To </F> Solve Youth Problems To Be Implemented"]    [Text] Implementation of President Mubarak's initiatives to  resolve youth problems and assume their burdens, by means of the  Social Development Fund, will begin on 1 May 1994. This process  will subsidize production opportunities for small projects and  provide new job opportunities, in order to contribute to a  solution for the unemployment problem.    This was stated by Dr. Husayn al-Jamal, the Social Fund's  secretary general, who pointed out that the initiatives include  lowering the interest rates on loans for new youth projects to 9  percent instead of 10 percent. These are projects financed by  the Arab Fund, for which the sum of 550 million Egyptian pounds  has been allocated. So far, 160 million pounds of this amount  have been used, with 390 million pounds remaining. This is being  done through five national and private banks.    Negotiations are being conducted with the World Bank to  lower  the interest rates that are currently being applied to the  manufacturing community's loans. This rate is currently 10  percent, with 68 million pounds allocated through three banks.  About 32 million pounds have been used, benefitting 30,000  individuals. In an agreement between the fund and the Ministry  of Social Affairs, it was decided to allocate 1 million pounds  to establish a joint center, for the purpose of developing  products, improving their quality, and promoting marketing.    The Social Fund's secretary-general added that in view of  the  youth's difficulty in obtaining information and determining the  best investment opportunities within industrial, engineering,  agricultural, agricultural processing, services, and handicraft  fields, guidance programs have been prepared for them. This was  done after it became evident that 80 percent of the projects  were for the readymade clothes industry, tricot, spinning, and  weaving.    The committee has finished preparing 65 programs, embracing  land survey, materials, labor, employment expenditures, and the  economics and profitability of the project.    A committee will also be formed, composed of Dr. Muhammad  Ibrahim Sulayman, the minister of state for new urban  communities, and Zafir al-Bashri, vice president of the National  Investment Bank, to draft implementation regulations to transfer  ownership of units in new cities and urban communities to young  people at token costs and on long term installment payments of  up to 30 years, similar to housing projects.    Dr. Husayn al-Jamal indicated that the maximum loan for an  individual project ranges between 35,000 and 50,000 pounds. If  there are multiple partners, the loan could go to 200,000  pounds, in order to ensure that it would cover the project's  costs of purchasing equipment, machinery, and production  requirements.    The secretary-general said that a republican decree has been  issued to exempt small projects from paying taxes on commercial  profits during the period of the loan, for a maximum of five  years.    To solve the problems of marketing the products of young  graduates and craftsmen, the Executive Committee of the Social  Fund, chaired by Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri, deputy prime minister and  minister of planning, decided in its recent meeting on a  strategy of marketing subsidies to end the problems that small  projects face in participating in local and international  exhibitions. It was also decided to establish permanent  exhibitions and create a center of marketing studies for small  projects. This center would include an information unit, a unit  for marketing studies and research, and a quality improvement  unit.    An agreement has also been reached with governmental  organizations to help the youth in marketing their small  projects' products by giving priority to their purchase.</p>

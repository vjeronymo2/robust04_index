			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (1): A bigger slice of the cake - The future looks promising for a sector that should grab moreof the marketing budgets than in the past MOST industries have walked through fire and ice in the current recession, and the conferences and exhibitions business is no exception. But unlike others, there are plausible arguments to suggest that, while uncomfortable for those who have gone out of business, the recession has been a useful maturing process for the surviving organisers of conferences and exhibitions. It has thinned out those with limited ability to offer the full-blooded support increasingly demanded by corporate management, trade fairs and international associations. Those that have survived - and many have - have been tempered by the experience. They have invested in crucial information technology and databases in advance of demand; they have pruned excessive staffing; they have adapted to client demands to organise a conference or exhibition with far less advance notice. In general, the economic squeeze has sharpened up thinking in a sector which has - with justice sometimes - been criticised for flaccidity and a failure to match promises with achievements. After all, who has not been tempted into attending an event by its glossy pre-launch publicity, only to discover on the day that it was not worth the effort? If the recession has killed that off, it will have provided a service. It is hard to estimate the current value of the international conference and exhibition business. Too many variables exist for definitive accuracy. The sector covers a broad range of functions - conferences, seminars, conventions, forums, symposiums, meetings - the list of types of function and possible venues is almost endless. Nevertheless, industry estimates calculate the sector may be worth Dollars 40bn annually, with Britain taking around 10 per cent of that pie. About 8,000 major international conferences are staged annually around the world, of which 5,000 are in Europe. The choice of venue is huge and growing, ranging from the internationally distinguished, such as the purpose-built Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in the political heart of London - where the 300-seat Mountbatten room, secure against electronic eavesdropping, with multi-lingual simultaneous interpretation, a splendid three-course lunch and plenty of refreshments, will set you back Pounds 5,300 (plus value added tax) a day - to any number of secluded country house hotels, ideal for the private small company annual general meeting. Because the conferences and exhibitions industry crosses so many boundaries  -hotels, leisure centres, large publicly quoted groups such as Blenheim to small organisers working from a spare bedroom - it is almost impossible to establish how many involved in the sector have gone under as a result of the recession. Certainly, the length of many conferences is now shorter, attendances are down and advance bookings happen later. But the blows have largely been taken in the corporate sector; companies have chosen to spend less on customer-oriented conferences, more on internal, staff-aimed sales and training conferences. Conferences involving international associations have been less badly affected, since they are normally required by their own statutes to stage regular conferences. The recession has not had a blanket, homogeneous effect; in the case of new product launches companies are, if anything, boosting their spending on conferences and exhibitions. Vauxhall, part of General Motors, will have spent well in excess of Pounds 1m on a five-stage event between February and June in the UK, launching a new model, the Corsa, via Spectrum Communications. The future, nevertheless, looks promising for this sector, not just because the companies involved in it are themselves given to relentlessly self-promoting optimism, but because the nature of marketing communications is shifting, in ways which favour this sector grabbing a larger share of marketing budgets than in the past. Vauxhall, for example, will achieve the following in its Corsa launch for a relatively small marketing spend: 16 simultaneous exclusive dinners for dealer principals and their partners; four regional launch venues for dealer principals, their staff, guests and local business users; a multitude of hands-on nationwide training sessions for sales managers and their staff; other launch events at points of sale; and a driving evaluation event at which dealers and guests can try out the new product range. Naturally, Vauxhall will also spend heavily on conventional television and press advertising, but the most cost-effective marketing for its new product may well be the relatively hidden expenditure, closely targeted on salesforces and key business customers. Perhaps the single most important trend within marketing at the moment is the shift away from broadcast to narrow cast means of reaching out to customers. Exhibitions and conferences, if properly organised and publicised, provide a relatively cheap and certain way of creating a relationship between seller and buyer. Exhibitions doubled their share of marketing spend between 1981 and 1991, from 4.7 to 9.3 per cent, while television advertising stood still (from 26 to 26.2 per cent) and national newspapers' share shrunk (from 16.9 to 14.8 per cent). The exhibition sector's growth averaged 18.4 per cent a year over that decade. Venues are doing much to provide not just crude value-for-money, but added extras to entice organisers. Ms Gill Price, commercial director of the QEII conference centre, says: 'One potential exhibitor was interested in knowing if it would be possible to organise an internal television relay of the forthcoming Wimbledon tennis men's singles' final this coming summer, so that those who would be setting up his exhibition at the centre would be able to watch the match as they worked. Being able to provide such extras is increasingly important if you want to get the business.' Hotel chains are now actively marketing themselves as conference venues as well as tourist destinations. Inter-Continental Hotels offers a 'European Meetings Portfolio' guaranteeing a daily delegate rate fixed until March 31 1994 and a complimentary room for every 15 booked, across 40 European locations. Conference centres are looking at how to make their venues more attractive. For instance, the NEC at Birmingham intends to erect an entertainment village the size of Wembley football pitch to go alongside Ipex '93, the September 7-15 trade show for the print and graphics industry. The village, set up by the exhibition company Button Eventures, part of Reed International, is based on an idea which has evolved at Cannes media festivals over the years. In a commercial world increasingly cluttered by marketing developments and daily more confused by technological developments in broadcast media and database manipulation, there is probably only one certainty: it will become more difficult to get the attention of customers. Given that, the conference and exhibition business has a head start against other sectors of marketing communications. As the explosion in broadcast media continues, marketing professionals involved in narrow cast, close targeting exercises should be able to take advantage of a situation where finance directors have learnt to ask of marketing departments: 'What am I getting for my expenditure?' Certainly, for business-to-business marketing, it increasingly makes less sense to lavish fortunes on the high-cost, little obvious return involved in using broadcast media. If you want to speak to your customers, build a database and use that to make the customers whom you already have feel important. And from the profile of existing customers it is possible to identify and target likely others. That is precisely what conferences and exhibitions can offer. And for organisers of conferences and exhibitions one trend stands out; the sheer number of available venues means that would-be organisers of events should be able, even when the recession lifts, to demand the very best in extra facilities, if not the very lowest in prices.</p>

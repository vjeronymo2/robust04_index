			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: ING profits advance 8.8% to Fl 358m in first quarter INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company, said first-quarter net profit rose by 8.8 per cent to Fl 358m (Dollars 200m), on turnover up 8 per cent at Fl 12.5bn. The pre-tax profits of the group's insurance activities rose by 8.5 per cent to Fl 228m, outstripping a 4.5 per cent increase to Fl 255m at NMB Postbank, ING's banking arm. Strong growth in international lending helped ING's total loan portfolio expand by 3.1 per cent to Fl 130.4bn in the first quarter compared with the quarter to December 31 1991. Although growth in the important domestic lending sector was limited to less than 1 per cent, foreign lending rose by 13.1 per cent. Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch insurance group, reported a 17.8 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit to Ecu73.3m (Dollars 56.93m) with all main sectors except car insurance posting higher results. Operating profit grew more slowly, rising by 10.6 per cent to Ecu72.0m. Revenues were up 22.9 per cent at Ecu2.3bn. The rise in net profit was aided by a sharp increase in capital gains to Ecu28.6m from Ecu17.0m. The company, formed in 1990 through the merger of Amev, the Dutch insurer, and its Belgian counterpart Groupe AG, said full-year capital gains may not reach the 1990 and 1991 levels.</p>

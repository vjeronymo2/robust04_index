			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS: BEACH VENDORS' DAY IS OVER IN ACAPULCO  </P> <P> Street and beach vendors are a thing of the past in Acapulco.  </P> <P> At least, that's what the new law says.  </P> <P> Under legislation enacted three weeks ago in the Mexican resort city, all  peddlers have been given public work employment or afforded easy credit to  purchase a stall at one of three flea market locations.  </P> <P> Shoppers looking for Mexican jewelry, crafts and souvenirs at bargain prices  will now have to shop at one of the three flea market areas located at either  end and midway on the main street, Carretera Miguel Aleman.  </P> <P> The project has a $1-million budget that provides manual training facilities  where ex-peddlers will learn trades and where children that have been abandoned  can receive shelter and job training for the future.  </P> <P> According to Acapulco tourism authorities, visitors will no longer see young  children begging in the streets, or selling gum.  </P> <P> Mideast Advisory: In the wake of Iraq's military invasion of Kuwait, the U.S.  Department of State has advised Americans to postpone all travel to those  countries and also to defer travel to Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates  and the eastern portion of Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Gain in Spain: Drift out of your lane on the autopista? Overtake on the  wrong side near Seville? Fail to watch your speed outside Barcelona? Don't look  for the Guardia Civil to turn a blind eye.  </P> <P> Spain recently put tough new penalties into effect to curb errant motorists,  raising fines by as much as 100% to reduce the number of accidents on the  nation's highways.  </P> <P> This is good news from a safety standpoint but bad news for travelers. Since  they have no fixed address in the country, tourist drivers very often have to  pay the fines on the spot. And the amounts levied are not small.  </P> <P> Minor infractions can result in a penalty of up to $150. More serious incidents  can cost up to $450, while very serious infractions can mean an instant fine of  as much as $2,400. Failure to pay usually means the vehicle is impounded until  the fine is paid or the matter is settled in court.  </P> <P> Euphemism Alert: The following opening sentence graced the latest newsletter  issued by the China National Tourist Office in London:  </P> <P> "The first quarter of this year saw a steady recovery in China's tourism, which  suffered a landslide following the accident last June."  </P> <P> Quick Fact: The Mediterranean Sea covers an area of 965,000 square miles and  has 70 cities and towns with populations of more than 100,000 along its  28,000-mile coastline.  </P> <P> Five Easy Pieces: It was London map maker John Spilsbury who invented jigsaw  puzzles in 1762 when he mounted engraved maps on sheets of wood and cut them  out along national boundaries to help teach geography.  </P> <P> Spilsbury would be amazed to learn that his puzzling idea is now a $145-million  industry in the United States alone.  </P> <P> This weekend, the finals of the national jigsaw puzzle championships are being  held in Athens, Ohio. Contestants compete in timed singles, doubles and junior  contests to see who can complete previously unmarketed puzzles the fastest.  </P> <P> The event at the Dairy Barn Cultural Arts Center also includes an exhibition of  antique jigsaw puzzles, the trading of puzzles and a puzzling carnival.  </P> <P> A Little About the Lot: The River Lot in France has been reopened to navigation  after a $5.4-million renovation of its lock system. The river meanders for mile  after scenic mile past hillside castles and caves, vineyards and limestone  cliffs, and used to used to transport wine and cheese by barge on its way to  Bordeaux.  </P> <P> Fallen Arches: The arches at the border between Mexico and Nogales, Ariz., will  be torn down so that the number of checkpoints can be increased to eight,  according to Mexico's Excelsior newspaper.  </P> <P> Alvaro Obregon Luken of the National Tourism Fund said a modern immigration and  customs services building will be erected over the eight traffic lanes.  </P> <P> He said 3.6 million foreigners cross into Mexico through Nogales each year.  </P> <P> New Bite From Big Apple: Tourists and business travelers alike are returning  from the New York City with loud complaints about the new 5% state tax tacked  on to hotel rooms that cost $100 or more per night. The latest levy is added to  an already existing sales tax of 8.25% and a city hotel tax of 5% plus $2 per  room which totals approximately 20% of the hotel. That could tax anyone's  patience.  </P></p>

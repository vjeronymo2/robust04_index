			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Russian securities licence for CSFB unit CS First Boston's Russian subsidiary has been granted a securities licence by the Russian ministry of finance. The licence allows the firm to trade and underwrite equity and debt, and is the first to be granted to a foreign-owned institution. The bank's main focus will be on the over-the-counter stock market, where turnover is currently an estimated Dollars 800m a month, according to Mr Boris Jordan, co-head of the Russian subsidiary. Mr Jordan expects Russia's capital markets to expand rapidly, due to growing interest from emerging market investors. He predicts financial investment of around Dollars 5bn in Russia this year. Other foreign banks have been slow to follow CSFB's lead in Russia, citing lack of sufficient flows of business and infrastructure difficulties. But Mr Jordan insists that CSFB's Russian subsidiary 'has been a profitable operation from the start'.

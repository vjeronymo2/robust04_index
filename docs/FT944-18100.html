			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: Yevgeny Onegin - Opera in Mezieres If there is an operatic event unique to Switzerland, it must be the annual late-summer production at Mezieres, a farming community in the rolling countryside north of Vevey. The Theatre du Jorat resembles an extended barn, not much altered since it was built in 1908. It has primitive facilities, wooden benches and no heating. Acoustics and sightlines are good. The place has a knack of inspiring festival standards - but the atmosphere front-of-house is informal and unpretentious. This is popular art at its best. We have to thank Renee Auphan - now in her final season as director of the Opera Lausanne before moving to Geneva - for making the most of Mezieres these past ten years. The small pit limits the choice of repertoire, but she has proved resourceful. We have had Gluck, Monteverdi and Mozart. This year she chose Yevgeny Onegin, in the original orchestration for 32 musicians. The idea was to restore some of the artless simplicity Tchaikovsky had in mind when he handed its premiere to students of the Moscow Conservatory. And so the conductor, Louis Langree, was despatched to Russia to find the correct instrumental parts. In the end, the music sounded impoverished: perhaps we have become too accustomed to big-house Tchaikovsky. But Langree's hasty tempi did not help, and the strings of the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra sounded thin and wiry. The real rewards were to be found on stage, in a production by Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser which spoke volumes with modest resources - at least in the first two acts. The wood-panelled veranda and interiors at the Larin estate were a natural extension of the theatre's own decor. Here was a pastoral idyll, a natural frame for intimate scenes. But the designer, Christian Ratz, failed to find an appropriate metaphor for the St Petersburg act, which unfolded on a dark, snow-covered driveway. Sub-zero temperatures are hardly conducive to ruminating about love. The cast was full of young, international singers making useful careers. Gino Quilico's Onegin was irresistible - a bearded beau of impeccable vocal distinction. His cool vanity worked well at first - this was a man for whom swooning women were clearly an everyday occurence. But his failure to register so much as a hint of vulnerability robbed the finale of poignancy. The other men were very much in his shadow. Marcus Haddock made a well-schooled Lensky, though the voice never really bloomed. Romuald Tesarowicz was the dutiful Gremin. The women had more to say. Bernadette Antoine's Larina, for example, cut an unusually chic and gracious figure, not unlike the ageing matrons you see around Lausanne. Gabriela Popescu's sumptuous mezzo was heard to advantage as Olga. Michal Shamir's Tatyana lacked tonal sweetness, but offered compensation in her portrait of repressed passion - pale and anorexic at the start, a girl with a Mills and Boon idea of love. The naive obsession of the Letter Scene was powerfully conveyed, verging on hysteria in the exchanges with Jocelyne Taillon's classic Filipyevna. This was the dramatic watershed, giving the rest of the performance an unfair sense of deflation.</p>

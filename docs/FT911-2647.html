			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: Car tax, the industrial damage and the illogicality (2) Sir, Your leader ('A plea for the motor industry', April 25) makes some good points about the discriminatory special car tax but is illogical with regard to company cars. You rightly differentiate between perk cars and work cars. Would you not agree that the chancellor should also have so differentiated, instead of proposing an increase of 20 per cent across-the-board in all car benefit scale charges?

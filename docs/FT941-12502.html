			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / BT halts performance pay plan for 26,000 managers BT has suspended its performance-related pay scheme for its 26,000 managers after only 10 months, claiming that they are already paid too much. BT says its managers receive up to 14 per cent more than the market rate. At present the income range of its managerial and professional grades is from Pounds 17,128 a year to Pounds 34,931. The company has now decided that 10 per cent of its managerial high-flyers will receive rises of up to 6 per cent this year, although a 'significant' number of the rest will receive unconsolidated payments worth 2 per cent. Some will get nothing. 'The majority of our managerial and professional grades enjoy rates of pay significantly above those of appropriate comparators in the industry,' Mr Peter Archer, BT's employee relations director, said in a letter to Mr Simon Petch, general secretary of the Society of Telecom Executives. He added: 'To ensure that the company has a competitive cost base in the medium to long term, it is essential that our approach on pay should seek to address this key issue.' The union responded angrily. 'The company's approach is inconsistent and wholly at odds with the philosophy of rewarding people for performance,' Mr Petch has replied. 'Unless substantially modified it will have a devastating effect on the morale and commitment of the management staff.' He added that BT had made a 'fundamental breach of its own performance-related pay scheme'. The union disputes the way BT carried out its pay comparisons and says it has been refused access to the raw data. BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance was a strong supporter of the performance-related pay scheme, believing it would stimulate greater effectiveness. Britain's biggest company has changed rapidly since privatisation 10 years ago as it has become more aggressively commercial. The number of its managers has been cut by 6,000 while management productivity has risen by 82.4 per cent in terms of operating profit since 1986. BT's managerial pay bill was Pounds 663m last year and brought a 4.8 per cent rise in its overall costs. This year it hopes to keep the total pay bill increase down to 2 per cent.</p>

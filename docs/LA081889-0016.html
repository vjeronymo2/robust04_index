			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LATE FILINGS FILL ALL SCHOOL DISTRICT RACES  </P> <P> Late filings for school board races in seven South Bay school districts added  seven candidates to an already-large field and ensured that every district will  be able to fill vacant seats in the Nov. 7 election.  </P> <P> Filing was extended until Wednesday in districts where incumbents had not filed  for reelection by the close of the regular filing period Aug. 11. Those are the  Lawndale, Wiseburn, Manhattan Beach City and Hermosa Beach City elementary  school districts; the South Bay Union High School District, and the Palos  Verdes Unified and El Segundo Unified school districts.  </P> <P> As of the initial filing deadline on Aug. 11, the Manhattan Beach City School  District had only two candidates for three seats. That was remedied this week  when two more contenders, Bernard E. O'Connor Jr. and Ronald G. Durham, filed  papers with the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder. They will face  incumbents Gary R. Collins and Rosa Lee Saikley.  </P> <P> The late filing period also produced two more candidates in the Palos Verdes  Peninsula Unified School District race, which is expected to focus on the  secession efforts of residents who live on the east side of the district.  Brenton F. Goodrich and Brigitte Scheuegraf added their names to the list of  contenders seeking three vacancies on the board. Both favor a single district,  as do Jeffrey Younggren and Marlys Kinnell, the incumbents seeking reelection.  </P> <P> The secession fight was sparked two years ago when the board voted to close  Miraleste, the east side's high school. Candidates who have favored secession  or a guarantee to keep Miraleste open, are Peter Gardiner, Barry Hildebrand and  Marianne Kipper. Scheuegraf has said she favors keeping Miraleste open but is  opposed to secession.  </P> <P> In other additions to the lineup, Gerald L. Wellfonder and Martha Castillo del  Muro filed for the board of the El Segundo Unified School District.  </P> <P> The race for four board seats already included incumbents Timothy T. Chang and  Ruth Parks, along with Jim Butterworth, Rich Reed, Ken Schofield, Patricia  Walker, Jerry Walters, Nancy Wernick and Keith Wise.  </P> <P> A lawyer, Chang last month was ordered disbarred by the state Supreme Court for  misappropriating money from a client. The court found he had "misappropriated  over $7,000" from Mellon Bank of Philadelphia. The bank hired Chang in 1983 to  collect $78,983 owed it, but he kept more than $7,000 for himself as a fee,  according to the Supreme Court decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bank Filed Complaint  </P> <P> The bank disputed the fee and filed a complaint in 1984 with the State Bar of  California. The State Bar recommended Chang's disbarment. On July 27, the state  Supreme Court agreed, finding that, in addition to the misappropriation of  funds, he had "fraudulently delayed the State Bar's investigation."  </P> <P> Chang could not be reached for comment this week. The disbarment takes effect  Aug. 26.  </P> <P> Also filing this week was Gregory J. Kelsey, who is a candidate for one of  three vacancies on the Hermosa Beach City School District. The other candidates  are incumbents Mary Lou Weiss and Lynne Gonzales, as well as Bill Druar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No New Candidates  </P> <P> No additional candidates turned in papers for the Lawndale, Wiseburn and South  Bay Union High School districts, where filing had also been extended.  </P> <P> Following are candidates in school races that did not gain candidates this  week:  </P> <P> Incumbents Bonnie Coronada and Robert Kruse and challenger Thomas Wayne Garrett  for three seats on the Lawndale School District board;  </P> <P> Incumbents Walter Guerrero and Daniel Juarez with challenger Angelina Garza for  three seats on the Wiseburn School District board;  </P> <P> Incumbents Tom Downs and Lyn Florey, plus Jim Duffy for three South Bay Union  High School District.  </P> <P> In a race not related to schools, Teresa Sun became a candidate this week for  the Palos Verdes Library District, where filing was also extended because an  incumbent did not seek reelection. Previously filing for the two vacancies on  Palos Verdes library board were incumbent Janet Smith, Frances Bolton and Alex  Rennie.  </P></p>

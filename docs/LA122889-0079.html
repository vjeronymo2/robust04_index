			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING THE MUSCLE ON FLAB  </P> <P> It may be a sluggish holiday retail season, but it's boom time for the folks  who sell exercise machines to help us burn up the guilt of holiday calories.  And sweat, we are told, has gone high tech.  </P> <P> High tech has brought us "electronically enhanced stationary cycles" in place  of ordinary stationary bikes. If you want to find out if you have too much fat,  a mere pinch of the upper arm will no longer do; now, a little machine that  looks as if it could also give you the temperature of your roasted turkey can  tell your percentage of body fat. Will discussion of body fat percentages now  join small talk about cholesterol levels as acceptable conversation over  dinner? Or, more appropriately, over a couple of glasses of mineral water?  </P> <P> These state-of-the-art machines and devices are the latest weapons in the never  ending battle against flab: This time of year television, radio and newspapers  are full of ads for speedy weight- loss promotions and programs. Some play on  the guilt angle, typically showings pictures of slothful persons breaking  springs on bathroom scales. Or there is the fantasy approach, with ads  featuring the sinewy bodies of professional models -- the implication being  that you can look like them if only you pulled yourself out of the easy chair  and jumped onto the treadmill. And there are year-end sales for memberships in  gyms that offer the use of exercise machines complete with video screens and  sound effects that duplicate the exertion of climbing stairs, riding bicycles  or rowing boats.  </P> <P> But some experts say that since the body's cardiovascular system does not know  the difference between walking up real stairs and using a machine to duplicate  the task, the equipment's price tags are an expensive affect merely to satisfy  a need for digital computer numbers and "bells and whistles." Instead of using  sophisticated machines, one exercise science professor proposes a radical idea:  walking daily wherever you can do it (no charge on that yet, unless a personal  trainer walks with you). That makes more sense, he suggests, than having people  drive and take elevators to go to a club filled with exercise machines.  </P> <P> He may be right. But we hasten to suggest that if someone were to invent a  motorized sidewalk cart that offered a sumptuous holiday meal, a cool drink --  and maybe a bell and a whistle -- that most of us would walk quickly after it.  In fact, such a machine would probably sell like, well, hot cakes.  </P></p>

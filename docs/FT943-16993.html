			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Human genetic blueprint scheme French researchers have launched an Dollars 11m programme to sequence and analyse the regulatory regions of the human genetic blueprint, which make up about 5 per cent of all human DNA. They are responsible for activating genes and controlling the way the genes produce proteins, Clive Cookson writes. The programme will be carried out jointly by Genset, a biotechnology company based in Paris, and Genethon, a charity funded by an annual telethon. Together they are setting up a Tres Grand Sequencage laboratory, which they believe will be the first in the world dedicated to sequencing and analysing the regulatory code - as opposed to the genes themselves.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Magdalen Y. Greenlief or John F. Gonzales, Special Program Examiners, Office of the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Patent Policy and Projects, at (703) 305&hyph;9285 or by mail marked to their attention and addressed to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, DC 20231. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This proposed rule change is designed primarily to implement the changes in practice related to patent term provided for in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110. In addition, it is proposed to simplify the procedures for filing continuation and divisional applications which will benefit both the Office and the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 154 of title 35, United States Code, currently provides that every patent (other than a design patent) shall be granted for a term of seventeen years from the patent issue date, subject to the payment of maintenance fees as provided for in title 35. S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 amend 35 U.S.C. 154 by establishing a 20-year patent term from the date of filing of the application. Specifically, the legislation provides that the patent term will begin on the date on which the patent issues and will end twenty years from the date on which the application was filed in the United States. If the application contains a specific reference to an earlier application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c), the patent term will end twenty years from the date on which the earliest application relied on was filed. As amended by S. 2467 and H.R. 5110, 35 U.S.C. 154 excludes from determination of the patent term any application on which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119, 365(a) or 365(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 further provide that the term of a patent may be extended, for a maximum of five years, where the issuance of a patent is delayed because of (1) proceedings under 35 U.S.C. 135(a), (2) placement of the application under a secrecy order pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 181, and/or, under certain circumstances, (3) appellate review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or by a federal court. The total extension available is limited to five years regardless of whether there were delays due to more than one of the reasons covered by the legislation. This extension is separate from and in addition to the patent term extension available under 35 U.S.C. 156. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 establish a domestic priority system. In accordance with the provisions of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the term of a patent cannot include the Paris Convention priority period. The legislation provides a mechanism to enable domestic applicants to quickly and expensively file provisional applications. Applicants will be entitled to claim the benefit of priority in a given application based upon the previously filed provisional application in the United States. The domestic priority period will not count in the measurement of the term. Thus, under the legislation, domestic applicants will be placed on an equal footing with foreign applicants with respect to the patent term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35 U.S.C. 111 is amended by S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 to provide for the filing of a provisional application. 35 U.S.C. 41(a)(1) is amended to provide a $150.00 filing fee for each provisional application, subject to a 50 percent reduction for a small entity. The requirements for obtaining a filing date for a provisional application are the same as those which previously existed for an application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111, except that no claim or claims as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, is required. Moreover, no oath/declaration as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 115 is required. The provisional application is also not subject to the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 131, 135 and 157, i.e., a provisional application will not be examined for patentability, placed in interference or made the subject of a statutory invention registration. Further, the provisional application will automatically be abandoned twelve (12) months after its filing date and will not be subject to revival to restore it to pending status thereafter. Benefit of the filing date of the copending provisional application may be claimed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(e), as contained in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110, in a continuing application during these 12 months. A provisonal application will not be entitled to claim priority benefits based on any other application under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121 or 365. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 amend 35 U.S.C. 119 to allow an applicant to claim benefits of the filing date of the provisional application in a later filed U.S. application. However, since 35 U.S.C. 154 excludes from the determination of the patent term any application on which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119, 365(a) or 365(b), the filing date of a provisional application will not be considered in determining the term of any patent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 further include transitional provisions for limited reexamination in certain applications pending for 2 years or longer as of the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2), taking into account any reference to any earlier application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c). The transitional provisions also permit examination of more than one independent and distinct invention in certain applications pending for 3 years or longer as of the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2), taking into account any reference to any earlier application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c). These transitional provisions are not applicable to any application which is filed on or after the effective date of 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(2), regardless of whether the application is a continuing application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

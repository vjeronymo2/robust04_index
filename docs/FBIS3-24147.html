			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Text of Appendix 1 to the GTK of Russia Instruction No. </F> 01-12/19 of 10 January 1994: "Rules for the Determination of the  Country of Origin of Goods"]    [Text]  <H3>  Rules for the Determination of the Country of Origin of  Goods, Approved by Resolution of the Council of the Heads of the  Governments of the Commonwealth of Independent States on the  Rules for the Determination of the Country of Origin of Goods of  24 September 1993 </H3>   These Rules are in effect in relation to goods that  originate  from the member nations of the Commonwealth of Independent  States (CIS) and circulate in trade among those nations.    For the purposes of these Rules:    a) the term "member nations of the CIS" is understood to be  nations that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent  States who have signed the Agreement on Collaboration in the  Sphere of Foreign Economic Activity (15 May 1992, Tashkent);    b) the term "country of origin of goods" signifies a nation  that is a member of the CIS in which a good was manufactured  entirely or was subject to sufficient processing. The cumulative  principle of origin may be employed when applying the criterion  of sufficient processing, that is, those nations are considered  to be a whole when there is consecutive processing of a good in  member nations of the CIS;    c) the term "criterion of sufficient processing" signifies a  criterion, in accordance with which a good that two or more  countries have taken part in producing is considered to  originate from the country in which it was subject to the final  substantial processing sufficient to impart its characteristic  properties to it;    d) the term "customs control" signifies the aggregate of  measures performed by national customs bodies for the purpose of  ensuring the observance of national legislation in customs  matters, as well as national legislation and international  treaties whose monitoring is entrusted to customs bodies;    e) the term "goods" signifies any movable property,  including  thermal, electrical and other types of energy, that is moved  across a customs border;    f) the term "goods list" signifies the Goods List of Foreign  Economic Activity (TN VED) based on the Coordinated System of  Describing and Coding Goods and Combined Tariff-Statistical List  of the European Community that is employed in the member nations  of the CIS.    The procedure for determining the country of origin of goods  imported onto the customs territory of the member nations of the  CIS from third countries and shipped to third countries from  those nations is regulated by the national legislation of the  member nations of the CIS.    1. A nation where a good was produced entirely or subjected  to sufficient processing is considered to be the country of  origin.    2. The following goods are considered to have been produced  entirely in a given country:    a) minerals extracted from its territory or territorial  waters, continental shelf and seas, if the country has the  exclusive right to the development of those mineral resources;    b) plant products cultivated and harvested on its territory;    c) live animals bred and grown in it;    d) products obtained in that country from animals bred in  it;    e) products of the hunting, fishing and sea trades produced  in it;    f) products of sea trades extracted and/or produced in the  world's oceans by the vessels of that country or vessels leased  (chartered) by it;    g) secondary raw materials and by-products that are the  result of production and other operations performed in that  country;    h) the products of high technology obtained in outer space  on  spacecraft that belong to the given country or are leased by it;    i) goods produced in a given country exclusively from the  products mentioned in subclauses a--h of Paragraph 2.    3. When two or more countries participate in the production  of a good, the origin of the good is determined in accordance  with the criterion of "sufficient processing."    4. The criterion of "sufficient processing" may be  expressed:    a) by a rule requiring changes in the tariff category of the  corresponding goods list, with a list of exceptions[.sup]1[/];    b) by a list of the production or technological processes  that are sufficient or insufficient for the good to be  considered as originating from the country where those processes  took place;    c) by a rule of ad valorem share, where the  percentage share of the value of the materials used or added  value reaches a set limit in the price of the ex plant price of  the good being supplied.    5. In the event that the criteria for the origin of a good  are not specially stipulated in relation to specific goods or a  specific country (or countries), a general rule is applied, in  accordance with which a good is considered to have been  subjected to sufficient processing if a change in the good entry  (classification code of the good) according to the Goods List at  the level of any of the first four marks occurred.    6. In the event that the criterion of "sufficient  processing"  is expressed through an ad valorem share, the value  indicators are computed:    a) for imported materials: according to the customs value,  that is, the value subject to customs charges on import (based  on the CIF) or, in the event that their origin is unknown,  according to the stipulated price of first sale on the territory  of the country of production;    b) for finished products: at the ex plant price or export  price of the seller.    7. Items in dismantled or unassembled form that are  delivered  in several lots, where their shipment in one lot[.sup]2[/] is  not possible under production or transport conditions, should be  considered, according to the wishes of the importer, as a  unified item from the standpoint of determining the  origin[.sup]3[/].    8. The origin of thermal and electrical energy, machinery,  equipment and tooling used in the production of goods is not  taken into account for the purposes of determining their origin.    9. A good is considered to originate from the country of  export only in the event that the good does not conform to the  criteria of origin stipulated by these Rules and the other  conditions, but is procured directly from an enterprise or firm  duly registered in the country of export and is imported via  direct shipment from that country to the country of import.    Goods that are transported across the territory of one or  several countries as a consequence of geographical, transport,  technical or economic reasons, as well as in their temporary  import or storage on the territory of those conditions, also  meet the requirement for direct shipment provided that the goods  are at all times under the customs control of the transit  country.    Goods that are procured by an importer at exhibitions or  fairs also meet the rules for direct shipment, provided that  those goods are not used for purposes other than those exhibited  after shipment to the exhibition or fair, and remain under  customs control during the exhibition or fair.    10. The submission of a declaration-certificate  (hereinafter,  a certificate) of the origin of a good to the customs bodies of  the country of import is necessary in order to attest the origin  of a good in a given member nation of the CIS.    11. The certificate of origin is issued, in the export of  goods from member nations of the CIS, by bodies of the country  of origin of the good authorized to do so in accordance with  national legislation.    The member nations of the CIS exchange samples of the seals  of bodies and the signatures of persons authorized to attest  certificates. Certificates are considered to be invalid without  submission of these samples, and the preferences stipulated by  agreements on the trade regime do not extend to the goods.    12. A certificate should contain the following essential  information about the good for which it is issued:    a) the name and address of the exporter;    b) the name and address of the importer;    c) the means of transport and the routing (as far as is  known);    d) the quantity of pieces and the type of packing, and a  description of th good containing all of the information  necessary for identification of the good;    e) the gross and net weight.[.sup]4[/]    13. The certificate of origin should unequivocably testify  to  the fact that the given good originates from the corresponding  country, that is, it should contain:    a) the written declaration of the exporter that the good  meets the appropriate criterion of origin;    b) written attestation of the authorized body that issued  the  certificate that the information submitted by the exporter in  the certificate corresponds to reality.    14. The certificate of origin is submitted to customs bodies  in typewritten form, without corrections, in the Russian  language.    15. The certificate of origin is submitted together with the  freight customs declaration and other documentation necessary  for the performance of customs clearance.    16. A officially attested duplicate (copy) of a certificate  of origin is accepted in the event of its loss.    17. The exporter may declare the country of origin of a good  in an invoice, or other accompanying documents attached to the  good, to attest to the origin of small lots of goods (values of  up to 5,000 dollars U.S.).    18. In the event doubts arise regarding the validity of a  certificate of origin or the information contained in it, the  customs bodies may appeal to the authorized organizations that  attested the certificate or to other authorized bodies of the  country indicated as the country of origin of the goods with a  well-founded request to report additional or clarifying  information.    19. A good is not considered to originate from a given  country until suitable confirmation of the origin or the  requested information is furnished.    20. The failure to submit a properly completed certificate  of  origin or information on origin, as a general rule, is not  grounds not to permit the good to pass.    Customs may refuse passage only in the presence of  sufficient  grounds to assume that ths freight is originating from a country  that is not subject to passage into the country of import in  accordance with international agreements prevailing for that  nation, and/or its national legislation.    Goods whose origin has not been reliably established are  permitted into the country of import, with a regard for the  provisions of the second paragraph of this clause, with the  payment of customs duties at the maximum customs tariff rate of  the country of import.    21. Most favored status or a preferential status may be  applied (or restored) for the goods indicated in the third  paragraph of clause 20 provided suitable attestation is received  on their origin no later than one year after the shipment  (release) of the goods.  Footnotes    1. The list of exceptions could contain:    a) a list of the production or technological operations  that,  even though leading to a change in the tariff category, are not  considered a sign of sufficient processing or are considered  such only with the observance of certain conditions;    b) a list of the production or technological operations  that,  even though they do not lead to changes in the tariff category,  are considered to be a sign of sufficient processing with the  observance of certain conditions. The conditions mentioned in  subclauses a and b may pertain both to operations that are  performed with a good and to the rule of the ad  valorem share.    2. This rule is also applied in those cases where a lot has  been broken up into several by mistake or by virtue of incorrect  addressing.    3. The conditions for the application of this rule are:    --the advance notification of import customs of the breakup  of a dismantled or unassembled good into several lots with an  indication of the reasons for the breakup, the detailed  specification of each lot as referenced to the TN VED, the value  and the country of origin of the goods that make up that lot;    --the delivery of all lots from one country or one exporter;    --the entry of all lots through the same customs office;    --the delivery of all lots of goods within a time period  that  does not exceed six months from the date of the first shipment.    2. These values may be replaced with others, such as the  quantity of units or the volume, when the weight of the good  varies substantially in transporting or when those units are  employed in standard fashion in relation to that type of product.</p>

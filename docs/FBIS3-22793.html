Povilas Vaisnis, chief of the State Inspectorate for Nuclear  Energy Safety, has indirectly confirmed the persistent rumors of  Lithuania as a transit country for nuclear radiation. He did  not refute or confirm the opinion of the German police that  Vilnius and Kaunas are centers of nuclear smuggling, although  the two largest Lithuanian cities can hardly aspire to such an  "honorary" title. There is no doubt that, following the breakup  of the USSR, Lithuania became a kind of transshipment base for  various firms, groups, and clans engaged in transporting and  selling dangerous freight to the West.    But what of Lithuania itself, which, thanks to the presence  of the Ignalina Nuclear Electric Power Station [AES] on its  territory, possesses nuclear fuel and materials? Is it not the  source of the nuclear exports? Lithuanian nuclear specialists  unanimously deny this. Povilas Vaisnis believes that, despite  the lack of juridical regulation of the control and accounting  system at the Ignalina AES, nuclear fuel is kept under reliable  guard in special storehouses. And yet the optimism is clearly  exaggerated. Everybody remembers last year's sensational  business when a nuclear fuel cassette went missing from the  Ignalina AES and has still not been found. AES engineers  estimate that one such cassette containing fuel is worth  approximately $60,000 on the world market.    If it had not been for stocktaking, even now nobody would  have learned of the disappearance of that cassette. The  investigative group never arrived at an unequivocal conclusion  -- had it been removed from the territory of the AES, or had it  simply "gotten lost" in the maze of nuclear bookkeeping?    Lithuania signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of  Nuclear Weapons and pledged to keep nuclear materials safe. A  special inspectorate is also keeping a careful eye on this. A  significant leak of nuclear fuel or radioactive waste is ruled  out here. But the transportation of nuclear materials across  Lithuania is something really real.    "We are trying to close the route for the export of nuclear  fuel," Povilas Vaisnis said, "but it is difficult for us. Not  only do we not have the necessary equipment and apparatus, we  also don't have specialists in the border and customs services  or such work skills in exposing smuggling."    Incidentally, local smugglers, for whom nuclear transit is a  reliable means of making a fast buck, are perfectly well aware  of these difficulties. Many have maintained links with the  Russian market, and people in the know maintain that things go  on at a very high level.    Entry to this sphere of business is prohibited to ordinary  businessmen engaged, for example, in the "copper business" or  unscrewing nuts from railroad tracks. As a rule, failures and  unpleasantness await those who attempt to engage in amateur  activities. This, for example, was what happened to one R.  Urbonas, a resident of Panevezys, who decided to make money out  of selling several kilograms of uranium conveyed from beyond the  Urals. He was caught and arrested by the police but, when asked  where the uranium was, he replied that he had thrown it into the  Nevezis River. At the insistence of the city's residents the  frightened police dug up the whole riverbed but never found  anything. Either the nuclear businessman had managed to sell  the uranium in time, or the police failed to display sufficient  zeal.    Genuine nuclear slick operators do everything legally. They  fall victim only to unforeseen circumstances. A graphic example  is provided by the matter of a load of beryllium in containers  given to the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation Bank in Vilnius  to store. The police stumbled across it by chance when checking  a telephone report that a bomb had been planted. It is,  however, possible that the call, far from being accidental, was  a ploy [navodka] by rivals for the dangerous freight. It is  curious that, according to documents, there was no contraband:  The freight weighing four tonnes and worth approximately $123  million had a certificate, an official import permit to  Lithuania, a customs note....</p>

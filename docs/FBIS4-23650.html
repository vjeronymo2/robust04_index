			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dirk van Eeden] </F>   [Text] The two former military undercover agents gagged  this week by Defence Minister Joe Modise claim that top ANC  officials were spies for the National Party [NP] government.  Weeks ago the men told SUNDAY TIMES that among the ANC agents  supplying information to them during the past decade were  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the National, MK; ANC military wing]  officers earmarked for top positions in the integrated defence  force.    The agents, Mr Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Clive  Brink, both former members of the disbanded Directorate of  Covert Collection [DCC], are now barred by a Transvaal Supreme  Court order from revealing the names.    Mr Modise's application was backed by a lengthy affidavit  from defence force head General Georg Meiring, who said the  disclosures of names of spies could lead to them being seen as  traitors.    In the interview conducted in a Sandton hotel in April as  part of a SUNDAY TIMES investigation, one agent said an ANC  informant supplied them with details of a secret meeting between  National Party and ANC negotiators in September 1992 on a farm  in Ellisras.    Mr Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Brink were among 62 members of  the DCC sacked after a Goldstone commission raid on their  offices in November 1992. Amid allegations that this was the  nerve centre of the "Third Force", 23 officers, including a  general, were placed on compulsory early retirement by former  State President F.W. De Klerk on December 19,1992.    Mr Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Brink said they feared for  their lives. "We are terrified, not just for ourselves, but for  our families. The problem is that all the DCC agents who were  shafted know too much about top people."    In an affidavit supporting Mr Modise's urgent application,  General Meiring said it was imperative that the agents be  prevented from revealing "a great deal of top secret  information...including the names of many informants" who could  be severely compromised if their identities were revealed.    According to General Meiring's affidavit: "An interdict  against them could save the state from severe embarrassment and  avoid international repercussions."    Edyth Bulbring and Ray Hartley report that a besieged Mr  Modise spent the anniversary of his first month in office  yesterday with senior members of the ANC discussing his gaggling  of the two agents and a bid to muzzle the WEEKLY MAIL newspaper  over reports on the two agents.    A spokesman for President Mandela said Mr Modise would have  to explain to the president why he acted in the way he did. He  said he had been unable to discover who in the ANC had put out  the statement condemning Mr Modise's actions. "There was  absolute confusion as to who put it out," spokesman Parks  Mankahlana said.</p>

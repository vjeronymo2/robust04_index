			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Enthusiastic demand for Amoco USDollars 250m issue DESPITE the continued weakness of the dollar, two borrowers launched offerings totalling Dollars 350m in the Eurodollar bond market yesterday. Amoco Canada Petroleum, the arm of the US oil and gas company which acquired Dome Petroleum in 1988, launched a USDollars 250m issue of 10-year bonds, its first Eurobond since 1986. Last year, the company raised CDollars 2bn in new bank debt and commercial paper, retiring most of the remaining debt incurred in the CDollars 5bn acquisition of Dome. The proceeds of yesterday's Eurobond will be used to refinance some of that short-term debt. Amoco's infrequent appearance in the market, combined with its AAA debt rating, allowed it to achieve unusually fine pricing, while meeting enthusiastic investor demand. Amoco is one of a dwindling band of companies to have held on to a AAA debt rating (British Gas recently lost its top rating, for example). Nevertheless, the pricing of the bonds at a yield spread of 42 basis points above the US Treasury yield, the same level as for Japanese government guaranteed agencies such as Japan's Export-Import Bank, was considered an aggressive move. 'More frequent triple-A corporate borrowers would not have been acceptable at that level,' one trader said. In fact, there is little comparable paper at the 10-year area of the yield curve, which is well liked by investors due to the positive shape of the yield curve. The steep yield curve in the US market, coupled with the feeling that the US dollar must be close to bottoming out, seems to have helped buoy European sentiment on dollar bonds. While dealers reported some selling of Eurodollar bonds by Japanese accounts, European accounts have not been unloading paper. 'Partly, they do not want to liquidate because they do not know what else to buy,' one trader said. Many investors are positioned in German bonds for interest rate cuts which have yet to materialise. These positions are costly to hold because of the inverted yield curve. Other European markets remain vulnerable to worries over the Maastricht Treaty. Also in the dollar sector, Telebras, the Mexican telecommunications company, launched a Dollars 100m issue of five-year Eurobonds via Merrill Lynch. In the German market, Credit National, the French agency, launched a DM300m five-year deal via Dresdner Bank, which was aimed at retail investors in Benelux and Switzerland.</p>

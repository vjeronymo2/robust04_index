			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEIGHING ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT, CANCER RISK  </P> <P> I am one of those women who takes estrogens and progestins to treat my severe  menopausal symptoms, so I was very interested to read your coverage of the  hormone/cancer connection ("Weigh Hormones' Risk, Experts Urge" by Janny Scott,  Aug. 4).  </P> <P> Let me just say that without estrogen I would be a basket case. I could not  work and would have to apply for disability. One thing the article did not  mention is that estrogen is also a mental tonic. Without it, I suffer from low  mental acuity and inability to concentrate, severe hair loss, healing of  something as small as a paper cut is very slow. I feel that there is more to  estrogen and other hormones for women that our esteemed medical profession is  aware of. So, I will take my chances and would rather enjoy some quality of  life even if it means having a short life due to potential onset of a cancer.  </P> <P> JOY ZETTERLING  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

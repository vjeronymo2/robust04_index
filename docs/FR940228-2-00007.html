			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 13, 1994, GMN also requested that the Department allow GMN to withdraw its request for review and terminate the review of the order on BBs from Germany with respect to GMN. Although its request to withdraw was submitted well after the deadline for doing so, GMN claimed that the circumstances of the firm's bankruptcy rendered it unable to proceed further with the review. After giving careful consideration to GMN's circumstances, we find that it would be inappropriate to terminate the review. GMN's request to terminate the review was submitted during the verification process, which is an advanced stage of the review process, and at a point at which it had become clear that the company would be unable to complete verification successfully. Furthermore, a domestic interested party objected to termination of the review at that stage. Therefore, we are not terminating the review of GMN. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we initiated reviews for SST Bearing Corp. (SST), and Peer International (Peer) with respect to subject merchandise from Japan. SST informed us that it neither produced AFBs in Japan nor exported Japanese-produced bearings to the United States. Peer informed us that although it is a reseller of Japanese-made bearings, all of its suppliers had knowledge at the time of sale that the merchandise was destined for the United States. Consequently, Peer is not a reseller as defined in 19 CFR 353.2(s) because its sales cannot be used to calculate the U.S. price. Therefore, we are preliminarily terminating the reviews with respect to SST and Peer. If we obtain any information that contradicts these companies' assertions, we will complete the reviews with respect to these companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Best Information Available <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account whether a party refuses to provide information in determining what is the best information available (19 CFR 353.37(b)). For purposes of these reviews and in accordance with past Commerce practice, we have used the most adverse BIA_generally the highest rate for any company for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country from this or any prior segment of the proceeding, including the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation_whenever a company refused to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but failed to provide all information requested in a timely manner or in the form requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same country from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39728 (July 26, 1993)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because Franke &amp; Heydrich, General Bearing Corp., and SNFA failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we have used the highest rate ever found for each relevant class or kind of merchandise and country of origin. Also, because GMN had substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but was unable to complete verification, we used as BIA its highest previous rate, in this case the rate from the LTFV investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAe disappoints British Aerospace swung about wildly, trading 9.5m shares following harsh profit downgrades from a number of major securities houses in the wake of the company's half-year results. The shares closed a full 26 lower at 445p after a low point at one stage in the morning session of 439p as selling came close to panic levels. BAe's interim figures were broadly in line with market hopes and the interim dividend gain was above expectations. But analysts departed from a morning meeting with the company's management in troubled mood. BZW was among the most bearish, downgrading its pre-tax profits forecast for 1994 from Pounds 175m to Pounds 105m. Most securities houses are now clearly concerned about BAe's potential for a severe near term squeeze on cash-flow.</p>

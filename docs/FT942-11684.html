			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (8): Search for stolen rights - Property owners struggle with the legacies of Hitler and Stalin. Disputes will take a long time to resolve A US developer who is investing more than DM800m in eastern Germany recently paid out more than DM1m as compensation to a former owner of a property who had tried to repossess it. Had he not paid out, his ambitious redevelopment of the property would have been delayed, and another costly design might have been required. An Anglo-American consortium, which had invested heavily in the states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, is still trying to resolve a property rights dispute after signing the contract with the Treuhand privatisation agency. A Jewish family, forced to leave Nazi Germany in 1938, is still trying to reclaim its property after four years of lengthy and bureaucratic negotiations with the regional office for property questions. The cases are typical of the claims being made by former owners (or their heirs) for property in eastern Germany confiscated either during the Nazi Third Reich or under the post war communist regime. Their claims often collide with the efforts of commercial developers to take advantage of eastern Germany's integration into the capitalist west. In spite of such cases, German bankers, the Treuhand privatisation agency and the teams of consultants and advisers insist that investment in the five eastern Lander is not being held up by any outstanding property disputes. Under the unification treaty, all owners who had their property confiscated between 1933 and 1945 are entitled to restitution of their rights or to compensation. All owners whose property was confiscated between 1949 and 1990 are entitled to similar rights. But those who had property expropriated between 1945 and 1949, when east Germany was under Soviet administration, are not entitled to restitution, and only recently, won the right to a more limited form of compensation. The deadline for registering claims was December 31, 1992. A year later, the Federal office for the Regulation of Property Questions still faced 1.08m outstanding claims on 2.6m titles. By that time, Berlin had resolved 16.3 per cent of claims, Saxony, 51.95. All told, 30 per cent have been resolved. According to officials at the Property Questions Office, it will take another decade to close the books. The federal government chose restitution of property rather than compensation partly for financial reasons. Bonn simply did not have the funds to allow only compensation. Yet no sooner had these rights been granted than the Treuhand and bankers realised that investment in eastern Germany would be held back unless new investors had precedence over claimants for restitution. Following some amendments, it is possible to buy commercial property in eastern Germany if one undertakes to invest (and create jobs). In these cases, former owners of the property generally have to settle for compensation at market value. There are still outstanding questions over the level of compensation to to individuals who cannot reclaim their property, either because it had been legally bought by east Germans after 1949, or because municipal buildings, such as a hospital, has been built on the original site. The federal finance ministry has drafted several bills, suggesting that compensation be valued on the 1935 value of land, but multiplied by several factors depending on the nature of the property; that a ceiling be imposed on compensation payouts; and payments be gradually paid out through some bond system. How do these delays in compensation legislation affect investment decisions? Mr Hansjurgen Schafer, head of the Berlin-based federal office for Property Questions, says that with about 70 per cent of the real estate titles 'there are no problems'. But the other 30 per cent were 'really critical'. One problem is deciding the actual purchase price as a basis for paying compensation. From the legal point of view it was also sometimes difficult to establish whether property was acquired legally after 1949. For instance, Mr Wolfgang Berghofer, the former mayor of Dresden, gave apartments and houses to his communist party friends and other political cronies. 'How do we assess the status of that property? Did these people receive the property legally or not? Was it legal under the former German Democratic Republic or not?' asked one official from the Property Questions Office. Then there are cases frequently experienced by members of the Jewish community. When they fled from Hitler, the Nazis, or those who had taken over their property, went to the Land Registry. There, they either tore out the pages containing the Jewish title to that property, wrote in their own, or simply crossed out the original owners' names with black ink and wrote their own names below. The central land registry at Barby, near Magdeburg in Saxony-Anhalt, has many such examples. These cases became even more complicated when the new 'owners' destroyed these documents or were stripped of the property by the east German communist authorities. In an bizarre twist of history, former Nazis have taken advantage of unification to claim back these former Jewish properties, while their original Jewish owners frantically search for their title deeds, or, with the help of infra-red equipment at the Property Questions office in Barby, try to read their names through the black ink. There is one other problem. It is quite easy to buy agricultural land in eastern Germany. But former owners of land expropriated between 1945 and 1949 are still insisting on equality of property rights before the law. Since they will not have the right to restitution, they are seeking fair compensation. Mr Hans Marcus, a London-based lawyer at Pannone &amp; Partners, says the situation in eastern Germany is 'a mess - no matter what the establishment says, there are big problems with property rights. These disputes have hindered investment decisions . . . such problems will take a long time to resolve.'</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (6): Banks braced for tighter controls - Finance THE Venezuelan financial sector, so far relatively insulated from the government's free market reforms, is expected to face foreign competition and tougher banking standards if legislation scheduled to pass before March wins congressional approval. The legislation to modernise the financial system has been languishing in Congress for the past 18 months. At long last, however, there appears to be a consensus among the big banks - and therefore an end to opposition from political parties - to endorse changes which would open the banks to increased supervision and disclosure requirements, and permit substantial foreign investment in the banking sector. Venezuela's financial system is in serious need of reform. The country's existing banking law is limited in scope and not suited to modern financial services. Supervision of the banking system, under the control of the Superintendency of Banks, which is part of the finance ministry, and to some degree the Central Bank, has been traditionally lax. According to a foreign banker, some commercial banks, the most important group within the country's specialised financial system, 'have been doing a lot of non-banking business' that has contributed to low-quality loan portfolios. This includes making loans to companies in which bank executives or directors are themselves investors. The central bank recently moved to impose more order on commercial banks by enforcing reserve requirements that some banks had ignored in the past. The initiative caused liquidity problems at some financial institutions, which competed for deposits by offering sky-high interest rates, even on savings accounts. Although impetus for change has come from some Venezuelan banks, international developments have helped. Higher capital adequacy standards, set by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, as well as tougher regulations for foreign bank branches operating in the US, have pushed the Venezuelan financial sector to endorse higher standards. 'Venezuelan banks are bowing to the inevitable,' said a foreign banker. The legislation would create a stronger, more independent central bank, a strengthened Superintendency of Banks with more oversight authority and independent funding paid by the banks themselves, as well as clearer guidelines for the financial sector. The current banking law, a patchwork of legal requirements and prohibitions, would be replaced by a modern law which specifies those activities banks may not engage in, but which would permit the banks to carry on any non-proscribed financial activity. The law would include rules for financial statements, and degrees of permitted concentration in loan portfolios to companies wholly or partially owned by banks or their directors. Furthermore, higher equity/loan ratios would be phased in. New policies in the latter two areas have already been issued in advance. Opening commercial banking and other financial services to direct foreign investment in subsidiaries, branches or joint ventures has become less controversial since large foreign banks already play an important role in financing Venezuelan companies, through 70 representative offices or investment banking units. Wholesale banking operations are likely to continue to attract foreign banks, but it is unlikely that there will be a stampede into the market. Political uncertainty at the start of a presidential election year would probably also act as a brake to any new foreign investment in banking over the short term. However, some Venezuelan bankers are still worried that their institutions (and power bases), whose stock is often cheap in foreign currency terms, will be taken over by an international bank; they remain opposed to opening up the system. Some Venezuelan commercial banks with large retail networks may welcome a capital injection from a foreign partner. Initially, the new banking law was expected to cap the share owned by foreigners at 20 per cent, but the current legislation leaves the ceiling open to the discretion of the Ministry of Finance. Freer access to new equity could be a boon to domestic banks. The president of Banco Venezolano de Credito, Mr Oscar Garcia Mendoza, said that local banks need to raise equity to 'grow and solidify the private sector'. 'We are so small that we couldn't even make a Dollars 100m loan to our state petroleum company, PDVSA. It has to rely on foreign banks for the scale of funding it requires,' he said. Improving the Venezuelan financial system should pay other dividends in the long run, attracting more foreign capital and investment. Even if Venezuelans repatriated only the annual interest on the estimated Dollars 60bn that they have invested abroad, a big infusion of capital would take place. Attracting that capital is crucial to Venezuela's future, because domestic financial savings have shrunk. According to one foreign bank active in Venezuela, total financial assets on the balance sheets of all Venezuelan financial institutions at the end of 1979 amounted to the equivalent of Dollars 23bn. At the end of 1990 the same assets were Dollars 18bn - a decline of 23 per cent in nominal terms, but over 50 per cent in real terms. During the same period financial assets in the hands of Venezuelans abroad are estimated to have tripled from Dollars 20bn to Dollars 60bn. Capital fled the country largely because banks fixed interest rates and because investors lacked confidence in the economy and expected the Venezuelan bolivar to be devalued. 'Passage of the banking law will be a small but important step in the right direction,' a banker commented. A more modern banking system operating at international standards and attracting new capital could better channel capital to other investments. With the state-dominated economy now slowly being privatised, increasing opportunities exist for investment. 'Our private sector is still too small,' Mr Garcia Mendoza said. 'Venezuelans have not saved in Venezuela because there was no place to save.' The new banking law could well help change that habit.</p>

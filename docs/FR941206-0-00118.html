			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has adopted a License Fee Reserve in response to programmers' concerns that a cap on total rate increases attributable to new channels, without a reserve for license fees, might give rate-regulated cable operators incentives to increase profits by adding only no cost or low cost channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Programming cost increase mark-up. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission has decided not to allow operators using the per channel adjustment under the new rules to take the 7.5% mark-up on programming cost increases, including retransmission consent fees and copyright fees incurred for coverage of broadcast signals, for channels for which the per channel mark-up of up to 20 cents was taken. The Commission's analysis indicates that the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents for additional channels, in addition to the License Fee Reserve, will provide full and fair compensation to operators adding channels to CPSTs. Operators who have added channels prior to the effective date of the new rules will not be harmed by this change since the operators may elect to add channels to CPSTs under the old or the new rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Deletion and substitution of channels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The new regulations also specify how operators shall adjust rates for BSTs and CPSTs when channels are dropped from, or moved between, BSTs and CPSTs. In general, when dropping a channel from a BST or CPST, operators will be required to make their rates reflect the net reduction in external costs as is required under the existing rules. See 47 CFR 76.922(d)(3) (i) and (ii). Operators also will be required to reduce the price of that tier by the ``residual'' associated with that channel. For channels that were on a BST or CPST on or before May 14, 1994 or channels added after that date pursuant to the current rules, the per channel residual is the charge for the tier, minus the external costs for the tier, and any per channel adjustments made after that date, divided by the number of channels on the tier. For channels added to a CPST on or after May 15, 1994, pursuant to the new channel addition rules, the residuals shall be the actual per channel adjustment taken for that channel when it was added to the tier plus any inflation adjustment since that time. The residual and programming cost shall be calculated as of the date the channel is dropped. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, when an operator substitutes a new channel for an existing channel on a CPST, no per channel adjustment may be taken. The residual for the new channel is that of the channel it replaced. Operators substituting channels will be required to adjust their rates for changes in license fees as provided by the current rules. To preserve the overall effectiveness of the Operator's Cap and the License Fee Reserve, if the license fee for the new service is greater than the license fee for the replaced service, and the operator chooses to pass that increase through to subscribers, the excess shall count against the aggregate of the Operator's Cap and the License Fee Reserve. If the license fee for the new channel is less than the license fee for the replaced channel, no credit shall be given against the cap or the reserve, so as not to create an artificial incentive to replace higher license fee channels with lower license fee channels. With respect to channels to which the 7.5% markup on new programming costs applies, the operator shall treat the mark-up as part of its programming costs and subtract the mark-up from its external costs when a channel is dropped. When such a channel is substituted, the operator may retain in its rates the 7.5% mark-up on the license fee of the dropped channel, so long as that amount is not more than 7.5% of the license fee of the new channel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a channel is shifted between a BST and a CPST or between CPSTs, it shall be treated as if it was dropped from one tier and the residual and programming cost associated with the shifted channel shall be shifted to the other tier. The residuals associated with the shifted channel shall be adjusted by reference to the number of subscribers on each tier to ensure aggregate revenues remain the same. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Revenue neutrality protects consumers by ensuring that the Commission's requirements do not create incentives for operators to move channels to tiers with more subscribers solely to increase revenues. And because the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents applies only to the CPSTs, an operator may not move a channel for which it received a per channel adjustment under the new rules from a CPST to the BST. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An operator may use the equivalent billing (``EBU'') methodology in calculating the number of subscribers on a tier, provided it does so for both the tier from which the channel is shifted and the tier to which the channel is shifted and provided that the operator otherwise meets the conditions for using EBU methodology. See Public Notice: Question and Answer on Cable Television Rate Regulation (July 27, 1994) Question and Answer 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Headend upgrades for small systems. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission decided to adopt a special streamlined cost-of-service procedure for independent small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs that upgrade their headend equipment to add new channels to CPSTs. Small systems may find it difficult to recover the fixed costs of the headend equipment required for adding channels, since the cost must be recovered over a small subscriber base. The Commission limits this relief to independent small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs because (1) systems with more than 1,000 subscribers can spread the fixed costs of headend equipment over a larger customer base and (2) small systems owned by larger operators should have adequate financial resources to add channels under our generally applicable rules. Qualified small systems that add channels to their CPSTs, therefore, have the option of either using this special procedure or using the existing or revised going forward rules applicable to all operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: European pension fund assets 'to double' MORGAN Grenfell, the investment banking subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, is predicting 50 per cent growth in continental European pension fund assets over the first five years of the current decade, to Dollars 997bn in 1995 from Dollars 675bn in 1990. Speaking in Frankfurt at Deutsche Bank's headquarters, Mr Michael Dobson, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell, said the highlight of this expansion would be diversification of pension funds into non-domestic investments, where the total under management was likely to double to Dollars 100bn over the five-year period from Dollars 48bn. This growth was likely to be higher than anywhere else in the world except Japan and was likely to fuel demand for the services of Europe-based fund managers, Mr Dobson said, arguing that the opportunities would be greater because approximately 10 per cent of all contracts to manage pension funds are expected to change hands each year. He predicted that the whole continental European pension fund market would follow the trend already set by the US and the UK, with a greater emphasis on active performance and an increasing tendency for pension funds to be managed by professionals rather than in-house. At present, 80 per cent of continental European funds are managed by companies themselves and 20 per cent by independent professionals, almost the opposite of the picture in the UK. In continental Europe, 'passive investments' in bonds and private placements typically constituted around three-quarters of a pension fund portfolio, Mr Dobson said, with only 10 per cent in equities and the balance in cash and property. The likelihood was there would be a move towards the typical UK portfolio, where over 70 per cent is invested in equities. Mr Rolf Breuer, Deutsche Bank main board director with responsibility for the bank's securities activities, said it was a priority for the bank to increase its fund management activities. At present, the bank is the world's 20th largest fund manager with assets of DM124bn under management. Deutsche Bank is predicting 9.5 per cent growth per year from 1991 to 1996 in the domestic German pension fund market. The total size of German pension funds stood at only DM129bn in 1991 compared to DM849bn in the UK, DM993bn in Japan and DM4131bn in the US. Morgan Grenfell fund managers are paying marketing visits to many of Deutsche's German corporate clients.</p>

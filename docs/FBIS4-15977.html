			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fedor Yemchenko report: "Diamonds Beyond Number. But Even </F> More Problems. Situation in Far Northern Regions Is Becoming  Critical"]    [Text] TRUD has already published a report on the hunger  strike by women from the "Tokhomo" Geological Exploration  Enterprise in the Evenki Autonomous Okrug. The reason for the  hunger strike is that the workers have not been paid since last  summer. The money due for the work they have completed was  finally "wrung out" of the enterprise by means of tears and a  strike. But the enterprise's future remains in question. The  state used to invest considerable sums in organizing the Evenki  oil exploration expedition. Highly skilled specialists have  been assembled here. If "Tokhomo" goes bankrupt, the result will  be further losses for the state.    No sooner was the hunger strike by the women of Baykit  brought to an end than the "protest relay" was taken up by six  representatives of the "Norilskstroy" Association's trade union  committee.    We learned recently that a three-day hunger strike was  declared from 1 April in Igarka by six workers at the geological  exploration expedition. The reason was the same: Work was no  longer being financed and people were not getting paid.    The problems being experienced by the working people of the  North have not cropped up overnight or even in the recent past.  Four years ago the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of  Russia held a conference in Murmansk at which the region's  social and economic problems were discussed. Incidentally, the  region provides the state with 75 percent of its oil, 92 percent  of its gas, 100 percent of its gold and diamonds, and 70 percent  of its timber. According to calculations by specialists, every  worker in the northern expanses provides the country with  revenue which is three times that generated by the average  Russian worker. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to  live here. At the Murmansk conference the trade unions stated:  "The North is sick, disaster is approaching. Contradictions  between production and social amenities have driven people to  despair. The pathetic incentives on offer have lost their  attractiveness given the chronic lack of food and basic  necessities."    Last year, under pressure from the trade unions, the  Congress  of People's Deputies adopted the Law "On State Guarantees and  Compensation Payments for Northerners," and presidential edicts  and government decrees aimed to stabilize the social and  economic situation in the Far Northern regions.    Nevertheless the situation in the region during recent years  has not only failed to improve but has actually reached the  critical level. Another trade union conference on the problems  of the North -- the fourth -- was held in Moscow at the end of  March. In addition to delegates from 18 territorial trade union  associations, deputies from the State Duma and Federation  Council, members of the government, and representatives of  ministries and departments took part in its work.    Following Russian tradition, the leitmotiv at this  conference  was encapsulated by two questions: Who is to blame? And what  can be done? Whereas practically every speech contained the  answer to the first question -- the government -- few had  anything definite to say about the second. The absurdity of the  situation is that the present government cannot act within the  framework of the laws adopted in the state even if it wants to.  Dmitriy Lukashenko, chairman of the Komi Republic Trade Union  Federation, gave the following example. Deputy Finance Minister  Vyacheslav Korolev stated bluntly at parliamentary hearings that  we have not implemented the Law on the North and we do not  intend to do so. "What do you mean?" the astonished  parliamentarians demanded. It seemed like nonsense to hear this  sort of thing directly from a ranking state official. And then,  without any embarrassment whatsoever, V. Korolev hit back with  the assertion that there is simply no money to implement the law!    Indeed, to fully implement this law would, according to  various assessments, require an appropriation of 35-80 trillion  rubles from the state budget. It is abundantly clear that the  government cannot manage this and is obliged to maneuver between  two extremes: Either it must pay the northerners the amount  laid down by the law and thereby stoke up hyperinflation, or it  must secure major amendments to the law from the State Duma.  Which, incidentally, is already being done. A report leaked to  the press, stating that the government has prepared a draft  decree on abolishing some of the benefits payable to  northerners, has provoked a negative reaction. A strike  committee has been formed in the Komi Republic.    "If the benefits stipulated by the law are cut," Dmitriy  Lukashenko stated at the conference, "products from our republic  will stop arriving in the Russian center. We will block  railroads and highways. Oil and gas wells will only `operate'  insofar as is necessary to satisfy the region's internal needs.  We will only send what is left over to consumers in other  regions in order to avoid shutting down the wells altogether.  We will stop transferring taxes to the federal budget...."    This menacing ultimatum is unlikely to be adopted. In my  view, the trade union leader's resoluteness contained more in  the way of emotional charge than considered appraisal. It is  not hard to conjecture what the consequences of such a step  would be: They would hit working people first and foremost. At  the same time we should bear in mind that the pursuit of a  policy based on the postulate that "the Russian peasant will  endure anything" is becoming extremely dangerous. It seems the  power structures are well aware of this. The representative  branch, at any rate. The State Duma and Federation Council are  planning to review the blueprint determining state policy in the  northern regions. Whatever transpires, it remains a fact that  the North always was and continues to be Russia's principal  "storehouse" of raw materials. Without the preservation and  development of the economy of these regions, which,  incidentally, comprise approximately 65 percent of our state's  total area, it becomes impossible to envision the rebirth of  Russia, a topic which political leaders love to talk about.    Polls that have been carried out show that over 50 percent  of  the workers currently employed in the Northern regions would be  prepared to leave the area at the present time. The only thing  holding them back is the lack of money to pay their travel costs  and the dim prospect of finding somewhere to live in another  area. Attempts by individual "desperate souls" to overcome these  obstacles often come to a sorry end.    Gennadiy Loginov, director of the Kola Scientific Center  attached to the Russian Academy of Sciences, gave this example.  Some 200 families left Zelenogorsk, he said. They sold  everything they had, their apartments and furniture. They  scraped together the money to make the journey. They simply  trundled around the central oblasts and came back again. It was  practically impossible for them to find work to match their  skills, and they had no place to live. Apartment rental prices  are crazy. You can imagine the situation they are in now....    It is not hard to imagine. It is far harder to answer the  question: How can these people be helped? After all, most of  them did not come here as a result of any romantic delusions.  Some were sent here after training, others sincerely responded  to party and government appeals. The main point is that through  their labor they have helped us to live more or less tolerably  by pulling the whole country along, so to speak. And now they  have become captives of this "white and silent expanse," it  would simply be inhuman to abandon them to the mercy of fate.    However, let us analyze factors that are more tangible --  economic reasons. We know that a significant proportion of  state budget revenue comes from the gold extraction industry.  It would seem that the government should pay most attention to  this sector. But alas no! Judging by the situation that has  developed in Magadan Oblast, nobody cares too much about federal  budget revenue.    Many gold extraction enterprises in this region, according  to  Valentin Tsvetkov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council  Budget and Finance Committee, are currently being forced to cut  production. The extraction artels are only working sites where  precious metal can be obtained without significant expenditure.  In other words, they are "siphoning off the cream." In this  respect the state is incurring enormous losses.    Enterprises which are fulfilling state orders for gold and  diamond extraction are not being paid on time for their output.  They have been obliged to take out loans with commercial banks  and pay interest rates at the expense of their profits. This is  how the "collapse" of the foreign currency sector is proceeding.  You will agree that it is very hard to understand the logic of  these actions by the government.    The economic problems of the northern territories, like  those  of the whole of our country, cannot be explained or justified  merely by the hardships that have resulted from the changeover  in the sociopolitical structures of society, the switch, so to  speak, from developed socialism to insufficiently developed  capitalism. Many of these problems have been generated by the  mistakes that were made as reforms progressed. But mistakes, as  we well know, are committed by specialists whose skills do not  match up to the tasks they have undertaken to tackle. In my  view, this encapsulates one of the reasons for the tragedy which  our society is enduring.    The future of these people who find themselves in extreme  economic and climatic conditions cannot leave us indifferent.  The appeals to the president and the prime minister adopted at  the conference that has just been held basically contain a  single call: Ensure strict compliance with the law regarding  social guarantees for northerners. Only time will tell whether  this call will be heeded in the Kremlin and the White House....</p>

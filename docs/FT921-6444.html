			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Arts: Andy Hamilton - The Orange, North End Rd, W14 That a saxophonist should still be gigging into his 73rd year is not remarkable. Contrary to popular perception, jazz musicians often wear well despite the rigours of a peripatetic life. Trumpet players Harry 'Sweets' Edison, Doc Cheatham and Yank Lawson, for example, appear indestructible. What is remarkable is that a Brummie tenorist should find popular acclaim - and a record deal - so late in a long career. Perhaps things would have been different had this gentle leader and composer not confined himself to the Midlands, and The Bear pub, Bearwood, Birmingham, in particular, for the last 40 years. However, since the much vaunted release last year of the star studded 'Silvershine' album - special guests include pop singer Mick Hucknall as well as top young London based jazzers - the rest of the country has been exposed to the mellow tones and romantic history of Andy Hamilton. Born in North Jamaica he left home in his teens to find labouring work on the US East coast and supplemented his income with big band playing. Returning to the West Indies in the Forties he signed up as resident bandleader aboard the yacht Zaka and wrote the tune 'Silvershine' for its owner, Errol Flynn. In 1949 he came to the UK, intending to return to the States, but settled in Birmingham where he has stayed, and played, ever since. Although he has chosen not to travel far he has kept good company and regularly plays alongside visiting names such as Edison as well as his own Blue Notes. In West London for two nights he retained precocious pianist Jason Rebello, Mark Mondesir on a drumkit twice his size and percussionist Nana Tsiboe from the album line-up, supplemented by Trevor Lines on string bass. A long absence since those recording dates could be to blame, but they made a wobbly start to a set consisting of common and uncommon standards as well as Hamilton's own calypso-soaked compositions. But Hamilton is an uncomplicated, soulful player and he gradually rounded the edges off his accompanists' eager clatter with long (all things considered), warm solos spaced out by absent-minded study of the playlist. Ben Webster was a major influence in his learning and the old man's ballad playing has a similar considered, mellow burr. It is laid back further by the irresistible sounds of the Caribbean which creep into even the most North American of tunes - 'Take the 'A' Train' and 'Juggernaut'. But the ballads see Hamilton at his soothing and breathy best and 'Silvershine', revisited on the album after a 40 year absence from his repertoire, sums up a life's work.</p>

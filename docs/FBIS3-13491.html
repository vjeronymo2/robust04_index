"We are just waiting for the  Russians to specify their proposal [on a second Middle East  conference in Madrid].    [Voykowitsch] Did Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  give any more specific information about that during his meeting  with Yasir 'Arafat on Friday evening [11 March].    [Qaddumi] No. He wanted to make the Palestinians agree to a  resumption of the negotiations with Israel. Our answer was:  First, the two co-sponsors of the peace process must make sure  that a UN resolution is adopted and that the Palestinians are  granted protection. The United States and Russia must come to  an agreement on the guarantees they want to give to the  Palestinians that events like the massacre of Hebron will not  happen again. First, protective measures must be implemented.  Then we can resume negotiations.    [Voykowitsch] You have been extremely critical of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement right from the beginning. What is the  document still worth today?    [Qaddumi] I have always been skeptical whether the Israelis  consider their signature worth anything. I expected they would  keep finding new justifications to delay the implementation of  the agreement. We cannot continue with this farce. The  Israelis have to withdraw quickly from Gaza and Jericho -- and  Jericho covers 345 square kilometers. If this does not happen,  the agreement is just a piece of paper that does not commit  anybody to anything.    [Voykowitsch] How strong are the voices in the occupied  territories, which demand a resumption of the armed struggle?    [Qaddumi] We have never given up our resistance, and it will  continue as long as Israeli soldiers are on our territory. The  intifadah is a democratic resistance and it has been supported  by the large majority of the international community. It is a  legal means of self-defense.    [Voykowitsch] How much terrain has the PLO lost to Hamas?    [Qaddumi] The problem is not one between the PLO and Hamas.  We both pursue the same struggle -- we are defending ourselves.  But we have different tactics. Our problem consists of the  Israelis. They have undermined the peace process. James Baker,  architect of the process, said that we must build trust. But  the governments of Shamir and Rabin have only sown new distrust.  The Israelis have deprived us of our credibility. Only 20  percent of the Palestinians still support the peace process.  The PLO feels committed to the process, but it can continue  only if the protection of the Palestinians is guaranteed. The  massacre of Hebron has shown again that Zionism is some kind of  racism. It was a mistake by the United States to rescind this  resolution.    Israel's security is still the absolute priority of U.S.  foreign policy. Israel gets military support from them and  increasingly better weapons. The United States, but also  Britain and France, which has just signed an agreement on  military cooperation with Israel, must give up their double  standards.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Letter: FT coverage of Lloyd's Sir, Under a banner headline, 'Lloyd's in cash talks with the Bank', on your front page (February 18), you declare that 'Lloyd's of London, government ministers and the Bank of England are discussing measures to ease a liquidity crunch at the insurance market, according to a senior broker involved'. This statement, relying upon a non-attributable source, was picked up by other newspapers and media, no doubt because of the high regard held for the FT as a journal of financial record. It would seem that both Lloyd's and the Bank very quickly declared this statement to be untrue. And yet coverage in the FT of February 19 of this important rejection is confined to page 8, in the midst of a piece written under a totally different heading - 'Lords to consider Lloyd's duty to Names'. To quote: 'Lloyd's said yesterday that 'centrally' it had not been involved in any discussion with the Bank of England about possible financial assistance. It also said that it had made no request for assistance from the Bank or from ministers.' Surely, given the importance of the Financial Times as a journal of record, it is incumbent upon you to give, to a denial or rejection, exposure with similar weight as the original report. Failure to do so could quickly erode the respect and regard with which the FT is viewed. Paul R Rawson, Springwood, Audlem, Cheshire CW3 0BA Editor's note: The report should have begun: 'Talks are under way between senior figures at Lloyd's. . .' We regret that this distinction was not made clear.</p>

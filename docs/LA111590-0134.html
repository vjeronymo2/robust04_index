			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTD DRIVER KILLED FALLEN MOTORCYCLIST, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> An RTD bus driver who allegedly ran over and killed a fallen motorcycle rider  in Canoga Park and then continued on her route was arrested on suspicion of  manslaughter Wednesday, police said.  </P> <P> Teresa LaBarba, 35, of Canoga Park, could also face a felony hit-and-run charge  when evidence from the accident is presented to prosecutors, Traffic Officer  Gary Weller said.  </P> <P> Police said LaBarba was driving her bus south on Topanga Canyon Boulevard about  10 a.m. when it ran over Eric Edwards, 20, of Chatsworth, and crushed him.  Moments earlier, Edwards had fallen off his motorcycle when he lost control of  it near the intersection of Sherman Way.  </P> <P> "The motorcyclist crashed and the bus driver ran over him," Weller said. "She  never touched the motorcycle. Then the bus took off."  </P> <P> Police said five passengers were on the bus and it was unclear whether they saw  the accident or told LaBarba to stop. Detectives were attempting to locate them  for interviews Wednesday night. One of the passengers who was contacted told  police he did not see or feel the accident, Detective Wayne Dufort said.  </P> <P> Weller said it was initially unclear who had hit Edwards until witnesses told  investigators it was an RTD bus. The RTD was then contacted and LaBarba, who  was known to be driving a route in the area, was ordered by radio to return to  the accident scene, Weller said.  </P> <P> LaBarba, an RTD driver for seven years, told investigators that when she  noticed the motorcycle in the street behind her, she radioed RTD supervisors to  report that there had been an accident but that it did not involve her. She  then continued on her route.  </P> <P> "She is claiming she didn't know she hit him," Weller said.  </P> <P> However, police said two witnesses who were not on the bus said they saw the  vehicle bounce as the front and rear tires struck Edwards.  </P></p>

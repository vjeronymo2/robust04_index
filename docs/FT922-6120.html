			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Launch date for Sony's Mini Disc SONY, the Japanese consumer electronics group, said yesterday it planned to introduce its Mini Disc portable player, a miniaturised version of the compact disc, in Japan by November 1 and in main overseas markets by Christmas. The Mini Disc is competing against the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) as the next-generation recording system with the audio quality of the compact disc (CD). Sony, which is seeking a new popular product to reverse its fall in earnings for fiscal 1991, hopes the Mini Disc will repeat the success of its Walkman cassette player, with the Mini Disc replacing cassettes in the same way the CD has succeeded the long-playing record. The Mini Disc will be the first compact disc system able to record as well as play. Sony said it would price the Mini Disc at Y80,000 (Dollars 617) for a record/playback model and Y60,000 for a playback-only version. Pre-recorded mini disc albums would cost about the same as CD albums, which is Y2,500 in Japan, while blank discs would be about Y1,000. Matsushita recently announced it would market its first Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) player in Japan on September 21. The DCC table unit would be priced at Y135,000. A portable DCC player is scheduled to be launched next spring at a lower price. The DCC technology, which uses a cassette tape, was developed by Philips of the Netherlands. Analysts believe that the Mini Disc may have gained a competitive edge over the DCC, at least in the Japanese market, because of its lower price and its compact disc format. 'The failure of digital audio tape (Dat) indicates that consumer interest in the use of cassette tape is waning, while the preference for compact discs is growing,' says Mr Chuck Goto, an analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities. The price of the Mini Disc must still fall further to penetrate the mass market, he adds. However, Mr Barry Dargan, deputy head of research at James Capel in Tokyo, believes there is still consumer resistence to both the Mini Disc and DCC systems, with the most popular alternative being a recordable standard-size compact disc. 'The advantage with the Mini Disc is that it is at least a step in that direction.' Sony said it has signed licensing agreements with 22 hardware manufacturers for Mini Disc technology. They include many of the main Japanese and Korean consumer electronics companies. Eight companies have signed similar agreements to produce recorded software and 10 to make blank discs.</p>

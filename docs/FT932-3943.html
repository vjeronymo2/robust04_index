			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Wimpey launches first rights issue GEORGE Wimpey, the UK construction group, yesterday broke with history by announcing the first rights issue since its formation 110 years ago. The company is raising Pounds 104m in the one-for-four issue at 148p a share. Wimpey's share price, which had almost trebled since sterling left the ERM last September, yesterday slipped 3p to 184p. It said the proceeds would be used to buy land to take advantage of recovery in the UK housing market. Quarry businesses in the UK and US would also be modernised and expanded. In March, Grove Charity Management, a charitable trust established in 1955 by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, Wimpey's founder, placed the bulk of its 34 per cent stake. This is thought to have cleared the way for the rights issue. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said that since the beginning of this year the group had sold 55 per cent more UK homes - including sales to housing associations - than during the first five months of last year. 'I firmly believe that a housing market recovery is under way at last, although progress is likely to be gradual rather than dramatic.' Private sector sales alone rose 27 per cent despite a normal seasonal slowdown in May. 'House prices prices have stopped falling and builders have begun to reduce some of the sales incentives introduced during the recession. Recovery in the general construction industry, however, is unlikely to occur before 1995,' said Mr Dwyer. He expected that by next year land prices would rise again. It made sense to increase the size of the group's land holdings before this happened to 'enable the group to achieve attractive margins on sales in 1994 and 1995'. This year UK house sales by Wimpey were expected to rise from 5,600 to at least 7,000. Analysts say the group is aiming to build 9,000 homes a year by the mid to late 1990s, making it the country's largest housebuilder, ahead of Tarmac, the current market leader. Wimpey said its net debt, reduced from more than Pounds 350m two years ago to Pounds 136m at the end of last year, had risen since the year-end to Pounds 159m due to a normal seasonal upturn in working capital requirements. Grove is not expected to take up the rights attached to its remaining 5 per cent stake. The issue has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and the brokers are Cazenove. Wimpey expects to pay a minimum total dividend for this year of 5.25p on the increased equity, the same as last year. London SE, Page 34; Lex, Page 14; Background, Page 18</p>

Gromov, commander in chief of </F> the Russian Federation Navy, by Vladimir Maryukha, under the  "Interlocutor of the Day" rubric; place and date not given:  "There Is No No-Man's-Land Between Sea and Shore"]    [Text] Calling Card    Admiral Feliks Nikolayevich Gromov is commander in chief of  the Russian Federation Navy. On graduating from the Pacific  Higher Naval School he progressed via his first postings to the  command of a destroyer, a cruiser, and a squadron of ships. He  has served in the Pacific and Northern Fleets and at the  Leningrad Naval Base. He has been commander of the Northern  Fleet and first deputy commander in chief of the Navy.    [Maryukha] Feliks Nikolayevich, Russia's Navy has another  year behind it, not the best of years, moreover, in its almost  300-year history. How did seamen cope with the tasks they were  set at the beginning of 1993?    [Gromov] The tasks that the Navy was set a year ago have  been  performed. This means that the Navy has succeeded in preserving  the specified level of combat readiness of the fleets' main  large strategic formations and combined units, as well as their  ability to shift in a timely and organized manner from a  peacetime to a wartime footing and perform their main  operational tasks within the prescribed timeframes.    I think that everyone realizes that the year has not been  one  of the best in the fleet's history: There is no no-man's-land  between the sea and shore and all the economic, political, and  other difficulties that the country is experiencing were bound  to affect the state of the Navy.    Nevertheless it was 1993 that once again saw an increase in  the intensity and effectiveness of strategic submarines' combat  service and alert duty. Foreign naval forces' activity was  reliably monitored by the general-purpose forces. At the same  time Russian ships collaborated intensively with multinational  forces in the Persian Gulf and established contacts between  Russians and the population of other countries during official  visits, the number of which also increased.    [Maryukha] Against the overall backdrop of the difficulties  experienced by the country the increase in the intensity of  naval service cannot help but evoke pleasure and...surprise:  How did it prove possible to achieve positive change?    [Gromov] First, I must say that the Navy's combat training  was carried out in a systematic manner. Intensively, but  without straining them to breaking point. Of course there were  and still are difficulties -- in repairing ships and providing  the Navy with all kinds of supplies. However, the Navy's role  goes far beyond the as yet unresolved problems. And in this  main area Russian seamen have shown themselves at their best.    The "Typhoon-93" command staff training exercise under the  leadership of the defense minister, involving the Northern and  Pacific Fleets, confirmed the naval strategic nuclear forces'  readiness to perform their set tasks and the staffs'  preparedness for field command and control of the main attack  forces. The Navy's combat readiness was also confirmed by the  competitive tactical exercises for the Navy championship which  resumed after a year's gap. This was the first time that the  Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying heavy cruiser took part in these  exercises. And the participation of ships of the Northern,  Baltic, and Pacific Fleets in joint exercises with other  countries' navies confirmed our seamen's supreme naval combat,  weapons, and tactical proficiency. Russian seamen worthily  represented our country in Canada, the United States, Britain,  France, and Greece, and, after a 90-year gap, in China and South  Korea.    This past year combat training plans did indeed have to be  adjusted and the number of course tasks reduced. Factors beyond  the fleet's control were responsible for this -- lack of fuel,  lubricants, ship repair services, a dramatic reduction in  funding, and undermanning of ships. But despite all this the  organizational, moral, and psychological groundwork was laid in  1993 for a qualitatively new approach to the system of training  command and control organs and naval forces.    [Maryukha] But, Feliks Nikolayevich, last year it did not  nonetheless prove possible to avoid a threat to the future of  the Navy: Ships "left" Navy ranks early and a difficult  situation also arose with "the Navy's wings" -- the air force....    [Gromov] In 1993 naval aviation began using the ship-based  Su-27K fighter. ASW aviation must also be recorded has having  shown an improvement. However, the economic crisis and the  resulting lack of new equipment and spare parts, and holdups  with aviation fuel did indeed reduce flying time, disrupt combat  training plans, and, naturally, reduce naval aviators' combat  readiness and flight safety.    The worst situation developed in the Black Sea Fleet air  force: Owing to nondelivery of spare parts and inadequate  repairs, around half of the aircraft and helicopters are unable  to take to the air today.    I would also describe the upgrading and replacement of the  Navy's ships as an issue of statewide importance. More  continuity than ever before is needed here: from one model or  design of a ship to another more sophisticated model, from the  slips to the plant moorings. It is extremely essential that we  preserve this technological chain both from the viewpoint of  safeguarding the qualitative parameters of the fleet's fighting  strength and also from the moral and psychological viewpoint.    In 1994 the Navy plans to obtain from industry the Petr  Velikiy nuclear missile cruiser, a large ASW ship, patrol  escorts, and certain other ships. The "Sever" machine building  enterprise in Severodvinsk recently began construction of the  first of class of a promising multirole nuclear submarine.  Those are the immediate prospects as regards Navy  replenishment, prospects that are directly dependent on full  funding.    In the longer term it is planned to further develop combat  surface ships. Priority here will be given to destroyers,  patrol escorts, and minesweepers. There are plans to develop a  new multirole shore-based aircraft for naval aviation, intended  primarily to perform tasks of covering the surface and  underwater situation.    On the other hand, the quantitative reduction of the fleet  will continue. This is brought about by the tasks of the new  military doctrine and the state's economic potential. Our main  aim is to create a relatively small, but qualitatively perfect  and highly effective Navy, which would be less economically  burdensome for the country than in the past. This task will be  performed at the same time as the reform of the fleet and the  construction of new ships. But I would not call the situation  that is emerging, as this task is resolved, a simple one.    [Maryukha] In your view, can it be rectified somehow?    [Gromov] It must be, but is there a real chance of doing so?    In any sector of industry, in any branch of the Armed Forces  there will be plenty of problems that the department in question  considers paramount. We realize that the country is in a  difficult economic position and that the budget is not, so to  speak, elastic.    On the other hand, there must also be awareness that the  accumulated potential with its high technologies for the  construction of both surface ships and submarines must not  disappear and that, if they are lost, it will subsequently be  hard for decades to produce these kinds of technologies and  forms of production sharing.    I think that 1994 should nonetheless be the year that sees  the country's economic revival. And that inspires hope. At the  same time one must constantly think about those serving today  and who will serve the Russian Navy in the future....    [Maryukha] I understand your concern: The naval budget,  like a shagreen skin, is shrinking drastically with every day  that passes, and moreover by no means having fulfilled our  wishes -- owing to inflation, cuts in defense spending... But,  along with a technically upgraded Navy, it is also necessary to  resolve the problems of providing seamen with social protection,  primarily, providing them with housing....    [Gromov] Last year we succeeded, despite all the  difficulties with funding, in building and obtaining 6,035  apartments. That is with a total number of 13,220 people  without apartments and 4,184 people in need of an improvement in  their housing conditions.    On the other hand, this number of people in need of housing  is spread extremely unevenly across the regions where the Navy  is based. In the Baltic Fleet it is primarily a question of  Baltiysk and Kaliningrad, where housing was previously in short  supply and requirements have now risen in connection with the  troop withdrawal from the Baltic countries. In the Northern  Fleet it is mainly the city of Murmansk and, in part,  Severomorsk. And in the Pacific Fleet it is a question of  Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. In the Black Sea  Fleet Sevastopol bears the brunt of the problems involved in  resolving the housing problem. This problem is also hard to  resolve in Moscow and St. Petersburg.    That is why since 1992 we have been taking a more rational  approach to resolving the question of housing construction. Now  the main emphasis is being laid on housing construction in  Russia's middle zone in order to move people away from the  closed garrisons. I have also set the task of not expanding  certain military camps but improving their structure.    Of course, uneven inadequate funding has a considerable  impact on this process. At the same time feasible housing  construction plans should be drawn up. If the population of a  garrison is falling, we should probably take a careful look at  what option is more advisable here -- building a new  kindergarten or refurbishing existing sociocultural consumer  facilities, etc. That is, a rational approach must prevail  today. In 1994 we are planning to build around 11,500  apartments with our own funds and via shared participation.  Time will tell what comes of that. And, of course, what sort  of money is allocated.    [Maryukha] Feliks Nikolayevich, since we have started  talking about the plans for 1994 I think it appropriate to ask  you about the tasks that the Navy is to tackle this year.    [Gromov] To use the language of command the Navy must  maintain the strength and status of the naval strategic forces  at a level which guarantees that tasks are implemented under any  conditions and maintain the strength and status of the  general-purpose forces to provide all-around backup for the  Navy's activity in conflict-prevention from Russia's maritime  sectors....    Combat service and combat alert duty remain the fundamental  means of performing these main tasks. In order to perform these  tasks it is necessary to resolve a set of questions pertaining  to updating and reducing the amount of specific-task equipment  amid the ongoing naval downsizing and improve the basing and  support system for the Navy's remaining ships. This is  primarily a question of providing amenities for the Baltic Fleet  and Caspian Flotilla forces that are being withdrawn and  removing shore-based naval infrastructures from Latvia, Estonia,  and Belarus. Combat training, like last year, starts with  training at the base and will be completed during integrated sea  voyages [kompleksnyye vykhody v more]. This is dictated by the  fact that one should not count on improvement in the Navy's  material and technical support and instances of putting to sea  with no serious intent the Navy too dear.    Nevertheless ships should not stay at their moorings for  long. Coastal waters and the oceans of the world will be their  zone of operations.    The main task facing the command of the Navy remains the  creation of normal service and living conditions for all  personnel -- seamen, warrant officers, and officers. It is a  question of boosting the prestige of Navy service and all the  concepts that go with this. It is a question of creating  conditions of service where every man does his job. Naval  personnel and flight personnel do their job, while shore-based  structures do theirs. That is hard to achieve, but only then  will the fleet unconditionally perform its main function.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (26): Monopolies will have to be abolished - Book Review of Telecom reforms / lessons learned 'Implementing Reforms in the Telecommunications Sector: Lessons from Experience.' Edited by Bjorn Wellenius and Peter A Stern; The World Bank, 757 pages; price Dollars 59.95 Bjorn Wellenius is telecommunications adviser to the World Bank and a respected authority on telecoms development and restructuring. He and Peter Stern have done a great service to governments and the telecoms industry by bringing together this collection of studies on the international experience of reform in the telecoms sector. The lessons are of critical importance to developing and developed countries alike. Virtually everyone agrees that telecoms modernisation is a spur to economic growth, and will become steadily more important as the information revolution advances. Governments start from starkly differing positions, within as much as between regions. At this summer's conference of the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity in Bangkok, a speaker hailing the advance of the superhighway in Australia was followed by another from Papau New Guinea recounting the treks faced by villagers wanting to reach a rural pay phone. There is no pretence in this book - which includes case studies of countries at all stages from development, from Sri Lanka to France - that reform can proceed without allowance for distinctive national and regional traits. Nor is there any simplistic assertion that 'big-bang' change is the only viable strategy. The US telecoms industry has retained its leading edge within the confines of a law drafted in 1934 - which looks set to survive for some while yet following the collapse of this year's Congressional legislation - while the Canadian telecoms industry operates within a law adopted in 1906 which is only now being redrafted. In the developing world, 'build, operate, transfer' contracts have evolved to inject private and foreign capital without breaching formal monopoly regimes. Even China's ministry of posts and telecommunications looks set to devise an elaborate ruse to the same effect, following contracts signed in principle this month with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK group which owns a majority stake in Hongkong Telecom. Yet the basic argument of the book, repeatedly propounded by the editors and contributors, is simple and universal in its application: that the only effective way to counter persistent shortfalls in telecoms investment is for governments to attract greater private sector participation. And that can only be done by abolishing monopolies, withdrawing the state from the direct provision of services, and opening up telecoms services and infrastructure to new entrants. Wellenius and Stern note in the preface: 'Traditional state monopolies are giving way to more complex sector structures that seek to overcome past constraints on telecoms development through commercialisation of operations, competition and private sector participation.' Six hundred pages later, Richard Schultz wraps up the study with a subtle attack on the 'exaggerated fears of restructuring,' highlighting the 'enhanced and refurbished' role left for the state after privatisation and regulatory reform. For policy-makers, the most useful of the 39 intervening chapters are the introduction and the regional overviews, which set reform programmes within the broad parameters of public sector constraints and the demands of private investors. The introduction by Wellenius and Stern is about politics as much as telecoms. Discussing the slow pace of reform in sub-Saharan Africa, they note that the region could have 'most to gain' from reform but that little has happened in part because 'national security is still a politically significant issue, compounded by a broader concern about foreign control of key factors of economic production and distribution'. The rapid development of telecoms in Latin America is explicitly linked to the return to democracy across the region in the late 1980s. The thesis that economic liberalisation requires prior political liberalisation is hardly novel, nor is it necessarily disproved by China's experience. In the case of telecoms, however, it is a challenge to those, notably in the US, who see telecoms development and the 'global information infrastructure' as a means to promote democracy and all that goes with it. The reverse is probably the reality. I shall never forget a phone interview earlier this year with a western businessman in Rwanda's capital of Kigali, across a brilliantly clear fibre-optic international line, as he described the slaughter and mayhem taking place in the streets outside. Latin America is the developing-world model which inspires the authors. Chile led the way with privatisation in 1987; in Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela subsequent privatisations were completed in less than two years (only in Mexico was much done to improve the network before privatisation); and most other countries in the region have followed suit. In his over-view, Wellenius pronounces most of the reforms broadly successful, although he notes serious regulatory issues which remain unresolved. His rule of thumb is that privatisation and liberalisation can be carried through in two or three years, but it takes a decade to sort out the regulation. A key factor in the Mexican reform process was the opening of the cellular market to competition at an early stage of the reform process. This is also the case across Asia-Pacific and Europe, where competition in cellular networks is now widespread and is being extended to fixed-line networks. There are three clear benefits to such an incremental strategy: it obliges governments to tackle inter-connection and regulation of the state operator before its main business is subject to competition; it forces the pace of reform in the fixed-wire sector, where political and trade union obstacles to change are greater; and it brings together consortia, often led by non-telecoms groups such as Mannesmann in Germany and Bouygues in France, which can move across to the larger fixed-wire sector as liberalisation advances. The mobile communications sector, becoming ever more important, is strangely neglected. The absence of an index is frustrating. But the book is nonetheless a bible for those contemplating structural telecoms reform.</p>

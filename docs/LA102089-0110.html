			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> In America, the '60s meant Warhol and Pop. The movement was actually pollinated  before that by London's Beat movement in music, art and letters, and the  photographs of Michael Cooper recorded it all. Cooper made a name shooting  album jackets for the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. He also worked for art  dealer Robert Fraser, whose gallery was the hub of the '60s scene in England.  Symbol and product of those fast, fraught times, Cooper died tragically in 1973  at age 31.  </P> <P> His assistant has collected and salvaged the prints Cooper left behind to form  a show of photos dated 1963-73, as well as a slick, salable portfolio with  anecdotes by '60s luminaries. Perhaps because Cooper's negatives laid in disuse  for so long, or because Cooper was still a young, evolving photographer when he  died, many of the black-and-white works have a rough edge and don't arrest our  attention for technical virtuosity. They grab us as gutsy, candid freeze frames  of the pulse of an era: Bay Area poet Allen Ginsberg protests the Vietnam War;  a youthful Dennis Hopper, isolated against black, is a sultry rebel without a  cause; a young flaxen-haired David Hockney poses with a winsome boy.  </P> <P> There are countless shots of prankster Rolling Stones in eccentric garb. A  photo of Marcel Duchamp, aged and ever cagey, is priceless, as are warm views  of surrealist Rene Magritte. The '60s are big business today, but in spite of  the posthumous hype one senses Cooper's gentle creative spirit. (Earl McGrath  Gallery, 454 N. Robertson Blvd., to Nov. 7.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The domestic political  situation took a turn for the worse Monday when the opposition  Democratic Party (DP) decided to force a showdown with the  ruling party over the suspended parliamentary investigation of  the Sangmudae scandal.    At a meeting of its supreme council on Monday, the DP  decided  to take strong action against the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party and the government which, it said, have been balking at  the parliamentary probe.    Spurred by an opposition demand, the National Assembly had  invoked its parliamentary right to probe the Sangmudae scam.    The opposition party claims that the president of a  construction company, Cho Ki-hyon, created a slush fund out of  profits he made from a defense contract to move a facility  called Sangmudae in Kwangju to the city's outskirts.    The DP alleges that part of the fund was eventually  funnelled  into the ruling party during the 1992 presidential election. In  calling for the probe, the opposition party wanted the National  Assembly to find out the truth behind the allegations.    As a result of Monday's decision, the DP plans to take its  case directly to the people by having newspapers publish the  facts uncovered so far by the parliamentary investigation and  details of the DP's own probe, as well as records of the  prosecution's investigation obtained by the party.    The opposition party also decided to sue Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae, Kim Chong-ku, chief of the Seoul District  Prosecutor's Office, Sin Song-taek, chief judge of the Seoul  Criminal District Court, and managers and other officials at 10  branch offices of six banks who refused to release to opposition  lawmakers the deposit records of people involved in the alleged  scandal.    In addition, the party will push for the impeachment of  Defense Minister Yi, Chief Judge Sin and Justice Minister Kim  Tu-hui.    As for impeaching President Kim Yong-sam, the DP will  withhold a decision because initiation of the procedure requires  the signatures of more than half the National Assembly  representatives.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WRONG MAN ARRESTED TWICE FOR SAME CRIME;  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD MECHANIC SUES FOR LATEST JAILING ON CHICAGO RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY  WARRANT  </P> <P> Chicago: The City of Big Shoulders. And to Roberto Perales Hernandez, the City  of Big Trouble.  </P> <P> Perales, 31, an unemployed auto mechanic from Inglewood, said that twice in the  last three years he has been picked up by police and held in Los Angeles County  Jail as a suspect in a 1985 Chicago residential burglary.  </P> <P> "They said I had a warrant in Chicago," Perales said this week. "I said, 'I've  never been to Chicago. How could I have a warrant there!' "  </P> <P> The answer, Perales says, is that authorities have confused him with another  Roberto Hernandez. Perales commonly writes his name in the Spanish style, with  his mother's maiden name last -- Roberto Perales Hernandez.  </P> <P> Perales has filed a lawsuit in Torrance Superior Court, charging the Hawthorne  Police Department, Los Angeles County and the state with false imprisonment,  infliction of emotional distress and civil rights violations stemming from the  most recent arrest last year.  </P> <P> Perales had previously received a $7,000 settlement from the county, which held  him for 12 days in 1986 on the Chicago warrant before realizing he was the  wrong man, said his attorney, Raul Lomas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment  </P> <P> Attorneys for the county, the city of Hawthorne and the state said they will  not comment on either arrest as long as Perales' new lawsuit is pending.  </P> <P> The confusion centers on a single entry in a computer database that provides  police throughout the country with information on crime and criminals.  </P> <P> The National Crime Information Center computer lists a Roberto Hernandez as  wanted by the Cook County, Ill., Sheriff's Department for a 1985 residential  burglary. The wanted man is described as 5 feet, 8 inches, 160 pounds with  brown hair and brown eyes and a tattoo on his left arm. He was born on Feb. 2,  1958. No middle name is listed.  </P> <P> Perales describes himself as 5 feet, 8 inches, 140 pounds with brown hair and  brown eyes and tattoos on his left arm and hand. He, too, was born on Feb. 2,  1958.  </P> <P> To add to the confusion, Perales reports a Social Security number that differs  by only one digit from the one listed for the wanted man.  </P> <P> Perales said he first became aware of the Chicago warrant on Feb. 24, 1986,  when Inglewood police arrested him for drunk driving.  </P> <P> The Tijuana, Mexico, native said he was held for 12 days at Los Angeles County  Jail on the warrant, despite the fact that he was not sentenced to jail for his  first drunk driving offense. He was subsequently placed on probation and had  his license suspended for three months.  </P> <P> After reaching the $7,000 out-of-court settlement with the county in that case,  Perales said, "I thought everything was OK in their computer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stopped on Way to Work  </P> <P> But on March 15, 1988, Perales said, he was pulled over by Hawthorne police  officers as he drove to work. Perales said the officers stopped him because his  car registration stickers had expired, but checked their computer and found two  outstanding warrants -- one for an unpaid ticket for not wearing a safety belt  and the other for the Chicago burglary.  </P> <P> "I said, 'I can't believe this. I'm going back to County Jail!' " Perales said.  "I told them, 'I've been through this once before and they found out it wasn't  me.' "  </P> <P> Court documents show that Inglewood Municipal Court Commissioner Wesley A.  Russell ordered Perales released from jail the day after his arrest, saying  that a night in County Jail was sufficient penalty for not paying the seat belt  ticket.  </P> <P> But sheriff's deputies cited the Chicago warrant and said they would not let  him go, Perales said. When he told deputies that they had the wrong man,  Perales said they responded, "That's what they all say."  </P> <P> Perales said he feared he would lose his job and that his wife suffered severe  anxiety, because the couple is still in the process of applying to be legalized  under the amnesty program.  </P> <P> He was held for seven days before deputies awoke him early in the morning and  told him he was free, Perales said. The jailers offered no explanation, but  Perales said he assumed that authorities realized they had the wrong man when  fingerprints arrived from Chicago.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials won't say why Perales was released, or even if he  was jailed in the first place.  </P> <P> Attorney Lomas said he hopes to obtain a court order for Perales to give to  officers, stating that he is not the man wanted on the Chicago warrant.  </P> <P> That might be a good idea. The Cook County Sheriff's Department and the  National Crime Information Center computer still listed Roberto Hernandez as a  wanted man last week.  </P></p>

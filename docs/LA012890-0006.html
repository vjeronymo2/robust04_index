			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHES MAKE THE MOVIE;  </P> <P> THE NEW EDITH HEADS OF HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> THEY SPEND MORE TIME looking through fashion magazines and history books than  sketching. They devote hours to shopping at Bullock's, Saks Fifth Avenue and  Western Costume. They scour garage sales and downtown clothing shops in search  of the perfect icon of an era. These scavengers of style are the new breed of  costume designers, the new Edith Heads of Hollywood.  </P> <P> Head, who lavishly costumed more than 1,000 films for Paramount and Universal  and won eight Academy Awards, began her career in the 1920s and worked until  her death in 1981. During her heyday, the '30s and '40s, quality workmanship  was affordable, and fashion trends, such as padded shoulders, were born on the  screen. Today, independent costume designers are limited by labor costs and  movie realism. Often, rather than create original garments, they opt to adapt  what they buy off the rack.  </P> <P> But the glamour isn't lost. Costume design is still a business played out under  the spotlight. Working with the world's top actors and directors, the new  designers wield the creative power to shape, via costume, today's box-office  hits. Most of the designers featured here have been nominated for Academy  Awards, but none has won. Yet.  </P> <P> AGGIE GUERARD RODGERS  </P> <P> As a teen-ager, Aggie Guerard Rodgers lived the San Joaquin Valley life that  George Lucas captured in his 1973 film, "American Graffiti." So it made sense  that she landed the costume designer's job. Besides, no one else would work  within Lucas' skimpy $4,000 budget.  </P> <P> The film's madras shirts and pleated skirts were an auspicious start for  Rodgers, who is now 46 and has a master's degree in costume design from Cal  State Long Beach. She went on to bigger films, including "One Flew Over the  Cuckoo's Nest," the Best Picture of 1975, "The Return of the Jedi," which had a  costume budget of $800,000, and "The Color Purple," for which she earned her  first Academy Award nomination.  </P> <P> For "Beetlejuice," Rodgers stretched her imagination to dress Michael Keaton  who, as a demon wandering hell and earth, appears in a wild black-and-white  suit. One scene called for Keaton's arms to turn into hammers and his head to  become a carousel, so Rodgers worked with technicians to fit mechanical devices  inside the garment. Special effects also required Rodgers to carefully design  the pajamas worn by Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Witches  of Eastwick." Cut-away duplicates had to accommodate harnesses used during  flight scenes.  </P> <P> In all of her projects, Rodgers uses a piece of her late mother's wardrobe. For  "I Love You to Death," which opens soon, she included her mother's jewelry in a  dinner scene. Says Rodgers: "I'm very sentimental."  </P> <P> DEBORAH NADOOLMAN  </P> <P> Deborah Nadoolman, who cut her teeth on television costume design, scrounged up  black Ray-Ban shades for Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi in the 1980 film "The  Blues Brothers," and a Wayfarer trend was born. In 1981, she outfitted Harrison  Ford in his battered flight jacket and fedora for "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  And in 1982, she created the red-and-black leather jacket for Michael Jackson's  "Thriller" video. It's no coincidence that safari gear and the leather look  have been popular ever since.  </P> <P> "I've had tremendous luck," says the 37-year-old wife of director John Landis.  "The clothes I've designed have gone on to become part of the popular culture."  Last year, the jacket that Nadoolman distressed by hand with a wire brush for  "Raiders" earned a place in the entertainment collection of the Smithsonian  Institution's Museum of American History.  </P> <P> More recently, Nadoolman, who holds a master's degree in costume design from  UCLA, worked on Eddie Murphy's "Coming to America." For the modern fairy tale,  she fashioned what she calls the "African ascot" look, combining ethnic motifs  and '50s couture silhouettes. "The goal was to establish the enormity of  Zamunda's wealth," she says of the fictitious country. The result was a tuxedo  topped by an ocelot skin, complete with cubic zirconium eyes; crown jewels of  real pearls, semiprecious stones and paste diamonds -- and Nadoolman's first  Academy Award nomination.  </P> <P> MARILYN VANCE-STRAKER  </P> <P> Marilyn Vance-Straker, 42, is known as a modern-day costume designer because  many of her films, such as "The Breakfast Club," "Die Hard" and "Uncle Buck,"  take place in the undefined present. The contemporary stories pose problems  that period pieces don't. Because most wardrobes are designed at least 18  months before the film is released, "you have to anticipate trends or avoid  them because otherwise the film looks dated," she explains.  </P> <P> Quick problem-solving is Vance-Straker's forte, so she was disappointed but  prepared when disaster struck Brian De Palma's "The Untouchables." "After the  longest wait, we got the suits from Giorgio Armani in Italy -- $200,000 worth,  mind you -- and then we spent the next 72 days remaking every inch," she  recalls. "The shape of the lapels, the pads in the shoulders, the pocket  treatments, the sleeves, the width of the pant legs, even the lining -- nothing  worked." Though Armani demanded on-screen credit, her rescue effort brought her  first Academy Award nomination.  </P> <P> A graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and a former  sportswear designer, Vance-Straker usually works on three films a year.  "Sometimes the amount of time you spend is purely determined by the bottom  line," she says. "If the producers can afford you for only two weeks, you give  them all you've got for 14 days. You approach every film as if it's going to be  a major hit, so every film is your best effort."  </P> <P> ELLEN MIROJNICK  </P> <P> Ellen Mirojnick is as interested in characters' psyches as she is in their  costumes. So, long before the 40-year-old designer sits down at her drawing  table, she explores "how they feel about love and hate, why they feel the way  they do." Her character analysis has determined the costumes for "The Flamingo  Kid," "Cocktail," "Talk Radio" and Steven Spielberg's latest release, "Always."  </P> <P> She has become linked to Michael Douglas, whom she has dressed in three films  -- not bad for someone who was thrown out of the Parsons School of Design for  flunking pattern-making.To turn him into the unscrupulous Gordon Gekko in "Wall  Street," Mirojnick researched men in similar jobs and then embellished reality.  Where she found classic suspenders, a plain white shirt and a simple paisley  tie, she replaced them with ostentatious striped braces with white leather  attachments, a notice-me blue shirt with a white collar and an I-dare-you  brocade tie.  </P> <P> In stark contrast are the somber black wardrobes of at least two of her other  films. For "Fatal Attraction," Mirojnick designed to foreshadow Douglas'  psychological state as a cheating husband whose lover is out to kill him: "His  spirits got darker and darker as the story progressed, and so did the clothes."  For "Black Rain," Mirojnick styled clothing to emphasize Douglas' hostility as  a no-nonsense detective: "It was important that he feel like a tough guy, so I  gave him tight clothes and slick textures. The leather jacket was the obvious  choice."  </P></p>

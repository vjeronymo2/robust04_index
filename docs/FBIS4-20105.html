			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Peter </F> Snow in London on 25 April from the "Newsnight" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Snow] I asked the French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe how he would persuade a skeptical world audience that any  new peace plan for Bosnia would actually be enforced.    [Juppe] We have enforced our principles in Sarajevo, and we  are enforcing them in Gorazde, because the goal which we had  when we approved the resolution of the Security Council and the  decision of the Atlantic Alliance has been reached now in  Gorazde.    [Snow] The problem is, isn't it, that the Serbs, although  they may have stopped shelling Gorazde now and are pulling their  heavy weapons out, they're still there, their infantry isn't  pulling back. Doesn't mean that Gorazde is effectively  neutralized?    [Juppe] I don't think so. Sarajevo is not neutralized, life  is coming again in Sarajevo. And we have the same target in  Gorazde and it's only a first step of course, because the  solution will be diplomatic and political and not military. We  must have a cease-fire, then a cessation of hostilities, then a  withdrawal of troops, and then a political settlement. And the  withdrawal, the final withdrawal of Serb troops, will take place  only when we have a political and global settlement in Bosnia,  of course.    [Snow] Are you confident, Foreign Minister, that you can get  the Serbs not just to stop where they are, not just to cease  fire, but to withdraw from where they are?    [Juppe] The Serbs have accepted the percentage of the  territory of Bosnia of about 50 percent, so they must withdraw  by about 20 percent, according to their presence at the moment  on the ground. So that's the target.</p>

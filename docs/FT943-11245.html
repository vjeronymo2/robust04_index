			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / US defies Gatt on Mexican cement The US has doubled anti-dumping duties on imports of Mexican cement despite a Gatt panel ruling that the duties are illegal, Mexico told Gatt's anti-dumping committee last week. The US has refused to accept the ruling, which dates from July 1992, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The independent panel said in its report that the procedures used by the US authorities to determine dumping in this case breached Gatt rules. The panel recommended that Mexican exporters should be refunded the anti-dumping duties already paid. Instead, Mexico said the duties had twice been increased from their original level of 30.74 per cent to 61.85 per cent in May this year. Urging adoption of the report, Mexico said there was currently a shortfall in domestic US cement production. This, and the consequent high prices, had prompted the National Association of Home Builders, representing 175,000 building companies in the US, to ask Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to repeal the duties.</p>

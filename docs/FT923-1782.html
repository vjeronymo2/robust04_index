			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Support for vote on Irish claim THE IRISH government has indicated it will support a referendum to amend its territorial claim over Northern Ireland, if 'a fair and honourable accommodation' can be reached between unionist and nationalists in the talks on the province's future. This could mean rewriting articles two and three of the 1937 Irish constitution which lay claim to the 6 counties of Northern Ireland. The round-table talks, which move to Dublin today, will be attended by the British and Irish governments, and three of the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. The hard-line Democratic Unionist Party said on Friday it would not send a delegation to Dublin, arguing that the Irish government had not shown any flexibility on its territorial claim. However a statement to unionist leaders in Stormont last Friday by Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, - leaked to Sunday newspapers in Dublin and Belfast - indicates the Irish government said it was prepared to go ahead with a referendum in the context of an overall settlement. The statement said: 'If  .. our negotiations achieved the basis of a 'new beginning' in the relationship between the two (nationalist and unionist) traditions in Ireland, and if agreement on a fair and honourable accommodation between them were to entail any constitutional consequence in our jurisdiction, the government could approach the electorate with the hope and prospect of a positive response'. Mr Ken McGinnis, the deputy leader of the Official Unionist Party said: 'The tone has modified noticeably from what we previously understood to be the Irish government's position.' However, Mr Sammy Wilson, a spokesman for the DUP, said the Irish government's position was 'totally unattractive'.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (2): Challenge of the hard core areas - Pump priming in North East England and the Midlands THE MURDER of a hostel dweller drinking in a pub in a rough area of Newcastle upon Tyne is not the sort of incident in which one would expect leading businessmen to take a personal interest. But when a man was stabbed to death last month at The Chieftain, in Newcastle's Cruddas Park area, Barclays bank north east England regional director Mr John Ward immediately thought 'Oh no, not my patch'. It was not that Cruddas Park teems with Barclays customers; indeed, it is doubtful whether many of its residents have a cheque book, far less savings or investments. Mr Ward's response was because this deprived inner city area of high rise flats and post-war terraces, centred on a bleak concrete shopping centre of which The Chieftain is part, has been the focus of one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by any of the Business Leadership Teams fostered by Business in the Community. Nobody, even before the murder, was claiming Cruddas Park had been totally transformed since it was identified in late 1988 by The Newcastle Initiative, the city's Business Leadership Team, as a testbed for how TNI's skills, contacts and resources could be focused on regenerating an area brought low by high unemployment and social problems. The stabbing served as a reminder that a web of social and economic difficulties woven over decades cannot be unravelled by a couple of years of private sector intervention. But TNI's experiment, in which it has been supported by central government departments, Labour-controlled Newcastle City Council and some local residents, has made Cruddas Park a less threatening place to live in and, through tackling residents' employment problems - and some employers' prejudice - transformed some people's lives. It has also wrought a small transformation by making prominent Tyneside businesspeople feel that what happens in Cruddas Park affects them; for years such areas have been almost totally bypassed by the affluent, none of whom would dream of living there. TNI was one of the first Business Leadership Teams set up in the wake of the Calderdale Partnership, created in 1987 by Business in the Community to bring together local business leaders to tackle their area's problems. Today, there are 16 BLTs in the UK as well a number of other more tightly-focused bodies, not formally constituted but working on similar lines. The BLTs' resolute individualism in the way they interpret their role is reflected even in their patchwork quilt of names, from the Bradford Breakthrough to West London Leadership, Teesside Tomorrow and the Wearside Opportunity. But they share a common philosophy: the belief that companies' commercial success depends largely on the economic health of their local communities and, therefore, that those companies which improve their community's economic health enhance their own businesses too. The BLTs are also united in being led by the private sector, in recruiting the businesspeople on their boards only from the most senior level and in being dedicated to tackling, in their particular area, what they perceive as the key problems. Another uniting factor, which can be both a strength and a weakness, is that BLTs do not have any function they are legally obliged to fulfil, nor any automatic funding. At its best this means they can use the often considerable influence of their prominent members to promote the wellbeing of their area and also bring fresh thinking to seemingly intractable problems. 'They act but they are not constrained,' says Mr Paul Johnson, BIC's regional director in north east England. 'They have a very powerful lobbying impact.' At a time when very many companies are both short of spare money and constantly under pressure to donate funds to myriad worthy causes, BLTs can provide an appealingly flexible 'value added' route to community involvement enabling companies to offer access to their services or their skilled staff rather than cash. Furthermore, BLTs can create a meeting point, for the good of the local community, for busy business leaders who would otherwise not know each other nor realise they had common cause. At the worst, however, BLTs' non-official status means they can be accused of seeking credit for investments and successes for which other organisations also claim kudos. It can also lead BLTs into a political quagmire where they find themselves caught between those councillors and officers who welcome their input and those who resent it; a major heritage project championed by one BLT bit the dust when blocked, late in the day, by the 'antis'. 'I think their attitude is: why should these businessmen meddle in something which is the council's job,' says a successful businessman on the board of the BLT involved. 'You have to understand the mentality - it's a hostile attitude to the nasty capitalists.' However, the same BLT has found support from the same council for smaller projects and strong encouragement from some other local authorities. The successful businessman, although irked that valuable time was wasted, is still enthusiastic about his BLT involvement. To operate effectively BLTs need constant injections of new blood; hence BIC's decision to hold a series of regional conferences on its Directions in the Nineties campaign. The first two, in Gateshead and Birmingham, take place today, addressed, respectively, by British Telecom chairman Mr Iain Vallance and Mr Robert Evans, chairman and chief executive of British Gas. The conferences are the first mounted by BIC specifically to get more companies involved in their communities. In areas such as north east England, with few locally headquartered plcs and a burgeoning number of BLTs (three are well established and three more in formation) the need is acute. Both the Newcastle Initiative and Wearside Opportunity currently have chief executives seconded from the DTI, not the private sector. Regional BIC director Mr Johnson says that, with honourable exceptions, the manufacturing sector has proved especially difficult to win over to BIC's philosophy of enlightened self interest through community involvement. 'There's been a tradition of 'head down and make the widgets'', he says. Casting its net, TNI has just hosted a highly successful environmental breakfast, attracting 200 businesspeople. They were all given a free factpack on the environment, including new legislation, then asked to pledge something in return. The response has been very encouraging. TNI's priority has been to enhance Newcastle's regional capital role through urban regeneration, ranging from Cruddas Park to the city's architecturally superb Grey Street and its Chinatown restaurant area. The Wearside Opportunity's primary objective is to promote Wearside as The Advanced Manufacturing Centre of the north: it has coined the Make It Wearside slogan emblazoned on commercial vehicles all over the area and used in national advertising. Teesside Tomorrow has mainly concentrated on smaller projects across a wide range of sectors, including areas not covered by other organisations. One of Teesside Tomorrow's board members is Mr Alistair Arkley, chief executive of locally based Century Inns, a fast-expanding chain of nearly 300 pubs. He voices what is probably a typical mixture of motives for becoming involved. Partly, he says, it was a philanthropic desire to improve the environment and culture of the area where he is based; also a personal wish to get to know other business leaders and discuss mutual problems. He was also aware of the potential direct benefits to his business. 'We're reliant on the people of the community to drink in our pubs to ensure a prosperous future for the business in the markets where we're strong,' he says. 'If there's better employment, a better environment, that will help my business.' In Birmingham, where many smaller companies identify more readily with their immediate area than the city as a whole, BIC has opted for setting up smaller BLT-type bodies. One example is the Newtown business group, comprising 12 companies, led by industrial tool sales, hire and repair company WH Price Ltd, which employs 150 people. The companies are in an inner city location suffering the familiar problems of litter, graffiti, unemployment, lack of parking space and poor redevelopment which has created bleak open spaces. Mr Tim Lunt, chairman of WH Price, says the business group has brought his company into contact for the first time with nearby businesses with similar problems. 'It's really been a chance for us to get together. And we've had a chance to talk to the residents of the area. They have very different problems to us, who commute into this area.' The Newtown group, like a number of BLTs, has been involved in its local authority's submission of a City Challenge bid for Department of the Environment funds to improve the area. Some of those who become involved in BLTs do so after participating in programmes run by Common Purpose, set up in 1989 by Julia Middleton, formerly of the Industrial Society. Common Purpose aims to expose the next generation of decision-makers, in the private, voluntary and public sector, to the different aspects of their city, to create better understanding and more effective networks. It pitches its recruitment - each year a group of around 30 gets together for 11 programme days - a couple of pegs down from BLT board member level. 'We're dealing with the people who in five years time are going to be at the top,' says Jenny Talbot, its Midlands director. Launched in 1989 in Newcastle and Coventry, Common Purpose now operates in 16 locations in England and Scotland. Like the BLTs it is locally self financing, relying on sponsorship in cash and kind. It too is committed to involving more companies. 'We have to make very considerable efforts to get new companies involved,' says north east England director Deborah Jenkins. She has contacted more than 1,000 businesses in three years. Miss Talbot says 'getting your foot in the door' is the most difficult part: she fears the sheer number of organisations wanting to get companies involved in community-related activities may have a deterrent effect. Miss Jenkins sees Common Purpose's main contribution as raising understanding and thinking about the problems facing cities. That includes breaking down preconceptions in all sectors. 'In one sense, the great disease is having too many people who want to get something done,' she says. 'Thrusting young executives can be a pain, especially when they think they know what makes people poor. It's very difficult for somebody successful to really understand somebody who doesn't appear successful.' There is, she says, a type of business thinking which believes there is no such thing as a problem, only a challenge. 'It's an idea that if you look at a set of circumstances in a different way, it's not a problem, it's something terribly exciting to sort out.' For those living in fear of crime, making do on state benefits, coping on their own with children and resigned to unemployment, being seen as an exciting challenge may be just one more indignity. The success of the Cruddas Park initiative is due in large measure to the recognition that solutions cannot be imposed on such areas. Local people must be actively involved, if possible as leaders. This takes time and slow, painstaking work, requiring long-term commitment and patience, qualities often in short supply among companies primarily concerned about survival and this year's balance sheet. After three years' effort, the Cruddas Park initiative has so far helped 192 local people into employment and assisted residents in setting up four businesses. Local unemployment is now estimated at around 45 per cent. While BIC wants to get more companies involved, Mr Ward of Barclays, who has shown strong personal commitment to TNI and to the Cruddas Park Community Trust, both of which he chairs, is worried about how the community can also be encouraged to participate. 'My worry is that my perception and the business world's perception of what we are doing isn't necessarily seen by the community,' he says. 'It needs to come from both ends to work as effectively as it can.' Suspicion, apathy and resignation create barriers. 'There's very warm acknowledgment from the doers in the community; but it's the vast majority of people on council estates who don't get involved,' says Mr Ward. But he remains resolutely committed. 'I'm a great optimist. If I wasn't I wouldn't do the job.'</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Clarke targets welfare costs MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday gave a blunt warning of future government spending cuts to resolve the most serious deterioration in public finances since the sterling crisis of 1976. Mr Clarke, who spoke after the meeting of European Community finance ministers in Brussels, pledged tough action to reduce the Pounds 50bn budget deficit. He repeated his warning that he might have to increase taxes in the November budget as a way of raising revenue. He also hinted that Britain's rising social security bill would come under close scrutiny in the government's attempts to prune the deficit. The chancellor's warning came as a Treasury document submitted to the EC finance ministers pointed to the rising burden on the public finances of social security spending. Mr Clarke spoke of a 'remorseless' rise in UK public spending due to an ageing population, growing numbers of people in higher education and increasing claims in items such as invalidity benefits. He said: 'Discretionary expenditure does not come free. The reason why public spending is rising remorselessly is partly the ageing population and partly the increasing take-up of benefits.' The latter factor was a desirable thing but had to be re-examined in the light of the public borrowing, he said. His remarks were in response to questions raised by his EC partners about Britain's aim to reduce the budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1997, in line with the Maastricht treaty's goal of economic and monetary union. The Treasury document submitted to the finance ministers' meeting is based on the March Budget and shows 'cyclical' social security spending rising dramatically from a total of Pounds 10.9bn in 1991-2 to Pounds 18.5bn in 1997-1998. These figures include unemployment benefit and income support for people of working age, particularly single parents whose numbers are increasing, according to Treasury officials.

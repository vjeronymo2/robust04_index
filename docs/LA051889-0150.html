			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TWISTER, RAIN HIT TEXAS; N. J. RIVERS FLOOD  </P> <P> A tornado ravaged a small town near Austin, and rescuers plucked residents from  homes, cars and trees in the flood-stricken Dallas area as Texas bore the brunt  of severe storms that soaked the Southwest and Northeast on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Rivers and creeks overflowed in New Jersey after two days of record rain,  chasing dozens of people from their homes, authorities said.  </P> <P> At least three deaths in Texas were attributed to the weather.  </P> <P> The pre-dawn tornado cut a swath 7 miles long and a mile wide through Jarrell,  killing one person and injuring at least 24. Fifteen homes and an apartment  complex were destroyed in the town of 1,000 people 40 miles from Austin.  </P> <P> A 42-year-old woman died of a broken neck when the tornado hit her mobile home.  Hospitals in Georgetown and Temple reported that 24 people sought treatment.  </P> <P> Floodwaters in the Dallas area, which received nearly 6 inches of rain in less  than 24 hours, sent hundreds of residents to shelters. Policemen, firefighters  and others rescued scores of people from homes, cars and, in one case, a tree.  </P> <P> Kennedale Police Chief David Geeslin said two women were stranded in a tree for  eight hours after their car was washed off the roadway.  </P> <P> Another rescue attempt ended in tragedy as firefighters, secured with ropes  strung to telephone poles, spent 2 1/2 hours trying to reach a woman whose car  was swept off a bridge into a Dallas creek.  </P> <P> The woman, who had been waiting on top of the car, "got back into the car and,  at that time, the car fell into the creek. It floated for a few minutes and  went down," firefighter Dennis Ground said. Her body was found a half mile  away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rescued From Truck  </P> <P> In suburban Grand Prairie, the body of an elderly man was recovered from a  truck in a creek, police Lt. James Gatlin said.  </P> <P> A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man who had gone to check  his cattle and became trapped by rising waters, Geeslin said.  </P> <P> At least 150 people were evacuated from the Five Mile Creek area, 50 from Grand  Prairie and 125 to 150 from Kennedale, police said.  </P> <P> Floodwaters 4 feet deep poured through Alvarado, just south of Ft. Worth,  forcing evacuations, the National Weather Service reported. A tornado tossed a  car off the road and overturned six 18-wheel trucks on Interstate 35 near  Jarrell, and several small planes were flipped over and hangars were damaged at  the airport in Cleburne.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Texas, a tornado battered an elementary school in Round Rock,  injuring one person. Police said about seven houses were damaged.  </P> <P> Flood warnings were issued in northern New Jersey, where dozens of people were  forced from their homes because of rising water on the Passaic River.  </P> <P> Newark got .71 inches of rain Wednesday and 2.11 inches on Tuesday, breaking  records that had stood for up to 49 years.  </P> <P> Baltimore-Washington International Airport endured its 13th straight day of  rain, the longest such stretch in 40 years of record-keeping there. The old  record for May was nine days, set in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Life after Maastricht THIS HAS been a historic week for the European Community. For almost five years - to be precise, ever since the Hanover summit of EC heads of government in June 1988 - debate about economic and monetary union has been all-consuming. This week, which saw both the Danish vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty and the successful third reading of the ratification bill in the House of Commons, should mark the end of that long and painful debate. The treaty should be ratified. But this will not end the controversy. It will not even be the beginning of the end. It will just be the end of the beginning. Deciding the form of the treaty was the first stage. Ratifying it was a second, still more contentious, one. But implementing it in current economic circumstances will be most difficult of all. What is the EC to do with a solemn treaty that has been ratified, but in some respects cannot be implemented? While the policy-makers grapple with these dilemmas, markets have decided that, Emu or no, exchange rate stability is back, at least for a select group of hard currency countries. For this group, the decline in interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the D-Mark has been nothing short of remarkable. Since the beginning of this year, interest rate differentials on three-month money have fallen from more than 14 percentage points to 0.85 percentage points for the Danish krone, from 24 percentage points to 0.1 percentage points for the Irish punt and from 5.1 percentage points to 0.1 percentage points for the French franc. On the Dutch guilder, the comparable interest rate has been consistently below that on the D-Mark, most recently by half a percentage point. But the Belgian franc has joined the guilder, with a decline in the differential from a percentage point in February, to minus 0.3 points. Long-term bonds More important as an indicator of long-term expectations are differentials in yields on long-term bonds vis a vis the D-Mark. For the Irish punt, these have tumbled from 3.1 points in January to 0.9 points; for the Danish krone, from 2.4 percentage points last September to 0.6; for the Belgian franc, from 1.2 points last September to 0.6; for the French franc, from 1.4 percentage points last October to 0.3; and for the Dutch guilder, from 0.5 points last September to -0.2 points. Markets have already decided that these currencies are in the inner core of the exchange rate mechanism. By contrast, the Italian lira, with a bond yield differential of 5 1/2 percentage points, and the Spanish peseta, with one of 4 points, are judged to offer an altogether different class of risk. But sterling, with a bond yield differential of 1 percentage point, is another matter again. The increased chance of reaching monetary union is far from being the sole reason for the markets' greater confidence in long-term currency stability. The recently narrowing - and by now decidedly small - interest rate differentials for the Danish krone, with its opt out, show that. Germany's position Investors have probably concluded that Germany is simply in the same leaky economic boat as other core members of the ERM. Unification has swept away its fiscal stability and the historic strength of the German current account; inflation is now well entrenched; and the all-German unemployment rate is the highest in the EC. Nor are there merely these structural similarities. The cyclical position is also now fully comparable. It is at least a reasonable assumption that the Bundesbank will be driven, willy nilly, towards a monetary policy suitable for all the core countries. There is also little reason to expect the D-Mark to remain a particularly strong currency, even by European standards. Globally, things look worse still. The D-Mark hit an all-time low against the Japanese yen this week. Interest rate differentials suggest it is set to lose still more of its value against both the yen and the dollar. So is Emu, albeit a distant prospect, also increasingly an irrelevant one? Will it be possible for currencies in the ERM core to sustain stability on the basis of fundamental convergence, rather than hopes for a rapid march to Emu? It is quite conceivable that this will happen, but investors may be too optimistic in assuming that this is almost certain. The question is whether the electorates of these countries will all be equally tolerant of policies that generate slow growth and high unemployment. In practice, enduring confidence in exchange rate stability depends on the emergence of policies that generate recovery now and lower unemployment in the longer term. Ratification of Maastricht was necessary. But the next five years must not be as dominated by the provisions of that treaty as the last five have been dominated by debates about it. The European Commission has at last recognised that the EC has severe cyclical and structural economic problems. Monetary and economic policies are needed to deal with these. The search should start now.</p>

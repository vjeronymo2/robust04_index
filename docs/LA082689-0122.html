			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAILING;  </P> <P> BABY-PATIO FURNITURE COMBINATION TURNS TRICK FOR CHARLIE'S WAREHOUSE  </P> <P> Some combinations are a natural.  </P> <P> Take ham and eggs. Salt and Pepper. Fred and Ethel. And . . . patio and baby  furniture?  </P> <P> As unlikely as the furniture combination may sound, it apparently is a dynamic  duo for Charlie's Warehouse in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Since the store opened in 1985, owners Lenny and Judy Small have found that a  fairly diverse group of shoppers -- pregnant women, young couples and  grandparents -- are interested in both kinds of merchandise.  </P> <P> The result? About half of the customers at Charlie's Warehouse end up buying  both patio and baby furniture, said Lenny Small.  </P> <P> For Charlie's Warehouse, that translates into a 36% leap in sales last year to  $2.25 million. For 1989, Small said he expects a further 15% jump in revenue.  </P> <P> Small first started his own business by selling toys and bicycles. Four years  ago, he began experimenting with a combination of patio furniture and gardening  supplies. When that didn't pan out, he switched to picnic supplies and patio  furniture. But again, sales volume wasn't high enough.  </P> <P> By then, however, Small had seen lots of expectant mothers who were interested  in baby furniture -- at that point the smallest segment of his business. So he  combined that with the patio merchandise and that winning combo has racked up  sales increases every year, Small says.  </P> <P> "We have lots of business and professional women who are now taking time off to  have babies. Grandparents are extremely good customers, too," he said.  </P> <P> Prices aren't bargain basement, but according to Small, Charlie's Warehouse  customers pay less than they would at a department or chain store.  </P> <P> That means that the 20,000-square-foot store has cribs ranging in price from  $110 to more than $700, the latter for a model that converts to a youth bed.  Bedding -- including a comforter, bumper and sheet -- can be bought for about  $280.  </P> <P> In addition to a wide selection -- the store carries 60 to 75 types of bedding  -- Charlie's Warehouse also stocks just about every type of baby accessory  imaginable. So persnickety parents can pick up, say, wall switches to match the  rest of the nursery's decor.  </P> <P> To keep shoppers coming back, Charlie's Warehouse is broadening its line to  include such furniture as bunk beds and desks, aimed at older children and  teens.  </P></p>

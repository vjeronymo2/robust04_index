			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH PRICES SPARK VIOLENCE IN ALGERIA  </P> <P> More than 50 people have been arrested after violence sparked by high prices  erupted at a rural market, the Algerian news agency APS reported Saturday.  </P> <P> APS said shoppers went on a rampage, wrecking stalls, trampling produce,  smashing utensils and damaging cars at the small farming town of Aflou, 200  miles southwest of Algiers.  </P> <P> It was the first report of violence since food prices in Algeria doubled or  even tripled in the last two weeks. Shoppers have boycotted meat and vegetable  sellers in Algiers and other towns like Oran and Tizi Ouzou. Consumer groups  have threatened to stage a nationwide boycott.  </P> <P> The agency said drought has decimated livestock and forced prices up. It blamed  higher prices combined with what it called tragic unemployment for the Aflou  outburst.  </P></p>

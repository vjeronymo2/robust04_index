			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raima Rondon from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage Davila said after  meeting with President Rafael Caldera that so far no petroleum  cooperation agreement has been reached among Russia, Cuba, and  Venezuela, although the possibility has not been ruled out.    The Cuban official said talks are currently under way among  the three states for a possible petroleum cooperation agreement  and that each is prepared to establish a commercial operation  that is favorable to the three countries. The Cuban vice  president stressed, however, that the issue was not discussed  with President Caldera because the tour of South American  countries is focused on strengthening relations with Cuba.    [Begin Lage recording] We did not discuss the issue with  President Caldera. As President Caldera said at the beginning,  we discussed general issues. We thanked him for his position  against the U.S. blockade on Cuba. We also expressed our  satisfaction with his election and stressed our desire for a  better future for Venezuelans. [end recording]    In the short 24-hour visit to Venezuela, the Cuban vice  president noted his interest in strengthening ties between  Venezuela and Colombia [sentence as heard]. To that end, he  held meetings with the ministers of tourism, foreign affairs,  and communications and transportation and with the president of  the Venezuelan Investment Fund.</p>

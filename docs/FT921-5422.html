			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German turnover more than doubles as foreigners buy MOOTED on Monday, foreign buying came in to lift German shares, while corporate news moved equities in Paris and Zurich, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reported foreign buying as German stock market turnover, cut back by carnival on Monday, more than doubled from DM3.5bn to DM7.6bn. The big four international blue chips, Siemens, Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Volkswagen, accounted for more than DM4bn of the turnover total as the FAZ index rose 6.15 to 715.44 at midsession, and the DAX closed 15.44 better to 1,763.31, its highest close since August, 1990. Hopes that the US economy is recovering lifted Daimler and Siemens in particular, with gains of DM11.60 to DM768.50, and DM11 to DM699.50 respectively. Elsewhere there was relative weakness in engineers and some steels, and in most retailers although Kaufhof went against the trend with a DM10 rise to DM527.50. Last week Kaufhof indicated a 33 per cent rise in profits for 1991, and another good year in 1992. PARIS was dominated by Alcatel Alsthom on the news that it was buying in ITT's 30 per cent stake in its Alcatel NV telecommunications subsidiary. The CAC-40 rose 4.10 to 1,983.77, off a day's high of 1,990.29. Volume improved to FFr2.3bn, of which Alcatel accounted for 15 per cent. Alcatel closed FFr12 higher at FFr620 with 563,930 shares traded. Analysts said that Alcatel had struck a good deal by offering cash and shares to ITT and that the operation was not seen as dilutive: indeed, it was likely to enhance earnings per share by about 5 per cent this year. The downside of the deal is that Alcatel's gearing is likely to rise to between 35 per cent and 40 per cent from around 20 per cent. MILAN closed broadly lower as volume dwindled ahead of the general election next month. The banking sector was depressed by reports that Moody's, the US credit rating agency, was concerned that the rapid growth of bank loans in Italy would lead to a deterioration in debt quality. The Comit index fell 2.98 to 529.42 in turnover estimated at not more than Monday's L75bn. Among banks, BCI fell 2.1 per cent or L84 to L3,841 while Credito Italiano eased L61 or 2.9 per cent to L2,040. The insurance sector remained weak in the wake of President Francesco Cossiga's scuppering of an important reform of car insurance premiums at the weekend. A flight to quality supported Generali, which added L20 to L30,710. ZURICH moved on company news, Alusuisse bearers topping the active list and falling SFr26 to SFr908 on a 62 per cent drop in profits and a share split and Sulzer, the engineer, seeing its registered up SFr70 to SFr5,560 on cooperation with a Japanese company, a plan to abolish restrictions on foreign shareholdings immediately, and a share split here, too. The all-share SPI index rose 3.8 to 1,151.9. Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) bearers rose SFr2 to SFr312 ahead of today's annual news conference; meanwhile, trading in in Banca Della Svizzera Italiana, in which SBC holds a majority, was suspended pending an announcement, also today. BRUSSELS maintained its strong run with the Bel-20 index closing up 5.51 at 1,234.72, its second successive record high. Turnover was BFr1.2bn against BFr1.49bn. Delhaize was active and hit a record high of BFr9,330, before closing up BFr90 at BFr9,270. Groupe AG, the insurer, rose BFr30 to BFr2,230, but Generale Bank, its possible partner in a merger, slipped back BFr10 to BFr6,750. AMSTERDAM finished mixed, the CBS Tendency Index closing up 0.8 at 127.0 in turnover of Fl 762.4m. DSM, the chemicals group, gained strongly, partly on options trading and closed up Fl 2.50 or 2.3 per cent at Fl 110.0 ahead of 1991 results next Monday. Philips gained Fl 1.10 or 3 per cent to Fl 37.6 on good institutional demand. Buhrmann Tetterode recovered some of Monday's losses and finished up 20 cents at Fl 43.30. Heineken continued to rise and closed up 60 cents at Fl 169.40. Its 1991 results are due tomorrow and net profits are forecast around Fl 389m. MADRID slipped back slightly in dull trading. The general index closed down 0.81 at 265.55 in turnover of Pta14.6bn. The banking sector weakened after early gains. Iberdrola put on Pta2 at Pta783 in trade of 2.5m shares. Telefonica's initial rise of Pta15 was wiped out when Wall Street opened and it closed unchanged at Pta1,175. OSLO rose nearly 2 per cent: the all-share index closed up 8.28 at 427.19 in turnover of NKr332.28m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr4.5 to NKr146, while Saga Petroleum free shares added NKr1 to NKr91. STOCKHOLM rose in good volume, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 10.4 higher at 961.3 in turnover of SKr525m. HELSINKI tumbled again on profit-taking, the Hex index falling 13.4 to 888.5. ISTANBUL's slide continued and the 75-share index fell 47.01 to 3,485.39, a drop of 4.9 per cent on the week so far and its lowest close since November 1990.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1173.51  1173.64  1174.98  1175.87  1176.65  1176.81 1176.49  1176.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1177.17    Day's Low  1173.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 2     Feb 28   Feb 27    Feb 26    Feb 25 1169.17   1169.95  1167.26   1165.89   1156.42  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

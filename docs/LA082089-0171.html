			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: AT WOODSTOCK'S 20-YEAR CURTAIN CALL, A LONELY STAGE  </P> <P>  -- What if they didn't give a concert and everybody came? Not a single rock  star was scheduled to perform, but cars were lining the roads leading to the  former Max Yasgur farm where the Woodstock Festival took place 20 years ago. A  crowd estimated to be at least 20,000 showed up, although some proved  themselves less hardy than their predecessors by leaving when they were rained  on. In contrast, a reunion concert 12 miles from Bethel, N.Y., at a resort  flopped when only 250 people came to see such performers as John Sebastian and  Edgar Winter. An offer to move the concert to the farm was nixed by Bethel.  "There's enough frenzy here already," town Supervisor Allan Scott said. Most of  the Woodstock pilgrims were willing to pay a $5 donation, which is to go toward  cleaning and reseeding the field when the party's over. Current owners Jeff and  Charlie Gelish were paying half the cost of providing water and portable  toilets, and garbage and ambulance services were donated. The crowd was an  eclectic mix including hippies, bikers, Grateful Dead fans, middle-aged  tourists and housewives. Local musicians were doing their best to entertain the  crowd on a makeshift stage, using sound equipment and a generator that were  donated. Finally, one of the original performers, Melanie, showed up for a  45-minute encore. "Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?" she said.  </P> <P>  -- An original painting of Mickey Mantle used to create his 1953 baseball card  fetched $110,000 as the Topps Co. auctioned 35 years' worth of rare cards and  pictures. Topps spokesman Norman Liss said the winning bid was from Marriott  Corp., which also paid $80,000 for artwork of Willie Mays from the same year. A  Jackie Robinson painting brought $71,000 from an unidentified bidder. Paintings  of Whitey Ford, Bob Feller and Roy Campanella went to the Rarities Group of  Marlboro, Mass., a collectibles company, for prices ranging from $15,000 to  $32,000.  </P> <P>  -- The object of the game is to go down the water slide and reach the  air-conditioned doghouse. On the weekend before jury selection begins in PTL  founder Jim Bakker's trial on fraud and conspiracy charges, the Charlotte  Observer in North Carolina published a board game called "Down the Tube." It  asks true-false questions about the lives of Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye.  If you land on Tammy's face, you advance four spaces. But if you land on  evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, you must "return to start and sob your heart out."  DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Apr (NA) -- Elected constituent  member Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Grand Front (FG) said  today that PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan]  President Matilde Menendez was "punished by society and  condemned politically" in yesterday's election.    The Buenos Aires district winner said that Menendez --  second  on the Justicialist Party ticket -- represents "an example of  the saturation felt by a good part of the capital's people."    He added that despite his victory he will not forgive the  government for "everything it did" to "disqualify him." Alvarez  said the campaign "was not traditional and did not include the  debate of ideas or the exchange of proposals" because the ruling  party "carried out a very harsh campaign below the surface."    He said that "part of the political game's cynicism" is due  to the fact that "when the aggression ends everybody pretends to  love each other again."    Alvarez denied that the reports of alleged bribes in PAMI  were "low punches" because "knowing where the money comes from  is as serious as discussing proposals."    "The people said it was enough and wanted to put a limit on  abuse and corruption in government. The FG was the instrument  citizens from different political and ideological groups used to  show this, which proves that no one has a captive electorate in  the capital," Alvarez said on the radio.    The legislator questioned "the government's insults and low  punches against the FG during the campaign," adding that "the  incidents created a tense situation because we knew the  information services were looking for any excuse to attack us."    "When the government saw our growth through the surveys it  started attacking us from all sides. Government officials linked  us with the issue of the super gang. Then they said I was being  financed by the SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence]. They  paid two mercenaries who came from the south to say that I wrote  letters from Congress to former political prisoners, which is  totally absurd," Alvarez added.    According to the FG leader, "there were various government  operations, one after the other, to hit us below the belt. They  gave people the impression that they could not accept the  possibility of losing democratically."    Alvarez said the reports on possible bribes inside PAMI  "were  not low punches, because to speak of kickbacks or bribes is as  serious as to discuss proposals." Alvarez concluded by urging "a  continuation of the investigation because the report was not  presented for electoral reasons."</p>

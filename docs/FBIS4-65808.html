			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Thomas Roser, manager of the German Atomic </F> Forum, by Wolfgang Proissl; place and date not given:  "`Germany's Pullback from Nuclear Energy Would Pose Serious  Problems for France'"]    [Text] Thomas Roser is the manager of the German  Atomic Forum, which represents the interests of the civil  nuclear sector. He believes that abandoning this mode of  generation would harm technology exports.    [Proissl] What would be the consequences for German industry  of a hypothetical decision to abandon nuclear energy?    [Roser] Such an abandonment would, in the long term, involve  holding German industry back from the world market in nuclear  technology and, with it, the entire European industry, for  German political decisions on the subject will have  repercussions throughout Europe.    If Germany withdraws, then Paris will have a hard time  explaining to the French people why France must be the only  major European country still counting on nuclear energy to  generate its electricity. In Spain, there is a de facto  moratorium; in Sweden and in Belgium, no more nuclear power  stations are being built. At the moment, France and Germany are  the only countries where nuclear power stations can still be  built. In short, a German withdrawal would pose major problems  for France.    [Proissl] What kind of consequences would this have for  exports of German nuclear technology and know-how in this sector?    [Roser] Negative ones in both cases. You merely have to call  to mind the South Koreans' choice in favor of the TGV  [high-speed train]. Countries seeking to purchase  high-technology products only do so if they can assure  themselves that they work well in their country of origin. For  exports, we definitely need models of reference which have  proved themselves.    Naturally, a withdrawal would also result in a loss of  know-how. It is already proving difficult to find young people  who believe that they can build a future by making a career for  themselves in the area of nuclear technology. The builders or  managers of power stations are experiencing great difficulties  in hiring young technicians.    [Proissl] Which export contracts are currently liable to  prove of interest to German builders?    [Roser] At present there is only one call for tenders, put  out by Taiwan, which wishes to purchase one power station and  take out an option on a second. Nowadays, a power station  represents a contract worth between 3 and 5 billion German marks  (10 to 17 billion French francs). Three consortia have  submitted proposals: one American-British; one American-Swedish;  and one French-German. The French-German consortium is proposing  a French power station. There is a simple reason for this. The  latest German power station is approximately 10 years old.  Since the Taiwanese want the most recent technology, they are  opting for France, where power stations have been built much  more recently.</p>

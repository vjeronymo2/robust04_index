			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview via telephone with Toshiro Kishi, NHK </F> correspondent in Pyongyang, by NHK announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata  at the NHK studio in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Kawabata] An event will be held in Pyongyang  tomorrow marking the 82nd birthday of North Korean President Kim  Il- song. North Korea has allowed a group of NHK correspondents  and correspondents from an American television station to cover  the event, issuing them visas.    North Korea has permitted the NHK correspondents to cover  the  event for the first time in twenty months. Pyongyang has  refused to permit foreign correspondents to cover activities in  that country in the intervening time. North Korea's decision to  permit foreign correspondents to cover the event amid mounting  international tension following its refusal to allow inspections  of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy  Agency is drawing attention. I will interview NHK correspondent  Yoshiro Kishi who is now in Pyongyang.    Kishi, the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song will be  celebrated tomorrow. What is Pyongyang like?    [Kishi] It is fine in Pyongyang and the temperature is high.  The streets are festooned with national flags and a variety of  flowers to celebrate the North Korean leader's birthday.  Tomorrow is a national holiday. I see many women carrying  large shopping bags believed to contain food for picnics. There  is a festive mood in Pyongyang. I anticipated military tension  over the so-called nuclear issue before I arrived here, but see  no signs of such tensions at all in Pyongyang.    [Kawabata] Kishi, you visited Pyongyang two years ago. Have  you found any changes this time?    [Kishi] Yes. I visited Pyongyang to cover the 80th birthday  of President Kim Il-song. At the time, a pompous event was held  to celebrate his birthday. This time the event is likely to be  relatively low key.    [Kawabata] Kishi, North Korea has allowed NHK and American  correspondents to cover the event. Why has North Korea decided  to permit them to do so?    (Kishi] To be honest, we were hard-pressed to obtain visas  from North Korea. I heard that President Kim Il-song and  Secretary Kim Chong-il made the final decision. Military  tensions have been mounting on the Korean peninsula over the  so-called nuclear issue ever since a solution through dialogue  has been stalemated. The acceptance of NHK and American  correspondents by the North Korea leaders is of great  significance. I have felt North Korea's strong will to resolve  the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue. I will pay  attention to how North Korean authorities will deal with our  coverage activities.    [Kawabata] Thank you very much.</p>

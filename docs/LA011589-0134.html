			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEY VIETNAMESE OFFICIAL ARRIVES IN BEIJING FOR TALKS;  </P> <P> UNANNOUNCED TRIP APPARENTLY IS AIMED AT ENDING DECADE-LONG CAMBODIAN CONFLICT  </P> <P> A high-ranking Vietnamese official, reported to be Vice Foreign Minister Dinh  Nho Liem, arrived here Saturday on an unannounced mission apparently aimed at  ending the Cambodian conflict.  </P> <P> China and Vietnam, key backers of the opposing sides in Cambodia, have refused  to comment on the arrival of the small Vietnamese delegation. But it appears to  be the beginning of the two nations' most serious contact yet in the search for  a settlement of the decade-old conflict.  </P> <P> Reporters hoping to interview the Vietnamese delegation saw a person closely  resembling Liem through the window of a reception room at Beijing airport. But  after being greeted by the Vietnamese ambassador and Chinese officials, the man  left through a back door and was quickly driven away. Vietnamese diplomats  later declined to say anything.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Passenger List  </P> <P> Liem's name was on the passenger manifest of an Air China flight that left  Bangkok on Saturday for Canton and Beijing, and Japanese correspondents  reported seeing Liem at the airport in Bangkok.  </P> <P> Liem helped negotiate a cease-fire that ended a 1979 border war between Vietnam  and China. The two countries were allies during the American involvement in the  Vietnam War, but they later split, largely over the issue of Cambodia.  </P> <P> The Hanoi delegation is expected to discuss Vietnamese troop withdrawals from  Cambodia, the ending of Chinese assistance to resistance forces there and the  shape of a political settlement, according to diplomats here.  </P> <P> It was not clear whether the delegation would also discuss a possible visit to  Beijing by Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach. Diplomats in Hanoi said  last week that they expected a senior Vietnamese official to travel to Beijing  within a few days to arrange a Thach visit.  </P> <P> Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom  Sihanouk, said earlier last week on Cambodian resistance radio that China had  agreed to receive either Vietnam's foreign minister or a deputy in early  February.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Talks on Summit  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is scheduled to visit Beijing  early next month for talks on arranging a Sino-Soviet summit later this year.  Cambodia is also expected to be a topic of Sino-Soviet discussion, because it  has been a key obstacle to improved relations between China and the Soviet  Union. Moscow has backed Vietnam's military invasion and continued presence in  Cambodia but now is pressing Hanoi to pull its troops out.  </P> <P> Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, currently visiting France, indicated  Saturday that Sino-Vietnamese relations could also rapidly improve if the  Cambodian conflict is settled.  </P> <P> Speaking at a press conference in Paris, Qian said that "the major obstacle  blocking relations between China and Vietnam lies in the Vietnamese occupation  of Cambodia," the official New China News Agency reported. Qian "stressed that  only by solving this problem can relations between the two countries be  improved," the agency said.  </P> <P> Vietnam has about 100,000 troops in Cambodia but has pledged to pull them out  by September if a political settlement of the conflict can be agreed on.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government is battling against various  resistance factions.  </P> <P> Sihanouk heads one of the factions. But the Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia  with a tyrannical and murderous regime from 1975 until Vietnamese troops drove  it from power 10 years ago, is the most powerful resistance faction. China has  supported both the Khmer Rouge and Sihanouk, who have been nominal allies but  are deeply suspicious of each other.  </P> <P> As the search for a settlement proceeds, a key question is whether terms of a  peace agreement will include a mechanism to keep the Khmer Rouge from regaining  power.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, China has indicated that it would be willing to reduce arms  supplies to the Khmer Rouge as a Vietnamese withdrawal takes place, but it  insists that the Khmer Rouge be included as one of the parties in any coalition  government to emerge from a peace agreement.  </P></p>

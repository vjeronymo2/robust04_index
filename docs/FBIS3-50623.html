			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Executive Branch has vetoed seven laws  generated in Congress but, on the other hand, it has not  submitted a single draft bill on its economic and social plans  to Congress. The declared war between the two state branches is  placing the implementation of basic laws for the state's legal  regulation at stake.    The Executive Branch's declared war against Congress, which  is reflected in the veto of laws of vital importance for the  state's legal regulation, threatens to affect the country's  political and economic panorama even more.    The Executive Branch, rather than proposing, has vetoed  seven  laws, of which two refer to social issues (expropriation of  land), one is socio-economic nature (the rescheduling of small  farmers' debts to the CAH [Agricultural Development Fund]), one  related to the prison system, the radio broadcasting law, and,  last, three of a political nature, that is, the Military  Organization Law, the law banning soldiers and police from  political party affiliation, as well as the Council for  Magistrates (that the Executive Branch still has not vetoed but  has threatened to do so.) [figures as published]    Due to its conflict with Congress, the Executive Branch  seems  to have exhausted its power to generate draft bills. In the  economic field, for example, it has not submitted a single draft  bill for the rationalization of its public expenditures.</p>

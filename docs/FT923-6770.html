			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Extra charge hits Canadian bank NATIONAL BANK of Canada, the country's sixth largest bank, reported a loss of CDollars 118m (USDollars 100m) or CDollars 1 a share for the third quarter, after more than CDollars 200m of additional loan loss provisions. The bank has a total exposure of CDollars 473m to Olympia &amp; York Developments and related companies, and also a relatively large exposure to non-performing property loans in Canada and the north-eastern US. The extra provisions mean that NBC has written down about two-thirds of its loans to Canary Wharf and to the Reichmann brothers, analysts said. 'NBC is a regional bank and their O&amp;Y exposure was excessive,' said Mr Stephen Martin, bank analyst with Canadian Bond Rating Service in Montreal. 'They have now recognised these risks and tightened up their credit standards.' In the third quarter of fiscal 1991, NBC earned CDollars 39m, or 25 cents a share. It said it expected to return to profitability in the fourth quarter this year, and in fiscal 1993, when the extra provisions would be in the past. Total third-quarter provisions were CDollars 358m against CDollars 90m a year earlier. Total assets at July 31 was CDollars 41.5bn, up CDollars 1.7bn. The bank is reducing its quarterly common share dividend from 20 cents to 10 cents. NBC's nine-months' loss was CDollars 37.9m, or 52 cents a share, compared with profit of CDollars 144.7m, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier, including the extra provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 1992.</p>

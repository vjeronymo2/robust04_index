			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AOUN BLOCKS LEBANON PARLIAMENT FROM MEETING ON REFORM PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Christian strongman Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun blocked the Lebanese Parliament from  meeting today in a villa on Beirut's Green Line battlefront, but an Arab League  mediator said plans are being made to hold the crucial peacemaking session  elsewhere.  </P> <P> Deputies needed for a quorum were still abroad, and the meeting was unlikely to  be convened until Monday or Tuesday.  </P> <P> The session -- the next stage in an Arab League effort to end 14 years of civil  war -- would ratify political reforms reducing the entrenched powers of  Lebanon's Christian minority. It would also elect a president after more than a  year without a clear-cut leader.  </P> <P> Aoun, who is vehemently opposed to the plan, reiterated Friday that he would  dissolve Parliament if it attempts to meet to consider the plan.  </P> <P> Christian and Muslim deputies agreed on the Arab-sponsored peace plan last  month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, and Arab mediators asked them to endorse it in  Beirut no later than Tuesday.  </P> <P> There has been speculation for days that because of the likelihood of mass  demonstrations by Aoun's Christian supporters, the session would be moved to a  safer location in the two-thirds of the country under the control of the Syrian  army.  </P></p>

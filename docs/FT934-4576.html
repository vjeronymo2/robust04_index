			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: 'Gatt failure would reopen old disputes' Failure to reach a Gatt agreement 'would dash economic confidence and reopen disputes supposedly settled as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations', a senior US official told a trade conference in Paris yesterday. Mrs Joan Spero, US under-secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, warned that in particular the arrangement which the US and the European Union reached in June on oilseeds might come unstuck if the Gatt round failed. She also said Europe's common agricultural policy 'could be challenged in the Gatt or by private parties under domestic trade laws'. On culture, the other main sticking point between the US and France, Mrs Spero said protectionism by Europe could backfire against 'European producers, directors, writers, actors, cinematographers who are a major force in American films'. Such European artists might lose these opportunities in the US, she said. Nevertheless, the US official said, 'the noises coming from the Brussels negotiations are good.' She said the US believed its Blair House agreement with the EU 'is the basis upon which the Uruguay Round can be concluded', apparently indicating that Washington is not adhering to every last detail of an accord which France has hotly contested. Mr Francois Perigot, president of the French employers' federation, told the conference that 'nothing would be worse than the failure of seven years of negotiation' in the Uruguay Round.</p>

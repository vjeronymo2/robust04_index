			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, March 7 (TANJUG) -- Intensive Croat-Serb  fighting has taken place in the broader area of Teslingrad in  the northwest of the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) during  the past 24 hours, after Croatian troops violated the latest  ceasefire agreement.    The R.S.K. army command said in a statement on Monday that  the fighting took place in the area of Cukovac, which was  captured by Croatian troops on Saturday. However, following  strong pressure by the Serb forces and after suffering  considerable casualties, Croatian troops were forced to withdraw  to their initial positions.    The same source said that the crushing of the last  strongholds of the Croatian army in the area was underway.    The Serb forces have suffered no casualties in the fighting  although considerable material damage has been inflicted on  civilian targets.    The statement said that Croatian forces had on several  occasions provoked the Serb forces by opening infantry fire in  the broader area of Drnis and Benkovac, in the south of the  R.S.K.    Croatian forces have repeatedly violated the ceasefire  agreement, which was signed before Christmas and extended twice  since then. The latest ceasefire violation indicates that Zagreb  has not given up attempts to resolve disputed issues with the  R.S.K. by force.    The R.S.K. was set up in 1991 on Serb ethnic and historical  territories in the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in  response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former  Yugoslav Federation and its violations of Serbs' human and  national rights.</p>

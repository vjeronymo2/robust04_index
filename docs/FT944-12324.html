			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Ford cuts output by 9,500 vehicles Production at Ford's Escort car and van plant at Halewood on Merseyside is being halted for 12 days this month, taking more than 9,500 vehicles out of production. Halewood's 5,000 shop-floor employees are working neither day nor night shifts this week and next. There will be no production on the following two Fridays. The cuts mean that by the end of this month Ford will have taken 20,000 Escorts out of production since short-time working began last month. Employees will be paid their basic wage on the 'down days' but will miss out on bonus and overtime payments. Ford blames a weaker then expected UK market for the cuts, though none of its main rivals is taking similar action. Halewood-built Escort cars are sold only in the UK. Ford's Dagenham plant in east London, which makes Fiesta cars and vans, will work normally this month after losing two days' production - representing 2,000 vehicles - in October. Dagenham has not been so badly hit because it exports about a third of its output to continental Europe, where demand is rising again after the severe vehicle market recession. The Escort was the UK's top-selling car in August, followed by the Fiesta. Ford's UK market share is about 22 per cent. Stock levels will be reviewed again at the end of this month. It is expected that at least some further short-term working at Halewood will be extended into December.</p>

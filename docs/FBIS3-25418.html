Although it would not extend the list  of powers it has until now insisted could be exercised  exclusively but within national framework legislation, the ANC  would now accept certain powers could be exercised exclusively  by the provinces.    Until now, in terms of the interim constitution, the  national  parliament will be able to exercise powers concurrently with the  provinces -- a position rejected by the Freedom Alliance in  negotiations since late 1993.    In its first shift, the ANC agreed to exclusive powers  during  negotiations with the government and the alliance earlier this  year. However, it insisted such powers had to be exercised  within national framework legislation.    The Freedom Alliance argued this defeated the purpose of  exclusive powers. It further argued that even the limited  powers the provinces were granted in the interim constitution  could be removed once an ANC-dominated constituent assembly sat  to draft a new constitution after the April elections.    An ANC concession to the principle of exclusive powers --  even if these are limited to parochial matters now -- and a  constitutional principle ensuring these powers will not be  removed, is the furthest the ANC has gone in conceding a  federal-type dispensation. "The formulation is to effectively  have a different approach to exclusive powers to that in the  interim constitution. The actual powers -- the functional areas  -- will substantially remain the same," Mr Ramaphosa said.    A further ANC concession that provinces will be able to  define their own legislative and executive structures is another  concession to the provinces. This is further strengthened by an  agreement that provinces will have their own revenue bases in  the form of taxes on betting and casinos.    Whether the concessions are enough to lure the alliance as a  whole into the electoral process remains to be seen. Inkatha  Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has already rejected  ANC President Nelson Mandela's proposals.    But the ANC, Mr Ramaphosa said, was engaged in negotiations  with elements of the alliance -- namely the Zulu king, the  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] of Gen Constand  Viljoen and the Bophuthatswana government. The negotiations  with the AVF had reached an advanced stage when Gen Viljoen was  booed off the stage by Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance  Movement -- AWB] supporters at an AVF meeting at the end of  January.    According to the agreements, the ANC agreed votes for the  AVF  in the elections could be counted as votes for an Afrikaner  volkstaat [homeland]. Those members of parliament could then  constitute a volksraad [national council] to push for a  volkstaat within the constituent assembly.    The next two weeks will be a crucial period for the  transitional process.    Parallel to the bilateral talks being conducted between the  ANC and elements of the Freedom Alliance, the multiparty  negotiating council will convene on Monday to draw up the  proposed amendments to the constitution and to the electoral act  to allow for a few more days for the parties to register.    This, Mr Ramaphosa said, would constitute a final deadline  for parties to take part in the April elections. Parties could  of course choose to stay out of the process.    The sub-script of the ANC's concessions has been a warning  to  those who want to disrupt the election not to dare.    Mr Ramaphosa warned there was no prospect of the ANC  agreeing  to an extension of the election date. And the government agreed  to this.    He said Mr Buthelezi had assured the independent electoral  commission that polling could take place within kwaZulu. "There  is a threat to the process," he said. But he was confident the  security forces would not stand by and tolerate a disruption.    Strict application of the laws should ensure the election  went ahead, however.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Message for Arab bourses Markets in the eastern Mediterranean sent a cautionary message to their Arab neighbours yesterday with Turkish equities down 4 per cent, Israeli blue chips by another 1.3 per cent for a two-day, 3.2 per cent fall, and Greek stocks by 1.4 per cent although Athens was moved by domestic concerns. Istanbul's composite index, down 1,090.25 at 26,136.56, plunged on worries over the survival prospects of the coalition government led by the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, as well as on an escalation of tensions in the Gulf. Brokers quoted recent reports that the coalition partners - Mrs Ciller's conservative True Path Party (DYP) and the Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) - had fallen out over draft laws to accelerate privatisation and improve democratic rights. Mrs Ciller, hoping that sell-offs would rescue the ailing Turkish economy, had made the privatisation law her top priority. As a Nato member, Turkey supported the US-led western forces against its neighbour, Iraq, during the Gulf war in 1991. Istanbul share prices fell sharply in the days following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. In Tel Aviv, market sources said that banks had called in credit extended to the public for investment in securities. The Mishtanim index fell another 2.34 to 180.24 and turnover rose from a slim Shk137m to moderate, at Shk168m. The market closed off its session lows as investment funds led a small late rally and traders said that demand for call options at that time indicated that speculators expect a technical rally today. Athens was more worried that a sharp rise in September inflation, to 11.9 per cent, would inhibit a fall in interest rates. The general share index ended 11.96 down from Friday's close at 862.07 03 after opening slightly up at 875.04. Turnover was Dr3.1bn. Brokers said that there was intense pressure on the market.</p>

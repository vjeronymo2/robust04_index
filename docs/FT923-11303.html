			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: The yield conundrum The UK equity market has had a lot to cope with this week: the upward creep in European interest rates, the further collapse of the Tokyo market and the unnerving hints of renewed hostilities between the US and Iraq. Perhaps the most significant development, however, was purely domestic. The ratio between gilt and equity yields - the traditional measure of equity value - fell to its lowest level since the great bear market of 1974. The comparison has its ironic aspects. In 1974, equity yields soared because corporate earnings were being mauled by inflation. They are now being mauled by the lack of it. In the recent past, a yield ratio as low as two - meaning that equity yields were half the level of long gilt yields - was a fair signal that equities were cheap. The ratio is now 1.73. But it is not clear that the old relationship holds good any more. The reason is straightforward. The rationale of ERM membership is that inflation should fall to German levels. Part of the process of achieving this involves punishing companies which allow their costs to rise. Gilts are thus worth more than before, because they need no longer offer an inflationary risk premium. Equities, at least in the punitive transitional phase, are worth less because of the damage to their earnings. The classic danger here is of mistaking a mere cyclical phenomenon for a fundamental shift. In 1974, there was much talk about the cult of the equity being dead. In the first six months of 1975, the All-Share duly rose 130 per cent. But the determining factor this time may lie at a deeper level. The other commonplace assertion at the bottom of a recession is that inflation has finally been licked. If that really is true this time, the valuation shift may be fundamental. The issue can be simply posed. If the UK sticks to its ERM parity, equities may or may not be expensive. If the UK were to leave the ERM, they would be a raging buy.</p>

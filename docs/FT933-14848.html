			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Fears over inflation in sharp retreat THE US credit markets are optimistic they are to receive good news on inflation this week, and that this will underpin the current record low yields at the long end of the bond market. A raft of statistics to be released this week will give the markets much more to chew on than last week, when a lack of fresh economic data and holiday-shortened working week meant trading lacked a firm direction. On Tuesday the market brushed off the biggest one-day gain in 13 years in the widely watched Commodity Research Bureau Index of commodity prices, which is often regarded as a harbinger of inflation. For the rise was due mainly to flooding in the Mississippi River valley, sending grain and other agricultural commodity prices rising sharply, which economists agreed would have little inflationary consequences. In thin trading ahead of this week's inflation reports, the price on the benchmark 30-year long bond managed to make a little progress, with the yield ending on Friday night at around 6.64 per cent, down from 6.66 per cent a week earlier. Wall Street is expecting the overall producer price index for June, which will be released on Tuesday, to be flat to slightly down, while the consumer price index, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be flat overall, with a 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent rise in its core rate. That would mean producer price inflation running roughly at a 2.8 per cent annual rate since the start of the year, with consumer price inflation at around 3 per cent - far below the worrying levels recorded in the first four months of 1993. Nor are there any significant inflationary clouds on the horizon. Retail sales figures for June, due out on Wednesday, are expected to show a modest 0.3 per cent rise, with consumers still nervous about an economic recovery which seems fragile and growing in fits and starts. A summary of the May meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee, released last Friday, confirmed reports that it voted on that occasion to lean towards raising interest rates if inflation did not slow down. The committee met again last week and, while the outcome of its discussions will not be known for some six weeks, the recent inflation figures should have made it more sanguine, though probably not sufficiently so to eliminate its bias towards tightening. With inflation fears in sharp retreat, international developments may help underpin the bond market's rally. Ms Susan Hering, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, points out that a modest revival in the dollar should increase the attraction of assets denominated in the US currency, while last week's unexpectedly successful trade talks at the Tokyo G7 summit 'should dampen fears that increased protectionism will trigger higher inflation'. In spite of the bond market's generally buoyant tone, it still has to overcome an important political hurdle - efforts by the House of Representatives and the Senate to reach a compromise on their different versions of President Clinton's deficit reduction package. Expectations that some compromise package will pass into law have underlain the market's rally since the start of June. Many on Wall Street expect the measures will act as a substantial brake on the economy, and thus on inflation. A particularly gloomy forecast came last week from Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities, who argues that there are early signs of the US relapsing into recession later this year or in the first half of 1994, and that the Clinton package will accentuate the trend.</p>

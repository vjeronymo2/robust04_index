			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Why maestros don't throw wobblies - Antony Thorncroft explains the different rules governing classical and pop recordings We all know that pop stars spend as much time in court as in the studios and that there are few artists who have not at some time fallen out with their record companies over royalties and advances. But could the same thing happen in the classical field; could Pavarotti throw a George Michael-style wobbly and take Decca, his recording company, to court? In general, the classical departments of the record companies are considerably more rarified environments than their pop counterparts: there is still an over-riding commitment to art for art's sake. Profits are perceived as less important than the wonderful creations that they are laying down for posterity. In practice, this has meant that the classical departments of the large record companies are loss-making and they have been subsidised by the more lucrative pop sections. The rules that govern classical music recordings are, in most cases, the complete opposite of the cut-and-thrust workings of the pop business. It is the classical artists, especially the handful of established divas and maestros, who have the record labels over the financial barrel. When the maestro coughs, the record executives jump. In pop, major stars tend to earn most of their fortunes from their records and use live performances to promote the sales of albums whereas a prestigious record contract is a useful promotion for the source of the real money in classical music - the concert halls and the stages of the opera houses. A handful of big name stars - Pavarotti, Domingo, Kiri te Kanawa, etc - have quickly learned to exploit their commercial appeal and moved out of the opera house clique into the entertainment media, with vast open air concerts, emphasising the superior earning potential of the live performance for the classical star. In pop, talent scouts scour the country in search of new acts which they strive to exploit quickly during the brief period of their fashionable shelf-life. In classical music, companies like Philips have been known to sign up young tyros and then hold them in creative suspension for years until they feel that their musical skills have reached a sustainable pitch. They might then nurse them, and their loss-making recordings, for many more years until concert performances have finally delivered a revered reputation. Classic contracts inevitably tend to be for long periods, with the knowledge that when the breakthrough comes, sales tick over for decades. Most of the annual revenue on the classical side comes from recordings made long ago. In pop, companies jealously guard their artists and are reluctant to let them record for rivals while top conductors and classical soloists take periodic 'holidays' to make occasional albums with competitors. Classical companies accept the tradition of lending artists to other labels. In pop, record companies want their artists to keep churning out repeats of their last hits. An established classical artist, however, can virtually perform what he or she chooses and there is a greater reluctance to force artists into the studio to complete a contract. If the inspiration has gone, the label accepts the loss. Record companies have regarded their classical subsidiaries as cultural icons ensuring prestige rather than profits, which take years to accumulate, and much depends on the good personal relationship between artists, agents and record company personnel. Loyalties are generally enduring: Pavarotti has been with Decca for thirty years. Classical albums might sell annually in their hundreds, rather than the hundreds of thousands of a pop hit, but they keep on selling. The Pounds 500,000 recording cost of a major opera might be amortised over 20 years. Advances are generally low - Pounds 5,000 for a newly signed artist - but there are no deductions. A new pop act might be dazzled by a Pounds 250,000 advance but by the time the cost of studio time, promotional video, and marketing have been deducted there is often little left. Unlike the pop industry, the classical world is selling repertoire rather than a name. Stars are important - on their broad backs the record labels hope to off-load to the shops the low priced, economically produced, recordings from eastern Europe and elsewhere, which supply music rather than masterpieces. But the serious enthusiast of classical music buys a sound rather than an over-hyped reputation. There have been whispers that the gentlemanly idiosyncracies of the classical companies are under threat and the emergence of Sony, George Michael's label, which acquired CBS, has caused some unease. Its Japanese management has a passion for classical music and poured millions into building up the American record company's rather lack-lustre classical catalogue. There was also a spell of unfamiliar 'poaching' from other labels and advances were inflated throughout the classical world. Some of Sony's more costly commitments sadly back fired - both Von Karajan and Horowitz, lured from DG, died before they could record for their new masters - but the new Sony list is impressive: Maazel, Mehta, Abbado, Muti, Barenboim and Giulini, and the Berlin Philharmonic. The company has yet to translate its investment into an increased share of the market. The sudden phenomenon of the classical hit also caused ripples. The money men at head office received a jolt when Pavarotti and the Tenors, Nigel Kennedy, Gorecki, Tavener and, this year, Spanish monks chanting the Gregorian ritual, suddenly started to sell in pop-like proportions. But excited board room speculation that classical music could be the much-needed new musical craze were soon scuppered by sales figures. Even in recent years classical music has never managed to rise above 9 per cent of total record sales. Most classical artists will still be more interested in developing a satisfyingly long creative career than cashing in their skills. The very limitations in the size of the business inhibit financial excess. Specialist record labels, like Conifer, which attracts artists who share its interest in exciting interpretations of the classics, know that they cannot afford to embark on an auction. Agents, too, want long careers for their artists: not a pop star's brief hour in the spotlight. Joeske Van Walsam protects his artists from signing recording contracts because he feels they have not yet achieved the required maturity. Pop music sold its commercial soul to the devil decades ago; in classical music there is still some integrity. That is one advantage in being a minority taste.</p>

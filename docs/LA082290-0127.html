Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BURBANK MAN SLAIN IN DRIVEWAY  </P> <P> A Burbank man was fatally shot this morning by two gunmen who were waiting for  him when he and his wife drove into a parking space outside their apartment,  police said.  </P> <P> Jose Salazar, 37, was shot once in the head as he sat in his car in the 700  block of East Cedar Avenue about 12:30 a.m., said Sgt. Don Goldberg.  </P> <P> He died an hour later at St. Joseph Medical Center. His wife, Cecilia, was not  injured.  </P> <P> Investigators had no motive for the slaying, Goldberg said. The victim was  returning home after being picked up from work by his wife in the Echo Park  area of Los Angeles. When they arrived at their apartment, two men approached  the car and fired at the victim before fleeing. Goldberg said it appears the  gunmen were waiting specifically for Salazar.  </P></p>

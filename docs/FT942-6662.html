			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed - for a fortnight Fixed-rate investment accounts are not as common as fixed-rate mortgages but they give investors the certainty of knowing what their income will be, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Yet, few investors would feel happy fixing their income, only to find interest rates moving up. A few weeks ago, Halifax announced it was increasing the rates on Stepped Income Reserve. Launched in February, this five-year, fixed-term investment pays a guaranteed return (on a Pounds 2,000 minimum) which increases each year. The new rates start at 6.5 per cent gross in year one and rise to 10.5 per cent in year five. Pushing up these rates might seem like good news - but not for investors who decided to fix at 'new' rates offered only two weeks earlier. And those rates - issued at the end of April - replaced ones issued only nine days before. The recent turbulence in the bond markets accounts for all the activity, but the message must be that this is not a good time to fix returns on investments. As Graham Bowley explains on page VI, the markets expect inflation and interest rates to rise. If that happens, investors will not want to be locked into relatively low investment rates. By the same token, it is still a good idea to fix mortgage payments, although only if you get a good rate. The number of offers is dwindling fast and many are decidedly unappealing. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester yesterday withdrew its 8.49 per cent, five-year fixed-rate mortgage but Lloyds and TSB have one at 8.39 per cent, putting Halifax's 9.25 in the shade.</p>

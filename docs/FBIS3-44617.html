In his speech, Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the numerous and  fruitful achievements scored by all levels of people's  congresses in ensuring and promoting the province's reform and  opening up as well as modernization. Jiang Chunyun said: At  present, China's socialist modernization has entered a new  development stage and it is now at a critical moment. All party  members, cadres, and masses, all party and government leading  cadres at various levels in particular, must further enhance  their understanding of the important position and role of the  people's congress work under the new situation from the high  plane of stabilizing the state, vitalizing the nation,  developing undertakings, and promoting social progress. Also,  they must exploit, in an even more conscious and positive  manner, the important role of people's congresses at all levels  in building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: At present and during the  foreseeable future, we should focus the people's congress work  on drawing up local regulations, economic regulations in  particular, and on drawing up as quickly as possible a number of  local rules and regulations that are suitable for the demands of  developing the socialist market economy in order to form within  five years the initial form for a basic framework of the legal  system that will ensure the orderly operation of the socialist  market economy. We should further strengthen the supervisory  function of people's congresses to ensure the materialization of  the general goals and general tasks of the party. At present,  we should give prominence to the supervision of law enforcement  to ensure the effective implementation of the Constitution and  laws. At present, the supervision of law enforcement should be  focused on solving the problems of refusing to abide by existing  laws, enforcing laws in a relaxed manner, refusing to deal with  law breakers, using powers to replace laws and suppress laws,  and taking bribes in violation of laws. We should actually give  play to the role of people's congresses in opposing corruption  and improving administrative honesty. Practice shows that one  of the reasons for the emergence of some unhealthy trends and  corrupt phenomena among party and government organs lies in the  imperfect legal system and the lack of necessary supervision.  The powers not subject to supervision will certainly lead to  corruption. Focusing on using the legal system to eliminate  corruption and improving administrative honesty, all levels of  people's congresses and their standing committees should rapidly  draw up and prefect the rules and regulations related to  improving administrative honesty and should use rules and  regulations to standardize and restrict the behavior of party  and government organs and workers. We should give full play to  the role of people's congresses and actually strengthen the  building of people's congresses. We should also use a new idea,  a new attitude, a new style of work, and new behavior to create  first-class people's congress work and to meet the demands of  new situations and new tasks.    Li Zhen, chairman of the provincial people's congress  standing committee, presided over the conference. Attending the  conference were Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee and vice governor of the province; Li Wenquan,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Lu Maozeng,  chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference; Tan Fude, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the  provincial discipline inspection commission; responsible  comrades of the provincial people's congress standing committee,  the provincial higher people's court, and the provincial  people's procuratorate; responsible comrades of various city and  prefectural party committees; responsible comrades of various  city people's congress standing committees; chairmen and  secretaries general of various prefectural people's congress  work committees; and responsible comrades of the pertinent  departments directly under the provincial authorities.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / China air traffic accord with US China and the US yesterday agreed to co-operate in converting the Chinese military-dominated air traffic control system to civilian management under an agreement signed by senior US and Chinese officials. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, and Mr Ding Henggao, minister of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, agreed to 'pursue preliminary co-operation in air traffic control systems and technology'. The signing follows the Sino-US decision earlier this year to establish a Joint Defence Conversion Commission to provide a framework for co-operation in transforming military industries to civilian use. Mr Perry and his Chinese counterparts were seeking improved defence co-operation as part of attempts to enhance Sino-US relations. Other issues discussed by the US defence secretary and Chinese officials included human rights, North Korea and non-proliferation of nuclear technology. The US had identified air traffic control, exacerbated by confusion between civilian and military controllers, as a priority because of China's poor safety record. At present China's military controls 90 per cent of the skies, with civilian controllers playing a limited role. US officials did not go into details, but the transformation of China's chaotic air traffic control system will lead to greater involvement of US companies in the building of a modern network. Mr Perry arrived in China on Sunday at the start of a four-day visit aimed at consolidating a recent improvement in Sino-US relations. But US officials made it clear that an embargo on arms sales to China would be maintained. Imposition of sanctions on sales of military equipment followed the bloody events of 1989, when the military turned its guns on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. Chinese media hailed the visit, saying it marked the 'resumption of high-level contacts between the two countries.' US officials expressed satisfaction with the wide-ranging discussions, which included human rights issues. Mr Perry spent two hours in talks with General Chi Haotian, his Chinese counterpart. These discussions will continue over the next few days. Guy de Jonquieres, Business Editor, adds: Mr Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister, has cancelled plans to visit three Chinese provinces this month after being told by Beijing that his visit was 'inopportune.' The move appears intended to underline Beijing's continuing anger at political reforms in Hong Kong instituted by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. However, the Department of Trade and Industry in London was playing down the significance of the incident. It said ministerial visits were always subject to last-minute change and Mr Needham had known the visit was not going ahead before he left for a Far East tour at the weekend.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, member of </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, and Miro Lazovic, chairman of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, by Svetlana Vasovic-Mekina; place  and date not given: "City-Dwellers and Mountain-Dwellers"]    [Text] What the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is now  launching are campaigns in an attempt to defend an integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina by cutting off the corridor, which would  force Karadzic to sit down at the negotiating table.    Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, a member of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Miro Lazovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, as representatives of the Serbs in  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, recently returned, via  Ljubljana, from an official visit to Moscow where they met with  Vitaliy Churkin and top-ranking representatives of the Russian  Orthodox Church.    [Vasovic-Mekina] Whom do you actually represent?    [Pejanovic] After the first multiparty elections in Bosnia,  the victorious parties arrogated the right (and the SDS [Serbian  Democratic Party] institutionalized this in particular) to  represent all of their own nation. This is a dangerous formula  of "representation," both for the nation and for democracy,  because a nation can never be represented by just one political  party if we want to have a multiparty system. As far as the  Serbian Civic Council is concerned, it was formed by an assembly  of citizens of Serb nationality who live in free territory,  territory under the control of the government and Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We stand for those citizens. Accordingly,  through the Serbian Civic Council we do not represent, but  rather stand for, those citizens in Bosnia-Herzegovina (around  200,000 of them) who both before and during the war were and  remained in favor of coexistence with Muslims and Croats, in  favor of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and equality of the  nations. I am chairman of the Serbian Civic Council and a member  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, while Lazovic is the  president of parliament and a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  War Presidency.    [Vasovic-Mekina] Is it not paradoxical that on the one hand  you, as representatives of civic parties, oppose blocs of  expressly nationalistic parties while on the other hand you  stand for Serbs?    [Pejanovic] In our case, by organizing citizens of Serb  nationality an association of citizens was created, which is not  a party organization.    [Lazovic] It is not our ambition to replace the SDS as a  national party. Over the course of the peace process that has  been going on for two years now, it has been necessary to oppose  Karadzic's and Milosevic's policy so that the world will finally  realize that they cannot speak on behalf of all Serbs. We  continue to stand for the civic option and believe that  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a civic state is the best solution for all  its citizens, including the Serbs.    [Vasovic-Mekina] As representatives of a portion of Bosnian  Serbs, what do you think of the policy of other Bosnian Serbs  being represented by Radovan Karadzic?    [Lazovic] The idea that he represents all Bosnian Serbs has  been taking shape for a long time, as if there is not a single  Serb opposed to his political option. If that were the case,  Bosnia-Herzegovina would have been partitioned long ago.    [Pejanovic] One of the reasons for our public actions is to  remove the collective burden that Karadzic's and Milosevic's  policy has placed on the shoulders of the Serb nation. We  believe that the Belgrade regime and the exponent of that regime  in Pale bear the blame for what has happened in the territory of  the former Yugoslavia, and that the Serb nation on the whole did  not want war, at least not the percentage of it claimed by  Karadzic, so that this was the best way for Serbs themselves,  within their own nation, to oppose the expansionist,  greater-state policy of Slobodan Milosevic. On the other hand,  we want to show the world community that an enormous percentage  of the Serbs living on free territory do not support Karadzic's  policy, and that an enormous number of Bosnian Serbs have fled  territory controlled by Karadzic and his exponents, not wanting  to take part in a war against their state and neighbors. Indeed,  the figures put Karadzic against a wall--right now 40 to 45  percent of the Serbs who lived in the territory that he controls  are unavailable to him. And even of that 45 percent, an enormous  number does not support his policy, but since a regime of  coercion and totalitarianism is in control there, it appears  that all those Serbs are in favor of his policy. It is not known  that an enormous number of them have fled, roaming Europe with  Bosnian Croats and Muslims, and that is why it is high time to  expose this false image of him and us that has been created in  the world. They want to resolve everything through force,  through war; true, they are a factor that must be considered in  the course of the negotiations, although they can represent only  one faction within the Serb nation, the chetnik faction. An  enormous number of Serbs are for the civic option, the peace  option, not for war. We want these Serbs to be heard.    [Vasovic-Mekina] All the same, it appears that the world  media are bashful about devoting attention to you, since you  ruin the image that has been created about all Serbs in public  opinion. Indeed, it seems that thus far it has not been in the  interest of the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities to show the  world, at the height of the war and shelling of Sarajevo, that  there are in fact other kinds of Serbs?    [Pejanovic] Unfortunately, the world media are already  accustomed to gauging everything according to national leaders,  regardless of what they do.    I think the very worst about politicians who pursue policy  through war. We are among the people and public employees who  would prefer a thousand times over to talk, not for a single  second to wage war.... It is true that the entire European world  has accepted the formula that there are three nations, three  parties, and three leaders in Bosnia, and that only what they  say is important to Europe, so that multiparty life has also  been ignored within the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government.    [Vasovic-Mekina] What are the prospects for negotiations  with  representatives of the same nation, with Karadzic?    [Pejanovic] What is one to think of people who base their  policy on God-given, inherited strength? Karadzic gained  strength in the form of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], aimed  at waging war in the name of Greater Serbian interests. And what  is one to think of a policy that uses force to drive people from  their age-old homes en masse? What is one to think about a  policy that murders people? About a policy that thrives on  hatred toward people who belong to another nation or another  religion, even though they have lived in this region for  centuries in mutual tolerance? Karadzic was not born in Bosnia,  he simply completed his schooling and studies in Bosnia. And now  he is fighting, with force, for the idea of the impossibility of  ethnic mixing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is destroying  coexistence by force. That is the Greater Serbian policy that he  brought with him from his native Montenegro. It is a policy that  separates Serbs from the neighbors with whom they have lived  together for centuries, that separates them into national pens,  into ethnically pure areas. What does it mean today, at the end  of the 20th century, to carry out a policy of ethnic cleansing,  genocide, a criminal policy?    [Lazovic] I have participated in all the negotiations in  Geneva and Washington. Despite all the efforts to keep  everything on a diplomatic and sober level, there were often  occasions where we had to react emotionally to their incoherent  proposals. For example, their proposal that everything must be  divided, meaning that there must be separate roads for Muslims,  Croats, and Serbs. The original solution was an  intersection--the Serbs take the overpass and the Muslims take  the underpass: They presented such absurdities to us in all  earnest, with maps and drawings.... To our question about how  the citizens of Sarajevo would get to Zenica, Karadzic said,  literally: "Dig a tunnel under Kobilja Glava!" which is one of  the mountains above Sarajevo. That is very indicative of those  who are deciding the fate of the Serb nation in an extremely  frivolous and irresponsible way. Milosevic's and Karadzic's  policy have forced the Serb nation into a moral, material, and  spiritual calamity that the Serb nation never deserved, because  never before has it borne the stamp of the aggressor, it has  always been the victim.    [Vasovic-Mekina] Does it not seem, ultimately, that this  policy of Karadzic and Milosevic has in fact been successful;  the world accepts them as parties in the negotiating process?    [Pejanovic] We differ from others in that we believe that  people must now secure international guarantees that they can  return to their own homes, and that the question of a  territorial partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina according to ethnic  criteria is criminal. For us, it is not possible to resolve the  Bosnia-Herzegovina war drama through military force, but only  through political negotiations aimed at stopping the war and all  military operations, as well as enemy propaganda, and at making  the Serb side accept a formula according to which  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a unified state in which the equality of  all three nations would be institutionalized through federal  institutions. If that is not accepted, the war will simply  continue.    [Vasovic-Mekina] How can the war be stopped if now, for  example, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government's troops are engaging  Karadzic's army and attacking Brcko?    [Lazovic] The position of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  legal, in pursuit of our political goals. On the one hand, we  want to defend Bosnia-Herzegovina and block the full  reconstitution of any future Serb ethnic state and its  connection to Krajina in Croatia, while on the other hand there  is the project to realize a Greater Serbia, which would undercut  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a sovereign and independent state. We  advocate a modern, civic republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its  territorial borders and believe that that would be most suitable  to Bosnian Serbs as well. What the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  now launching are campaigns in an attempt to defend an integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina by cutting off the corridor, which would  force Karadzic to sit down at the negotiating table....    [Pejanovic] Let us look at the facts--who took the offensive  in Bosnia-Herzegovina? If it had been the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, then we might have controlled 70 or 80  percent of the territory; Karadzic's army would not hold 70  percent of the territory if it had not taken the offensive.  Today they are circulating the theory that they are forced to  continue fighting because they are facing an offensive by the  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which they call the Muslim army,  which is a profanity. Concretely speaking, the Brcko front  serves the purposes of the propaganda war, in a desire to  project a continuation of the war. The Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has spent the whole time in a position of  defense and resistance, and in that way it has managed to defend  some places and regain some of them. The policy of the legal  institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to break off military  operations and engage in negotiations and the search for  political solutions. Our government did everything it could to  find a political solution with so-called Herceg-Bosna, i.e., the  Croat national corpus, in the form of the Washington agreement.  That was not a wonderful solution, holding forth milk and honey,  but at least military operations were halted through this  constitution of peace. The same thing is sought from the  so-called Karadzic side. Instead of that, he offers us an  offensive against Gorazde. We have stopped Gorazde, and now  Brcko is being opened up as a propaganda ploy.    [Vasovic-Mekina] You said that it is a profanity to call the  troops of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government a Muslim army.  Besides Kladanj, can you cite any other example where Serbs are  fighting on your army's side?    [Lazovic] The Tuzla region is an example of a joint  government in power, where people of different nationalities are  trying to jointly defend themselves against the greater-state  appetites of Karadzic's army. For two years, Serbs in Sarajevo  have experienced together with Muslims and Croats all the  horrors of the biggest concentration camp maintained by  Karadzic's Serbs from the surrounding mountains.    [Pejanovic] The Serb victims of shells in Sarajevo alone are  enough to condemn Karadzic as a war criminal. In terms of  inhabitants, Sarajevo was the biggest Serb city after Belgrade.  And it still is today: Inside it there are still between 60,000  and 70,000 people of Serb nationality. Why is that hushed up in  Belgrade, and who will bear responsibility for that?! According  to some analyses, more Muslims than Serbs have left Sarajevo.  The Serbs are the ones who have remained in Sarajevo in all the  structures of life to work and continue fighting, to defy  Greater Serbian aggression. By working in joint institutions of  government, we have allowed the Serbs to preserve their  political and human honor, both in Sarajevo and in Tuzla and the  entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Lazovic] During the first months of the war, two shells  that  fell in front of the building where I live and where children  were playing killed seven children. Of the seven, five were Serb  children. Were these children traitors? The theory that the  Serbs who have remained in Bosnian cities are traitors is the  fruit of chetnik ideology. In this context, we are traitors: I  am personally a traitor to a chetnik ideology, and I will never  support a Greater Serbian policy.    [Vasovic-Mekina] Are you not afraid that the Bosnian  Government will use you publicly as honorable Serbs and that you  could be misused in its political activity?    [Pejanovic] No, because we have always acted in the interest  of peace and coexistence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Permit me to  turn the question around: What would have happened to the other  Serbs if Mr. Lazovic, I, and many other Serbs had not  participated in institutions of power and shared responsibility  with others for the fate of the state? What would have happened  to Serbs in cities and villages all over Bosnia, where even  today they live peacefully with their neighbors, if we had not  defended our Bosnia? What would have happened, in the end, if we  had not opposed the extremists within Bosnian politics, if we  had not contributed to seeing to it that Cacina, Jukina, and  other paramilitary units were transformed and that control over  security was assumed by a professional Bosnia-Herzegovina army  and a well-organized police?    [Vasovic-Mekina] You participated in the Washington  negotiations, but the Serbs are not included in the current  constitution for a new Bosnian federation?    [Lazovic] That is understandable. It is not possible to be  constitutive twice--once within Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole  (Karadzic's Serbs--author's note) and then again, separately,  within the current federation. The Washington agreement is open  to everyone. If Karadzic accepts the negotiations, then the  Serbs too will gain the same status within an integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina as all the other nations. If not, then Serbs  in Bosnia, thanks to Karadzic's policy, will in fact become a  minority.    [Vasovic-Mekina] What then?    [Lazovic] In that case, we are left with the possibility of  fighting for adequate national, but most of all civil and human  rights for Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina without the status of a  constitutive nation.    [Vasovic-Mekina] What sort of guarantees did Churkin give  you  in Moscow?    [Pejanovic] We were pleasantly surprised when he confirmed  that the entire world is united in the effort to preserve the  integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Churkin literally told us, let  the war stop for one year, even with temporary maps, and that  will be enough for the drunkards of war and the extremists to  leave their positions.... We presented to Churkin our views, the  views of all Serbs who do not agree with Karadzic's policy.</p>

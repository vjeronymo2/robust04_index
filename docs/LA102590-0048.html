			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CSUN PLAYERS REQUIRED TO HIT BOOKS BEFORE BASKETS  </P> <P> Pete Cassidy, Cal State Northridge basketball coach, is making sure that the  student part of the student-athlete description gets equal time. In addition to  monitoring daily study-hall sessions, Cassidy and his staff check the  classrooms on campus.  </P> <P> Northridge basketball players must be in class, in the first three rows of  seats, and sitting upright in the front third portion of their chairs.  </P> <P> Those who are either absent, sitting at the back of the room or slouching are  required to join Cassidy at dawn for "cock-a-doodle-doo" runs.  </P> <P> "I don't want it to appear that we don't trust them," Cassidy said. "It is just  that this is what has to be done for them to be students. It is best for their  future."  </P> <P> Quoteworthy: Todd Bowser, CSUN's 6-foot-7, 300-pound center, on his weight-loss  program: "It is coming off as we speak, so to speak."  </P> <P> Bowser attributes his loss, 25 pounds and counting, to the Loyola Marymount  conditioning program that Cassidy adopted.  </P> <P> "I do watch what I eat anyway," he said. "I guess it is hereditary."  </P> <P> Since his days at Montclair Prep, Bowser has been told that he moves well for  his size. He certainly will have to in the Matadors' run-and-gun offense.  </P> <P> "It'll be hard, but I'll just do it," Bowser said. "Isn't that the way the  saying goes?"  </P> <P> Rider on a storm: J. R. Rider, called the top returning junior college  basketball player in the country by one preseason publication, has spirits  soaring at Antelope Valley College.  </P> <P> "He is a phenomenal talent," Coach Newton Chelette said of the 6-foot-5 Rider.  "You can't stop him."  </P> <P> Surprisingly, although numerous colleges have included Rider on their mailing  lists, only a handful of coaches came by to see him during a recent contact  period. Apparently they have been scared off by the sight of a Shark in the  recruiting waters.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty much known fact that, if everything is OK in Vegas, he's going  there," Chelette said.  </P> <P> Rider, who originally signed with Kansas State, is a transfer from Allen County  (Kan.), where he averaged 31 points a game last season.  </P> <P> He played for the North team in the Olympic Festival last summer.  </P> <P> West Valley connection: With only Kirk Scott, Eugene Humphrey and Erik Cooper  back from last season's team, the CSUN basketball team is short on familiarity,  but Scott is well-acquainted with newcomers Keith Gibbs and Brian Kilian. All  three attended West Valley College in Saratoga, Calif.  </P> <P> When Scott was at West Valley, Gibbs attended Westmont High, just around the  corner.  </P> <P> Pioneer spirit: Scott has no delusions about how difficult it will be for the  Matadors to be competitive this season.  </P> <P> "First-year Division I programs have it tough," Scott said. "We got a bunch of  pioneers here. We know it is going to be tough and we take it as a challenge.  </P> <P> "With the style of play we have it is going to be hard for other teams to keep  up. This is the best shape I've ever been in."  </P> <P> Saved by the bell: Former Cleveland High standout Andre Chevalier has avoided  freshman initiation so far, but he has found college basketball at CSUN to be  much more physical than the high school game.  </P> <P> "They don't call those ticky-tack fouls," Chevalier said. "I have to get used  to being held when I'm dribbling."  </P> <P> Despite his freshman status, Chevalier isn't afraid to speak his mind.  </P> <P> "The team has a positive attitude even though the media is saying we're not  going to win many games," he said.  </P> <P> Stat watch: Football -- Northridge quarterback Sherdrick Bonner has attempted  137 passes and completed 63 with only one touchdown and one interception. . . .  Northridge leads the Western Football Conference in turnover ratio: The  Matadors have committed only 14 turnovers while forcing 25. . . . Tailback  Albert Fann needs 88 yards to become Northridge's first 4,000-yard rusher. . .  .  </P> <P> Tailback Bobby Webster of Glendale has played a major part in the Vaqueros'  four-game winning streak. The freshman from Pasadena High has rushed for at  least 143 yards and scored two or more touchdowns in every game during that  stretch, including a 210-yard, three-touchdown performance against Ventura last  week. . . .  </P> <P> Antelope Valley held San Bernardino Valley to 90 yards in offense in the last  three quarters of Saturday's 21-14 win after giving up 153 yards in the first  quarter. . . .  </P> <P> Tailback Steve Miller of Antelope Valley is only 114 yards short of making the  Marauders' all-time top 10 career rushing list. Miller, who leads Foothill  Conference backs with 606 yards this season, has gained 1,053 during his  career.  </P> <P> Soccer -- Forward Danny Daniels of Northridge ranks 11th in scoring in the  21-team Division I Far West region. Daniels, a sophomore from the island of  Cyprus, has eight goals and five assists. . . . Bobby Reyes of Northridge is  tied for second in assists with nine and goalkeeper Joel Entreken ranks 13th  with a 1.30 goals-against average.  </P> <P> Bad break: Kevin Burt, special-teams center on the Northridge football team,  broke the ring finger on his right hand during practice last week and is out  for the season. The 6-1, 240-pound redshirt freshman is the son of Matador  Coach Bob Burt. Ed Allum, CSUN's starting center, has taken over duties as the  team's long-snapper.  </P> <P> Injury report: Clayton Bamberg, CSUN's starting safety, is listed as probable  for Saturday's Western Football Conference game at Santa Clara. Bamberg  sustained a bruised left knee in the first half of Northridge's 24-13 win over  Cal State Sacramento.  </P> <P> Helping hand: Antelope Valley's football schedule has been a factor in the  Marauders' 6-0-1 start this season.  </P> <P> This is not to say that it has been loaded with pushovers, but the fact is that  the Marauders have their toughest opponents at the end of the season.  </P> <P> "The conference schedule rotates, so we didn't have much to do with that,"  Coach Brent Carder said. "But it just happened that we play the best teams in  our conference in the second half of the season. And with a young team like  ours, that's the best possible set-up."  </P> <P> The Marauders (4-0-1 in conference play) are currently third in the Foothill  Conference standings behind co-leaders Mt. San Jacinto (6-0, 4-0) and Citrus  (4-2, 4-0), and 1 1/2 games in front of fourth-place Desert (3-4, 3-2),  Saturday's opponent.  </P> <P> After a bye next week, Antelope Valley will play host to Mt. San Jacinto on  Nov. 10 before traveling to meet Citrus in its regular-season finale the  following week.  </P> <P> Service ace: The Antelope Valley women's volleyball team (9-2, 7-2) was tied  for second in the Foothill Conference standings heading into Wednesday night's  match at Rio Hondo thanks largely to Lorna Sawyer.  </P> <P> Sawyer, who had 31 service aces last season, set a school mark for career aces  when she hit her 51st winner last week. She also has become the fourth Antelope  Valley player to post more than 200 kills in her career.  </P> <P> Teammate Heidi Roarty leads the Marauders with 80 kills and 27 aces this  season.  </P> <P> Hitting the road: While most collegiate cross-country teams will be competing  in their respective conference meets this weekend, Division I independent  Northridge will run a road race, the Alhambra Moonlight 8K, on Saturday night  instead.  </P> <P> The race serves as a final tuneup before the NCAA Division I District 8 meet in  Fresno on Nov. 10.  </P> <P> "That's one of the downfalls of not being in (a) conference," Coach Don  Strametz said. "Our top people haven't raced in two weeks and three weeks is  too long of a layoff. (The Alhambra) course is flat, fast and it won't take as  much out of them as a hilly cross-country course would."  </P> <P> Staff writers Theresa Munoz, Mike Hiserman, John Ortega, Brendan Healey and  Kirby Lee contributed to this notebook.  </P> <P> DISTANCE RUNNER  </P> <P> Few would deny that Moorpark College running back Freddie Bradley is a big-play  performer, considering how often the sophomore has had runs of more than 40  yards in the past 1 1/2 seasons.  </P> <P> 1989 Season  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.45IN:2.88IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Yds  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Opponent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Play  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 98  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> East Los Angeles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kickoff return*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 83  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> L.A.

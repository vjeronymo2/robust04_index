			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 19 March  carry editorials commenting on how the ROK Government should  deal with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue in the wake of  the announcement by the International Atomic Energy Agency that  its inspection team was unable to satisfactorily inspect the  North Korean nuclear facilities between 3 and 14 March because  of North Korea's uncooperative attitude. The editorials note  the little progress made in the inter-Korean working delegates'  contact for the exchange of special envoys, and the possible  cancellation of the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "The Policy Toward the North Should Be  Reviewed." The editorial begins, "It is undeniable that there  have been two positions, dovish and hawkish, over the ways to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. This was the case in  the ROK as well as in the United States. Both the ROK and the  U.S. Governments have so far maintained the dovish position  exploring a solution through dialogue and diplomatic efforts.  We admit that this dovish line has attained a degree of  success." The editorial then notes, "However, the doves  overlooked an important fact. It resulted from their distorted  view that dealing with the issue in a hawkish manner was like  not hesitating to wage a war. They should have admitted earlier  that the hawkish position is aimed at the same objective,  namely, a peaceful settlement. To preserve peace, we must make  clear our firm position of resolutely dealing with any threat of  war. This is all the more so especially when we deal with North  Korea." The editorial notes, "The ROK even took a negative  position as to the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK on  the grounds that it could hurt the dialogue atmosphere, thus  suffering an estrangement in ROK-U.S. relations. Now it is time  to make a change," and concludes, "It seems that we have no more  carrot to give. It is up to North Korea to make a choice."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "It Is Time To Reestablish Policy Toward the  North." The editorial notes, "The time has reached a point  where we can no longer tolerate the North Korean attitude of  breaking promises, its delaying and avoiding tactics. We should  now reconfirm clear principles and reestablish our position. In  case North Korea rejects full nuclear inspection and the envoy  exchange, we should make clear our position as to the  consideration of resumption of the Team Spirit joint military  exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles, and sanctions  on North Korea. We should also consider the suspension of  inter-Korean economic cooperation, including the ongoing  unofficial inter-Korean trade."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a  900-word  editorial entitled "The Nuclear Inspection of North Korean  Facilities and the Government's Measures." The editorial says,  "The government should maintain a firm policy and continue to  persuade North Korea since the situation is expected to worsen  if the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security  Council. North Korea, for its part, should now review its  strategy of negotiation with the United States and South Korea.  Irrespective of North Korea's basic strategy, the North Korean  attitude is narrowing the gap for negotiation of the dialogue  advocates in South Korea and the United States and is  encouraging the voice of those who oppose dialogue."</p>

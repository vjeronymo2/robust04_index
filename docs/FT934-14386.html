			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Fashion: The scent of success for an innovative German - The inspiration behind Wolfgang Joop's collections IN HIS native Germany, 48-year-old designer Wolfgang Joop (pronounced yope) is as famous as Helmut Kohl and Boris Becker. Like any national treasure he is hounded by tabloid gossip columnists. He is either hailed as the Prussian designer or accused of being a spy for the Stasi, the hated former secret police, simply because he was born in Potsdam, East Germany. Both attributions are far-fetched since his family moved to the west when he was eight. On the face of it, Joop's celebrity status seems remarkable in a country notably devoid of fashion stars. But in fact, it is his novelty value that is the key to his success. Joop's decision to pose in his own scent advertisements was an ingenious, if vainglorious, marketing ploy. It made him a household face, a personality behind a label, someone with whom people could identify and call their own. While Karl Lagerfeld turned his back on the fatherland to rejuvenate Chanel, Joop won respect for showing his collections from his headquarters in Hamburg. While most German fashion houses employ anonymous stylists and give brands British or Italian-sounding names in order to have export appeal, Joop stands proudly by his surname (ironically of Dutch origin), adding an exclamation mark to it on his label as if to emphasise his uniqueness as a bone fide, hometown designer. Since setting up the Joop] label in 1980, with plans to specialise exclusively in furs, he has built an empire embracing womenswear, menswear, scent, a jeans collection and ranges of shoes, leather goods, hosiery, eyewear and furs. Next year, he is introducing childrenswear and underwear ranges but he is axeing his fur collection because of decline in demand. The manufacture of each collection is licensed to large German companies - Jobis for womenswear, Windsor for menswear, Mustang for jeans - meaning the Joop] company remains free of the financial burden of factory production. It allows Joop] to focus on product design and marketing. At a time when other luxury goods companies from Dunill to Louis Vuitton are feeling the pinch of recession, Joop] sales rose 33 per cent last year to Dollars 167m (Pounds 110.50m). Like a fish that has outgrown its pond, Joop knows that continued expansion depends on his acceptance in the international fashion arena. He has just set plans in motion aimed at establishing himself as a major European designer. Last year, he launched his scent in the US and the UK. in the UK it is stocked by 500 Boots chemists and leading department stores. He also introduced his menswear to selected stores including Liberty and Harrods in London, Christopher Scotney in Leicester, Norton Barrie in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and Smiths in Edinburgh and Glasgow. He plans to increase his menswear presence to 50 stores nationwide next year, starting with London's Harvey Nichols. He is also opening a store on Madison Avenue in New York next year and will show his collections on the New York catwalks for the first time. However, in the immediate future, readers of glossy magazine advertisements are more likely to associate Joop's well-groomed, tanned and beaming visage with fragrances, not clothes. While Coco Chanel was already a legendary couturier when Chanel No 5 arrived in the market place, Joop, is reversing fashion's traditional order of doing things. Joop sees himself as an innovative designer, someone who, 'not only gives people what they want, but gives people what they did not know they wanted'. He purports to be a pioneer of bright colours in menswear and his vivid red jackets bedeck the backs of many television chat show hosts. His autumn/winter 93 collection includes dandified red and white striped blazers, scarlet velvet frock coats, bold yellow check suits, baggy overcoats in outsized checks, a preponderence of black leather jeans and black, felt cowboy hats. But if discreet British taste has trouble relating to such extrovert dressing, flamboyant styles are only half the story. Joop is sufficiently commercially-minded to realise that Rupert Bear suits keep cat-walk photographers happy but grey suits, denim jackets and white shirts keep the bank manager friendly. Like the UK's Paul Smith, he describes his designs as 'quality classics with a twist. He admires traditional English menswear but likes to combine country and city styles, heavy-looking, rough-textured tweeds and chunky knitwear with smooth silks, fine lightweight wools, cottons and leather. He may accessorise a tweed sports coat and a pair of corduroy trousers with a bright waistcoat and a loud, patterned kipper tie. Joop] costs more than Hugo Boss but less than Cerruti and Giorgio Armani, with a suit retailing from Pounds 390 to Pounds 495, a jacket from Pounds 250 to Pounds 325 and a shirt from Pounds 65 upwards. When approaching womenswear, Joop adheres to the 'less is more' school of thought. He is disparaging about Escada - 'for nouveau-riche Arab princesses  -and the showbusiness element of the Paris catwalks. 'Lagerfeld may have made Chanel fun, but l cannot believe that many women want to be wrapped in gold chains from top to toe and wear men's underwear with a tweed jacket,' he says. Joop's womenswear for this autumn is inspired by the Berlin of the 1920s with an emphasis on a streamlined silhouette achieved by softly-tailored, long, A-line overcoats, little cloche hats, hemlines stopping just above or below the knee and a liberal use of floaty chiffon in eveningwear. He has also concentrated on trouser suits consisting of flared or cigarette pants and tweed box jackets, often with velvet lapels. Mink and fox stoles are very much in evidence, although real fur will be replaced by synthetic versions next year. 'I have come to the conclusion that fur is no longer relevant in the 90s,' he says. 'Contemporary chic is a woman in a pretty, floral dress and tailored jacket or a man in a suit and a simple T-shirt. The mood is casual and young-spirited. Fur does not fit in with modern life.' As the Joop] collections are rolled out across the US and the UK (womenswear, though, is not destined to reach the UK before next year), the designer is unlikely to miss revenue from fur sales. Joop will retire from the star role in his own advertisements. 'I was beginning to feel like Marlene Dietrich,' he says. We may not see his face as much in future, but the increasing availability of his clothes should prevent us from forgetting that he is around.

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cakebread Robey plunges Pounds 1.7m into red Cakebread Robey, the Middlesex-based builders' merchant, plunged into loss last year as contractors delayed starting dates and cancelled orders. The group, which warned in February the deficit would top Pounds 1.3m, swung from a Pounds 282,000 profit to a Pounds 1.7m loss in the year to December 31. Mr Martin Earle, chairman, said the deeper-than-expected losses had been due to accounting inaccuracies in the manufacturing division. These had misrepresented the level of losses, especially in the fourth quarter. The division's accountant left before the inaccuracies were discovered. Turnover fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 22.9m. The manufacturing division was hardest hit with sales down by 45 per cent. Merchanting volume declined by 9 per cent, and losses had deepened, Mr Earle said. An extraordinary gain of Pounds 256,000 on the disposal of two properties left a Pounds 1.3m loss attributable to shareholders. Mr Earle warned that it could 'take some time' to restore the company to profitability. Earnings per share swung from 3.2p to losses of 26.1p. There was no dividend.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Bolivian police said former President Luis Garcia Meza escaped from house  arrest to duck charges he tried to peddle the stolen diaries of famed Cuban  guerrilla commander Ernesto (Che) Guevara. Authorities said they went to the  former dictator's home in the colonial city of Sucre on Friday after Congress  charged him with stealing the diaries but could not find him. Guevara, perhaps  the world's most famous guerrilla commander and trusted right hand of Fidel  Castro, died from wounds suffered in a gun battle in Churo, Bolivia on Oct. 8,  1967. Soldiers seized the Guevara diaries, which were then placed in an army  strongbox, only to show up at a London auction house in 1984 where they were  put up for sale for $300,000.  </P></p>

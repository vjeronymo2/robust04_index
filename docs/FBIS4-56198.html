			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Matilde Perez] </F>   [Text] In light of the upcoming elections and the  subsequent change of government, the Permanent Agrarian Congress  (CAP) has demanded recognition as an interlocutor in the  drafting of a national project and an agricultural development  strategy, as well as recognition as an advocate of the country's  political and socioeconomic development.    The CAP believes it is important to give peasants greater  access to posts of democratic representation to ensure that  agricultural problems are discussed as "national high-priority"  issues. In exchange, the CAP commits itself to promote voting  in the countryside and to fight abstentionism because this is  how to channel the social and political demands of this sector  to the state.    This organization, made up of 11 national peasant  associations, warned that if the government fails to modernize  itself and to allow new local, regional, and national  politicians, it will continue to slowly lose its legitimacy,  thus promoting the emergence of new opposition groups.    In its document entitled General Guidelines To  Preparing the CAP Proposals To Modernize the Countryside With  Social Justice, which will be discussed on 30 April and 1  May by all CAP members and will eventually be submitted to the  new president, the CAP demands political democracy and insists  that the new "countryside politicians" cannot be left out of the  decisionmaking process and the drafting of policies geared  toward the rural social sector.    In its analysis, the CAP highlighted the Chiapas issue and  the need to amend Article 27 of the Constitution and to upgrade  the Program of Direct Support to the Countryside (Procampo) to  constitutional rank. The CAP also believes that at least $4  billion must be earmarked for Procampo annually and that expired  portfolios from official and commercial banks must be written  off.    The CAP also noted its decision to join the national peace  and reconciliation efforts because "neither armed nor legal  violence is good for anyone." The organization maintained "all  interests at stake are legitimate;" thus, it suggested "a  reconciliation by way of compromise."    The CAP document, which will be discussed within the  organization, indicates "the only condition we demand is justice  and understanding. Should we pay any costs, these must be fair,  and we must have the absolute guarantee that socioeconomic and  political benefits will be fully enjoyed."    The document, which includes statistics on the evolution of  international prices for basic grains and on production and  harvesting costs, states the following: "The costs incurred and  sacrifices made during a reform must be limited; should they not  be evenly and fairly shared, any modernization project will  fail."    As the CAP added that the end of paternalism means autonomy  for the rural social sector, not a "divorce from the state," the  organization, which will mark its fifth anniversary this year,  stressed: "Accepting socioeconomic development is not populism.  We demand fair conditions to compete at the level of the NAFTA  trade partners."    As it addressed political issues, the CAP pointed out it  already planned to meet with all presidential candidates to know  beforehand their projects for the countryside and to make sure  "our organizations will have solid foundations on which to  choose a candidate." The organization also said its members  agreed to "work for the opening of opportunities in the  decisionmaking of the institutions involved in the fight against  abstentionism and in the campaign to convince people to vote.  As political entities, we cannot be left out of the drafting of  political decisions."    The agrarian organization believes strategic alliances are  necessary at all stages of primary production,  industrialization, and commercialization to be "competitive in  final, selective, or intermediate markets. The alliances and  commitments among our organizations, industrialists, and  businessmen are essential for each one of us, always under the  possibility of being straightforward and complying with the  already signed agreements."</p>

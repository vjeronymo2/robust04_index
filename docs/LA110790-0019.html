			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS NOT IN MOOD TO CELEBRATE ON BOLSHEVIK ANNIVERSARY;  </P> <P> COMMUNISM: A TRADITIONAL MILITARY PARADE WILL MARK REVOLUTION DAY. BUT IT WON'T  BE A HAPPY HOLIDAY.  </P> <P> The headquarters of the Communist Party are lit up like a Christmas tree. A  huge portrait of Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, covers the  facade of the KGB's central offices. Red flags, flashing stars and glowing  torches adorn buildings across the city.  </P> <P> Yet, the Soviet Union has never celebrated a Revolution Day the way it will  today. Already on the eve of the 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution,  the mood in the Soviet capital was far from festive.  </P> <P> Fewer than a third of 2,222 Muscovites polled approved of the planned parade of  tanks, missile launchers and armed troops through the capital and across Red  Square in the traditional demonstration of Soviet military strength, according  to a study by the All-Union Center for the Study of Public Opinion.  </P> <P> Unlike previous years, the stores have not been stocked full of scarce foods  for holiday tables, and many people say their economic hardships leave them  with no appetite for celebration.  </P> <P> And for the first time, people seemed unsure about whether to wish each other  "happy holiday," as has been the custom for decades.  </P> <P> There were even doubts at the traditional Kremlin celebration of the  revolution. Normally a meeting of self-congratulation and praise for the  Communist Party, the gathering of nearly 5,000 readily acknowledged the  questions that many people have about where the country had gone wrong as well  as the angry tempers today.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it is difficult today to understand what is what," Anatoly I.  Lukyanov, the chairman of the Soviet Parliament, said. "It is difficult to make  a simple decision, to discuss anything civilly."  </P> <P> But the manifest problems of the country should not detract from the importance  of the Bolshevik Revolution, Lukyanov asserted. "No one has the right to  belittle the importance of this revolution and its influence on world history  and the progress of human civilization," he said, answering the Communist  Party's critics.  </P> <P> Still, there was criticism from other speakers.  </P> <P> Describing this as "a time of great trial for the country, of national  tragedies and an economic disaster," Irina A. Antonova, a museum director, drew  thunderous applause when she said that the Soviet Union could only emerge by  being honest about its mistakes.  </P> <P> "For many years, we have been living lies," Antonova said. "We must not allow  people's minds to be poisoned further today with new lies."  </P> <P> The country must distinguish, she argued, between the Bolshevik Revolution and  "its noble, lofty ideals of freedom, justice, equality and the people's  happiness" and the mistakes made later as the system grew increasingly  totalitarian in character.  </P> <P> Leonid Y. Bliznov, a machinist and a member of the Supreme Soviet, the  country's legislature, turned his criticism on the current leadership,  including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of  the Russian Federation, who were both seated behind him.  </P> <P> Asking why the Soviet Union's two most powerful men could not put their rivalry  aside and work for the good of the nation, Bliznov said: "It is  incomprehensible who or what stands in the way of these two leaders who know  the people's needs and whom the people recognize. Both must realize that  continued opposition will cost them support."  </P> <P> The criticism, supported by resounding applause, had its impact. Gorbachev  approached Yeltsin after the meeting and, extending his hand, proposed that  they meet, one on one, after the holiday to discuss their differences.  </P> <P> "People must again look back and pay tribute to what the revolution did and  what the mistakes were during that period," Yeltsin said, describing the  holiday as a time for reflection. "The biggest mistake was turning things over  to a totalitarian regime."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, speaking later at a state awards ceremony, said, "We know that  people in the factories and in the lines (for food and consumer goods) say that  we in the leadership know nothing about the situation and do less to change it.  In fact, we are aware of all the problems, and we are working for change."  </P> <P> All these doubts and disputes aside, the traditional military parade will still  be held in Red Square today to celebrate the Bolshevik Revolution and the  achievements of seven decades of socialism, and Soviet leaders will view it  from Lenin's mausoleum just beneath the Kremlin's red walls.  </P> <P> But two alternative demonstrations, both authorized by the Moscow city  government, will highlight the darker sides of Soviet history.  </P> <P> The Moscow Voters Assn., which sponsored several large anti-Communist  demonstrations this year, will hold a "funeral march" from Staraya Ploshad, the  square in front of the headquarters of the Communist Party, to the apartment  building where longtime dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D.  Sakharov lived until his death in 1989.  </P> <P> The organizers say they see this demonstration as a chance to mourn innocent  victims who died under repression sponsored by the Communist state.  </P> <P> "The outcome of the revolution was that millions of our countrymen were  murdered," Vera F. Kriger, an organizer of the rally, said. "Because of this,  our demonstration can be nothing but a funeral march."  </P> <P> In another alternative Moscow demonstration, radicals in the national  Parliament will lead a march from the Byelorussian railway station to Red  Square. Its leaders include Oleg D. Kalugin, a former general in the KGB state  security and espionage agency, and anti-corruption campaigners Telman Gdlyan  and Nikolai Ivanov.  </P> <P> Across the country, controversies about whether to hold Revolution Day  celebrations have become a barometer of public opinion about the Bolshevik  Revolution, the society it created -- and what reforms the country must now  undertake.  </P> <P> A strike organizer in the Arctic mining city of Inta told the independent  Postfactum news service that union members will hold posters with  anti-Communist slogans and the three-color flag of pre-revolutionary Russia  during the parade there.  </P> <P> "Citizens, by turning this mournful date into a holiday," the Inta trade unions  said, "we are once again committing an act of outrage with respect to all sons  and daughters of Russia who perished in the bloody meat chopper started by the  Communists."  </P> <P> The nationalist government in Armenia canceled the holiday altogether. In  neighboring Azerbaijan, the military commander called off the parade to avoid  inciting further unrest in the capital, Baku, the scene of ethnic rioting in  January.  </P> <P> Military parades were banished from main thoroughfares in many other major  Soviet cities.  </P> <P> In the southern Soviet republic of Georgia, where a bloc of parties calling for  independence beat the Communists in elections last month, the army will hold a  parade at a military base rather than in the center of Tbilisi, the capital.  </P> <P> The City Council of Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, ordered the military to  hold its parade away from the city center so the soldiers would not clash with  radical students, whose calls for independence from the Soviet Union have grown  over the last several weeks.  </P> <P> In Leningrad, where the 1917 Revolution began, liberal Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak  quit his drive to cancel the holiday and sanctioned a traditional celebration.  </P> <P> Patriarch Alexi II of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose followers had been  persecuted through much of Soviet rule, told the government newspaper Izvestia  that Revolution Day should be a time of somber reflection.  </P> <P> "Let all the years that have passed rise in our conscience one after another,"  Alexi said, "and persuade us not to pay for politicians' experiments and  principles with human destinies."  </P></p>

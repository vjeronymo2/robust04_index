			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / China vows to scrap HK reform: Furious Beijing accuses Britain of closing door to future talks China accused Britain of slamming the door to future negotiations over Hong Kong yesterday and vowed to scrap representative bodies elected in the last days of British rule. In a statement of barely disguised fury, the Chinese government said Britain had 'completely' closed the door to further talks on the colony's political development. But Beijing stopped short of issuing any threats to Hong Kong's economy. China was responding to the passage through Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) yesterday of a bill enshrining the first stage of Governor Chris Patten's plans for more democracy. Mr Patten said a second bill would be published today and submitted to LegCo on March 9. It contains proposals to broaden the franchise, which China claims break past Sino-British agreements and understanding. In an attempt to contain the row, Mr Patten said: 'Let us try to draw a line under this dispute, and co-operate together in other areas in the interests of the people of Hong Kong.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said the UK looked forward to co-operation with the Chinese, 'in particular . . . to early agreement on financing arrangements for the new airport and on Hong Kong's ninth container terminal'. Instead, however, China is likely to step up its preparations for assuming control of Hong Kong. Beijing's Preparatory Work Committee, an authority-in-waiting comprising senior Chinese officials and leading figures in Hong Kong, is due to meet today. After Mr Patten spoke in Legco, the Hong Kong government took the unusual step of releasing its version of why the talks have floundered without agreement, charting the course of the negotiations and setting out the compromises tendered by Britain in a bid to reach a deal. Some 200,000 copies of the 36-page white paper were printed, 60,000 in English and 140,000 in Chinese. The white paper, entitled Representative Government in Hong Kong, underlines the gulf between the two sides, although Mr Hurd notes in his introductory comments: 'Our door has been open all along for discussion with the Chinese government. It will remain so.' Accepting the Chinese stance as it stood at the end of eight months and 17 rounds of negotiations would have been to embrace an electoral system that restricted choice and left elections open to manipulation, increasing the possibility of corruption and vote rigging, Mr Hurd said. The three main sticking points to agreement between the two sides on the first stage agreement are China's insistence on reinstating appointed members to municipal councils and district boards after 1997; China's refusal to include the voting method for Legco within the initial agreement; and China's view that the Hong Kong government should not legislate unilaterally on any matter which had not been resolved in the talks. 'This time the choice was between sticking to our position or total surrender,' said one British official. Key to this were Chinese proposals which, according to the British account, had sought to slash the original intention to open up the franchise to 2.7m down to around 840,000 voters.

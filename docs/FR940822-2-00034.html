All lines are operated at low pressure to provide service to rural domestic customers of ARKLA, a division of NorAm Energy Corporation (formerly Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company) and ARKLA's Ada Townborder Station No. 2. NGT says that these lines are old, deteriorated, and are no longer necessary for the delivery of gas to ARKLA. NGT proposes to transfer, by sale, minor segments of these lines to ARKLA. No customers or service will be abandoned as a result of the abandonment of these facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> September 26, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

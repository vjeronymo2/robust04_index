			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> VASQUEZ AND STANTON TAKE OATHS OF OFFICE  </P> <P> Seven months after they both won election, Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and  Roger R. Stanton were sworn into office Monday in a ceremony outside the  county's Hall of Administration in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Both supervisors said their experience in office so far has taught them lessons  about how to govern through some of the difficult decisions facing the county.  </P> <P> The "challenges, while formidable and insurmountable to some, can and will be  conquered," said Vasquez, who was appointed to his 3rd District seat in 1987 by  Gov. George Deukmejian and became the county's first elected Latino supervisor  last June.  </P> <P> "I am confident that we . . . will face the adversities and the shortfalls and  overcome them with solutions, leadership and, most of all, the motivation to  build a future for the next generation and beyond," he said.  </P> <P> Stanton, who was first elected in 1980, is beginning his third term in the 1st  District. "I accept this oath with more humility than I did in 1981," he said.  "Quiet perseverance . . . that's the rule, not the exception for millions who  are beyond the glare of public office."  </P> <P> The ceremony featured a Marine Corps brass band from Camp Pendleton and remarks  from state Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and William Campbell  (R-Hacienda Heights) and the county's other three supervisors.  </P> <P> Stanton was sworn in by Bergeson and Vasquez was sworn in by California  Associate Justice John Arguelles.  </P></p>

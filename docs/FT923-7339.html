			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Industry cool on timeshare rules: New legislation may not go far enough THE new Timeshare Act, which gives purchasers a cooling-off period of 14 days to cancel their contracts, will be of little comfort to the man from Staffordshire who fell for the renumbering trick. The renumbering trick works like this: the buyer purchases time in a top-floor Tenerife studio flat with a sea view and, in the case of the man from Staffordshire, pays Pounds 3,300. A year later he arrives for his holiday and discovers that the flats have been re-numbered. He now has a basement studio. He is told he can have a top-floor flat, although a new building has regrettably appeared between his development and the sea, depriving him of his sea view. All he has to do to get the flat he originally wanted is to pay an additional Pounds 1,300. He pays up. The Timeshare Council, which represents owners' groups and the legitimate industry, is severely critical of the Timeshare Act. Giving purchasers 14 days to pull out of timeshare agreements deals with only one of the abuses perpetrated by the less reputable members of the timeshare industry: high-pressure selling. The act does not protect those who buy timeshares in properties that are never built. Nor does it help those who sign contracts on the selling company's promise, subsequently unfulfilled, that it will sell an existing timeshare. In addition, the cooling-off period only applies if the contract is concluded in the UK. The Timeshare Council estimates that 75 per cent of contracts are concluded while buyers are on holiday abroad. The act has its defenders. Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the Consumers' Association, says it has the merit of confining itself to provisions which can be enforced. Abuses which take place outside the UK can be dealt with only by a planned European Community directive, but not all EC members regard the directive as urgent. Mr Ron Haylock, managing director of RCI Europe, which arranges timeshare exchanges, says he does not expect a directive from the EC before 1994  - and governments would then have an additional two years to implement it. However, the delay in devising an effective system of consumer protection has not retarded the growth of the European timeshare industry. Mr Haylock estimates that the number of people buying timeshares in Europe grew by 28 per cent last year to 125,000. This year's figure is expected to be 138,000. In 1987 it was 46,000. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and France have seen strong growth in the timeshare industry. However, the most spectacular performer of all, he says, is Spain. Although the country is a favoured location for timeshare apartments, Spaniards have only recently begun to feature among the buyers. The UK has the largest number of timeshare buyers but, in contrast to the rest of Europe, the British market has begun to decline. Mr Haylock estimates that there were 49,000 UK buyers last year, only 1,000 more than in 1990. In the first eight months of this year the number of UK buyers fell by 8 per cent. Mr Haylock believes this is the result of the recession rather than consumer concern about sharp practice. Miss Diana Hanks, consumer services manager of the Timeshare Council, argues, however, that legislation is still needed to deal with sharp practices. The council would like tighter control of purchasers' money when timeshares have been purchased in property that is still being built. A common ploy is for rogue vendors to sell timeshares in flats that have not been built, and then offer buyers holidays in alternative accommodation. She says it should be compulsory for timeshare companies to offer potential buyers full prospectuses which specify whether the property has been completed. When villas and apartments have not yet been built, buyers' money should be paid to trustees to be released in phases as construction work is completed. Legislation, says Miss Hanks, should deal with the problem of buyers who discover, after paying cash, that they have also acquired a pre-existing mortgage over the property. Selling timeshares which turn out to include additional financial obligations of this sort, should, she says, be 'a criminal offence with massive fines and imprisonment'.</p>

Late  on the night of 25 January negotiations on the participation of  Siemens and a number of other German companies in the  construction of an international airport in Novosibirsk came to  a close in that city (according to preliminary estimates the  cost of construction will come to $1.2 billion). In the course  of the negotiations, two drafts were compared--the German one  and the American draft offered by Boeing Aerosystems  International late last year.    The negotiations were conducted by representatives of the  Novosibirsk directorate for construction of the airport--the  Transsibavia joint-stock company. In addition to Siemens,  Gunther Eppelmann, general representative of the company Graf  von Wedel, and Werner Thiemig, managing engineer of the company  DYWIDAG Osteuropa, took part in the negotiations for the German  side.    As the Siemens manager Horst Warzel stated in the course of  the negotiations, the draft of the construction of the  international airport proposed by Boeing Aerosystems  International does not fully account for the local climatic and  financial-economic peculiarities (a consortium of American  companies led by Boeing and the consulting company Ernst and  Young is planning to complete work on its draft in  mid-February). Mr. Warzel noted that the concept of the Siemens  draft is fundamentally different from the American draft of an  airport terminal complex which would not allow for further  expansion. Mr. Warzel believes that in this instance, a  block-modular pattern of airport construction which makes it  possible to gradually augment the capacity of the airport is  optimal. The model of construction of one of the Indonesian  international airports, as well as that of the airport in the  capital of Qatar, Doha, was proposed as a prototype; they were  also designed with the participation of Siemens specialists.    As Mr. Warzel stated, the Berliner Bank, the Deutsche Bank,  and a number of Swiss and Austrian banks, as well as the German  engineering construction companies DYWIDAG Osteuropa and Graf  von Wedel have already shown interest in financial participation  in the project. They are prepared to embark on carrying out the  airport project shortly; within two to three weeks Siemens could  develop a business plan of the project.    Carrying out the project may influence the nature of the  economic presence of foreign countries in the Siberian region  substantially. This circumstance, in combination with the  considerable cost of the project, was the reason for this kind  of keen competition between German and American companies.    The negotiations have not been completed yet: The  Transsibavia joint-stock company and the German companies have  agreed to continue them and hold joint consultations.    KOMMERSANT observers note that the lack of necessary foreign  exchange funds in the possession of the Russian side may become  the main obstacle to implementation of the project. According to  data from unofficial sources, representatives of the  Transsibavia have already approached Aeroflot for financial  support, but have gotten no response so far.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BACK IN THE FRAY: Tom C. Rogers, above, a slow-growth advocate from San Juan  Capistrano, has started a statewide group to help defeat Proposition 111, the  governor's June ballot proposal to increase the gas tax for major road  improvements. . . . Rogers says he is against the initiative because it tampers  with state spending limitations put in place by Paul Gann's Proposition 4 in  1979. . . . It's "misleading," he says, because "you have to read it four times  before you get the notion that it's a gas tax hike." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve  Emmons  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Leeds acts on domestic toxic waste THE FIRST large-scale attempt to find a safe method of disposing of toxic or environmentally unfriendly household waste such as paint, garden chemicals and engine oil will be launched in Leeds today. The project is being funded by ICI Paints, the B&amp;Q DIY retail chain and BP Oil. It will be run by Leeds City Council. The rubbish will be collected by a mobile 'wastewagon' that has cost nearly Pounds 25,000. If the experiment works the backers expect the scheme to be introduced by other councils although the costs would have to be borne by the public sector out of national and council taxes. Some wastes pose environmental problems if they are put out with normal household rubbish and garbage. They may not be suit-able for safe incineration at low temperatures or, if buried in landfill sites, they may react years later during decomposition to give off poisonous fumes. Local authorities are also becoming concerned at people pouring solvents or other liquid wastes down drains or lavatories.</p>

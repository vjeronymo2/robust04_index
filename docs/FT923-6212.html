			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Collor defies demands for resignation: Thousands demonstrate against president in state capitals across the country PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil remained defiant yesterday in the face of mounting public pressure for his resignation following Monday's damning congressional report accusing him of involvement in a multi-million-dollar kickback scheme. Thousands of students and union militants gathered in the commercial centre of Rio de Janeiro last night dressed in black and shouting 'Out with corruption. Out with Collor'. Office workers in surrounding buildings threw shredded paper out of windows to show their support. Other mass demonstrations were under way in state capitals across the country. Students, trade unionists, lawyers, intellectuals and politicians calling for Mr Collor's resignation took part in earlier protests in Sao Paulo, the country's largest city where up to 500,000 had gathered, and Belo Horizonte, the third largest city. Leading intellectuals have issued a manifesto accusing the president of 'breaching the moral and legal limits of his mandate'. Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, the influential governor of Sao Paulo, demanded the president's impeachment. But Mr Collor summoned his entire cabinet to the presidency last night for an emergency meeting at which he repeated his determination to stay in office. Afterwards Mr Celio Borja, law minister, said that all ministers had signed a declaration affirming they would remain in their posts until the crisis was over. The 200-page congressional report broadcast live to the nation on Monday contained nothing that had not previously surfaced in press reports since investigations began in May, when Mr Collor's younger brother accused him of corruption. But the report by a 22-member commission was the first official confirmation of allegations. It was unsparing in its criticism, accusing Mr Collor of profiting from a huge corruption racket by his former close friend and campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, and of 'failing in his constitutional duty to uphold moral standards'. Congressional discussion on the report began yesterday afternoon and the commission will vote today on whether to approve its conclusions. There is little doubt it will be approved, as 13 members have already confirmed their backing. This will open the way to impeachment proceedings, for which a two-thirds majority in Congress is necessary, and a possible criminal investigation. Mr Collor continues to insist the report was 'political'. He is expected to produce a counter-report asserting his innocence and laying all the blame on Mr Farias. His aides are also planning legal challenges to the report on the grounds that the commission had no right to investigate the president. The inquiry was set up to examine Mr Farias' activities. Mr Collor spent yesterday closeted with pro-government political leaders in an attempt to ensure the 168 votes necessary to withstand impeachment proceedings. Government officials claim they have 209 votes but this may be jeopardised if the Democratic Social party (PDS) withdraws its 44 votes of support for the government. Mr Paulo Maluf, PDS president, has already said he is in favour of impeachment. Most politicians are keen to avoid a lengthy impeachment and hope public protests will force Mr Collor to quit. The economy remains paralysed with inflation running at 23 per cent a month. Mr Carlos Langoni, a former central bank governor, said: 'If Collor stays on now, inflation will rise and there is no way the government will be able to manage the economic situation.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 Mar -- Sudden depressurization of the  pilots' cockpit may have caused the crash of the A-310 airbus in  Kemerovo oblast. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today  by Valeriy Eksuzyan, general director of Russian International  Airlines, which operated the airliner.    Using information gathered from the site of the disaster  investigation, he pointed out that this scenario is supported by  the facts. The investigation has established that the airbus  descended from a height of 10,000 m with its engine running at  an angle of 70-80 degrees for 10-20 minutes with its navigation  lights on and undercarriage retracted. It fell after grazing a  hill. The area over which the pieces of the aircraft are  scattered is small - 200 meters. The fuselage, cockpit, wings,  and other pieces are close together. The three pilots were  found in the Airbus's cockpit, strapped to their seats. Their  bodies, like 46 bodies of the other people on board, were quite  recognizable.    According to Valeriy Eksuzyan, these facts indicate that, as  a result of some abnormal phenomena, the pilot's cockpit may  have been suddenly depressurized, which, at an altitude of 10km,  causes the blood to boil and death ensues quickly, and the  aircraft, uncontrolled and on autopilot, lost height until the  moment of impact.    However, it will be possible to determine the precise cause  of the disaster, according to Valeriy Eksuzyan, only after the  two "black boxes", the flight recorders, which were recovered  today and were sent to Moscow for study, have been decoded.</p>

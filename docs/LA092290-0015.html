			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. FANS ARE THRILLED (IN THEIR SPECIAL WAY) THAT RAIDERS WILL STAY  </P> <P> As one who did not believe the Raiders would stay in Los Angeles, I must say  that I am happy to see them stay. I think most of the credit should go to Mayor  Tom Bradley, who never gave up in his commitment to keep the Raiders here. It  is obvious that Al Davis wanted to stay here, on his terms, and Al obviously  got what he wanted . . . again.  </P> <P> KELVIN FILER  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Exporters receive faster payment Exporters are continuing to be paid more promptly by European customers, as the Continent emerges from recession, NCM Credit, the Cardiff-based insurer, said yesterday in its quarterly survey of export activity. It said that for the first time since the recession began fewer companies were defaulting on bills. The value of payment delays fell 14 per cent in the year to June compared with a 15 per cent reduction in the 12 months to the end of March. The proportion of UK companies suffering a loss as a result of non-payment by European buyers in the larger countries remained high.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: CHC Helicopter lifts stake in Brintel to 90% CHC Helicopter Corp of Newfoundland has lifted its stake in Brintel Holdings, the UK helicopter operator which was formerly part of Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire, from 40 per cent to 90 per cent. CHC has also acquired the outstanding 50 per cent of the preference shares and plans to make an offer soon for the remaining ordinary shares, held by the employees. The shares were bought from institutions and Brintel's management. The total cost, assuming the offer to Brintel's employees is accepted, will be about CDollars 36m (Pounds 18m). Brintel, based in Aberdeen, was formed a year ago to acquire the assets of British International Helicopters from the administrator. In the 10 months to November 30 1993 revenues were CDollars 75m for net profit of CDollars 8m. It operates 25 heavy and medium helicopters servicing North Sea oil rigs. It also provides simulator training for commercial and military helicopters, and operates a shuttle service between Penzance, Cornwall, and the Scilly Isles.</p>

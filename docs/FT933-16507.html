			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Ukraine says it owns nuclear arms THE Ukrainian parliament yesterday took a further step along the road to becoming a fully fledged nuclear power by declaring that Ukraine owned the 176 strategic nuclear missiles on its territory. The parliament passed a new defence doctrine declaring that the state 'owns the nuclear weapons on its territory'. The weapons are 130 six-warhead SS19s, 46 10-warhead SS24s together with hundreds of nuclear-armed cruise missiles carried on heavy bombers. The vote was one in a series of incidents within the former Soviet Union yesterday which underscored the precariousness of their political, economic and even territorial existence. The Georgian government accused Russia of sending 2,000 troops in full combat gear to Georgia, following an earlier claim that commandos from the forces of the breakaway region of Abkhazia landed from the sea in the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi and attacked the Georgian forces which still control the city. Guards on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan claim to have repulsed a force of 150 guerrillas of the Tajik opposition attempting to infiltrate the country from bases in Afghanistan, according to an interview on the Interfax News Agency with Colonel Valery Kochenov, a senior Russian staff officer. The Tajik frontier is largely guarded by Russians. A constitutional crisis deepened in Belarus, as Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the chairman of parliament and head of state, refused to step down in spite of an overwhelming vote of confidence against him on Thursday in the Belarus parliament - a vote which, however, was inquorate. Mr Shushkevich, a liberal, was accused by largely conservative deputies of failing to move Belarussian policy closer to Russia. Mr Shushkevich has responded by demanding a constitutional assembly to adopt a new state constitution. The Ukrainian move is the latest in a lengthening chain of decisions and declarations which point to the loss of any political will to give up the weapons and to ratify the Start I and II treaties which have yet to be put before parliament. Though the nuclear missiles are still ultimately controlled fom Moscow, unconfirmed reports point to an attempt by Ukrainian authorities to develop their own control system. The decision will further sour relations between Ukraine and Russia, as Moscow has always claimed ultimate ownership of the missiles and has demanded their return or destruction under the terms of the Start treaties. The Russian parliament cannot ratify Start II while Start I remains unratified by Ukraine. The issue of the Black Sea fleet based in ports in the Ukrainian-held but ethnic Russian-dominated region of Crimea between the two republics has over the past few days revived animosity between the two countries. Though Presidents Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia have agreed to the split and continue to support it, Russian military officers have rejected the decision. Even the Russian defence minister General Pavel Grachev yesterday said that 'the ideal would be to keep the fleet united' and called for attention to be paid to the strong objections of the largely Russian naval officers. However, Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs commission said after the debate: 'Ukraine will move towards arms reduction and Start will be ratified. Only our enemies can say that Ukraine wants to become a nuclear state.'</p>

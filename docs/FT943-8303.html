			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Latins defer to UN over Haiti crisis A group of Latin American governments has cancelled a planned mission to Haiti to discuss the country's political crisis with its military rulers, and will instead allow the United Nations to lead its own mission, Canute James reports from Kingston. The governments - including those of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela and several in Central America - gave way to the UN after suggestions that Haiti's military would use the visit to seek further talks and delay its departure from office, according to diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. The mission was intended to persuade the military leaders to step down and prevent a US-led military invasion to return President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office from his enforced exile. The UN mission was announced after the security council had voted to authorise the creation of a multinational force that would use 'all necessary means' to re-establish democracy in Haiti. The neighbouring Dominican Republic will allow up to 2,000 Haitians into the country for transportation on to the US. Nearly 800 Haitians already granted asylum in the US have been stranded in their country because of flight bans as part of the embargo of Haiti.</p>

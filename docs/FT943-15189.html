			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): Astoria Few singers make suffrin' music so sweet as blues balladeer Bobby Bland, who plays the London Astoria on Tuesday. One of the original soul stylists, Bland's mellow vocals on a string of '60s hits shaped the sound of the new generation of soul singers. He is accompanied on this rare visit by ribald R&amp;B belter Irma Thomas - she of 'You can have my husband, but don't mess with my man,' fame.</p>

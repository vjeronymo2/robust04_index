			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese stores hit as luxury goods sales slow Slow demand for luxury goods hurt interim sales at Japanese department stores, in spite of last summer's rise in consumer confidence due to a cut in income tax and hot weather. Takashimaya posted a 3.8 per cent decline in unconsolidated sales to Y342bn (Dollars 3.94bn) for the first six months to August because of sluggish consumer and corporate demand. Pre-tax profits jumped 2.5 times to Y976m due to a Y6bn cut in costs although after-tax profits fell 31.3 per cent to Y1.32bn. For the full year to February, the company expects pre-tax profits to rise 20.3 per cent to Y3.3bn on a 2.9 per cent decline in sales to Y702bn. Daimaru said parent sales for the first half fell 2.4 per cent to Y261.4bn while pre-tax profits dropped 20.7 per cent to Y1.1bn. After-tax profits rose 3.4 per cent to Y527m. Sales of women's wear rose 2.5 per cent, but sluggish furniture and consumer electronics sales hurt revenue growth. The company cut costs by Y1.8bn. Pre-tax profits for the full year are forecast to fall 4.6 per cent to Y4.5bn on a 1.2 per cent decline in sales to Y536.6bn. Matsuzakaya said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to August dropped 46.8 per cent to Y711m. Sales declined 6.7 per cent to Y214.9bn due to lower spending per customer. After-tax profits fell 25 per cent to Y574m. For the full year to next February, it expects sales to fall 4.8 per cent to Y437bn and a 22.8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y2.2bn.</p>

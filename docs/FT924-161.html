			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas Arguments about the market power of British Gas rumble on as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation proceeds. But it is far from clear which structure for the industry will best promote efficiency and competition. If British Gas were split into separate trading and pipeline operations as the regulator wants, the pipeline company would own the vast majority of the assets. Its fortunes would be dictated by the effective rate of return it was allowed to earn on the pipes. The marketing company or companies would be much flimsier entities, yet these would be expected to enter into long-term contracts for large amounts of gas with producers. Their low capital would not allow much margin for error in fixing their purchasing requirements. If the rate of return were held down on the pipes to allow high marketing margins and encourage new entrants, pipeline shareholders would suffer. But if the pipes earned a commercial return that might not leave enough margin for marketing companies unless gas prices rise. By contrast the price cap structure with British Gas at least offers some economies of scale and competitors are at last taking a significant proportion of the business market, while gas prices are falling. Yet whichever way the MMC leans, British Gas shareholders are reasonably well underpinned by a combination of net asset value and 7 per cent yield, which are not seriously under threat. As deposit rates fall, British Gas shares may look an alluring alternative to gilts.</p>

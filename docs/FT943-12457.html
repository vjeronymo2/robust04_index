			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury expected to bid for Wm Low J Sainsbury is expected to join battle with rival Tesco this week by launching a counterbid for Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group. Sainsbury has been examining the detailed financial information on Wm Low it had requested and although it is thought that it has not yet made a final decision it is widely expected that it will top Tesco's 225p a share bid. By the end of last week Low's shares had climbed to 265p as the City decided a move by Sainsbury was almost certain. The shares jumped 67p to 236p when Tesco launched its bid on July 14. Rival supermarket chains also expect Sainsbury to overcome its historic aversion towards hostile takeover bids. 'Sainsbury cannot afford to sit back and let Tesco steal a march on it in Scotland. There is only one Wm Low,' said an adviser to one of its competitors. Sainsbury itself would only say: 'We are studying the information supplied by Wm Low and will make another announcement in due course.' Both Sainsbury and Tesco are keen to expand in Scotland where they have only 5 per cent and 7 per cent of the market respectively. Wm Low has almost 7 per cent with its 45 outlets and has a further 12 stores in the north of England. Sainsbury, which has only four outlets north of the border, has found it difficult to expand with planning rules making it hard to find greenfield sites and competitors bidding up the price of available land. Its most northerly distribution centre is outside Manchester and taking over Wm Low would give it a ready-made infrastructure. However, fewer than half Wm Low's stores are thought to be appropriate for the Sainsbury format and the company is likely to be estimating the price it could get for the others.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Ukrainian Nuclear Disarmament Has </F> Begun"]    [Text] An event of which there has so long been so much  talk in the capitals of three major countries -- Washington,  Moscow, and Kiev -- has finally happened: Russia and Ukraine  have begun implementing the trilateral accord signed in the  Kremlin 14 January on the partial transfer of the nuclear  warheads of strategic missiles and of strategic bomber cruise  missiles to Russian territory for subsequent dismantling and  salvaging.    They are not revealing the details of the current operation,  its schedule, or the size of the transfers, citing the secrecy  and security requirements stipulated in a special document. But  independent experts maintain that the secret [liternyy] trains  taking the nuclear warheads out of Ukraine must be taking  several dozen warheads previously removed from SS-19 liquid-fuel  strategic missiles of the 43d Missile Army's 46th Missile  Division, which are in a pre-malfunction state.    Special cars are bringing elements for Ukrainian nuclear  electric power stations to meet these trains.    According to information at the disposal of the editorial  office, at least some 200 strategic missile warheads are to be  removed from Ukrainian territory to Russian plants during the 10  months of this year. In return, Ukraine will receive by way of  compensation, as a first real step, 100 tonnes of slightly  enriched uranium in the form of those very fuel assemblies for  its nuclear power industry.    It is no coincidence that these March days have been  selected  to start the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian  territory. At the time the secret train crossed Russia's border  with specific weapons and headed deep into the country, toward  the plants where they will be dismantled and salvaged, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk was meeting with Bill Clinton. He had  something to report in Washington.    The trilateral Moscow accord is being fulfilled. This  attests that Kiev and Moscow are serious about the obligations  they have assumed.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL MAKE A HACKER HAPPY  </P> <P> I got a fax from Santa asking me to recommend gifts for computer users. I  suggested that he concentrate on accessories, games and reading material. It's  generally a bad idea to give expensive hardware or complicated business  software unless you know exactly what someone wants.  </P> <P> Before Santa does give software, he sends an elf to check out the equipment to  be sure everything is compatible. The elf makes a list (and checks it twice) of  all the equipment, including the disk drive (3 1/2- or 5 1/4-inch) and monitor.  </P> <P> As for what you can give your computer-user friends, I'll start with  accessories. A lot of people can use a "power strip" that allows them to plug  their PC, printer and other electrical devices into a single outlet. You can  get an inexpensive six-outlet power strip with an on-off switch at just about  any hardware store. Radio Shack and most computer dealers carry power strips  with built-in surge protectors. A surge protector filters out electrical  surges, or spikes, which could damage your computer.  </P> <P> Don't forget to check your local office supply store. That's where I found  several varieties of diskette holders (make sure you know whether to buy the 3  1/2- or 5 1/4-inch size) as well as colored disks and lots of other gadgets.  </P> <P> I also saw a number of useful accessories from Curtis Manufacturing. I liked  the Computer Tool Kit ($29.95), which comes with a variety of demagnetized  screw and nut drivers and a device to remove chips from computers. Other useful  Curtis products include a tilt-and-swivel monitor stand, a universal printer  stand to elevate your printer ($24.95) and a $6.95 clip that attaches to your  monitor and holds your papers. The company is at 30 Fitzgerald Drive, Jaffrey,  N.H. 03452.  </P> <P> I like giving and receiving books. If you're buying a gift for a Macintosh  user, consider "The Macintosh Bible," edited by Arthur Naiman (Goldstein &amp;  Blair, $28). It's an indispensable tool for those who want to get the most from  their Macs. It comes with a coupon for two free updates. If you can't find it  at a bookstore, you can order by phone (add $4 for shipping) at (415) 524-4000.  </P> <P> For the IBM PC user, consider "PC Magazine DOS Power Tools" by Paul Somerson  (Bantam Computer Books, $44.95). This 1,275-page colossus contains tips and  ideas, many compiled from the pages of PC Magazine. It comes with a disk full  of programs to help streamline your use of the PC.  </P> <P> As much as I hate to spoil the spirit of Christmas, it does come right before  tax season. So you might think about tax-preparation and financial  record-keeping programs. TurboTax ($75) from San Diego-based ChipSoft is the  leading tax program for the IBM PC, while MacInTax ($99) from Softview of  Oxnard dominates the Macintosh market.  </P> <P> For budgeting and financial record keeping I recommend Quicken ($59.95), which  runs on the PC, Macintosh and Apple II. Check your retailer for a special  Christmas "bundle" that includes the IBM version of Quicken, Turbo Tax and a  stock portfolio management program for $99.95. Macintosh Quicken, bundled with  MacInTax, costs $109.  </P> <P> I don't know a lot about computer games, so I sought the advice of Peter Spear,  author of a recently published book called "King's Quest Companion"  (Osborne/McGraw Hill, $14.95). The delightfully literate 360-page book  creatively provides tips to players of that popular game series from Sierra  On-Line.  </P> <P> For science fiction fans, Spear recommends Neuromancer, an animated adventure  game from Costa Mesa-based Interplay. There are versions for just about any  type of computer at prices ranging from $29 to $49. Interplay can be reached at  (714) 549-2411.  </P> <P> If you're inclined to run for mayor, why not practice on a simulator? Sim City  lets you create and run a modern city and solve problems related to taxes,  crime, disasters and monsters. It's available for the Mac, IBM PC, Amiga and  Commodore 64. List price is $49.95 for all versions except Commodore, which  sells for $29.95. A color version for the Mac II sells for $79.95. It's  published by Maxis Software of Moraga at (415) 376-6434.  </P> <P> If your friend is an Indiana Jones fan, you might consider giving Indiana Jones  and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure from the games division of  LucasFilm at (415) 662-1902. It costs $49.95 and runs on IBM compatibles, Amiga  and Atari ST computers.  </P> <P> Leisure Suit Larry 3 ($59.95) is the newest addition to the series about a  "lovable nerd and world-class lounge lizard." When the game opens, you play the  recently divorced Larry "out for pure carnal pleasure." Somewhere in the middle  you switch roles and become "passionate Patti." I'll leave the rest of the plot  up to your imagination. Don't ask me why, but the series is quite popular, even  among reasonably intelligent adults. It's published by Sierra On-Line and is  only for IBM compatibles.  </P> <P> Other versions are also available for the Mac, Atari ST, Amiga and Apple IIGS.  Sierra can be reached at (800) 326-6654.  </P> <P> Personal computers offer a safe alternative for those among us who enjoy  barnstorming or strafing villages. A host of flight simulation programs make it  possible to take the controls of everything from an early biplane to a modern  jet fighter. You can even fly an alien spacecraft by purchasing UFO ($49.95)  from SubLogic of Champaign, Ill., reachable at (800) 637-4983.  </P> <P> Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0 is one of the few flight games for people  interested in noncombat planes. Version 4.0 ($59.95) lets you fly a broad  variety of planes and even lets you create your own experimental aircraft. The  program runs only on IBM compatibles, but users of a Mac, Apple IIGS, Amiga or  Atari ST can take advantage of SubLogic's Flight Simulator program.  </P> <P> F-19 Stealth Fighter from MicroProse is Computer Gaming World magazine's  top-rated game. It allows you to conduct combat missions in the Mediterranean,  Middle East and Europe. The product runs only on the IBM PC and compatibles  ($69.95) and the Commodore 64 ($44.95). MicroProse can be reached at (301)  771-1151.  </P> <P> For a more realistic flight experience, consider getting your own "yoke" to  control the plane. The Maxx Yoke, which works with IBM and compatibles, lets  you steer your aircraft into 60-degree turns and even has its own thumb  controls to invoke your simulated guns. It can be ordered from the Tailwinds  Catalogue for $99.95 plus shipping. For some PCs, you will need to buy a game  port (available from Tailwinds for $49.95). Call them at (800) 992-7737.  </P> <P> If you're looking for more game ideas, check out a copy of Computer Gaming  World magazine at most major bookstores. A 1-year, 12-issue subscription costs  $24 and can be ordered by calling (800) 827-4450.  </P> <P> Davka Corp. has a couple of interesting Hanukkah gifts for Macintosh users.  HyperHanukkah ($39.95) is a HyperCard program that describes Hanukkah  traditions with graphics, sound and text. HyperHebrew (also $39.95) features  digitized sound to teach users to pronounce and identify Hebrew letters and  vowels. For information or a free catalogue, call (800) 621-8227.  </P> <P> Finally, there is one product that you don't even need a computer to enjoy. The  Chocolate Software Co. offers a full line of "eat-ware" that includes chocolate  diskettes and keyboards in a variety of configurations. The diskettes, whose  capacity is measured in calories rather than kilobytes, are bug free but loaded  with sugar. Call them at (213) 931-1527. Outside of California, dial (800)  332-BYTE.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIVALS ARE GIVING WESTERN UNION RUN FOR MONEY-BY-WIRE  </P> <P> A college student telephones his parents for cash to cover an overdrawn check.  A friend arrested in the dead of night calls for help in scraping up bail  money.  </P> <P> Within minutes, if you're willing to pay the price, you can wire financial aid  just as corporate deal-makers routinely transfer billions of dollars halfway  around the world.  </P> <P> Western Union Corp. remains the solid leader in this growing consumer  money-transfer business, although rivals are giving it a run for the money.  </P> <P> American Express Co., for example, introduced its MoneyGram service about 1 1/2  years ago. Smaller companies serve specific regions or groups ranging from  gamblers to truckers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Idea of Speed'  </P> <P> Commercial banks also wire money, and even the U.S. Postal Service is  considering a high-speed money order service.  </P> <P> "It's the whole idea of speed. Consumers rely more and more on getting things  done faster," said Jay Giesen, a vice president of marketing at the American  Express Information Services Co. subsidiary. "The consumer market has yet to be  fully tapped."  </P> <P> Trying to do just that, American Express just began its first advertising blitz  for the service recently. Like the company's pitch for traveler's checks, the  MoneyGram ads appeal to people's fears.  </P> <P> One shows a broke American teen-ager stranded on the steps of a European church  on a cold, stormy night. Another shows an elderly couple evidently distraught  over an unexpected financial hardship. A third shows a mother and daughter  stuck at a remote bus station.  </P> <P> Western Union, which has been in the money-transfer business since 1871, is  countering with a beefed-up ad campaign that includes a TV spot showing a  succession of mothers complaining about their children's spending habits. The  light-hearted ad includes a new toll-free number for sending money by phone.  </P> <P> All that competition could spell good news for harried, bargain-hunting  consumers who need to send or receive cash fast.  </P> <P> The cheapest and easiest way to gain access to emergency cash is through the  bank automated teller machine network, where fees on transactions range from 10  cents to $3. Many are free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Limits Cited  </P> <P> But one major problem with this system is that daily cash withdrawals usually  are limited to $200 to $500. Another drawback is that not everyone has an  automated bank card.  </P> <P> "There are still many households in this country that don't even have checking  accounts," said Western Union spokesman Warren R. Bechtel.  </P> <P> For them, the main way to send fast emergency cash, albeit expensive, is via  the transmission service. Many Western Union and American Express agents are  open 24 hours; their telephone numbers are available in the yellow pages.  </P> <P> Only Western Union allows customers to send money over the telephone, although  it tacks on an extra finance charge. American Express says it has no finance  charge, but all transactions must be done in person.  </P> <P> Western Union has a computerized network of 13,500 agents nationwide, including  many all-night convenience stores, supermarkets, hardware stores and hotels.  American Express has nearly 7,000 agents.  </P> <P> Western Union says it wired around $3 billion last year, with the average  transaction at $300. American Express doesn't release these figures but says  its volume has risen steadily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Convenience Costs  </P> <P> Both companies promise money will be available domestically at the receiving  agent within 15 minutes. MoneyGram, however, claims to offer more flexibility  about where the money can be picked up.  </P> <P> For these conveniences you must pay the price. Western Union and American  Express have graduated fee scales, where the more you send the less you pay  percentage-wise. But be careful: In some cases if you send a penny over the  limit you'll end up in the next bracket and pay a substantially higher fee.  </P> <P> For instance, it costs $12 to send up to $50 via Western Union, or 24% of the  principal amount. The fee rises to $14 for sending $50.01 to $100; to $21 for  $101.01 to $200; and to $27 for $300.01 to $400. The fee levels off at $3,000,  costing $105, or 3.5% of the principal amount. Above that each additional $500  or fraction thereof costs $20. Western Union says it doesn't limit the amount  of money that can be sent.  </P> <P> For the MoneyGram service, fees range from $9 for sending up to $50, or 18% of  the principal amount, to $330 for sending a maximum $10,000.  </P> <P> Wiring money from bank to bank is often much cheaper, with the sending bank  charging from $10 to $20, but this service is only available during banking  hours.  </P></p>

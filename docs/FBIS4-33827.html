			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Quito -- Police Chief Guido Nunez today resigned  from his post after finding himself in the midst of a corruption  scandal. Nunez, who was on leave for 60 days to facilitate the  investigations conducted by a presidential committee, has  reiterated that he is innocent but admitted that the scandal is  harming the police institution and for this reason he should  leave his post.    In announcing his resignation to reporters, Nunez said the  institution's image has been seriously damaged and this has  increased the agressiveness of criminals. In a noticeably  shaken voice, Nunez said: Because of this basic consideration  which is of an institutional and social-safety nature, I find  that I must withdraw from the General Command by submitting my  resignation.    The cabinet today discussed the resignation of the police  chief. A government spokesman has told REUTER that Nunez'  departure is a fact and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen will  appoint a new commander general before Monday.    Nunez, who is well known for his diligent struggle against  the underworld, has been accused of illegal acquisition of  wealth and abuse of power. The charges, which initially were  filed in mid-May against Nunez only, gradually were applied to  the entire police staff by Police Colonel Hector Estrella, who  exposed the scandal.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2331 GMT on 9 June in a similar  report adds: "Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has  appointed General Miguel Rosero as the new police commander."]</p>

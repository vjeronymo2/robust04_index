			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Personal View: The dangers of capital mobility The liberalisation of capital controls throughout the industrialised world is often seen solely as an advantage. However, all-out capital mobility is very far from being an unalloyed virtue. Explosive growth in international financial transactions has added sizeably to the risk of economic instability. Aided by modern technology and growth in areas like derivatives, these transactions have increased so much in speed, scope and complexity that they vastly exceed the level of international trade in goods and services. Untrammelled capital movements have been an important factor behind the two crises in the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 and July-August 1993. More generally, they can give rise to a dangerous political vacuum. It is no exaggeration to speak of an abdication of democracies in the face of anonymous, uncontrolled market forces. As Thomas Jefferson said, banks can be more dangerous than standing armies. Governments and central banks have a duty to respond to this challenge. The Maastricht treaty allows countries facing currency disturbances to reintroduce capital controls as a last resort. Such purely national measures are unlikely to be effective. However, governments should give thought to the idea of harmonised international controls to curb the activities of large-scale 'players' on the markets. Introducing EC-wide minimum reserves on banks' deposits or borrowings - a system already in force in Germany - would help control the process of money creation which often leads to speculative excess. Such a scheme could possibly be extended to other institutions. Additionally, a tax on speculative currency movements, suggested recently by several international economists, could have a stabilising effect. The advantages far outweigh the technical difficulties and perceived negative side-effects. Such a move would make speculators think twice before attacking defensive walls erected by central banks and elected governments. These measures could not be effective, however, if individual countries allowed their financial institutions to evade national or community-wide restrictions by switching activities to 'safe havens' and other off-shore centres. One important reason for considering preventative measures of this sort is because, when crises arise, the authorities are invariably at a great disadvantage. Markets react almost instantaneously to events and perceptions. But official steps to counter financial operators' collective excesses require time for preparation and co-ordination. Attempts to pre-empt monetary unrest through international co-operation  - above all, stability-orientated economic policies, and improved financial supervision - must be given priority. I support restoration of the previous narrow exchange rate mechanism bands, as well as, in due time, the return to the ERM of Britain and Italy. However, we need to understand that, with the August crisis, a fundamental change has taken place. EC finance ministers have postponed indefinitely any return to the narrow bands, while Britain, in particular, looks unlikely to rejoin the ERM for the foreseeable future. The vision of passing to a single currency before the end of the century has been replaced by the much more sober notion of trying to make the new flexible ERM work in a manner which buttresses non-inflationary growth. The ERM will still need protection from speculative attacks. To maintain realistic central rates, we need a somewhat modified application of the so-called Basle/Nyborg rules agreed in 1987. The main methods for maintaining currency stability should be intervention and interest rate measures, with the possibility of realignments held in reserve as a last resort - for the period after narrow bands have been re-established. Whether or not we one day have economic and monetary union, Europe, and the rest of the world, needs more monetary harmonisation. But governments must also assemble measures to steer the financial community away from anarchy. Such moves are in the best interests of all nations and, ultimately, of market participants. They are essential if we are to rebuild the economic confidence so badly bruised during the past year. The author, who was a member of the Bundesbank council and president of the Hamburg Landeszentralbank between 1982 and 1992, now teaches monetary and international economics at Hamburg university. He is the author of Monetary Policy in Europe after Maastricht (Macmillan, London, St Martin's Press, New York)</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Businessman to be Thai minister Thailand's new foreign minister, whose appointment was confirmed yesterday as part of a cabinet overhaul, is an unelected businessman whose corporate involvements are prompting criticism that he is vulnerable to conflicts of interest. Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, 45, is one of the country's wealthiest and most dynamic businessmen. His telecommunications empire has thrived on his ability to win government contracts and franchises, and is expanding rapidly in Thailand and the region. He has been appointed because Mr Chamlong Srimuang, founder of the Palang Dharma (Buddhist force) party, has risked seeing his political creation break apart by replacing all of his party's 11 ministers in an attempt to boost its popularity. The five coalition parties are permitted to fill their cabinet allocations largely as they see fit. Mr Vichit Surapongchai, former president of Bangkok Bank, picks up the important transport and communications portfolio; this has caused less comment because he is seen as a professional business manager brought in to deal with a specialist field. Mr Chamlong himself takes up formal political office - as a deputy prime minister - for the first time since he was swept into power as a corruption-fighting governor of Bangkok in the 1980s. There are worries that Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, will have to use all his diplomatic skills to prevent the unpredictable Mr Chamlong driving the five-party coalition into crisis as he tries to score political points over this government's final two years of its term. Mr Thaksin has resigned as chairman of his Shinawatra group in favour of his wife. But each retains 25 per cent of the holding company, Shinawatra Computer &amp; Communications, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.58bn). 'If we interpret the constitution by the letter of the law, he is OK. But the spirit of the law is that you don't want a person to hold high position in order to benefit from it. This is a problem that could explode at any time,' said Prof Likhit Dhiravegindra of Thammasat University's political science faculty. Mr Thaksin's predecessor as foreign minister, the former intelligence chief Mr Prasong Soonsiri, is believed to be both furious and vengeful after being dumped by his party leader for a fresh face.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to The Star" by Bilal Hijawi] </F>   [Text] Eight Jordanian transport and clearance agents have  protested to the Minister of Transport over a recent Iraqi  transport measures, which they say threatens to destroy the  Jordanian land transport sector.    In a letter sent to the minister early March, the agents  said  the Iraqi Ministry of Transport had canceled all land transport  contracts with Jordanian companies as of the beginning of  January, once these contracts expired. The agents said while  this measure was not officially announced, it was effectively  enforced.    The measure, the agents said, is aimed at limiting all land  transport contract rights, from Jordan to Iraq, to one  Jordanian-registered company, the Iraq-Jordan Land Transport Co.  (IJLTC)    The agents said they were informed of the new policy when  they attempted to renew their bank gurantees with the Iraqi  government one month before their expiration. Under the new  measure IJLTC, a private shareholding company, will be the sole  party authorized to issue Iraqi manifests in accordance with  Iraqi laws. That authority had until last year rested with the  Iraqi Ministry of Transport.    "IJLTC is thus given total authority as a legal department  representing Iraqi government interests in Jordan," Mr. Uthman  'Azir, of the Orient Maritime Services (OMS), told THE STAR.    Another regulation names the State Enterprise of Land  Transport in al-'Aqabah as the sole agent for Iraqi imports  through Jordan. It will be responsible for securing clearances  and transport of cargo to Iraq.</p>

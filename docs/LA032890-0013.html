			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. JUDGE IS URGED TO REJECT LATEST PLEA BY KILLER HARRIS;  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY: STATE CONTENDS THAT THE APPEAL OFFERS NO VALID REASON TO DELAY  THE CONDEMNED KILLER'S SCHEDULED TUESDAY EXECUTION.  </P> <P> The state's lawyers urged a San Diego federal judge Tuesday to deny Robert  Alton Harris' latest appeal, saying there is no valid legal reason to postpone  next Tuesday's scheduled execution of the condemned killer.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office claims that Harris failed to offer anything  in his new appeal that would suggest he was not fairly sentenced to die for the  1978 killings of two San Diego teen-agers.  </P> <P> "Payment for crimes is long overdue," the state's lawyers said in legal papers  filed late Tuesday asking U. S. District Judge William B. Enright in San Diego  to "put an end to this case."  </P> <P> Enright is scheduled to preside today at a hearing on Harris' new appeal. If  Enright denies the appeal -- he has turned down Harris twice -- Harris must  turn to the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the San Francisco-based  appellate court that serves nine Western states and Guam.  </P> <P> Harris' case has progressed further through the court system than any of the  other more than 270 prisoners' cases on Death Row. His execution would be the  first in California in 23 years.  </P> <P> Harris' sole hope for reprieve lies with the federal courts because last week  he withdrew a request that Gov. George Deukmejian consider clemency -- that is,  commuting his death sentence to life in prison. The state courts repeatedly  have denied his pleas for mercy.  </P> <P> The U. S. Supreme Court has rejected Harris' appeals four times, most recently  Jan. 16.  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court affirmed Harris' death sentence in 1981. On March  16, the state Supreme Court turned down a new appeal that Harris' San Diego  attorneys, Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe, filed Jan. 5.  </P> <P> The federal appeal, filed Monday, essentially sets forth the same arguments  that failed to persuade the state Supreme Court to spare the 37-year-old  Harris.  </P> <P> In the latest appeal, defense attorneys contend that new psychiatric evidence  shows that Harris suffered from a variety of mental disorders that played a  part in the killings. It would be unfair to execute Harris because those  conditions were not taken into account when he was sentenced, the defense  attorneys said.  </P> <P> Among the ailments, defense attorneys said, is post-traumatic stress disorder,  the condition usually associated with combat.  </P> <P> The effect of the disorders is that Harris is driven by impulses that, on July  5, 1978, fed on one another uncontrollably, driving each sequence in the  killings of Michael Baker and John Mayeski, defense attorneys said.  </P> <P> Harris killed both 16-year-old boys after stealing their car for use in a bank  robbery. He abducted them from a fast-food parking lot where they had just  ordered lunch. Later, he ate their half-finished hamburgers.  </P> <P> Responding Tuesday to the defense claims, the state attorney general's office  said Harris "knew precisely what he was doing when he kidnaped, robbed and  killed those boys and when he robbed the bank."  </P> <P> Harris killed the teen-agers because he couldn't afford witnesses, the state's  lawyers said. When he robbed the bank, he pointed his gun at the teller and  told him not to call security or he would be killed, they said.  </P> <P> In addition, the prosecutors said, the evidence was not newly discovered.  </P> <P> Harris' mental state in 1978 has been available for study since 1978, they  said. No one knows if the labels placed on Harris' mental state now are any  different from those attached at the time of the 1979 trial because there are  no reports from the defense psychiatrists, they said.  </P> <P> Perhaps, they added, the doctors who examined Harris 11 years ago considered  whether Harris exhibited symptoms of conditions such as post-traumatic stress  disorder, but rejected those diagnoses and, instead, concluded -- as the  state's expert did -- that Harris was a psychopath.  </P> <P> As for Harris' "supposed inability" to control his impulsive and violent  behavior, that contention is inconsistent with some 20 sworn statements  recently filed in his appeal by friends, prison guards and other inmates, the  state's lawyers said.  </P> <P> All those statements attest to Harris' "warm and caring nature as well as his  ability to control himself," the prosecutors said.  </P> <P> The danger in Harris' new appeal, the prosecutors said, is that it represents  nothing more than an abuse of the legal processes and is bound to cause  disrespect for the courts among a frustrated public.  </P> <P> This new appeal is Harris' "19th bite at the apple," they said, meaning it was  the 19th time -- not counting pretrial review -- that state or federal courts  have considered Harris' claims. "The apple is long since consumed and justice  long overdue," they said.  </P></p>

Chairman of the HZDS deputies group Tibor Cabaj commented on  it as follows: "I doubt they are from our group because the HZDS  leadership adopted a resolution, whereby in the case of the  dismissal of the government we would turn into opposition."    Cabaj said he could not rule out that this could happen.  These deputies should reconsider their further HZDS membership.  It is undignified to wait for expulsion, he said.    It is the duty of the SDL to join the provisional  government,  regardless of its composition, said Weiss. But it will be,  indeed, a temporary government because the SDL feels very  strongly about early elections, Weiss added.    Anton Hrnko, a deputy for the National Democratic Club said:  "I believe that Vladimir Meciar will keep his written promise he  gave to his daughter that if he is dismissed for the second  time, he will never return to politics."</p>

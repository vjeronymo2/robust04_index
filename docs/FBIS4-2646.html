			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- China's capital city of  Beijing will step up its infrastructural construction this year,  Mayor Li Qiyan said Friday [8 April].    It plans to earmark 12.5 billion yuan to boost the  development of several major projects including water, heat and  electricity supply and highways, Li said at a meeting of the  municipal people's congress.    Li said that the city's total investment in infrastructure  reached 10.36 billion yuan last year, a sturdy 76.2 percent rise  from the year 1992.    A number of major projects such as the expressway leading to  the capital airport, the eastern section of the third ring  highway and part of the Beijing-Shijiazhuang Expressway have  already opened to traffic, he said.    It also added another length of 61.6 kilometers of highways  and 15 flyovers last year, he said.    In addition, the first phase of a large sewage treatment  plant with a disposal capacity of 500,000 tons of waste water  has been put into trial operation.    The mayor said that emphasis of the infrastructural  construction this year will also be placed on improvement of the  housing conditions of the city dwellers.    He said the total floor space to be built this year is  expected to surpass 6.5 million square meters that will house  95,000 residents. At the same time, efforts will be made to  rebuild or repair the shabby and dangerous houses.    Over six million square meters of houses were built last  year, making the total housing built over the past 15 years  adding up to 110 million square meters, he added.    The official said that the average living space per capita  of  the urban people has now increased to 12.5 square meters while  that of the farmers in the suburban area is 23.7 square meters.</p>

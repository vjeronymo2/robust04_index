			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / France unveils first N-carrier: Europeans can develop their own means of security, says Mitterrand It was a weekend of false starts on historic projects for President Francois Mitterrand. On Friday he helped Queen Elizabeth open the Channel Tunnel which then promptly closed. A day later, he went to Brest to 'launch' France's, and Europe's, first-nuclear powered aircraft carrier, but the Charles de Gaulle stayed firmly in dry dock. If five months seems a long wait to use the Chunnel, spare a thought for the impatient French navy which will have to wait another five years, until summer 1999, before their Charles de Gaulle is fully fitted out with all its weaponry and Rafale jets. What the navy had to be content with on Saturday was a Christo-like wrapping-up of the carrier's hull and its conning tower in the tricolour, and then the ceremonial 'undressing' of the carrier in the presence of Mr Mitterrand, and three of the people who would like to succeed him as president - Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Paris mayor Jacques Chirac and the defence minister, Francois Leotard. The carrier's real launch will take place out of the limelight in a week or so when tide and weather are judged right, because the navy wants to take no risks with the ship which has cost FFr17.5bn (Pounds 2bn) so far, not counting an even more expensive bill for the Rafales. Ironically, timing of the launch of this ship, symbol of France's we-depend-on-no-one sovereignty, is very much dictated by a Dutch salvage company, which can only spare for a brief time its giant barge crane to lift the nuclear propulsion reactors into the carrier. But the 38,000 tonne carrier will be worth the wait. 'European navies have some 200 frigates between them, but only ours has true aircraft carriers', said Mr Mitterrand, adding that 'by preserving this, France will assure its place in a future European navy.' Though less than half the size of their US counterparts, French carriers are the only European ones capable of putting heavy aircraft into the air ever since Britain opted for the Invincible class of mini-carrier with their acrobatic Harriers. But France's Foch and Clemenceau carriers (32,000 tonnes) have each seen more than 30 years' service, and cannot take the heavier, 15-20 tonne version of the Rafale fighter/bomber coming into service at the end of this century. Equally significant are France's unrelenting ambitions for its own defence and that of Europe - shared as much by the socialist president as by the conservative Balladur government - and the new importance it places on crisis prevention and power projection, which are classic rationales for aircraft carriers. 'There is no reason why 350m Europeans cannot develop together their own means of security,' said Mr Mitterrand. But co-operation involves concessions, he told an audience of several thousand which included Admiral Sir Kenneth Eaton, Comptroller of the Royal Navy. Referring to the Horizon project in which France, Britain and Italy hope to build a dozen or so frigates together, the president said France's Horizon-class frigates would be the essential escort to the Charles de Gaulle. But he warned of 'industrial difficulties' which were preventing the project getting off the ground. French officials said defence ministers of the three countries were delaying signing a formal memorandum of understanding until an Anglo-Italian dispute over radar had been resolved. Italy is offering the completed Empar system, but the UK claims its Mesar system would be better.</p>

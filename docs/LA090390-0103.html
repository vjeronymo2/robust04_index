			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: MANUFACTURING NEW BUSINESS;  </P> <P> PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC CHIEF SAYS ITS GROWTH WILL CONTINUE;  </P> <P> EDGAR S.BROWER  </P> <P> Like many manufacturers nationwide, traditional labor-intensive manufacturers  in Orange County are having a tougher time keeping costs down and competing  with businesses outside the region, especially those in offshore countries.  </P> <P> In the coming year, with weaker defense spending and a possible national  recession, manufacturers will have to work harder than ever to keep jobs in the  county.  </P> <P> Chapman College economist James Doti expects the county to show a slight  decline in manufacturing jobs in 1990 for the first time, though at least one  other report is forecasting an increase.  </P> <P> One Orange County manufacturer that seems to be prospering despite the tough  going is Pacific Scientific Corp. in Newport Beach, an aerospace and industrial  instruments maker that has recovered from heavy losses in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> The company has succeeded by diversifying its product mix away from defense in  the past five years, says Edgar S. Brower, chairman and chief executive of  Pacific Scientific, a 30-year veteran in the manufacturing industry.  </P> <P> Before joining Pacific Scientific as chief executive in 1985, he was corporate  group vice president at Allied Signal Corp. and president of Allied Electronic  Components Co., a $12-billion subsidiary. From 1972 to 1977, Brower was  assistant postmaster general of the United States.  </P> <P> In April, Harry R. Goff retired as chairman of the Newport Beach firm, and  Brower assumed the additional title of chairman.  </P> <P> The company, which has 1,800 employees, reported second-quarter earnings of  $1.8 million on sales of $46.9 million, recording its highest quarterly  earnings in five years.  </P> <P> The company's backlog of orders is about $100 million, and its dependence on  defense-related products has declined from 30% in 1989 to 25% in 1990.  </P> <P> In an interview with Times staff writer Dean Takahashi, Brower talked about how  a small-to-medium-sized manufacturer can survive in today's economic climate.  </P> <P> Q. Can you describe what Pacific Scientific does?  </P> <P> A. Pacific Scientific is involved in two broad markets: aerospace and  industrial. We're very diversified within those markets. We're just under $200  million in sales and so could be considered a medium-sized company that is  fairly typical of Orange County. We have one plant in Yorba Linda with 200  employees, but most of our manufacturing is done in the Midwest, East Coast or  offshore. Within this diversified framework, we make small-cost, proprietary  products. About 25% of our aerospace work is military and the rest is  commercial. In the military products, that same technology is usually used in  industrial applications. We're very mindful of the world trend to less military  spending, which isn't all that new. That trend was foreseeable even before the  changes in the East Bloc.  </P> <P> Q. What are some of the products you make?  </P> <P> A. We are a leading manufacturer of fire-suppression equipment, and we're  developing fire-detection equipment. In Yorba Linda we make restraint systems,  or seat belts, for pilots in both military and commercial airlines. We make  high-speed power generators and power supplies for torpedoes, missiles and the  internal workings of aircraft. We're one of the major suppliers of DC motors  and controls, a fast-emerging market in the last 10 years. We're the major  supplier and have a leadership position in making light switches that go on the  top of street lights, and turn them on and off automatically in the morning and  at night. We make energy-saving devices for utilities and instruments that  indicate where there are faults in underground utility equipment. Historically,  we were strong in the snubber business, or control and shock absorption in  pipes in the nuclear energy industry.  </P> <P> Q. What is the firm's history?  </P> <P> A. It's a very old company founded in 1919 as a distribution company. It  started out as a West Coast distributor of electronic widgets for the emerging  airplane industry and made things like the magneto (the ignition generator) for  the Spirit of St. Louis (the plane that Charles A. Lindbergh flew across the  Atlantic in 1927). The company diversified in the 1940s and got into a whole  range of businesses. In the 1970s, it got into the restraint business, or  elaborate seat belts such as sophisticated systems for jet pilots. It sounds  really mundane, but it is a very technical, precise business.  </P> <P> Q. When did the company take on its current character?  </P> <P> A. In the late 1970s. At that time, the snubber business took the company from  the $20-million range to the $80-million range. It was very profitable and it  was strong with the creation of the nuclear energy industry throughout the  United States. But it collapsed in the early 1980s and so did the profits. When  I came to the company in mid-1985, it was suffering from that change of  technology and collapse of its highest-volume product line. We made some  acquisitions and changed our strategy to emphasize the industrial side instead  of military. We've very healthy and immune as any company to the current  economic trends. All of the things happening in the economy now are short-term  things that were predictable in the long term.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think we're in a national recession?  </P> <P> A. I don't think there's any doubt about it. We're seeing it in our markets  that have capital goods involved, such as in selling motors to the automation  industry. We're seeing a definite chilling in which customers are not canceling  orders but are watching their inventory. Is it a deep recession? No. Are we in  a slowdown? Yes. It started about the fourth quarter of last year. We're  shielded somewhat in military aerospace, where we have a three-year backlog.  Our commercial airline business is strong and isn't seeing a recession. Our  utility business hasn't slackened yet. The only two businesses that are  affected are our motors and controls business and the particle detection  business, where we build contamination-detection equipment for manufacturing  clean rooms.  </P> <P> Q. Whether you're shielded or not, you are probably making changes to adapt to  the economic environment.  </P> <P> A. We think we're leading Orange County companies in adapting. We really have  to organize around what I call our value chain. How are you going to satisfy  the customer? That is what you have to organize around. Any company that  doesn't and is still divided into separate departments like engineering and  research and development probably isn't going to be in business five years from  now. We started a transition to focus around a satisfied customer five years  ago. You have to give them a quality product when they want it. We adopted what  are commonly called world-class manufacturing concepts, such as just-in-time  manufacturing and rapid-cycle manufacturing.  </P> <P> Q. Can you explain those concepts?  </P> <P> A. Just-in-time theory is aimed at satisfying the customer. To do that, you  have to be very flexible in your delivery. You can't have a lot of inventory  because the inventory requirements could change very quickly with a customer's  changing needs. I order only the inventory I need for firm orders, and I can  respond quickly. Instead of building big batches of orders, we now try to build  one piece at a time as ordered. We arrange to make long-term commitments to our  suppliers and let them know how we need to be flexible. If everybody in the  chain adopts the concept, we can all respond very quickly to changing world  markets. This is mainly credited to the Japanese, but we taught it to them and  now it's coming back to us. Rapid cycle is the same thing. Instead of having a  lead-time on products stretching out to six months, we should be able to build  a product in two days. We focus on eliminating all time that isn't devoted to  enhancing the product. When I came here, we were delivering motors and controls  in 18 weeks. Now we have a standard lead-time of two weeks from scratch. To do  this, you have to organize differently. Instead of having an engineering  department, you have cells of people with representatives from each department,  such as marketing and engineering, and they live for one particular customer or  product. In some of our factories, we make a room for a customer and paint  their logo in the area to let them know that it is dedicated to them.  </P> <P> Q. Orange County's manufacturing base seems to be shrinking, with some  companies moving out of the county and some just shutting down. What is the  problem?  </P> <P> A. I think it's a trend all over the United States right now, with companies  going out of business because they haven't made the changes that we just talked  about. The one problem that Orange County has, if not Southern California, is  that the cost of infrastructure is very high. It's very hard for direct-labor  people to find satisfactory living conditions. Housing affordability is down so  low that about 19% of the population can afford to buy a house. It's very hard  to attract a direct-labor force with that kind of infrastructure cost. Those  things have a way of balancing out when you talk about the worldwide  competition. There will be fluctuations, and Southern California remains very  entrepreneurial with strong start-up rates. Q. What about environmental  restrictions imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District?  </P> <P> A. I think California leads the way in progressive changes in the world and  there is a value to that. I hope environmentalists, in considering the  worldwide competitive market, will show restraint in their timing. Their goals  are very laudable, but we have to keep in mind that we have to compete with and  evolve with the rest of the world. There will be some times when we will be out  of sync, but it won't be that big a factor.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think that the defense layoffs in Southern California could make a  recession here worse than what might happen in the rest of the country?  </P> <P> A. I don't think so because the defense industry is so diversified. California  has a strong balance of industries, too. There are a lot of major corporations  here and very few of them are totally military. Most of them are a combination  of military and commercial aerospace, which is still strong.  </P> <P> Q. How much will the high-tech industries be able to absorb the defense  layoffs?  </P> <P> A. I don't know. You would have to look at start-up rates and employment rates.  We have always had a lower unemployment rate than the rest of the country and a  good entrepreneurial spirit. I see no trends to change that. We also have a  very high-age profile because of the climate. As that group starts to retire at  a faster rate, that will also put a great demand on new employment. I think  also there's a real question about the area's regional product, when you have  these defense layoffs, that they are really a small part of the total  population of the state. When we read announcements that 17,000 people are  going to be laid off at Douglas Aircraft Co., that sounds like big numbers. But  it's a very small percent of the jobs in the state. Through our own fears and  our media we tend to greatly exaggerate those events.  </P> <P> Q. You said Pacific Scientific is diversifying away from defense now. It seems  almost every defense company is doing that. Is there a smart way and a bad way  to do it?  </P> <P> A. Obviously the best way to do it, and the way that we've been doing it, is to  multi-use the technologies. Take our restraint systems, where we have a  leadership position in military aircraft. We've used that same technology and  know-how in the commercial cockpit and the passenger seats. We apply the same  principle in our fire suppression and detection business, with modifications  that are appropriate. We stayed out of technologies where you can't work both  sides of the street.  </P> <P> Q. Is there anything you're advocating on a national policy level that would  help manufacturing?  </P> <P> A. You can't have federal and trade deficits go on forever. The quicker one  addresses those problems, the less chance it will have of being a depressing  influence in your markets. So we feel Congress and the President really need to  address that. Not in one day, but they clearly must address the problem. If you  look at the rest of the world, such as in the East Bloc, you see they will need  a tremendous amount of capital to develop. We must help them get that capital  if we are to sell our technologies in their markets. In China, India and  Western Europe, they will also need capital. We've been generating and using  capital ourselves for so long, but the rest of the world must develop if we are  to avoid economic chaos. We have to have a much stronger energy conservation  and development program than we now have because those are the two areas the  rest of the world will soon need.  </P> <P> Q. To what extent will Pacific Scientific's sales growth follow the health of  the economy?  </P> <P> A. If you look at our markets, in utilities it is almost countercyclical. As  the economy tightens, the utilities try to conserve and therefore tend to want  devices we sell. In military aerospace, we're in low research areas of the  business. They will always need seat belts, power supplies and missile devices.  That will follow the perception of threat in the world. Our only areas that are  susceptible to economic trends are our instrument business and our particle  detection business. But in developing today's new products, most research  companies need clean-room environments and that is what our particle-detection  business serves. If you look at the world's needs, I don't think the recession  will last long. I would be surprised if we're still in a downturn by the end of  1991 because the world markets will drive growth. Since we are worldwide  manufacturers, we'll participate.  </P> <P> Q. What kind of growth does Pacific Scientific expect in the next year?  </P> <P> A. We expect moderate growth, certainly better than the rate of inflation. If  the economy doesn't pick up by the end of 1991, the growth will be only  slightly better than inflation.  </P> <P> Q. What hiring requirements will you have?  </P> <P> AThey won't change much. The implementing of world-class manufacturing concepts  means we've cut out wasteful activities and so we have less need for new  people. We've taken care of those cuts through attrition. We have become more  efficient and so won't need to hire large numbers of people.  </P> <P> Q. Do you see most other manufacturing companies doing the same?  </P> <P> A. Yes. I think the biggest labor changes will occur in the service industries  as they apply the principles of efficient operations to their own work forces.  That will probably lead to big changes in Orange County, where companies in the  service industry become more competitive by applying just-in-time and  rapid-cycle principles.  </P> <P> Q. What are your thoughts on Japanese competition in manufacturing?  </P> <P> A. I think the Japanese have done two things in manufacturing that have made  them dominate the media. Through their government, they have taken a very  long-term approach in manufacturing. Their cost of capital is far lower, up  maybe 2% in the last 10 years compared to 10% in the United States. You can't  compete in a world market with those kinds of differentials. They said they  would capture electronics by investing in world-class manufacturing concepts  and being very innovative. They also did a very good public relations job of  selling the quality of their products. Over the next 10 years they will have a  difficult time matching the growth of the last decade.  </P></p>

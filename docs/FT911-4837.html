			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Labour drops N-arms stand: Draft election manifesto marks final phase of shift to centre ground MR NEIL Kinnock abandoned the last vestiges of his party's support for unilateral nuclear disarmament yesterday as Labour launched its draft manifesto for the general election. The shift, designed to defuse defence as an issue in the election campaign, came at the launch of a 27,000-word policy document promising to combine economic prudence with a comprehensive programme to 'modernise' Britain. The Labour document, entitled 'Opportunity Britain' to emphasise its claim to what is becoming the political slogan of the 1990s, marks the final stage in the party's shift into the centre-ground of politics. In an attempt to refute Conservative charges that Labour would negotiate away Britain's deterrent in return for a fraction of the Soviet nuclear force, Mr Kinnock said: 'We have at no stage . . . made a commitment to getting rid of all nuclear weapons for as long as others have them'. A commitment to revolutionise education and training is put at the heart of a strategy which Mr Kinnock said would provide a 'commonsense lead into a better future'. The document stresses that Labour's spending plans - from those on education and the NHS to those needed to meet pledges to encourage industrial investment - will be met only when economic growth permits. Mr Kinnock said those on average earnings would not be hit by Labour's intention to raise the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and to increase the top rate of tax to 50 per cent. Labour also set out in detail its plan for a radical restructuring of government decisions on public spending and taxation. In an attempt to prevent a pay explosion wrecking its plans for increased investment in industry and in education and the health service, it plans to wrap public spending decisions into the annual Budget. This will follow a 'National Economic Assessment' when employers and unions will be invited to assess what the country can 'afford' - implying that excessive awards would trigger tough decisions on tax and public spending.

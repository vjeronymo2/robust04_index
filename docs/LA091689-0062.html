			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIBLE IS REAL PAGE-TURNER AT SOVIET FAIR  </P> <P> Two lines of eager Soviet citizens stretched on either side of famous American  atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair's booth at the Moscow International Book Fair,  but no one stopped to browse through her anti-religious literature. O'Hair  herself, in fact, was taking a snooze.  </P> <P> In one queue, about 75 people waited for their turns to flip through Jewish  religious and cultural books. In the other, about 150 people stood, hoping to  get a free New Testament Bible.  </P> <P> It was a turn of events in this officially atheistic state that did not please  O'Hair, a flamboyant 70-year-old non-believer who took her views to the Supreme  Court and in 1963 won a decision eliminating obligatory prayer in public  schools.  </P> <P> "I am completely stunned to find out the U.S.S.R. is absolutely indifferent to  atheism," she said, shaking herself awake to talk to a journalist and quickly  warming to her subject.  </P> <P> "They seemed to think here that if you just leave religion alone, it will go  away. But that's ridiculous," she fumed, slapping her knee. "The Pope is never  going to call me up and say, 'Madalyn, I give up.' No, he won't do that. You  have to fight religion, actively show people why religion is so dangerous."  </P> <P> It was a message preached with feeling, but there were few takers at the book  fair. O'Hair's Russian-speaking translator, intended to help Soviets with  questions, sat idly on a chair and listened while O'Hair talked.  </P> <P> Nearby, Soviet police helped control crowds at the Jewish and Christian  literature booths.  </P> <P> The 7th Moscow International Book Fair -- which opened this week and is  traditionally monitored by foreigners looking for Soviet trends -- was as clear  a sign as any of the revival of religious freedom and interest in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> It is a revival tolerated and even encouraged by President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, whose mother is said to regularly attend church and who has publicly  acknowledged that he was baptized as a child.  </P> <P> Glasnost, the Russian word for Gorbachev's policy of permitting greater  openness, was in plentiful evidence at the fair, which will close Sunday after  a five-day run.  </P> <P> Among the books on display from 65 countries was one by former Soviet Jewish  dissident Natan Sharansky about his years in Soviet prisons, and one by  American hard-liner Zbigniew Brzezinski called "The Great Failure -- Birth and  Death of Communism in the 20th Century."  </P> <P> But the religious booths drew the biggest crowds, and it was there that the  sense of new possibilities was the greatest.  </P> <P> The distribution of 10,000 free Bibles at the Moscow fair was a first. "We  finally felt the time was right and no one would get in trouble for it," said  Doug Ross, executive editor of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Assn.,  based in Tempe, Ariz.  </P> <P> And even though the Assn. of Jewish Publishers, based in New York City, has had  a booth since the first fair in 1977, "this time the crowds are larger than  ever," said the group's president, Charles Donald Lieber. "I guess people are  less afraid with every passing year to be seen demonstrating an interest in  religion."  </P> <P> Both Ross and Lieber said Soviet customs officials, who in the past have  carefully inspected and often confiscated their religious literature, this time  generally let whole cartons of books pass unexamined.  </P> <P> Most of the books were not for sale to individuals but instead were intended to  attract publishers and distributors. People still stood in long lines just for  the chance to finger a book.  </P> <P> The Bible giveaway was the fair's biggest draw. Vera Kaprolov, 69, was among  those who stood in line for more than two hours but still missed out on a  chance to get a free Bible. She handed in her name and address, hoping to get  one of the 15,000 Bibles the evangelical publishers have promised to mail.  </P> <P> "I'm Jewish, but the New Testament is better than nothing," she explained. "In  the past, I've been able to read a few fragments of the Bible, but that is  all."  </P> <P> "The Bible is the best-selling book in the world, and this line convinces us  that if it were available here, it would be the Soviet Union's best seller,"  Ross said.  </P> <P> "One man begged me for a Bible, but I didn't have any more for that day, so I  had to say no," he said. "He looked me in the eyes and said, in English, 'Maybe  you will remember me.' "  </P> <P> "I think that's important," Ross added. "We should all remember him. We in the  United States, where everybody has got a Bible on the shelf, have got to  remember that in the Soviet Union, there are many people who can't see a Bible,  hold a Bible, read a Bible."  </P></p>

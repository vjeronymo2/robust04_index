Containment conditions for experiments in which DNA from Class 5 agents is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes shall be determined by NIH/ORDA following a case-by-case review. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections V&hyph;R and V&hyph;T). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;3. Experiments Involving the Use of Infectious Animal or Plant DNA or RNA Viruses or Defective Animal or Plant DNA or RNA Viruses in the Presence of Helper Virus in Tissue Culture Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Caution: Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment levels for experiments which are likely to either enhance the pathogenicity (e.g., insertion of a host oncogene) or to extend the host range (e.g., introduction of novel control elements) of viral vectors under conditions that permit a productive infection. In such cases, serious consideration should be given to increasing physical containment by at least one level.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Recombinant DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, which contain less than two&hyph;thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V&hyph;Q) being considered identical (see Section V&hyph;S), are considered defective and may be used in the absence of helper under the conditions specified in Section III&hyph;D&hyph;1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;3&hyph;a.

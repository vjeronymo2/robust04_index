			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / 'Cracks are appearing in the alliance's cohesion' ONE OF Germany's most senior diplomats, Baron Hermann von Richthofen, ambassador to Nato and a former ambassador in London, sent a sharp message to his government last week warning that the political ties that bind the allies in Nato were breaking. The message was sent after the US decided to stop policing the UN arms embargo on the warring parties in Bosnia, but before criticism of the French and British role in Bosnia by Mr Robert Dole, incoming majority leader of the US Senate. Extracts from the ambassador's message, printed here in full, first appeared yesterday in the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, and reflect particular concern in Europe about perceived new policy priorities in the US Cracks are appearing in the cohesion of the alliance. The most recent example concerns the last few days' irritation - scarcely possible to play down even to the outside world - over the unilateral US decision to modify its participation in the joint Nato-WEU operation 'Sharp Guard'. Relations between UN allies and Nato in the Bosnia and Hercegovina conflict, already complicated and tense, have become definitely problematic as a result of national decisions of the US in its capacity as the leading power in both organisations. The real strain for (Nato) cohesion must be expected in the event of unilateral US support for the Bosnian military or a lifting of the arms embargo, either through US action to force a decision in the UN Security Council, or through unilateral action. Such measures would lead to escalation of the conflict and raise the question in a concrete fashion of the protection or withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping troops deployed by alliance countries. This would demand from the alliance an engagement of a completely new form, to which precisely the US up to now has been unable to commit itself. During the last decades the cohesion of the transatlantic alliance has been imperative and undisputed. It also held its ground during the political changes of the last years. Today, individual alliance partners or groups have greater freedom to push through their interests, and Nato is instrumentalised for this purpose. (Here we should not forget that the issue which keeps the US and its European alliance partners apart, namely the Bosnia conflict, also binds them in another context, above all through the contact group). As a result we see a blurring of the partners' stance that was previously held and determined jointly. A joint effort from all partners is needed to tackle this task, for no partner can be interested in weakening the alliance. Individual problems: 1. It has proved impossible to sweep away, even for outside observers, the irritation in the last week over the unilateral US decision concerning the Nato-WEU Mediterranean operation Sharp Guard. Internally, the US action has left clear traces which have been particularly durable in the case of France, but have also caused mistrust and concern among other partners. France is accusing the US of de facto non-enforcement of surveillance of the arms embargo, and is demanding a comprehensive evaluation of all embargo infringements at sea, on land and in the air, in the apparent expectation that this will show the unreliability of the US. The speedily held foreign ministers meeting of France, Britain, and Russia - in other words without the contact group partners US and Germany - may be seen as direct reaction to the recent US action. Moreover, the US government has been apparently consulting in the meantime with Congress over massive support for Bosnian government troops and a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. It is above all the possible lifting of the arms embargo, which would have far-reaching political and military consequences, that would bring the cohesion of the alliance to its limits. The US, as a country without ground troops in Bosnia, stands along with Turkey for more robust action by the alliance (ie air strikes against the Serbian side), in spite of the doubts this would raise for withdrawal of Unprofor. Those countries that supply ground troops go along with this idea on paper, but naturally stress the priority of safeguarding their peacekeepers on the ground. They also underline in this regard the principles of dual decision-making and the need to keep action appropriate to objectives - whereby they stress the importance of keeping political control in the hands of the United Nations. This dilemma of the alliance would break out into the open should, as a result of a lifting of the embargo, a worsening of the situation force peacekeepers to be withdrawn and fighting troops to be sent from Nato members for their protection. 2. In addition to this, unilateral changes in US policies towards the ex-Soviet Union and eastern Europe since the Nato summit in January directly affect the alliance. There was an abandonment at short notice, without any consultation, of the 'Russia First' concept. The same happened to the question of treating the expansion of Nato as a process and as part and parcel of development of European security. This need not per se be regretted. However, if the US on the one hand promotes a robust continuation of Partnership for Peace, but if on the other hand the concept is described by parts of the administration as 'inadequate' and 'oversold' after a few months, then this part of alliance policy ends up being discredited. The programme is in danger of being obsolete already, especially for the countries it is meant to help. Now the US is applying political pressure for more speed in the expansion question, without paying attention to how this affects internal alliance positions on eastern policies as well as the military and financial consequences. The US administration sees itself under pressure as a result of the (mid-term) elections. It appears almost as if it is looking at presenting a new Nato in the US as an alternative to not being able to hold Nato at all. Pressure for rapid Russian expansion appears to be in tune with the anti-Russian line of the Republican right; it is doubtful whether this is compatible with (US) attitudes that are increasingly inward-orientated and isolationist. The US appears to want to force its way past hesitant alliance partners ('My way or no way'.) It is not clear to what extent US pressure is being motivated by a let-up in defence efforts of Nato member countries and expectations of a build-up of Nato potential through new members. Equally, it cannot be ascertained whether 'hurdles' are being erected by means of criteria for (new members') acceptance into Nato. Latest US security policy consultations in some central and east European states are likely to have included the question of Nato expansion. This leaves us to conclude that a backdoor method is being used to present the alliance with a fait accompli in the form of predetermined agreements, non-compliance with which is bound to cause political damage. If such consultations were to be carried out before each Nato-level agreement, then the partners in the alliance would no longer be free in their decisions. Should this method however be chosen, it should encompass in a transparent manner all the Partnership for Peace members of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and not imply selective decisions concerning future accession candidates. This is another manner in which the cohesion of the alliance is being put under strain - even if it is possible to find a more or less procedural passage in the foreign ministers' communique of December 1 that all 16 states can accept. The expansion question is of such fundamental importance that we must avoid a rapid US success (in this matter) turning into a Pyrrhic victory for the alliance. 3. France, which in the last few years has moved pragmatically toward the US within the alliance, is bound to be disappointed by these unilateral American decisions. The threshold of tolerance may be in sight and fundamental rethinking cannot be excluded. France mistrusts US policy on Bosnia. Foreign minister Juppe alleges that the US 'favours a logic of war'. A demand is possible for a change in leadership of the operation Sharp Guard, ie through the WEU. Thoughts about restructuring the alliance - a division between traditonal tasks and new tasks - are also well known. 4. Other member states are also contributing to these divisions and to a weakening of alliance cohesion. Canada has left Europe militarily; also, it has only one political goal with one interest, however understandable: the security and well-being of its peacekeepers in Bosnia. Canada intends not only drastically to reduce its financial contribution to the infrastructure budget of the alliance, but also its Nato participation. The Bosnia conflict has also made the divergence between Greece and Turkey more evident. Turkey demands an entirely new Nato commitment to protect the Moslem population, Greece warns against the use of Turkish peacekeeping troops in the conflict. It distanced itself also from the alliance air strike decision. Greece considers the Christian Serbs not to be the main cause of the conflict. In the light of the alliance's active eastern policies of the last few years, and the northern expansion (Finland and Sweden) of the EU-WEU, the Mediterranean countries, especially Spain and Italy, are calling for a counter-balance - a kind of 'southern outreach' of the alliance in the Mediterranean. This underlines how different security interests are being increasingly regionalised. As understandable as this is, in the medium term it will demand more resources, which are hardly likely to be available. As a result, Spain and Italy, as well as Greece and Turkey, will face new frustrations. 5. There are other examples of disunity ... as well as current problems, in particular in the financial area concerning a joint defence effort after the end of the east-west conflict. 6. It is a matter of weighty consequence that the 16 countries lack convincing concepts and perspectives. In the past, the alliance has overcome divisions and crises - like after the Nato double-track decision in December 79 - as a result of the clear threat from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. This external pressure in the direction of cohesion and solidarity does not exist today, at least not outside the contact group for Bosnia. Since solidarity no longer is imposed from the outside, it must be accomplished through vision and conviction, through common ideas and concepts. This difficult task must be taken on quickly before the cracks in the alliance get larger and possibly more difficult to repair. The general secretary's talks with Congress during the last days in Washington were particularly important. Richthofen</p>

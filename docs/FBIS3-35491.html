			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between moderator Itay Engel in the studio and </F> correspondent Netan'el Semrik in Hebron -- live]    [Text] [Semrik] Several moments ago, a senior military  source revealed that an initial investigation indicated that the  Arab worshippers were fired upon by two weapons: an M-16 rifle  and a revolver that apparently were in the possession of the  Qiryat Arba' resident who opened fire at the worshippers and  later committed suicide.    The authorities are currently investigating the assertions  made earlier by a witness according to which additional Jews  assisted the settler who opened fire. The defense establishment  has no confirmation of this claim which is currently being  investigated.    The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is now dispatching  reinforcements to Judaea and Samaria. A curfew has been imposed  on Hebron and there is a general closure on the Gaza Strip.  Arab workers from the Gaza Strip are not being permitted to  enter Israel. The IDF General Staff is calling on the Jewish and  Arab residents of the territories and Israel to show restraint.  A series of steps are being taken at this time in an attempt to  prevent any exacerbation of tensions or a deterioration of the  situation in the territories.    Reports streaming in from Hebron, which as mentioned earlier  is under curfew, indicate that there are small gatherings of  Arab residents. Settlers reported stonethrowing incidents  around Hebron and near Halhul. Nevertheless, three hours after  the bloody incident at the Cave of the Patriarchs, the security  forces seem to have the situation under control and there are no  serious incidents.    [Engel] You said that the initial investigation indicates  that two weapons were used in the shooting. Do the results of  the investigation also specify whether the man who committed the  massacre used both weapons or did he have an accomplice?    [Semrik] The current premise of the security forces is that  the shooting was carried out by one man, a settler from Qiryat  Arba' disguised in an IDF officer's uniform. As far as is known  at the present time, he was carrying two firearms, an M-16 rifle  and a revolver. We will have more accurate details later on.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 25 February  adds that "in the Gaza Strip this morning, tires are burning in  many locations and stones are being hurled at the security  forces. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the residents  of the strip are being updated in Hebron through loudspeakers in  the mosques. From time to time, instigatory calls are heard  from the mosques in between prayers being read from the Koran.  There have so far not been any reports of serious clashes  between the army and residents."]</p>

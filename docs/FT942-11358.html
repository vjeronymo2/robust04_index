			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Swedish interest rate reduction Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, yesterday cut interest rates to their lowest level for 20 years to consolidate the country's recovery from its deepest recession since the 1930s. The bank's marginal rate, which steers short-term interest rates, will fall to 7.0 per cent from 7.25 per cent from May 9. The bank said falling European interest rates and the krona's stable performance during recent financial market turbulence had provided scope for the cut. The krona has fallen by 20 per cent since late 1992 but this year it has strengthened amid clear signs of an export-led recovery. Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor, said that with Swedish inflation subdued, 'there is scope for lasting lower interest rates in Sweden'. He also noted that there was a general acceptance that Sweden would have to pursue tighter fiscal policies to promote growth and employment. The Riksbank has attracted criticism for not cutting rates more aggressively over the last 18 months, despite the country's deep economic problems. Real interest rates remain high, with inflation running at less than 2 per cent. The government expects Sweden's GDP to grow 2.4 per cent this year, the first increase since 1990.</p>

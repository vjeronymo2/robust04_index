			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma </F> Commission for International Affairs, by correspondent Boris  Kalyagin; place and date not given; from the "The Bosnian Knot"  program -- recorded]    [Text] [Kalyagin] Russia believes that it is impossible to  achieve a military settlement of the Bosnian problem: a peaceful  settlement is required. Decisions influencing the situation in  Bosnia must be taken not by NATO, but by the UN Security  Council. Russia must not stand on the sidelines while such  actions are being worked out and approved. This was stressed by  President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin in his conversations with  Western leaders, and this stance is backed by the Russian public  and by our parliamentarians.    [Lukin] We believe that in this matter the policy of the  international community, of all countries including Russia,  should be coordinated and based on true partnership. That does  not mean some can take decisions and inform the others; it means  decisions must be adopted jointly, however difficult that may  be. That is mature partnership, based on equal rights.    [Kalyagin] Do you fully support the policy of our government  in the Bosnian issue, or do you believe that there have been  some omissions?    [Kalyagin] I believe that now the stance of the foreign  ministry as it is being expressed is very close to what is  contained in the statement. This position proceeds from the  fact that our main task is to prevent bombing, to prevent air  strikes, and naturally, to create conditions to stop the bombing  of Sarajevo. That is the right aim. It is also right that our  Foreign Ministry is demanding a special decision by the UN  Security Council on the question of whether to implement the  ultimatum, to implement the threat. However, the problem is  that one mistake brings others in its wake. I am firmly  convinced that the earlier vote approving limited air strikes  was a mistake...    [Kalyagin, interrupting] To protect UN convoys.    [Lukin] Unfortunately it was to protect UN convoys and  civilians, which in itself is excellent and noble. But that can  be used any way one wants. The Duma may express its point of  view. Its statement will be very firm. The essence -- I know  this, knowing the mood of the Duma -- is that if the United  States and NATO adopt unilateral decisions in spite of our  recommendations, in spite of the very insistent opinion of a  partner, then the partner can adopt unilateral actions and  statements as well. This is another question: it is a matter  for executive authority, a matter for separate consultations,  but I would not want that. I am in favor of partnership, I am  in favor of joint decisions.</p>

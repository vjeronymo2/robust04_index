			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Merger control THE EUROPEAN Commission's decision in principle to vet the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) bid for Midland, while leaving UK authorities free to deal with Lloyds Bank's rival offer, breaks new ground in merger regulation by splitting jurisdiction over the outcome of an important takeover battle. The immediate casualty looks like Lloyds, which has said its bid may lapse unless its offer and that of HSBC are examined in the UK. For that to happen, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may now need to persuade Brussels that compelling national interest requires the HSBC offer to be reviewed in London. Since the Bank of England has already ruled that the bid does not raise problems of prudential security, there is no apparent case for ministerial intervention. At this stage, Brussels has taken on the task of determining whether the HSBC bid raises competition issues. In the relatively unlikely event that it determined this to be the case, it would be desirable for these questions to be explored by a single regulatory authority or at the very least by the two authorities acting in close co-operation. If no competition problem is judged to exist, the Hongkong bid can and should be allowed to proceed. Meanwhile, it is sensible that the Lloyds' bid, which bears entirely on the UK market, be dealt with in London. Dividing lines All of this, however, has exposed again the risk of jurisdictional conflicts and 'double jeopardy' which has existed since the EC first sought expanded control over mergers. The risk has grown as more European countries have introduced merger controls of their own. Neater dividing lines between EC and national competence would be desirable  - but hard to achieve in practice. Alternatively, Brussels' merger 'thresholds' could be lowered to catch more deals. That, however, could simply create further jurisdictional problems, since even after 1992 many deals will raise purely national competition issues. The sensible solution is closer co-operation and convergence between EC and national merger authorities. The time limits for completing merger investigations should be harmonised, since variations create damaging uncertainties and distortions. But harmonisation is most crucial in the criteria used to assess mergers, since it is here that divergence will create the biggest problems. The case for basing judgments exclusively on competition issues is overwhelming. While regulators can invoke vague 'public interest' criteria at will, predictability, consistency and fairness across the EC will suffer. Less impartial Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, has adhered unswervingly to that principle. However, he has to argue each case before 16 colleagues, many of whom have proved less impartial in their views. Sir Leon's successors may not be so strong-minded or persuasive. The best safeguard against political meddling is to establish an independent EC cartel office, answerable to the courts, and to ensure that commissioners could reverse its rulings only in exceptional circumstances. Mr Heseltine, meanwhile, is thought to favour loosening the 1984 Tebbit doctrine on mergers to give more weight to 'national interest' factors. At the very least, any relaxation should not change the MMC's current criteria, but should provide simply for the rare and limited exercise of ministerial discretion, preferably with specific accountability to parliament. Even with such restrictions, there would be a risk of arbitrary and unpredictable judgments, favouring special interest groups with the most powerful Whitehall lobbyists. If Mr Heseltine really wants to create a stable environment in which the whole of industry can flourish, and not just pander to those sections best placed to bend his ear, he should resist the temptation to tinker with merger rules. He should also avoid setting any precedents in the Midland affair which could damage the long-term interests of British business.</p>

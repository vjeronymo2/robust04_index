			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Brussels hits back over steel criticism The European Commission hit back swiftly yesterday after seven of Europe's biggest steel producers criticised its year-long efforts to restructure the sector, saying the industry itself was responsible for excess production. In an open letter to industry ministers on Monday, the companies from six northern European countries had complained of 'totally inadequate' progress by the Commission. They warned against reaching solutions 'at any price' to the deadlock over state subsidies. In response Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said in a joint statement: 'It's not the Commission but the whole steel sector that is responsible for current production overcapacities.' Companies had not made one concrete offer to cut capacity despite the Commission's decision to authorise a restructuring fund backed by EC loans. The two commissioners pointed out that the need for unanimous backing for subsidy decisions put the Commission in an 'extremely delicate situation', but it had managed nevertheless to win deep capacity cuts in most cases. It said parties interested in resolving the steel crisis should resist putting off decisions until the last minute or risk aggravating a situation with 'catastrophic economic and social consequences'. The Commission's steel rescue plan aims to entice steelmakers to close some 30m tonnes of excess crude steel capacity in exchange for European Union money to help cover at least 50,000 job losses, import restrictions and other assistance. Italy's refusal to accept demands for capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker, in exchange for approval of state aid is the main stumbling block to an overall deal on subsidies.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 7  June.    The Guatemalan Congress has refrained from approving the  renegotiation of the country's debt with the Paris Club. This  decision places the country in a precarious position and could  even close the doors to future international loans. Guatemalan  Christian Democracy and Solidarity Action Movement deputies  blocked a proposal in favor of the renegotiation. (Guatemala  City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 79)    The Central Bank of Guatemala has reported that between  January and May 1994 the country's foreign exchange income rose  by 18.7 percent. The country's foreign trade contributed  greatly to this increase. Sales of traditional products  increased 26.5 percent, despite declines in cotton and banana  sales. Meanwhile, sales of nontraditional products increased  14.4 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0256 GMT 7 Jun 94)    Finance Minister Ana Ordonez has reported that during the  first trimester of the year, Guatemala's fiscal deficit  increased by some $52.2 million. The minister said the fact  that taxpayers failed to pay taxes on time contributed to the  shortfall. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1841 GMT 3 Jun 94)</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Violence mars Italian strike: Four-hour stoppage by at least 6m workers takes toll of industry and transport in staggered action across the country AT LEAST 6m workers yesterday took part in Italy's tenth general strike in 12 years, hitting industry and transport in a four-hour staggered stoppage marred by violence in Milan. Mr Sergio d'Antoni, leader of the CISL, the Christian Democrat-controlled confederation, was slightly injured on the lip when union militants and right wing extremists joined forces to hurl coins and bolts at the speaker's podium as he addressed a mass meeting. Milan was also the scene of violence last month during a four-hour regional stoppage. The strike had been pressed for by the largest and most combative of Italy's three union confederations, the CGIL, which is run largely by former communists. Called in protest against proposed welfare cuts in the 1993 budget, it was the culmination of a series of co-ordinated regional four-hour general stoppages begun last month and organised by all three confederations. However, the strength of the protest was undermined by public divisions between the unions, a lack of public support, and a growing appreciation of the government's lack of room for manoeuvre. The CISL and the Social Democrat-oriented UIL accepted the national stoppage with reluctance and deliberately called it for yesterday, too soon for the statutory two weeks' notice needed to include essential services. Yesterday's action seemed as much as anything a controlled exercise in allowing the rank and file to vent their fears and frustrations over impending austerity, reduced welfare benefits and the loss of the link between wages and inflation. The demonstrators themselves appeared mostly to be on the streets out of a mix of nostalgia for the mass protests of the seventies and confused impotence in the face of an economic crisis. The system of indexed wages, the scala mobile, was abolished by mutual agreement in July between the union leaders, Confindustria, the employers' confederation, and the government. The agreement provoked a groundswell of protest against the union leadership, especially the CGIL, causing Mr Bruno Trentin, its leader, to offer his resignation. He agreed to stay on only after a special congress, but he has since been treading a tightrope between placating this discontent and supporting his friend and former CGIL colleague, Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister. His task has been complicated both by the tough measures proposed in the 1993 budget capping pensions and reducing national health benefits, and by the prospect of wages being eroded next year by the inflationary effects of the lira's devaluation. The Amato government has little room for manoeuvre in making concessions without reducing anticipated revenues and in the process undermining domestic business and international confidence. Equally, if the government holds firm, union leaders risk being exposed as weak. The authority of the three confederations has already been eroded by declining membership and the formation of workers' committees in key sectors such as the railways, education and air transport. The CGIL also reflects the continuing ideological turmoil caused by the collapse of communism and the split in the former Italian Communist Party. At least 15 per cent of the CGIL consists of hardline communists threatening to form their own confederation.</p>

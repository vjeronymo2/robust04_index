			<p>BFN     [Text] The second national conference on the economy ended  this morning. The 2,000 participants deliberated for two days  on the consequences of the devaluation and development  strategies for our economy within a new context. Braimah  Ouedraogo reports on some of the proposals made by participants:    [Ouedraogo] We begin by pointing out that the conclusions  reached at the end of the deliberations were merely proposals.  Concerning our membership in the franc zone, it was recommended  that greater thought should be given to the advantages and  disadvantages of belonging to such a common monetary outfit. In  the field of industry, a sector in difficulty and whose  operators were present throughout the deliberations, the setting  up of an enterprise promotion fund with special attention to  women chief executives of enterprises was proposed, as was the  amendment of the investment code and tax system, and the  creation of industrial zones with special status.    To better sustain agriculture and stockbreeding, a sector  which benefits greatly from the devaluation, proposals were made  to create an outfit for the export of livestock and meat, the  production and export of meat, bring the cost of production of  rice under control by reducing the cost of inputs.    The social sector was not forgotten: It was proposed that  traditional medicine and drugs should be integrated into the  health delivery system in order to reduce the adverse effects of  devaluation on a sector severely hit by poor economic times. To  better fight against unemployment, it was proposed that  apprenticeship should be developed for dropout youth, the  creation of a national council for vocational training. To make  the transport sector more dynamic, it was recommended that a  general conference on land transportation should be convened,  the revision of land transportation agreements signed with  coastal countries.    Finally, the Economic and Social Council was charged with  monitoring and implementing these proposals so that they become  actins and not simply words.</p>

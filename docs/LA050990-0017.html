			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY OKS GUARANTEE TO CLOSE LOPEZ DUMP  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to ensure that the  Lopez Canyon Landfill will be closed permanently even if a key component of a  garbage disposal agreement between the county and city of Los Angeles falls  through.  </P> <P> Following the city's lead, the board voted 4 to 1 to modify the disposal  agreement, which it had originally endorsed in March.  </P> <P> In the earlier version, the city, which owns the Lopez dump, would have been  allowed to reopen it if the proposed Elsmere Landfill in the Santa Clarita  Valley could not accept the city's trash.  </P> <P> Under the newly approved terms, the city is prohibited from reopening Lopez  even if Elsmere can no longer take the city's trash.  </P> <P> The city modified the agreement last month at the behest of City Councilman  Ernani Bernardi, who wanted a guarantee that Lopez will never be reopened.  Neighborhood activists have complained that the Lopez landfill is emitting  toxic gas emissions and should be closed.  </P></p>

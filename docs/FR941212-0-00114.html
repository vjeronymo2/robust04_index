			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Claims that are within the scope of this section and also within the scope of subpart J may be processed under subpart J when specific authority to do so has been obtained from the Commander, USARCS. The request for such authority should be accompanied by a copy of the report of the incident by the Marine Casualty Investigating Officer, or other claims investigator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.126 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Subrogation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) An insurer will be recognized as a claimant under this section to the extent that it has become subrogated by payment to, or on behalf of, its assured, pursuant to a contract of insurance in force at the time of the incident from which the claim arose. An insurer and its assured may file a claim either jointly or separately. Joint claims will be asserted in the names of, and must be signed by, or on behalf of, all parties; payment then will be made jointly. If separate claims are filed, payment to each party will be limited to the extent of such party's undisputed interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For the purpose of determining authority to settle or compromise a claim, the payable interests of an insurer (or assurers) and the assured represent merely separable interests, which interests in the aggregate must not exceed the amount authorized for administrative settlement or compromise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The policies set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section with respect to subrogation arising from insurance contracts are applicable to all other types of subrogation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.127 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Limitation of settlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The period of effecting an administrative settlement under the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act is subject to the same limitation as that for beginning an action under the Suits in Admiralty Act; that is, a 2-year period from the date the cause of the action accrued. The claimant must have agreed to accept the settlement, and it must be approved for payment by the Secretary of the Army, or other approval authority, prior to the end of such period. The presentation of a claim, or its consideration by the DA, neither waives nor extends the 2-year limitation period and the claimant should be so informed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In the event that an action has been filed in a U.S. district court before the end of the 2-year statutory period, an administrative settlement may be negotiated by the Commander, USARCS with the claimant, even though the 2-year period has elapsed since the cause of action accrued, provided the claimant obtains the written consent of the appropriate office of the Department of Justice charged with the defense of the complaint. Payment may be made upon dismissal of the complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When a claim under this section, notice of damage, invitation to a damage survey, or other written document indicating an intention to hold the United States liable is received, the receiving installation, office, or person, will immediately forward such document to the Commander, USARCS. The USARCS claims office receiving notice of the claim will promptly advise the claimant or potential claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Where a claim under this section for $25,000 or less is presented to a Corps of Engineers or other designated area claims office (see &sect;&sect;536.128(c) and 536.132(c) and thus may be appropriate for action by that office pursuant to the delegation of authority set forth in &sect;536.128, the receiving Corps of Engineer office will promptly advise the claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit on the Army's authority to settle the claim as well as the fact that the claim does not toll the statute of limitations for filing suit. (See &sect;536.12(b)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Claimants are not required to file an administrative claim six months prior to filing suit except for those claims where maritime jurisdiction is based on the Act Extending the Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction (46 U.S.C. 740) (i.e. damage or injury on land resulting from an act on navigable waters). However, even in those cases, the filing of an administrative claim does not toll the two year statutory limit for filing suit nor extend the authority of the Army to settle a claim. Any such claim filed within six months of the running of the statute of limitations should be brought to the attention of USARCS immediately and every reasonable effort should be made to complete final agency action before the running of the two year limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Limitation of Liability. Under the provisions of the Limitation of Shipowners' Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. 181&hyph;188, the United States may be able, in cases alleging injury or loss due to negligent operation of a vessel, to limit our liability to the value of the vessel after the accident. To take advantage of this law, the United States must file an action in federal district court within six months of receiving written notice of a claim. Therefore, USARCS must be notified within 10 workdays of the receipt of any maritime claim arising in the United States or on the high seas out of the operation of an Army vessel, to include pleasure craft owned by the United States. The Claims Service will coordinate with Litigation Division, OTJAG or the Chief Counsel, COE and the Department of Justice on whether a limitation of liability action will be filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.128 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Approval authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management) as designee of the Secretary or the designee of the Secretary may approve any settlement or compromise of a claim under this subpart subject only to the statutory limits (presently $500,000). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) TJAG, TAJAG and the Commander, USARCS or his designee within USARCS are delegated authority to settle (i.e. deny or approve payment in full or in part) any claim under this subpart regardless of the amount claimed, provided that any amount awarded does not exceed $100,000 and that the claimant signs an appropriate settlement agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Chiefs of command claims services, heads of Corps of Engineers area claims offices and heads of other area claims offices designated by the Commander, USARCS, are delegated authority to deny claims under this subpart presented in an amount not exceeding $25,000. They may also pay in full or compromise any claim where the amount to be paid does not exceed $25,000, provided the claimant is willing to accept the payment and executes an appropriate settlement agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Only the authorities designated in paragraph a, above may deny or make a final offer on a claim demanding more than $25,000. If a claim cannot be settled within the authority of the head of an area claims office or the chief of a command claims service responsible for investigating a claim, it will be forwarded to USARCS through appropriate channels with a claims memorandum of opinion recommending disposition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Meritorious claims arising from civil works activities of the Corps of Engineers will be paid from Corps of Engineers funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Claims In Favor of the United States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.129 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Scope. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Title 10, United States Code, Section 4803, provides for agency settlement or compromise of claims for damage to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) DA accountable properties of a kind that are within the admiralty jurisdiction of a district court of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims for damage caused by a vessel or floating object to property under the jurisdiction of the DA or property for which the DA has assumed an obligation to respond in damages, where the net amount payable to the United States does not exceed $500,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Title 10, United States Code, Section 4804, provides for the settlement of compromise of claims in any amount for salvage services(including contract salvage and towage) performed by the DA. Claims for salvage services are based upon labor costs, per diem rates for the use of salvage vessels and other equipment, and upon repair or replacement costs of materials and equipment damaged or lost during the salvage operation. The sum claimed is intended to compensate the United States for operational costs only, reserving, however, the right of the Government to assert a claim on a salvage bonus basis in accordance with commercial practice, in appropriate cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The United States has three years from the date a maritime claim accrues under this section to file suit against the responsible parties. The Army's authority to settle or compromise a suit under this section terminates when the statute of limitations has run. Efforts to compromise a claim under this section should not extend more than two years past the date the claims accrues unless it is clear that an administrative settlement is likely. As a general rule, affirmative claims which are likely to be resolved through litigation should be referred to the Department of Justice within two years of the date the claims accrue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.130 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims exceeding $500,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Maritime claims in favor of the United States, except claims for salvage services, may not be settled or compromised under this section at a net amount exceeding $500,000 payable to the United States. However, all such claims otherwise within the scope of this section will be investigated in accordance with the procedures in subpart B and reported to the Commander, USARCS. The Commander, USARCS will forward the claim to the Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management) as designee to the secretary or other designee of the Secretary who will then certify it to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

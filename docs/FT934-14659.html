			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Multi-media superhighways THE AVERAGE telephone line in the US is used for only 20 minutes a day. For the remaining 23 hours and 40 minutes, it is dead. This basic fact underlies the current convergence between the telecommunications and cable television industries, which was epitomised by this week's Dollars 22bn bid for Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television group, by Bell Atlantic, a large regional telecommunications carrier. Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications believe that by combining forces they will be able to sell customers a rich diet of services over a single network: ordinary entertainment and telephone services to start with, but eventually home shopping, access to databases, picture telephones and much else. The same desire to fill the unused hours on the telephone lines with extra services underlies recent multi-billion dollar investments in cable television by US West and Nynex, two other US regional telecommunications carriers. There are those who are sceptical about the current enthusiasm for 'multi-media' convergence. They point out that attempts to merge telecommunications and computing companies in the early 1980s failed because it was impossible to devise products which appealed sufficiently to customers. Similarly, it has yet to be proved that customers want to buy new multi-media services. Cost advantages But the industrial logic driving the convergence of cable TV and telecommunications does not rely on consumers showing interest in new and as yet unproved multi-media services. There are cost advantages in combining ordinary entertainment and telephone services over a single infrastructure. This has already been shown in the UK, which has become a telecommunications laboratory since deregulation in the mid-1980s. British cable TV companies are successfully offering combined telephone and entertainment services at lower prices than either service could be provided on its own. If anything stops the convergence of the two industries, it will be regulation rather than industrial logic. There are already signs that the Bell Atlantic/TCI takeover will face tough scrutiny from the authorities. The reason is concern among politicians and consumer groups that instead of competing head-on, cable TV and telecommunications operators will join forces and push up prices for both telephone and TV services. This argument misses the point that cable TV and telecommunications companies have in the past not competed at all. Regulations have kept them out of each others' businesses, so creating local telephone and cable monopolies. Now these regulations are crumbling. In August, for example, Bell Atlantic won a legal case allowing it to provide video services over its main telephone network. Hasten competition But barriers still largely remain on cable companies providing telephone services over their networks. Rather than seeking to use regulations to slow down convergence, the authorities should press ahead with deregulation as a means of hastening competition in both industries. There is one important caveat. Telecommunications operators should continue to be prevented from linking up with cable companies operating in the areas where they run telephone services. Such integration would be seriously anti-competitive, as it would eliminate major potential competitors. But allowing link-ups with cable companies outside the areas where they provide telephone services is a different matter - particularly if combined with a policy of freeing both cable and telecommunications groups to offer a full range of services over their networks. Such an approach would eventually mean that customers would have a choice between two integrated fixed-link operators, instead of facing monopoly suppliers for two separate services. Further competition will be provided by operators offering television and telephone services via satellite and radio links. Restructuring the industry in this way will have considerable benefits for customers. Far from increasing prices, competition would drive them down. Meanwhile, the industry would be able to bring the dead hours of the telephone network to life.</p>

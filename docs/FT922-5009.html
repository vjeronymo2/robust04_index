			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico embraces the international financial markets - The share offerings and foreign listing which have made an impact on the country's business methods IN THE past 12 months around a dozen Mexican companies have become significant players in the international financial markets, issuing billions of dollars in new stock and, in some cases, acquiring listings on Wall Street. Just a few years ago such events in Mexico would have been thought of as laughable. Not surprisingly the speed and extent of the changes are having a profound effect on Mexican business methods. The share offerings have been spurred by the large financing needs of industry which needs badly to catch up after a decade of weak capital investment if it is to make the most of the proposed free trade pact with North America. The trend started in May 1991 when the Mexican government sold 14 per cent of Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly, for Dollars 2.17bn, most of it in American or Global Depository Receipts. In all, Mexican companies placed about Dollars 4.8bn of stock at home and abroad last year. This year Dollars 3.6bn has already been raised and a further Dollars 2bn could be in issue before the year is out. Companies as diverse as Telmex, Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, and ICA, the construction company, are now listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with more to follow. Foreign investment in Mexican ADRs is now short of Dollars 20bn. In part, the rush to sell stock abroad reflects the phenomenal rise of the Mexican stock market and the desire of existing owners to cash on the high earnings multiples being offered: and the issues have had to be international since the Mexican stock market is far too small to absorb all the paper on sale. The more so since more than Dollars 11bn of Mexican savings have been used up to buy the country's privatised banks from the government. Most Mexican companies were starved of capital during the 1980s. They are now having to invest heavily in a re-shape in order to compete under Mexico's relatively open trade policy, and prepare for a North American free trade area. With foreign banks reluctant to lend directly, Mexican business has been forced to tap foreign money through equity or bonds. At the same time the large public offerings of Mexican stock are forcing Mexican companies to face the discipline of the domestic and international equity markets, and meet much tighter reporting requirements. This marks a particularly profound change in management styles. In the past, even some publicly owned Mexican companies were treated as little more than personal fiefdoms, an approach which helped put many of the country's largest companies into virtual bankruptcy in the early 1980s. Mexican companies, prodded by the finance ministry, can see the benefits of giving up their freedom to run companies as they wish: going public, or being listed on foreign markets, cannot just reduce the cost of capital, but attract foreign partners that might otherwise shun a third world company. Mr Arturo Trevino, the director general of Gigante, the supermarket chain, suggests that had it not been for his company's public listing, its joint venture with the US's largest wholesaler Fleming could not have gone ahead. Similarly, Mr Hugo Jaime Garcia, who is head of banking relations at Vitro, says that his company's presence in global capital markets, while perhaps demanding in terms of investor relations, 'reduces the aspect of Mexican risk'.</p>

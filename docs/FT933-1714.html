			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago lumber futures hit peaks after big rise in US housing starts CHICAGO LUMBER futures prices, which have earned a reputation for volatility this year, rallied sharply early yesterday in response to news that US housing starts had advanced in August at their fastest rate in a year. A US Commerce Department report said the seasonally adjusted rate would indicate 1.323m homes being built in the US this year. However, profit-taking by traders who had bought futures during strong advances on Friday and Monday halted the rise, and by midsession lumber futures for November delivery, which had reached a recent high of Dollars 336 per 1,000 board/feet, had turned lower. Nearby prices had rallied their 10 cents-a-contract daily limit on Friday and Monday after the US Commerce Department surprised traders by recommending that a US duty on Canadian lumber imports be raised to 11.54 per cent from the existing 6.51 per cent. The higher duty, which must still be reviewed by a US-Canadian trade committee, would not be effective until December 16. With US timber cutting in Pacific north-west forests restricted by environmental red tape, an increasing amount of US building materials are being imported from Canada. The duty decision led several Canadian lumber mills to reconsider selling into the US futures market, for fear of incurring duties during delivery, lumber analysts said. 'The rally was really the result of a lack of sellers. The Canadian mills that would generally sell into a rally hung back,' commented Mr Curt Cunningham, analyst for Seattle-based Pacific Futures Trading. The 7.8 per cent jump in August starts might not be sustainable, despite historically low mortgage rates, traders said. Much of the increase in August building was delayed activity following unusually wet summer weather. 'Builders who couldn't dig foundations because of the wet are rushing to get houses framed before the cold weather,' Mr Cunningham said. Still, applications for permits to build new homes also rose sharply in August, by 7.5 per cent to an annualised rate of 1.249m units.</p>

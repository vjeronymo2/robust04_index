			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPITOL CONSEQUENCES CLOSING IN ON PAT NOLAN;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS: ASSEMBLY REPUBLICAN BOMB-THROWER FEELS THE STING AS POLITICS TAKES  ITS TOLL AND INVESTIGATIONS GRIND ON.  </P> <P> Pat Nolan came to Sacramento exactly 11 years ago as a 28-year-old political  bomb-thrower, one of more than a dozen new Republican legislators who called  themselves "Proposition 13 babies" and vowed to wage ideological war.  </P> <P> Within weeks, Nolan and the other newcomers had helped engineer a coup against  the moderate Republican leadership. And five years later, Nolan led another  coup, installing himself as the Republican leader in the Assembly and promising  all that he would deliver a GOP majority within a few years.  </P> <P> Despite his right-wing ideological credentials, the Nolan regime resembled that  of his counterpart, Democratic Speaker Willie Brown, with whom he reached a  semi-secret pact of mutual accommodation.  </P> <P> Brown, the master of internal Capitol politics, understood Nolan's ambition and  played on it. He gave Nolan some powers over committee appointments and other  matters to prop up his position as Republican leader. In return, Nolan agreed  to avoid frontal attacks on Brown's speaker ship.  </P> <P> Nolan, whose ambitions included statewide office, used his Brown-supplied  authority to install his sycophants in plum legislative positions and punish  rivals.  </P> <P> And he dabbled in matters outside the Capitol, such as trying to handpick  Republican legislative candidates and shove them down the throats of local  party activists. The Republicans picked up three seats in the 1986 elections,  which had Nolan crowing, despite the fact that several of the wins were by GOP  candidates who had defeated his anointees in the primary.  </P> <P> The dumb luck that overcame Nolan's tactical errors in the 1986 elections  deserted him within months.  </P> <P> A band of five Democratic dissidents came to Nolan with a scheme to unseat  Brown by combining their votes with the Republicans. But, honoring his  understanding with Brown, Nolan refused to play ball with the "Gang of Five."  </P> <P> A state investigation of Republicans' use of a phony letter carrying President  Reagan's signature in the 1986 campaigns finally resulted in an indictment of  Assemblyman John Lewis, a top Nolan political lieutenant, for forgery. There  were strong indications in grand jury testimony that Nolan and other Republican  strategists sanctioned use of the phony Reagan letters, but Lewis alone was  indicted.  </P> <P> Nolan, feeling renewed heat from critics within his own caucus, finally agreed  to cooperate with the Gang of Five, but it was too late. Brown staved off the  challenge and recouped at the polls in 1988, cutting the Republican margin once  again and forcing Nolan to give up his leadership position.  </P> <P> In August, 1988, FBI agents raided the Capitol offices of several legislators,  including Nolan, to close a multi-year undercover investigation of  influence-peddling in the Capitol.  </P> <P> The Capitol sting operation, which involved FBI agents posing as businessmen  seeking special legislative favors, has been a yearlong sensation.  </P> <P> One state senator, Joseph Montoya, was indicted along with an aide on a variety  of federal corruption charges, and the U.S. attorney's office continued to  painstakingly build cases against other targets.  </P> <P> Even as that investigation continued, another political scandal was unfolding  in Washington and Sacramento, regarding the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan. And once again, Nolan found himself embroiled because he had carried the  legislation that loosened regulatory oversight of Lincoln and other  state-chartered S&amp;Ls. Nolan had been among the many recipients of campaign  checks from the head of Lincoln, Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> Last week, a woman who had become one of Nolan's top political aides, Karin  Watson, pleaded guilty to federal charges of extorting campaign checks and  promises of speaking fees from the undercover FBI agents during the Capitol  sting operation. And she was promised lenient sentencing in return for  cooperating with investigators as they seek charges against legislators.  </P> <P> Nolan and Assemblyman Frank Hill, another of his one-time lieutenants, are the  apparent targets. Both Nolan and Hill received campaign checks from the dummy  corporation set up by the FBI.  </P> <P> Nolan is learning that real politics are a bit more complicated than the  student variety he practiced so earnestly at USC 20 years ago. And a bit more  hazardous.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The other 'great depression' In an article on March 25 ('Tide turns in the world economy') I suggested that we might be seeing a sea change in the world economy. The word 'deflation' was not used. But there does seem to have been a trend towards ever lower inflation, taking one cycle with another. The main industrial countries witnessed twin inflationary peaks of inflation in 1974 and 1980 following the first two oil price explosions. Since then the inflation trend has been decidedly downwards. The next cyclical peak in 1990, associated with both a worldwide credit boom and the temporary upsurge in oil prices following Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, was very much lower. Since then inflation in most countries has fallen to levels not seen since the 1960s, and could go lower still. This view of rapidly falling inflation, not just from one year to another but from one business cycle to another, has received a slight dent from the flurry of interest in gold, and the proclaimed interest in that metal of one or two well- known individual investors. There are also a few political straws in the wind suggesting that democracies have not the patience to persevere with low inflation. The probability, however, is that the forces making for low inflation are too powerful to be overthrown by political eddies in favour of cheap money and lots of it. The secular fall in inflation has been accompanied, unfortunately, by a secular rise in unemployment. There are many structural as well as monetary reasons for this rise. But in view of the rigidities in wage and price adjustment, the pressures to reduce inflation have also meant severe job losses. The problem with diagnosing such trends is that people rush to ask: 'Are you predicting another great depression like that of the 1930s?', even though nothing remotely resembling it has so far occurred. The difficulty is that in examining eras of modest growth in total spending and downward pressure on prices and wages, people only have the 1930s in mind. It is worth looking at the last previous period of downward pressures to broaden one's view of what can occur. This period was in the UK from 1873 to 1896 and was indeed once known as 'the great depression'. It gave rise to the first of the many fruitless inquiries about why Britain was being overtaken and to strictures on the laziness of the third generation of businessmen. In the eyes of subsequent historians, the period was one of deflation, but not depression. The title of a historical booklet, Professor S B Saul's The Myth of the Great Depression, 1873-1896 (Macmillan 1989), tells its own story. As Prof Saul remarks, the most unmistakable movement of the whole century was that for 14 years after 1873 UK wholesale prices, with one slight respite, 'fell without cease, overriding all shorter cyclical fluctuations'. After that there was a modest upswing; but there was a further fall after 1891, which took prices down a further 10 per cent below the 1887 level. Because most industrial countries were linked via the gold standard they saw similar price falls. Why did prices fall in the late 19th century? At one time historians used to make great play with specific factors such as the Bessemer process which brought down the price of steel rails. The pages of notes on such subjects explain why people such as the late Anthony Crosland regarded economic history as a bore. Such micro explanations do not tell us why innovation expressed itself in falling prices in one period and rising money wages in another. A more convincing explanation comes from the monetary side. The absence of new gold discoveries until the end of the 1880s, and the rush of new countries to join the gold standard after 1870, increased the demand for gold relative to the supply. As the amount of bank notes and deposits was still related to gold, the growth of both the US and British money supplies slowed down. The original reason why Prof Saul and other historians rejected the idea of 'the great depression' is that it is associated with the dubious idea of 50-year-long Kondratieff economic cycles. (Alas, I cannot engage in one-to-one correspondence with readers who believe in such cycles.) Moreover, the period is given a false precision from the 1873 peak in prices and activity and the sharpness of the upswing of the late 1890s. But the basic reason why the period was not a depression is that real growth was not depressed. The depression idea derived credence from a slowdown in the growth of UK industrial production after 1873. Even in these terms what occurred was a once-and-for-all slowdown from mid-Victorian growth rates. More recent estimates, which cover the whole national income including the rapidly rising service sector, do not show a slowdown. Indeed, real GDP continued to grow at trend rates, despite short-term fluctuations. As the table shows, the average rate of increase over the period 1873-99 (virtually the 'great depression' years) was 2.1 per cent per annum, slightly above the average for the 60 years before the first world war. The slowdown in output growth occurred in the subsequent period up to 1913 when prices were rising once more. While the growth of real output was maintained in 'the great depression', the jobless story was different. Unemployment is estimated, on the basis of union returns, to have risen from an average of 5 per cent in 1851-73 to 7.4 per cent in 1874-95, before falling back to 5.4 per cent in 1896-1914. The wages chart is suggestive. It shows that, despite the downward pressures from the demand side, money wages continued to grow over the 1873-96 period taken as a whole. Prof Saul writes of 'the ability of wage earners to force money wages up above prices in the boom years and to maintain a money wage plateau in between'. The result was that when the growth of nominal demand slowed down the share of profits was squeezed. The prosperity of the period was at the expense of those who became unemployed. This, together with the pressure on profits and the shift in the economic structure away from manufacturing, produced a lack of confidence and doom-laden writings all too familiar to someone looking back from the late 20th century. Net domestic capital formation was not in fact very different in 1873-96 from what it was before or after, measured in a percentage of gross domestic product. But as the 19th century drew to a close it fell behind the corresponding proportions in the US and Germany. Whether or not a long-term British economic disease was already taking root is a separate historical controversy from that of the supposed 'great depression'. The 1873-96 episode suggests that deflation need not mean depression or the absence of growth. But it is likely to mean pressure on profits and jobs; and the same is likely to apply to its modern equivalent of severe downward pressure on the inflation rate. Comparison with the true depression of the 1930s emphasises how important it is to prevent a slowdown in the growth of nominal demand from degenerating into a self-perpetuating downward spiral. This happened in the 1930s much more in the US and Germany than it did in the UK, but the result spread worldwide. A moral from the late 19th century is the importance of pay and price flexibility. There are today more institutional obstacles to such flexibility than there were then. On the other hand, with a much higher real national income per head, it ought to be easier to top up the pay of those who suffer most from taking a pay cut or give up a pay increase to preserve jobs. If genuine deflation need not involve depression, how much more does that go for the symptoms associated with the achievement of low inflation.  -------------------------------------   ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE GROWTH           OF UK REAL GDP  ------------------------------------- 1856-60       1.7 1860-65       2.0 1865-73       2.4 1873-82       1.9 1882-89       2.2 1889-99       2.2 1899-1907     1.2 1907-13       1.6 1856-1873     2.2 1873-1913     1.8 1873-1899     2.1 1899-1913     1.4  ------------------------------------- Source: SB Saul  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE DIVIDEND SAVE FOR STORMS AHEAD;  </P> <P> DON'T USE A SLEDGEHAMMER ON OUR DEFENSE FORCES;  </P> <P> THE SOVIET ECONOMY WILL REBOUND AND ITS MILITARY- INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX WILL  FLOURISH.  </P> <P> In a preemptive move, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney announced a  "streamlining" of the U.S. military, theoretically to save $39 billion. He had  previously ordered the defense Establishment to reduce spending by $180 billion  over a three-year period. Now President Bush is planning troop cutbacks. These  are opening plays in a football game between the Administration and Congress --  a game designed to take advantage of the temporary aberration caused by the  greatest geopolitical reorganization since World War II. But the players are  not focusing on certain vectors that will eventually converge and how to handle  them.  </P> <P> From 1946 to 1956, Japan and Germany rebuilt their states with the help of  countries that were instruments of their defeat. In that period, the world saw  these nations rebound and become stable. Then, between 1957 and 1970, they  became serious competitors in the world marketplace. After 1971, they became  superpowers.  </P> <P> Today we see an analogous situation: The West is starting to rebuild the Soviet  Union and the East Bloc. But it will not take the Soviets as long to recover.  The Soviets' natural resources, technological advances and taste for a better  life will make their rebound possible, amazing even their most cynical  detractors.  </P> <P> The only major difference today from 40 years ago is that both the Japanese and  German military-industrial complexes were destroyed and then restricted. But  the military-industrial complex of the Soviet Union will still be intact,  commanding about one-quarter of gross national product. Keeping in mind that  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may not have real control over his military,  much less be able to retain power, one can safely assume that the Soviet  military institution will promote its own agenda. Careful moves will enable it  to survive an initial contraction and flourish as the economic transformation  occurs, thanks to Western investment. Mutant forces -- in Cuba, Vietnam, Angola  and other areas -- will emulate this model, generating their own turmoil. This  will contribute to conflict aimed at the Free World for decades to come.  </P> <P> The expanding world population, with its depletion of our environment and  resources, is another vector generating conflict. The population of our planet  is 5.3 billion and growing exponentially. This crowding will replicate the  psychology experiment demonstrating how two mice in a grocery box with an ounce  of cheese are friendly, 20 under the same conditions are feisty and 200  murderous. The competition for markets, resources and trade routes will in  itself generate turmoil.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the idea that war will become obsolete, as predicted by the  authors of "Megatrends 2000," especially when the drug and terrorism vectors  are considered, is unfortunately ridiculous. The notion that the level of  intensity will decrease is pure fantasy, because the proliferation of nuclear,  biological and chemical weapons is on the increase.  </P> <P> As the world reels under an average of 30 wars a year, our leaders are  auctioning off our constitutionally mandated defense Establishment for a "peace  dividend" that is shortsighted compared to the consequences. The remaining  hollow shell, if not directed toward these specific, expanding threats, will  eventually prove as rigid as the French military was in the late '30s.  </P> <P> Our President and military leaders, when cutting defense spending, should not  be tempted to use a sledgehammer when they can use a scalpel. Accordingly,  there must be selective use of Special Operation Forces to keep violence at its  lowest level. Conventional brute force will be too expensive in terms of  manpower, political risk and resources for the increasing and frequent small  conflicts around the world. It should be saved and used only when appropriate,  with Congress supporting this concept.  </P> <P> Cheney must not focus on a cheaper version of the same old military with the  same antiquated insights. He has to reorient and redesign our defense  Establishment to meet these multidimensional threats with the resources to do  the job of protecting America.  </P></p>

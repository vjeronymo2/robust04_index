			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Smiths poised for US avionics deal SMITHS Industries, the UK defence and aerospace components group, is about to sign a partnership agreement with the Collins Avionics division of Rockwell International of the US. The venture will create a third force in the commercial aircraft avionics sector competing against Honeywell, the market leader, and the French Sextant avionics group. It will also rationalise the commercial aircraft avionics business along the same lines as the other main sectors of the commercial aerospace industry dominated by three airframe manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas) and three engine makers (Pratt &amp; Whitney, General Electric and Rolls-Royce). Mr Graham Thornton, marketing director of Smiths Industries' defence and aerospace activities, said yesterday agreement between the two companies was close. He said there was only room in the market for three groups to provide the avionic systems for the flight decks of commercial airliners. The venture is not expected to involve a cross-equity agreement at this stage. The agreement is expected to form a joint marketing company with the two groups retaining their design and manufacturing activities. The two companies will bid as a partnership for future avionics contracts on airliner projects. The partnership is also expected to focus on winning business on US Boeing aircraft which make up about 55 per cent of the world airliner market. Honeywell, the biggest US avionics supplier with about 35 per cent of the world market, is dominant on McDonnell Douglas aircraft. The French Sextant group, formed by the merger of Aerospatiale's and Thomson CSF's avionics interests to rationalise this sector of the French state-controlled aerospace industry, is the main avionics supplier of European Airbus airliners. The idea of the partnership followed an earlier unsuccessful attempt by the two companies to bid jointly for the aircraft information management system (AIMS) of Boeing's new 777 widebody airliner two years ago. Although the AIMS contract was ultimately won by Honeywell, Smiths Industries and Collins felt there were strong synergies between the two companies and decided to discuss a broader alliance, Mr Thornton said.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 108m leveraged buy-out at Devro A BUSINESS which dominates the British market for sausage skins has come to the rescue of that recently most unfashionable piece of financial engineering, the leveraged buy-out. Scotland will be the headquarters of the international sausage casing manufacturer Devro, which has moved into independent ownership through a Pounds 107.7m management-led buy-out from its US parent Johnson and Johnson, the healthcare group. The buy-out has been masterminded by Charterhouse Development Capital, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The deal has been carefully structured to take account of Scottish sensibilities. A previous buy-out in 1989 was abandoned after attracting considerable hostile reaction from Scottish politicians and trade unions. Devro has guaranteed the jobs of all 600 people it employs at its plants in Moodiesburn, outside Glasgow, and Bellshill in Lanarkshire. It also has manufacturing facilities in New Jersey, Canada and Australia. Although the headquarters of the independent company will be at Moodiesburn, it aims to continue to expand, notably in the Far East and Europe. Last year it made operating profits of Pounds 17.6m on turnover of Pounds 70.1m. Devro's chairman and chief executive is Mr Frank de Angeli, 65, a former main board director of Johnson and Johnson, who retired at the end of 1989. He will be based in London, but will travel extensively between Scotland and the overseas operations. Although the sausage market is slowly declining in mature developed regions such as the UK, Mr Angeli said there was growing demand for the group's products in areas such as the Far East, as younger people adopt more Western tastes. Charterhouse will be the main institutional investor. The others participating in the Pounds 30m of institutional equity are Baring, Citicorp, Clydesdale, County NatWest, Dunedin and Standard Life. Senior debt finance of Pounds 68m has been provided by a syndicate of international banks led by the First National Bank of Chicago, Industrial Bank of Japan and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mezzanine finance of Pounds 12.2m has been provided by a syndicate led by Mezzanine Management. Mr Gordon Bonnyman, managing director of Charterhouse, said Devro was a textbook candidate for a buy-out with a quality product and high earnings. It was not too highly geared, with the interest bill covered twice by operating profits.</p>

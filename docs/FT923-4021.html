			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Education: mixed messages and incompatible grades Sir, In the debate on a broad-based examination I would like to offer a few comments on the International Baccalaureate as compared with A-levels. There is no doubt that the IB offers a demanding but flexible mix of numerate, social and scientific subjects, with three subjects on a higher level and three on a subsidiary level in addition to training in the basics of philosophy. A very satisfactory level of Allgemeinbildung, or general education, is achieved, allowing direct access to all university systems. There is, however, a real objection to the IB as far as UK university admissions are concerned: the grading levels range from 7 to 1, with 7 being the best grade. In the UK 7 is equivalent to A, 6 to B and 5 corresponds to a C in the A-level system. This puts IB students clearly at a disadvantage in the admission procedure. It would be highly desirable if admission officers took account of that. W Petzny, managing director, Erdoelchemie, Cologne, Germany</p>

All are aware of the  bad situation of human rights in Kosova. I know that the issue  of Albanians is more profound and it is not limited only to  human rights," Vesna Peshic, chairman of Civil Alliance Party in  Belgrade said in an interview with the independent newspaper  DITA INFORMACION.    Vesnia Peshic, professor of philosophy and sociology at the  Belgrade University, is considered by Milovan Gjilasi, the most  renowned Yugoslav dissident, as the only representative of the  opposition that should be appreciated. Mrs. Peshic wrote in the  book A Goridan Knot, should it be cut or...? that thus far it  has been spoken of Albanians raping the Serbs but statistics  show of the opposite. Because of this attitude Mrs. Pashic was  declared traitor by the Belgrade government.</p>

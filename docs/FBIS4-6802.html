			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesia hopes that the PRC Government does not  doubt its determination and ability to swiftly cope with the  riots in Medan, North Sumatera, which have threatened the safety  of the ethnic Chinese community.    Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said this in Jakarta today in  response to a statement issued by (Wu Chiaming), spokesman of  the PRC Foreign Ministry, calling on the Indonesian Government  to immediately curb the demonstrations by workers in Medan which  led to anti-Chinese riots.    The Indonesian Government's determination to deal with the  riots was reflected in the remarks by President Suharto and  other high-ranking officials who sought to take strong action  against the rioters because the demonstrations led to  destruction acts based on the sensitive SARA [tribal, religious,  racial, and intergrouping conflicts] issues.</p>

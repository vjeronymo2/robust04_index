			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> LUNCHES TO COST 10 MORE  </P> <P> Lunch at Culver City elementary schools will cost a dime more next year.  </P> <P> The price increase, approved Tuesday by the Culver City Board of Education,  will help offset losses in the cafeteria due to increased costs for salaries  and food.  </P> <P> Because of cutbacks in government surplus cheese and other items, food costs  have gone up almost 20% this year and are expected to rise at least another 10%  next year, according to the district.  </P> <P> The school cafeterias this year will show a total loss of $35,000 to $40,000,  according to the district's food service department.  </P> <P> Elementary school lunches, which have cost $1.25 for two years, will be $1.35.  In addition, profit-making food items such as pizza, French fries, nachos,  cookies and diet fruit sodas will be sold a la carte at Culver City middle and  high schools, a food service report stated. Samples of possible a la carte  offerings will be given to students to determine which are most popular,  district officials said.  </P> <P> Middle and high school lunches will remain at $1.75.  </P></p>

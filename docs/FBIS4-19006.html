			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on  Tuesday [12 April] received Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jassim Bin-Jabuur  al Thani, foreign minister of Qatar, for talks. Shaykh Hamad,  who has been in Bonn since Monday, is discussing possibilities  to increase cooperation between Germany and the Arabic Gulf  emirate with the Federal Government and Bundestag deputies. The  two countries are negotiating an agreement in the spheres of  economic cooperation, investment protection, double taxation,  aviation, and cultural exchange.    According to statements from the Foreign Ministry, Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel and Shaykh Hamad in a meeting last night  agreed to conclude these negotiations as quickly as possible.  Bonn would also try to further extend relations between the  European Union [EU] and the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the  community of the six Arabic Gulf monarchies -- during the German  EU presidency (second half of 1994).    Before his meeting with Kohl, the Qatari foreign minister  held talks with Hans Stercken, chairman of the Bundestag's  Foreign Committee; Reinhard Goehner, parliamentary secretary in  the Economics Ministry; and Friedrich Bohl, head of the  Chancellor's Office. Tonight, the foreign minister is scheduled  to meet Joerg Schoenbohm, state secretary in the Defense  Ministry, for talks.    With exports worth 192 million German marks [DM] in 1993,  Germany was one of the most important supply countries for Qatar  (after Japan, the United States, and Britain). Qatar's exports  to the FRG, mainly crude oil, only amounted to DM8 million.</p>

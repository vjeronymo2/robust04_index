			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled interview with Valentin Kovalev, deputy </F> chairman of the State Duma, by correspondent V.Perfilyev; place  and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Perfilyev] Valentin Alekseyevich, the State  Duma is to continue its work tomorrow. So, what are the  priority aims you are setting yourselves?    [Kovalev] The first package of bills the State Duma will  adopt urgently concerns the economic sphere of our state's life.  What concept are we proceeding from in doing this? Nowhere in  the world is there such a thing as a free market, an absolutely  free market. Therefore, if we strive for a free market, we are  going nowhere -- mankind has long gone elsewhere. There exists  a regulated market, and moreover, I am going to utter a word  which is not at all popular in our country at the moment -- a  market which can be planned. [passage omitted]    It is important to overcome the crisis resulting from  nonpayments; it is important to restore economic ties that have  been severed. If necessary, the question of the composition of  enterprises may be raised. [passage omitted]    Now about some of our plans in more detail. It happens that  the military-industrial complex plays an important role in our  country's economy. One can be critical of such an orientation  of our economy in the past, but nevertheless this is a fact  which we cannot disregard. Therefore, our goal is to rebuild  the high technology market and to reestablish our status on the  world market.    [Perfilyev] Judging by your attitude to economic issues and  to how reforms should be carried out, the State Duma should have  no problems with the government and with the policy of reform  currently being pursued by Viktor Chernomyrdin?    [Kovalev] The Russian Federation State Duma will have its  own  point of view on these issues. As for the new government, we  are planning to hear a report of the chairman of the Council of  Ministers on this matter. I think this will help to clarify  many points and to determine the Duma's standpoint with regard  to the present government and to the economic development of the  country as a whole. [passage omitted]    We also have a number of questions to the government, some  of  them not too pleasant. One of them concerns privatization. We  consider that the issue of privatization should be viewed from a  broader angle. [passage omitted] We consider that other forms  of reorganization and denationalization are possible. More  specifically, a large group of deputies believes that the fixed  capital of enterprises could be transferred to work collectives  which would be responsible for its operational management, while  the products made by those work collectives should certainly be  their property and be fully owned and disposable by them.    [Perfilyev] Valentin Alekseyevich, many officials in our  country have undertaken to fight crime but somehow their  attempts have always fallen through. Will the State Duma be  able to do anything in this respect?    [Kovalev] I can give you my own view on why those laws have  never worked. The reason is that they have not been aimed to  affect the causes and conditions from which crime springs.  [passage omitted] Our viewers should know that issues of  fighting crime are in the focus of attention of the State Duma.  At this time we are preparing a large package of special  proposals aimed at combating corruption and fighting organized  crime. Possibly as soon as next Friday we shall discuss a  number of amendments and additions to the criminal code. The  amendments will include expanding the limits of self-defense  [weapons and devices]    [Perfilyev] You attend all the sessions and have inside  information about the life of the State Duma. Would you like to  sketch a collective potrait of the State Duma for our viewers?    [Kovalev] The people who have been elected are people who  act  and not just talk. They know how to work and how to translate  their words into deeds. So I think the Duma has very good  prospects.</p>

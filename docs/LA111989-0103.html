			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER AND GROWTH  </P> <P> Kudos goes to staff writer Bill Billiter for his perceptive articles expressing  the "essence" of South County's water problems.  </P> <P> Ah, yes! The initial water crisis was over by September for San Clemente and  the other customers of the Tri-Cities district; however, the water shortage  problems were not.  </P> <P> Billiter's articles stressed the need not only for emergency conservation  measures but also for a permanent allocation plan -- a plan urged and  supported. After all, four customers shared a single, finite water source. They  will continue to share a single supply. Yet San Clemente, the largest and  fastest-growing customer, has not recognized the need for the plan.  </P> <P> Projected additional supplies are not guaranteed, and reclaimed water  facilities won't release enough potable water to satisfy future demands,  according to staff. Where does the city go from here? Councilman Tom Lorch  wanted to know too, the only council member to express concern about the  growth-water issue. More's the pity.  </P> <P> KAROLINE KOESTER  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Swan song Today an era ends on Tyneside, when the HMS Richmond, the last of 2,700 ships built by the 134-year-old Swan Hunter shipyard, leaves the river. Next week it will be handed over to the Royal Navy. Its departure from the Wallsend yard signals the company's closure and the probable end of shipbuilding on the Tyne. Swans has been in receivership since May 1993, and the closure of the north-east's last shipbuilding yard is hardly a surprise. But it is nonetheless of great symbolic importance: it underlines the region's decline over a century as one of the world's leading centres of heavy industry. Of more practical consequence, the closure will cost jobs in an area with the highest regional unemployment rate on the British mainland. Swan Hunter employed 2,400 people when it went into receivership; it now has only 400 left, most of whom will go within days, although sales of subsidiaries have preserved some jobs. Those losing their livelihoods might well ask why the government has seen fit to use public funds to attract inward investment to the region, such as the electronics factory opened by Samsung, but would not prop up Swan Hunter. The sums should be kept in perspective; while the region is economically depressed, it will continue to receive large transfers from central government in the form of unemployment benefits, which dwarf the industrial subsidies in question. That point made, the government's strategy in backing Samsung not Swans is right. The Samsung project, which could bring 3,000 jobs to the region, has received Pounds 80m out of the Pounds 450m total cost of the project in government and regional subsidies. However electronics is a growth industry, and the record of inward investment in providing training, jobs and growth is good, particularly in the north-east, which prides itself on being the magnet within the UK for far eastern manufacturing investment. No such case could be made for Swan Hunter. It has been increasingly dependent on military work, a dwindling market. Moreover, the cost-plus basis of many contracts has encouraged a high-quality but high-cost culture ill-suited to the demands of world competition. While shipbuilding is clearly not dying worldwide, civil orders are pursued ferociously by South Korea and Japan; indeed the OECD has warned that planned Korean expansion could lead to overcapacity and international price-cutting wars. It is far from clear that subsidising Swan Hunter would have enabled it to compete. France, which has subsidised its industry heavily and has threatened to veto limits on such aids agreed in the OECD this summer, has nonetheless seen its industry decline. The north-east's record in attracting inward investment is admirable. That is of more future value than propping up dying symbols of its past success.</p>

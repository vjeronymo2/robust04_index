			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP WEDNESDAY;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3-A SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> IRVINE SLAMS TWO HOME RUNS, BEATS SADDLEBACK, 3-0  </P> <P> The Saddleback High School softball team had never seen its freshman pitcher,  Desi Abrego, give up a home run -- until Tuesday. Then Irvine first baseman  Cheryl Dunmeyer hit one over center fielder Claudia Rodriguez's head in the  first inning.  </P> <P> So Saddleback's outfielders moved back.  </P> <P> But not far enough.  </P> <P> In the third, Irvine pitcher Jennifer Brundage sent a towering fly ball over  Rodriguez's head for another home run in the Vaqueros' 3-0 victory at  Saddleback in the second round of the Southern Section 3-A softball playoffs.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros (19-7-1) will play Saugus, a 2-0 winner over Culver City, in the  quarterfinals Thursday.  </P> <P> "Jennifer's home run I think was the critical blow," Irvine Coach Phil Dunmeyer  said. "They had already backed up after the first home run and she still got it  past them."  </P> <P> Irvine's power at the plate and on the mound was more than Saddleback bargained  for.  </P> <P> "We are not used to someone tagging (Abrego) that hard," Saddleback Coach  Yvonne Alonzo said. "I think everybody kind of let down a bit. To see that  happen to her . . . the whole team kind of went, 'Whoa! Somebody can hit this  girl.' "  </P> <P> Abrego (19-5) struck out three, gave up five hits and a walk, and the  Roadrunners committed three errors. Brundage (16-7) pitched a two-hitter,  striking out 10.  </P> <P> "She's a lot better than we expected," Alonzo said of Brundage. "She has a  wicked curveball that was getting the kids inside and her riseball was working  for her today."  </P> <P> Saddleback had runners on base only three times and none advanced beyond second  as Brundage got excellent support from her defense, which committed only one  error.  </P> <P> Saddleback designated hitter Kim Carstens singled to left in the third with two  outs, but Rodriguez flied out. Rodriguez singled to center in the sixth and  stole second with two outs. She, too, was left on base when Leann Larriva  struck out.  </P> <P> In the seventh, shortstop Nikkanni Andrews reached when Irvine third baseman  Sam Lutsch dropped a line drive for the Vaqueros' only error. But Irvine  catcher Lisa Goodwin picked off Andrews at first, and Brundage struck out the  next two batters to end the game.  </P> <P> Irvine scored its final run in the bottom of the fifth. With two outs and  Brooke Carpenter on first on a fielder's choice, Abrego walked pinch-hitter  Jennie Matthews. Carrie Caudill then hit a ground ball to Andrews, whose throw  to third was late, loading the bases.  </P> <P> Erica Koch then singled to center, scoring Carpenter.  </P> <P> In other 3-A games:  </P> <P> Montclair 3, El Toro 1 -- Carrie Fredricks had a two-run single with two outs  in the sixth to give Montclair (23-4) a 2-1 lead at El Toro. Winning pitcher  Martha Vargas allowed five hits and struck out four. Jennifer Jourdan (5-6)  also pitched a five-hitter, striking out seven, but took the loss.  </P> <P> San Clemente 3, West Torrance 2 -- Tara Rouse had an RBI double with no outs in  the fifth for San Clemente (13-12). Rouse (11-7) pitched a four-hitter,  striking out 10, for the victory. She also hit a solo home run in the first.  </P></p>

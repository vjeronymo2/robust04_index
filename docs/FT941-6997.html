			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: OFT targets funerals The Office of Fair Trading this week launched an inquiry into the pre-paid funeral industry. Only relatively few British people have chosen to organise their own funerals while still alive although the idea is big business in the United States and has begun to catch on in the UK. But the collapse of one UK firm, Will Writing Services, the business of which included selling pre-paid funerals, has drawn attention to the fact that the sector is not subject to any regulation. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the OFT's director-general who announced the inquiry, said: 'The financial implications of the growth of pre-paid funerals are considerable.' If only a quarter of the 20m people in the UK over 50 bought pre-paid funerals at an average of Pounds 1,000, the money involved would add up to Pounds 5bn. Carsberg added that the funds would not be regulated or safeguarded by any legislation because they represented advance payments for services and did not fall within the definition of savings, investments or insurance. The OFT's main concern is to protect consumers' money by ensuring it is kept separate from funeral companies' other funds and monitored by independent trustees. But officials also are worried that over-elaborate and expensive funerals could be sold to vulnerable or elderly people who were unable, or too confused, to resist the salesman's blandishments. Four main companies offer pre-paid funeral plans in the UK: Chosen Heritage (the largest), Dignity, Golden Charter, and the Co-operative Wholesale Society. All are linked to existing large funeral businesses or networks of funeral directors. They offer a range of funeral plans, from basic to ostentatious, some of which can be tailor-made. Although the pre-paid funerals industry is still fairly small, it has two rival trade organisations: the National Association of Pre-paid Funeral Plans (leading members: Chosen Heritage and Dignity) and the Funeral Planning Council (leading members: CWS Funeral Services and Golden Charter). The NAPF this week launched a code of practice covering the monitoring of investments, advertising guidelines, and procedures for handling complaints. The FPC is still working on its version. Age Concern, the charity, has links with the Chosen Heritage scheme. It has published a check list of information customers should get before buying a pre-paid funeral plan. This includes: Does the money go into an independent trust fund, separate from the other assets of the company? Does the plan guarantee to cover the cost of a specified funeral service, no matter how far in the future the need arises and how much costs have risen? Does the plan cover the full cost of the funeral, or are there extra services which will need to be paid for at the time of the funeral? Is the plan portable (in case you move), or can your money be refunded?

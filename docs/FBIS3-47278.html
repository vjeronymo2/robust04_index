Upon receiving the birthday table amid blessings of all  people that day, the old woman and her family, relatives and  villagers expressed boundless thanks and reverence for the dear  leader who bestowed deep benevolence on her, caring for the  birthday of an unknown old woman who has lived an ordinary life.    Born into a poor peasant family in a mountainous village in  Changjin County, South Hamgyong Province, on January 6, 1894,  she managed to eke out a living by doing farming. She could not  learn abc, without her proper full name. It was not until Korea  was liberated in 1945 that she could live a worthy and happy  life as master of the country.    The number of people who enjoy longevity is on a steady  increase thanks to the popular health policy in the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea.</p>

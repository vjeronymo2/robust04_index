			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Canadian Tire plans further expansion CANADIAN Tire, a 425-store hardware, sports and leisure goods and car parks chain, is improving margins and planning further expansion, says president Mr Stephen Bachand, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The icon of Canadian retailing for 25 years, Canadian Tire took some heavy blows from internal fighting for control and the recent long recession. Mr Bachand, an American who has turned around a similar operation in the US, told Toronto analysts sales were up nearly 9 per cent in the first eight months of this year. He said the company was reaping benefits from gains in distribution efficiency and improved accounting systems at the store level. He is developing larger stores to compete with warehouse chains, after two pilot operations exceeded forecast results. However, the US subsidiary will not be expanded until it reaches profitability. He expects 1994 group earnings to be slightly better than 1992's CDollars 72.3m (USDollars 54.8m), or 80 cents a share.</p>

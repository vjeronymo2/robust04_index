			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Current account surplus down Japan's current account surplus fell 9.6 per cent in September from a year earlier, the second consecutive monthly decline in the dollar-denominated surplus. The finance ministry reported yesterday that the seasonally adjusted current account balance for the month was Dollars 10.5bn. The country's trade surplus in the same period was Dollars 12.1bn, down by 3.9 per cent on a year ago. Exports rose by 8.1 per cent to Dollars 32.8bn, while imports were up sharply by 16.6 per cent to Dollars 20.7bn. The figures provide further confirmation that the combination of a strong yen and a reviving economy are starting to make small inroads into the country's enormous external surpluses. In the three months to September the current account surplus fell by 6.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter. In yen terms the surplus has been falling for several months, but until the July-September quarter the dollar-denominated surplus had been rising as the higher yen raised export prices and cut the cost of imports. It now appears that the strengthening currency has begun to be reflected in export and import volumes and, as a result, the surplus is declining in dollar terms. But the pace of the decline is still painfully slow and is unlikely to take the pressure off the yen, which has reached new highs against the dollar in the last week.</p>

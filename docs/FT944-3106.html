			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Pakistan move on violence Pakistan's ruling and opposition parties temporarily put aside their squabbling yesterday to agree on a concerted effort to try to end violence in Karachi which has killed at least 93 people in two weeks. The National Assembly unanimously decided to set up a committee to investigate the causes and propose remedies to solve the ethnic, sectarian and political violence in Pakistan's commercial capital. The rare bipartisan accord came as a Moslem Shia leader warned of a bloodbath in Karachi unless the government acted in the wake of Tuesday's killing of three Shias in separate shootings. The violence has gained in intensity since army troops ended two-and-a-half years of law enforcement duties in the port city recently.</p>

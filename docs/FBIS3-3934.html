BCE Director Chen Xiong said 60 million yuan ($6.9 million)  of treasury bond futures are traded each day at the exchange.    Speaking yesterday at the exchange's first meeting of member  companies, he said transaction value in bond futures at BCE has  been 1.3 billion yuan ($149.4 million) since it opened on  December 15 last year.    Futures trading in treasury bonds started on the Shanghai  Stock Exchange last October.    Chen said prospects for the market are rosy since China  plans  to issue 1OO billion yuan ($11.4 billion) worth of treasury  bonds this year.    More importantly, the People's Bank of China's open market  operation is to start this year.    Its control of the money supply through buying and selling  government bonds should improve futures trading, Chen said.    BCE officials said treasury bonds, along with corn, bean,  sugar and copper futures are the most actively traded products  on the exchange.    And since it opened, total transaction value at the BCE has  topped 8 billion yuan ($919 million).    More than 500 people from the exchange's 225 member  companies  attended yesterday's meeting.</p>

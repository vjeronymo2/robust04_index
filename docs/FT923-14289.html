			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Stormy forecasts IT HAS been a particularly chastening recession for Britain's economists. Spotting turning points is the hardest task for economic forecasters, as well as their raison d'etre. But their recent record has been particularly bad. Having failed to predict the recession, most economists have been expecting Britain's recessionary cloud to lift for a year or more. Yet, defying the forecasts, it just keeps raining all the time. Mocking economists is a rather cheap, if satisfying, pastime. Many professions require some ability to read the future; and politicians, business executives and journalists have all been fooled by the stormy nature of this cycle. Yet accurate forecasts remain as necessary for policy-makers and wage-bargainers as for business. How far-sighted, then, of the Treasury to commission an investigation into recent forecasting performance. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research may not be the most independent of auditors or unbiased of critics. Nor is the main conclusion of its preliminary report particularly earth-shattering. Extrapolating the past into the immediate future is not much help when the immediate future is radically different from the immediate past: this point has surely sunk in by now. Yet the NIESR report does implicitly criticise the funding policy of the Economic and Social Research Council. The bulk of the government's Pounds 2m budget, on top of the funds spent on the Treasury's own model, funds two other models, at the NIESR and the London Business School. Both are similar in design to the Treasury model, and all three have made very similar errors since 1985. Yet more iconoclastic (and recently more successful) forecasting teams at Cambridge, Liverpool and City universities have all had their funding withdrawn over the past decade. The public interest would be better served by a policy that promoted choice and diversity rather than a cosy cartel of like-minded clones. The fault, however, lies not with the models themselves, but with those who use them. Politicians, journalists and economists have treated econometric models with undue reverence. Forecasts of the economy do, in fact, deserve to be treated as sceptically as those of British weather.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A mother's 21-month jail stay should end because further incarceration won't  end a bitter child custody battle or persuade her to reveal where she has  hidden her daughter, a Washington appeals court was told. Dr. Elizabeth Morgan,  a prominent plastic surgeon, was sent to the District of Columbia Jail on civil  contempt charges in August, 1987, after refusing to produce her daughter Hilary  for court-ordered visits with Eric Foretich, Morgan's ex-husband and the girl's  father. Morgan said she hid the girl because Foretich had sexually abused her;  Foretich has denied those charges. Morgan has been in prison ever since, and  the 6-year-old Hilary's whereabouts are unknown. "She will not trade her  freedom for her daughter's safety," Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, told a  three-judge District of Columbia Court of Appeals panel that was reviewing a  lower court judge's decision to keep Morgan behind bars.  </P></p>

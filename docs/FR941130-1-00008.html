			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Section 945.22 Districts currently specifies the original districts which had been established in 1941. The order has authority in &sect;945.23 to change districts through informal rulemaking. In 1972, new districts were established, based on the significant changes in industry conditions since the order was first issued in 1941. The proposal simply updates the Districts section to list the current districts. This change would also bring the district listings in &sect;945.22 in conformity with the listings specified in &sect;945.130 Reestablishment of districts and reapportionment of committee membership of the rules and regulations. It is hereby recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;945.22 be revised by listing the current districts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The proposed amendment to &sect;945.23 Redistricting would revise the heading to read ``Redistricting and reapportionment'', and would reapportion committee membership. No new authority is being proposed. Existing provisions are simply being rearranged for easier reference. In &sect;945.20 it is recommended that authority be provided for a seed producer member and alternate to serve on the committee representing District No. 1. The section should continue to provide flexibility to reestablish districts within the production area, reapportion committee membership among the various districts, and change committee size and composition. Section 945.24 Selection currently specifies committee membership as it was constituted prior to being reapportioned in 1972. The order has authority in &sect;945.23 to reapportion committee membership among the various districts through informal rulemaking. The proposal is simply to update the listing to the current apportionment. District No. 1 is shown as consisting of two producer members and one handler member, with their respective alternates. The proponents testified that District No. 1's representation should be shown as three producer members (one to be a new seed producer position) and one handler member, with their respective alternates. District No. 2 specifies one producer member and one handler member, with their respective alternates. No revision in this representation is needed for District No. 2. District No. 3 currently lists two producer members and one handler member, with their respective alternates. The proponents testified that it should show one producer member position (after one had been moved to District No. 1, to now provide a new seed producer member position). Therefore, District No. 3 membership should be revised to provide for one producer member and one handler member, with their respective alternates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future representation should be as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary, as significant changes occur in the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also &sect;945.24 Selection, should be revised to eliminate paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) which lists the committee membership apportionment for Districts Nos. 1, 2 and 3, to avoid redundancy in the language as recommended in &sect;945.23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the recommended revision of &sect;945.20 Establishment and membership that adds a paragraph requiring that the committee, at least every six years, review committee size, composition, and representation, and recommend any changes to reflect developments in the industry, &sect;945.23 should also be revised by adding a similar paragraph specifying that at least every six years the committee should review industry changes and recommend any necessary redistricting, reapportioning, or change in committee size or composition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Paragraph (a) of &sect;945.30 Procedure should be revised to require a simple majority of all members of the committee, including alternates acting for members, to constitute a quorum or to pass any motion or approve any committee action, except any motion regarding a change in committee size shall require a unanimous vote. Currently, there is an eight-member committee, and five members are necessary to constitute a quorum and to pass any action. The proponents have testified that the committee should have the authority to recommend changes in the size of the committee to adjust to future changes in the industry. Any size increase approved by the Secretary would necessitate a corresponding change in the number required for a quorum and to pass any action. Rather than specify all the possible combinations of such numbers, record evidence supports adoption of the proponents' proposed language that a quorum be a simple majority. This would simplify procedures if the committee size is changed. Therefore, it is hereby recommended that &sect;945.30 Procedure be amended by specifying that a simple majority of all members, including alternates acting for members, shall be necessary to constitute a quorum to pass any motion or approve any committee action, except any motion regarding a change in committee size shall require a unanimous vote. Changing the committee size is such a significant action that it should be favored by all committee members. It was testified that a near unanimous vote would not suffice, even if it might give one member veto power over the committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt German government bonds have had a bumpy ride, rallying sharply over the Christmas period, selling off last Tuesday and recouping some of those losses towards the end of the week. The Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged at last Thursday's council meeting, and statements from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its president, that rates would be kept on hold for the time being, gave some support to the long end of the yield curve as well as the D-Mark. Bunds were further underpinned by the strength of the US Treasuries market following the release of slightly weaker-than-expected US jobless numbers on Friday. In the absence of market-moving data, German bonds this week are expected to trade within a narrow range, with the March bund future seen fluctuating roughly between levels of 100.90 and 101.30. Meanwhile, Bundesbank watchers are eagerly awaiting the release of January inflation data and M3 money supply numbers, which are expected next week, for further clues to the pace of monetary easing. Until then, fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements at 6 per cent for the next two weeks will keep rate-cut speculation to a bare minimum.</p>

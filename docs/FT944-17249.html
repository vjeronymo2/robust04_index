			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / German Elections: Business reluctant to buy Scharping - The SPD leader's bid for the management vote Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat (SPD) leader, was out of luck when he went trawling for a big-fish business name to join his election campaign team at the end of August. The best he could net was Mr Daniel Goeudevert, the fallen and faded star of the Volkswagen management board, most recently spotted earning a crust as a model in a computer advertisement. Although he has angled deftly - no thanks to Mr Goeudevert's suggestion that the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism was not as red as it was painted - Mr Scharping looks like having equally little luck catching the management-class vote at next weekend's federal election. According to a poll of 500 German managers last week, a mere 8 per cent consider Mr Scharping a suitable chancellor. And while only about 48 per cent of the population at large say they will vote for the current coalition parties, 78 per cent of managers are backing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's alliance of Christian Democrats, the Christian Social Union and liberal Free Democrats. The fact that a solid 80 per cent prefer Mr Kohl to Mr Scharping appears to be at odds with the regular blasts delivered in the chancellor's direction by such eminent industrial mouthpieces as Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the federal chamber of trade and industry. But the better-the-devil-you-know factor is clearly at work. Although Mr Stihl, heard earlier this year comparing Bonn's economic policy and Germany's economic future with the style and prospects of a local league soccer side, has not recanted, he has since decided that the government's own-goal scoring rate would be even worse under the SPD. His opinion has doubtless been coloured by the calculations - and activities  -of number-crunchers in Frankfurt. Foreign analysts in particular have advised their employers to prepare sell orders for D-Mark investments in the event of accidents such as the induction of Chancellor Scharping. A precautionary sell-off which last week helped drive the Frankfurt stock exchange's DAX index of 30 leading shares down to the year's low is also likely to have played a role in consolidating corporate support for the status quo in Bonn. German analysts, typically, have been more circumspect so far and expect the shock of any change to wear off quickly. But their main guiding principle has been a common if Delphic view elicited in an informal FT sampling of German business opinion on the outcome of the election. There is a standard reply to questions on the result: 'We do not expect any major changes/surprises/shocks.' This portmanteau attitude, while apparently supportive of Mr Kohl, also encapsulates the rose-tinted expectation that even if the SPD joins government in a grand coalition with the conservatives  -judged in business circles to be the second most likely outcome to a continuation of the present government - it will mean business as usual. As Mr Adolf Rosenstock, senior economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, points out, the SPD has been a de facto coalition partner for years. Since it commands a majority in the Bundesrat or upper house of parliament, which enjoys considerable powers to block legislation, the solution of important differences has long demanded compromise and consensus-building. However, such bright-eyed scenarios appear to be based on the shaky assumption that the decent, charming Mr Scharping would be able to smother the ambitions and voices of his more bumptious election-campaign cohorts, Mr Gerhard Schroder, Lower Saxony premier, and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the vinegary prime minister from the Saar. Mr Schroder, who runs an active, interventionist economics policy in his home state, makes no secret of his view that he would make a better chancellor than his official party leader. He certainly emerged favourably from last week's poll of managerial opinion in which 50 per cent of the interviewees said they would rather have him as economics minister than the present incumbent, Mr Gunther Rexrodt. Sadly, they were not asked the question Mr Schroder and many others of all party hues would like to hear answered: how he is rated against Mr Kohl?</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS says aluminium output to fall by more than 10% ALUMINIUM OUTPUT in the Commonwealth of Independent States this year is expected to fall by more than 10 per cent from the 1992 level, according to CIS industry officials. They also want aluminium exports to go no higher than 1m tonnes - more than 20 per cent below last year's estimated total. The revised CIS forecasts were given to a team from VAW Aluminium of Germany, the first delegation from the western industry to visit their Russian counterparts this year. Mr Karl Wobbe, VAW's management board member responsible for aluminium production, said yesterday that, in spite of the extreme pressures on the CIS industry, which was very short of raw materials and capital, the production target was realistic. 'The CIS industry did not collapse last year and we don't expect disaster will overtake it in 1993. So CIS exports will continue at a high level this year and so will the problems they create for the rest of the world aluminium industry. Prices will not go up from present low levels unless western smelters make more production cuts,' he said. Mr Wobbe said industry representatives estimate that CIS primary aluminium output in 1992 reached 3.1m tonnes, not far below estimated capacity of 3.5m to 3.6m tonnes and slightly higher than production forecasts made at an industry gathering in St Petersburg in September. For a variety of reasons, however, they expected 1993 production to fall to 2.675m tonnes. CIS officials said that licences for the export of 735,000 tonnes of aluminium were issued last year and another 150,000 tonnes was officially exported under joint-venture arrangements, making a total of 885,000 tonnes. However, they estimated that there was at least another 400,000 tonnes of uncontrolled and unlicensed exports, including some directly from smelters. Mr Wobbe said that Mr Gregory Maslov, head of the state-controlled Aluminium Committee, set up in November and which seemed likely to take prime responsibility for the CIS industry, wanted to cut exports by 400,000 tonnes this year to leave more metal available for the domestic market. However, the smelters wanted to export 200,000 tonnes on their own account. Even so, the committee still hoped to keep exports at no more than 1m tonnes. In order to keep a tighter hold on exports, Russia increased aluminium export duties from 50 Ecu (Pounds 39.25) a tonne at the end of 1992 to 130 Ecu for primary aluminium and to 205 Ecu for bartered metal. To discourage exports of primary metal disguised as 'scrap', the duty on aluminium scrap had been lifted to 460 Ecu a tonne. Officials estimated that proceeds from nearly half the aluminium exported by the CIS last year - about 600,000 tonnes - were used to buy alumina (aluminium oxide) and other raw materials from the west so the CIS smelters could continue producing metal. 'The aluminium committee wants stronger control of exports, but whether it will succeed is another matter,' said Mr Wobbe. 'They (the CIS industry) are begining to understand something about the free market and that you cannot continue for ever producing at a loss.' Alusuisse-Lonza said yesterday that overcapacity in the world primary aluminium industry and low prices were forcing it to close its Steg smelter in the Canton of Valais, Reuter reports from Zurich. Last year the smelter produced 48,000 tonnes of metal compared with its capacity of 50,000 tonnes. About 100 jobs will be lost when production ends in the autumn next year. Inespal, Spain's state-owned aluminium producer, has told unions it wants to cut 34,000 tonnes a year from the output of its La Coruna smelter, Reuter reports from Madrid. It produced 79,000 tonnes in 1992, and 39,000 tonnes from its Aviles smelter.</p>

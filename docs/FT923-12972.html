			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Belgian bank shareholders split over its partnership strategy DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert yesterday urged investors to find a quick solution to the strategic questions that threaten to undermine the Belgian bank's shareholder structure. But the board failed to indicate whether the bank would be better off forging commercial links with an international or a domestic partner. The group's shareholders are split over strategy. BBL is under pressure from Internationale Nederlanden (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance group, to enter into a form of collaboration. At the same time, influential Belgian investors - notably Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the holding company - would like BBL to link up with Credit Communal, the publicly-owned Belgian credit institution. ING announced on Tuesday that it had increased its stake in the Belgian bank to just over 10 per cent. At yesterday's board meeting, BBL directors 'took note' of ING's wishes, and said they wanted to position the bank 'favourably for its further development'. They urged shareholders 'to find a rapid solution in order to ensure the stability of its shareholding'. Another board meeting is fixed for September 17, but a BBL spokesman said: 'The discussion is not really in the boardroom any more - it's rather a debate between investors.' A report to the bank's executive committee by Credit Suisse First Boston has indicated that an international strategy would offer more advantages to BBL than a domestic move. BBL managers have also indicated they would prefer an international link-up. BBL's complex shareholder structure is dominated by GBL, which controls 24.16 per cent of the bank directly and through subsidiaries. The holding company is headed by Mr Albert Frere, who is believed to favour keeping BBL Belgian. Last week he and his subsidiaries sold a 5.7 per cent stake in BBL to Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, which has Credit Communal as its principal shareholder. GBL also heads a long-standing syndicate of BBL's main shareholders, which must offer their shares to GBL first if they decide to sell. The first-refusal clause in the syndicate agreement expires at the end of this year. Lex, Page 20</p>

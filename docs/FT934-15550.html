			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (4): Cold comfort for the jobless - Half a million are without work SITTING IN his fifth floor office high above Helsinki's central Esplanade, Mr Ilkka Kanerva, Finland's youthful Minister of Labour, offers no quick solutions to the country's unemployment crisis, which has left one in five workers out of a job after three years of deep recession. Indeed, he expects the underlying trend to carry on rising for another year, in spite of the country's recent export success. He believes the rate may not start to fall noticeably for 18 months. 'If at the end of the current parliamentary period in two years' time, unemployment is down to 15 per cent, it will be a good achievement,' he says. Finland now has Europe's second highest unemployment rate, with 500,000 people out of a job, but probably nowhere has the total climbed so quickly in such a short period. Only three years ago, the country boasted one of Europe's stronger economies and unemployment was just 4 per cent. The jobless problem has brought remarkably little social tension, and so far at least, many families have been protected from severe hardship by the country's generous welfare system which guarantees good rates of benefit during the first 500 working days that an individual is out of work. Worldwide recession, the sharp slump in the domestic market and the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union have all contributed to the sharp acceleration in the unemployment rate. The worst hit sector, as elsewhere in the Nordic region, has been construction, although there has been widespread rationalisation throughout the manufacturing industry. The good news is that unemployment has probably reached its peak in the metal and engineering sectors, but a far higher level of redundancies in the public sector can be expected over the next 12 months. Unemployment is undoubtedly Finland's main economic problem, alongside its budget deficit and rising foreign debt. And therein lies the main constraint: the government simply does not have the financial resources to stimulate the economy through major infrastructure and investment programmes and it is worried that any sign of fiscal relaxation could further weaken the markka and damage its inflation and interest rate goals. Instead, it is hoping that unemployment will gradually start to come down as part of a broader export-led economic recovery, assisted by the fall in interest rates which are at their lowest level for more than a decade. The budgetary constraints mean that the type of FM10bn stimulation package being proposed by the opposition Social Democrats has little chance of becoming reality. Big infrastructure projects are out for the same reason. That is not to say that nothing is being done. However, the effort is reactive more than proactive and is centred on training and education programmes. Mr Kanerva says that around 250,000 people a year can be offered some form of training, but he accepts that this will have little impact on long-term unemployment, which is set to reach 200,000 people by the end of next year. The broader government effort has been to overhaul the labour market and introduce greater flexibility into the wage bargaining process. The need for such flexibility is a theme which has been repeatedly emphasised by the OECD and it was taken up again by the organisation in its latest report on Finland, published last month. 'The present centralised bargaining framework  -within which the government has, in the past, tended to facilitate wage negotiations by offering expensive fiscal concessions - now appears incompatible with the general thrust of government policy based on budget consolidation,' the OECD stated. But government efforts to overhaul labour market structures have yet to show much success. In the spring, it encountered fierce union opposition, including the threat of a general strike, when it tried to introduce a package of reforms, including a scheme allowing employers to take on jobless youths for 30 per cent less than the minimum wage. The measure was eventually implemented, after agreement with the unions, but in a way which has meant it has had little practical impact. Mr Kanerva concedes that the government's approach might have been heavy- handed, but he insists that the fight for reform will continue. 'The tactic now will be step by step, rather than grand slam,' he states. One scheme he wishes to implement would compel employees to operate a more flexible working schedule, although it would not increase the total number of hours they worked annually. SAK, the blue collar union, says it is prepared to compromise, but only as part of a broader package which tackles unemployment. It believes the government could afford to expand public spending in the short term if agreement on medium-term cuts in public spending could be reached as part of a social pact. It has already identified a number of infrastructure investments which it says could be funded in this way. The union says it is ready to discuss wage rises in the context of job security, investment and training, implicitly linking the question of wage restraint to job creation. The main frustration for the union is apparent government unwillingness to open a dialogue. Mr Kanerva admits that relations are strained, but says this is because the unions have traditionally been aligned with the opposition Social Democrats, rather than with the centre-right parties which are currently in power.</p>

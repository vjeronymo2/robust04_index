			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] According to Hans Meyer, spokesman for the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it seems that the  next working-level contact between North Korea and the IAEA for  negotiations on nuclear inspection will be delayed until next  week.    Spokesman Meyer said that he had expected there would be a  contact between the two sides this week for follow-up  negotiations on the IAEA checklist that was delivered to North  Korea on 9 January [as heard] for inspection of the seven  reported nuclear facilities [haek sisol], and that now it seems  that the next contact will be delayed until next week because  there has been no response from North Korea as of the evening of  14 January.    Regarding this, an IAEA source analyzed that the delay of  the  next contact may be considered a North Korean negotiation  strategy, but he also pointed out the possibility that North  Korea is taking pains in reviewing the details of the IAEA  demand and deciding how to respond to it because of the large  gap between the IAEA and North Korean positions on the nuclear  inspection issue.</p>

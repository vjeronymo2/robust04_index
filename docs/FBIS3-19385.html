The briefing was to be followed by a meeting of IAEA  ambassadors who were to consider the findings of their seven-man  team which was prevented by North Korean officials from fully  carrying out inspections at seven nuclear sites.    IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said an emergency meeting of the  Agency's board of governors could be held later to discuss the  inspections and possibly refer the matter to the UN Security  Council.    Meyer confirmed earlier reports that North Korea had blocked  the inspectors from visiting some nuclear sites but would not  elaborate on the matter. [passage omitted]</p>

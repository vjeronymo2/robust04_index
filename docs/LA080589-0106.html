			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG WHEELCHAIR CAMPERS GET A TASTE OF COMPETITION AT SDSU  </P> <P> When it comes to sports, most disabled children stay on the sidelines. But the  45 children attending the third annual Junior Wheelchair Sports Camp at San  Diego State University this week are getting a taste of competition.  </P> <P> The children, ages 5 through 18, are instructed by counselors, also in  wheelchairs, who are expert in tennis, swimming, track and field, archery and  basketball. The camp was made possible this year with the help of the La Mesa  and San Diego fire departments, which contributed volunteers and funds; the  Easter Seal Society of San Diego and the Lions Club.  </P> <P> Most of the firefighters participating this year are returning volunteers, and  when they found out that the grant that funded the past two camps had run out,  they organized donations and money-raising events. Other organizations donated  the food that is served every day to the campers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Positive Role Models  </P> <P> But another key contribution comes from the people who volunteer to help run  the camp and assist children during lunch and when they change clothes to  participate in the sports, said Marla Knox, a camp coordinator and recreation  leader with the Disabled Services Program of the San Diego Park and Recreation  Department.  </P> <P> The weeklong camp provides not only physical conditioning for the children, but  positive role models as well: the people who have succeeded in life even though  they are in wheelchairs, said Rick Draney, a counselor at the camp who suffered  a spinal-cord injury eight years ago in a car accident.  </P> <P> The campers, most of them from San Diego, are transported by buses donated by  Sharp Rehabilitation Hospital. Each day until 4 p.m., they participate in at  least four activities in one-hour intervals.  </P> <P> A positive attitude is emphasized during the week, and counselors encourage the  children to take part in every sport, Knox said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Can Be Givers'  </P> <P> Mark Shepherd, the camp's basketball instructor, was a police officer in  Northern California until he was injured three years ago and paralyzed from the  waist down. He said the camp allows for social interaction among the campers  and a feeling of equality, which disabled children usually miss out on at  school.  </P> <P> "Working with kids like these lets me know there is something I can give back"  to society, Shepherd said. "Most people think (disabled people) are takers, but  we can be givers, and we are able to take care of ourselves."  </P> <P> Draney, who has been a counselor and director in other camps for disabled  children for six years, said the children at the camp are able to find out what  they can do instead of being told what they can't.  </P> <P> "It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to see their horizons, their vision,  expanded, to see them dream a little more," he said.  </P> <P> Jeremy Gilbert, a 15-year-old camper who has spina bifida, said what he enjoys  most about the camp is the freedom to participate in different sports.  </P> <P> Luke Ture, 11, suffered a spinal-cord injury when he was 2 years old in a car  accident in Germany, and he said he sees the 10 instructors and counselors as  good role models for the children.  </P> <P> "You are getting role models for what you would like to do from people who are  very successful," he said.  </P></p>

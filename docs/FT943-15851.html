			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: Several herrings short of a catch - Cinema STAGGERED (15) Martin Clunes NEEDFUL THINGS (15)Fraser C. Heston WILD TARGET (15) Pierre Salvadori THE SAINT OF FORT WASHINGTON (15) Tim Hunter GO FISH (18)Rose Troche To be a filmgoer is to be caught in an eternal duel for your attention between two weapons: the exclamation point and the question mark. You hope the first will triumph, and that you will be painlessly lanced by delight, hilarity or amazement. More often the second prevails. Queries lodge in your head like fish-hooks. You cannot enjoy the movie because you keep asking: Why would such-and-such happen to So-and-So, and what on earth is the logic of Whatsisname doing whateveritis. Take Staggered, a British comedy. In three days, toy demonstrator Neil (Martin Clunes) is to marry pretty Hilary (Sarah Winman). But on stag night his prospective best man Gary (Michael Praed) drugs him and helicopters him off to a remote Scottish island. So far, so logical. Gary is enamoured of ex-flame Hilary and wants to push Neil out of the picture. It is after our hero awakes naked on his shingle that the film starts to look several herrings short of a full catch. First Neil, finding the only phone booth for miles around, makes a reverse-charge call to Gary, whom we see answer it without any 'Will you accept the call?' preliminaries from the operator. Then when Neil is directed by Gary to an Aberdeen Airport locker where he will find proper clothes (he hitches a lift from a passing supply plane), we watch him embarrassedly change into the clothes right there in front of two cleaners. Why? It is a minor point - but why not use the airport loo? Shortly after that Neil is arrested on touchdown at Newcastle Airport by the local Chief Inspector (John Forgeham), who speaks with a Birmingham accent. Why? Then we learn that it is apparently the habit in Newcastle for a busy Inspector to stay handcuffed all night to his captive as the latter lies in bed. Why? Then when the captive wants to make a vital telephone call in a hospital, the only available phone is in the morgue. Why? So that plot wheels can turn and Neil can meet his girlfriend-to-be, a vampiric pathologist called Carmen (Anna Chancellor). And so on. I looked at my scribbled notes after the film and each one began with 'Why?' Comedy is lost without logic, for it is the art of taking that logic and tickling it until it unbends into chaos. If you begin with an illogical premise - let alone an army of them - what 'undoing' is there to laugh at? Faced with a senseless world, what is funny about additional senselessness? Persons to blame: writers Simon Braithwaite and Paul Alexander. Person to pity: Martin Clunes, who as well as acting was drafted in late to direct. Then there is the horror side of question-mark cinema. In Needful Things, directed by Fraser C. Heston (Charlton's son) from Stephen King's novel, why does the promising plot about the Devil visiting a small New England town, in the guise of antiquarian Max Von Sydow, go so remorselessly to pieces? Von Sydow sells each townsperson the object of their dreams in exchange for a diabolical favour. So a strongish cast - Amanda Plummer, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia - spends its time maiming, murdering or tormenting their fellows. Mr Von Satan, you see, wants to set the town on its ears. By pricking everyone into acts of motiveless spite - as in Strangers On A Train person A does person B's dirty work and so on - he ignites dormant grudges into a conflagration of hate. But wait. Why, as soon as the townspeople twig to the disproportion between the gratification of their modest wishes and the heinous crimes required of them, do they not boot the old devil out of town? Why does it take two hours of screen-time to finger Old Max as Old Nick? Answer: because none of these townspeople is a living character, merely a pawn in King's plot. What is more, the plot is an old one. It was done before not just by Highsmith/Hitchcock, but by novelist Dashiell Hammett in Red Harvest. And done much much better. We must not be dogmatically 'either-or' about the question mark/exclamation mark issue. Some films mix the two together. From France Pierre Salvadori's comedy Wild Target is nearly all exclamation: with its sweetly logical plot about a fussy hit-man (Jean Rochefort), his stumbling apprentice (Guillaume Depardieu) and the pretty girl they turn from quarry into protegee (Marie Trintignant). The parrot jokes are excellent. Rochefort's Victor Meynard - part Clouseau, part Phileas Fogg - is impeccably developed. And some lines get a roar. 'Medium height, medium build, medium moustache' bumbles the villain's henchman to his boss, trying to describe the unknown assassin he has just glimpsed. 'Victor Meynard]' declaims the instantly enlightened boss. Only a brief outbreak of over-contriving in mid-movie turns our smiles into frowns. (How could those Spanish guitarists have got to that car crash scene?) As for The Saint Of Fort Washington, an initial flurry of where-are-we's - as Matt Dillon is demoted to down-and-out status in dingiest New York and no less precipitately becomes soul-buddy with black street-sleeper Danny Glover  -compose themselves into a movie that leavens social-realist sentimentality with moments that more sharply expose NY's welfare system and geography. The last-scene visit to the city's dumping ground for the homeless dead, in a mass unmarked grave on a neighbour island, is chillingly moving. But the best film of the week is Go Fish: all exclamation points and no queries. We may be unfamiliar with lesbian life in 1990s Chicago, but not after this. A comedy of counter-culture manners directed by Rose Troche and co-written by her and the film's star Genevieve Turner - she plays the kooky girl with the back-to-front baseball cap - it is very funny and discombobulatingly frank. Are there any Sapphic courting rites you do not know about? Or any female body parts you do not know gay women's favourite nickname for? Again: not after this. The film was made with what must have been someone's loose change after a wild night at the disco. Grainy black-and-white rules. The sound recording is basic. And the camera clambers over rough-lit faces and bodies and furnishing items, like a house guest trying to find his or her sleeping bag. But after the doggerel of the week's commercial film-making, this is free verse by a genius. The offhand-funny dialogue is a delight. It mixes spoof gusts of agitprop correctness - 'She doesn't seem to be interested in her own oppression' - with a raunchy wit and candour that male chauvinists (straight or gay) will be shocked to discover is not their exclusive preserve. At the centre: a love affair between the pretty Max (Ms Turner) and the pikestaff-plain Ely (VS Brodie). This begins by defying probability - especially when beaky Ely increases her mirror-cracking potential by shaving her long hair into a punk cut - but ends by totally charming and persuading us. Around the amorous knot-tiers gather such exotics as Kia, Evy and Daria, swapping one-liners or lying in heads-together truth-game sessions under the one flashlight that seems to serve for the film's lighting equipment. By rights this film should have been an amateurish, doctrinaire chunk of sexual-minority special pleading. Instead it is the best film of the season and could well be the most charming film of the year.</p>

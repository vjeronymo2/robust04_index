			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Observer: Waiting in the wings Who put Arkansas on the map - George Bush or the state's governor, Democrat presidential candidate Bill Clinton? Oddly enough, Bush aroused the biggest publicity boost for the state this year by mislocating it: 'somewhere between Oklahoma and Texas,' he said, which applies only to one minuscule corner north-west of Texarkana. But while Clinton has carried on the good work, the man who is most keen for the international limelight to fall on the state is Jim Guy Tucker. True, Clinton is technically governor, and every now and then breaks from the campaign trail to go back home to Little Rock and 'attend to state business'. In reality, however, Arkansas is run by Tucker and and he looks to be enjoying it. A lawyer and two-time state attorney general, with a term in Congress under his belt from 1976-78, he is three years older than Clinton, looks a little like him, but is trimmer. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1990, appointed acting governor last year, and if the Democrat wins the White House, is in line to take over the state in his own right. One option would be to serve out Clinton's unexpired term until 1994. But he'd prefer, provided his checks confirm that state law allows it, to call a special election within 60 days. 'If I can't win at this point, God let me know now.' He slyly points out that the US president's ignorance of the state's whereabouts certainly isn't shared by the 109 international companies with investment there. Moreover, if the recent British corporate experience is anything to go by, the last place jobs are going to be cut is Arkansas. Within the past week, both BICC and BAe have been wielding the axe - but not, significantly, in the land of the razorbacks where both have interests. Could these decisions, not to mention Hanson's five separate operations in the state, reflect some British political preference?</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Kazakhstan uranium put out of reach The US yesterday successfully completed the secret transfer of 600 kilograms of highly enriched uranium from a storage facility in Kazakhstan considered highly vulnerable to theft. Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, told a press conference: 'We have put this bomb-grade nuclear material forever out of the reach of potential black marketeers.' He said the uranium could have been used to produce 'more than 20' nuclear bombs. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, described the operation as 'a landmark event in President Clinton's non-proliferation strategy,' along with last week's approval by the Ukrainian parliament of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the recent agreement with North Korea. The US operation, code-named Project Sapphire, was conducted over the past six weeks after the government of Kazakhstan, one of the four former Soviet states with nuclear capability and a signatory to the NPT last year, privately advised Washington it could not guarantee the safety and security of the stockpile at its Ust-Kamenagorsk facility. President Clinton authorised the operation on October 7 and it was placed under the direction of Vice-President Al Gore. A US team then worked non-stop in Kazakhstan to arrange the transfer in conditions of high secrecy. The first shipment left Ust-Kamenagorsk airport last weekend, with the final consignment arriving in Delaware yesterday morning en route to the re-processing plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The operation was funded by the US under the Nunn-Lugar Act which provides about Dollars 800m (Pounds 500m) in the current fiscal year to assist de-nuclearisation efforts in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. 'There is no better example of how the Nunn-Lugar programme can help eliminate a national security threat before it arises,' Mr Perry said. 'This is defence by other means and in a big way.' His remarks were directly aimed at Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, probable next chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, who has threatened severely to cut funding for such operations. Mr Perry rejected a Moscow report that the uranium could not have been used to make bombs. 'It is weapons-grade material. I state this unambiguously.' Asked if there were other vulnerable caches, he replied: 'I cannot state categorically that there is no other such source anywhere else. As far as we know, this is it.' A defence department official later said that though the uranium came in slightly different forms, the majority was 'almost pure U-235,' extracted from SS-18 missiles stationed in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's nuclear energy minister said the uranium was used during the Soviet period as fuel for nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear reactors, not for atomic weapons. Mr Vladimir Karmakov also said that Kazakhstan conferred with Russian military officials before informing the US. 'We asked the permission of the Russian military structure, then gave the information to the United States,' Mr Karmakov said. US concerns that what the state department calls 'rogue states' - such as Iraq and Iran - might acquire nuclear capability have been high for the past two years. Reports of smaller quantities of enriched uranium intercepted in Germany earlier this year had heightened these alarms. Mr Perry was effusive in praising the co-operation from the government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, which, he said, 'demonstrated a sensitivity to regional security by consulting with the Russian government before proceeding with Project Sapphire.' The Washington-Moscow channel of communication was principally through Mr Gore and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, he added.</p>

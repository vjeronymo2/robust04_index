			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TUSTIN'S TRINITY TO BROADCAST ON SOUTH AFRICAN TV  </P> <P> Trinity Broadcasting Network of Tustin has been included in a group of  religious broadcasters approved for time on South Africa's state-owned TV  networks, the government press association in Pretoria reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> The South African Minister of Home Affairs, Gene Louw, said the Christian  Television Group, which includes Trinity, will be given 30 minutes each weekday  morning and two hours Sunday on the main government network, TV1, and two hours  each Sunday morning on the two African-language stations.  </P> <P> The government requires that the religious broadcasts have at least 50% local  content and contain no advertising.  </P> <P> Trinity's founder and president, Paul Crouch, has been telling viewers for the  past year that the 24-hour-a-day programming service was hoping for an entire  channel on the South Africa state system. Trinity already operates a station in  Ciskei, a black "homeland" in South Africa. SCOTT KRAFT  </P></p>

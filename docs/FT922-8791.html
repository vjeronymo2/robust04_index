			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (1): Partnerships that work - Over the past 10 years many large UK companies and their employees have entered into a wide range of activities in partnership with their local communities.  The aim now is to encourage many more smaller businesses to begin to participate AROUND 100 senior business leaders meet in Birmingham and Newcastle today to hear how they and their companies can get involved in helping the community and at the same time help themselves. The meetings are part of a campaign organised by Business in the Community to extend and deepen the participation of companies in a range of local activities and to ensure that community involvement becomes a natural part of successful business practice. They coincide with the 10th anniversary of BITC, an umbrella organisation which helps create partnerships between business, government and local communities to improve the economic, physical and social environment. The organisation is at something of a crossroads, and is seeking to develop a blueprint for expanding community involvement to virtually every company in the country, not out of a sense of charity but out of enlightened self-interest. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle and the current chairman of BITC, says: 'We need to move to Stage Two of our existence by significantly enlarging our army of volunteers ...by doing so we develop better people and as a result better companies.' Today's conferences, spearheaded in Birmingham by Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, and in Newcastle by Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, are part of a series of six across the country which follow an assessment of BITC strategy last year called Directions for the Nineties. Since the organisation was set up a decade ago, around 500 companies have joined and several thousand have entered into local partnerships. The question now is how these activities can best be expanded and developed by involving more companies and more employees, and by linking community help with other business functions. Corporate community involvement in the UK can trace its roots back to the Victorian era when industrialists such as Cadbury, Rowntree and Boot provided free education for employees. Social 'investments' were viewed as essential to commercial success, and they remain an essential ingredient of family-led businesses such as Marks &amp; Spencer and J. Sainsbury. However, under the Labour post-war administration, the central government took more responsibility for social welfare, and corporate patronage declined. It re-emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the decline of traditional manufacturing industries and increasing levels of social alienation, particularly among the young and ethnic minorities. Enlightened businesses began taking direct corporate action to rebuild the health and vitality of local communities, and companies such as IBM (UK), BP, Shell, British Steel, Barclays and Midland banks all developed community involvement policies. An Anglo-American conference at Sunningdale in 1980 led to the establishment of a working party chaired by Sir Alastair Pilkington, chosen because of the glassmakers' pioneering work with the St Helens enterprise agency, and this committee laid the foundations for the launch of BITC in 1982. The profile of the organisation was raised greatly in 1985 when the Prince of Wales became president. It was also the riots of 1981 in Brixton, south London and Toxteth, Liverpool that gave the movement a big fillip. Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, dragooned a group of senior businessmen on to buses to show the devastation of Toxteth, and this proved to be the catalyst for much wider action. From its launch BITC supported the local enterprise agency movement as a job creation vehicle for redundant employees and unemployed school leavers, and the development of employment opportunities has remained an important priority. The private sector's work with LEAs and other community initiatives has drawn thousands of large, medium and small companies into community involvement. It has also developed the practice of partnership between the private sector, local authorities, voluntary organisations and central government, and paved the way for the establishment of Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs). BITC, acting as an umbrella organisation and a disseminator of best practice, has evolved into a national organisation with 11 regional offices. Target teams focus on national issues, business leadership teams implement programmes locally, and neighbourhood economic development partnerships address urban regeneration problems at local level. The Per Cent Club, administered by BITC, is a group of companies which have agreed to contribute a  1/2 per cent or more of pre-tax profits, or 1 per cent of dividends, to community based projects. Contributions take the form of cash, staff secondments, or donations in kind such as equipment, premises, time or expertise. More than 500 organisations are now members of the clubs. A Professional Firms Group pledges professional services free of charge to community projects, including engineering, legal, accountancy, quantity surveying and architectural services. In the early years, help from business was concentrated on straight charitable giving and sponsorship of the arts and sport. These are still important but they now form a much smaller part of the total. The issues facing the movement have become much more focused since Directions for the Nineties was published after a lengthy consultation exercise. They are the need to widen the range of support given by business to the community, the need to include more employees in community involvement, and the need to integrate community work fully into every aspect of corporate life. Mr Shaw, like other BITC leaders, stresses that a company's involvement in the community must not be seen as just a charitable act, but as a 'two-way street' that benefits the company as much as the community by generating a more prosperous local economy. He also emphasises the benefits to the individual of community work. 'I would pay more attention to a successful involvement in a local project than I would to success at business school,' he says. Sir Allen Shepherd, chairman and group chief executive of Grand Metropolitan and a deputy chairman of BITC, says: 'Corporate responsibility is not a fringe activity. It is becoming an integral part of doing business.' The GrandMet Trust has become the largest private agency in the country for providing government-sponsored training and counselling programmes for the unemployed. On any given day, 5,000 people will be attending a course, and 80 per cent of those completing one go on to find full-time employment. The secondment of employees, favoured particularly by companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer which donates Pounds 5.5m a year to community work, IBM, banks and the big accountancy firms, has always been an effective link with local communities. The enterprise agency or local organisation gains from the secondee's expertise and fresh approach to problems, and the company sees key employees increase the range of their experience. Kingfisher, which owns B &amp; Q, Comet and Woolworths, was a founder member of the Opportunity 2000 campaign aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of women's participation in the workforce, and the company has sponsored a guide to corporate responsibility. WH Smith is one of many companies that has encouraged employee participation by matching pound for pound any sums raised. One recent exercise has been to update the Samaritans' overloaded crisis phone lines. Mr Sam Whitbread, chairman of Whitbread the brewers and chairman of BITC's target team on employee volunteering, believes this area is the key to a company benefiting from community activities. 'It can be used as a vehicle for team building and staff development, it fosters positive communication with otherwise disparate departments and generates a caring, service-driven culture which can only lead to a commercial advantage,' he says. The recession of the last 18 months has clearly had an impact on the community involvement of some businesses. Redundancies and closures do not sit happily alongside well publicised community projects. But the effect has not been as great as might have been expected. Mrs Julia Cleverdon, BITC chief executive, believes that support has been well maintained partly because of the interest of chairmen and chief executives who insist on a commitment being kept. It is also partly because of a growing appreciation that the backing and sympathy of the local community is particularly valuable to a company in difficult times. What seems to have happened in recent years is that an increasing number of large companies have appreciated the benefits of community involvement. But this has not filtered down sufficiently to smaller companies, who wonder whether they have the resources to act effectively enough. What stops many business leaders from becoming involved in the community is not unwillingness, but a lack of knowledge of the working mechanisms through which their energies can best be channelled. That is the purpose of today's meetings and of others to follow.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A chance to help Kiev After three years of inept economic policy, Ukraine finally has a government which appears ready to implement market reforms. Ukraine's new president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, sent a strong signal of his intentions by telephoning the International Monetary Fund the day after his election. The IMF responded with commendable speed: last week Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director, flew to Kiev and offered to help Mr Kuchma write an economic plan. The US, which appears to have recovered from its initial distaste for Ukrainian independence, has followed suit, dispatching Al Gore, vice-president, to Kiev tomorrow. Sceptics may argue that it is too early to judge Mr Kuchma's policies. Nevertheless, the IMF and the US were right to seize the opportunity to encourage reform, not least because of Ukraine's size and crucial geo-political location. A stable and prosperous Ukraine would be one of the best guarantees against the emergence of a neo-imperialist Russia and a welcome neighbour for the economically more robust, but politically vulnerable nations of eastern Europe. However, continued economic deterioration could inflame both nationalists in the west of the country and separatists in the east, creating conditions that might lead to civil war. That is why the west must follow-up its flurry of flights to Kiev with a concerted effort to nudge Ukraine on to the right economic course. The IMF has already offered Mr Kuchma its usual advice: support the tight monetary policy of Ukraine's surprisingly good central bank, produce a budget which is balanced, or nearly so, and liberate the country's economy from the administrative bondage which is restricting the development of its potentially vibrant private sector. Currency stability This is sound policy so far as it goes. But Mr Kuchma should be urged to go further and the IMF and the Group of Seven leading industrial countries should be urged to give him the wherewithal to do so. One need is to make a commitment to exchange-rate stability. Another is to yoke sound macro-economic policies to radical structural reform. For Ukraine, that means starting to shut down inefficient heavy industries, while creating a social-welfare net able to support the workers who will lose their once secure jobs. Paradoxically, Mr Kuchma, who like Mr Victor Chernomyrdin in Russia spent his career in the heart of Ukrainian heavy industry, is well placed to deal with his country's rust-belt. He speaks the language of Ukraine's industrial barons and, during the presidential elections, won a land-slide in eastern Ukraine, the region which would be hardest hit by radical reform. His distaste for the nationalist rhetoric which his predecessor, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, employed as a substitute for economic policy should prevent the new administration from wasting its time bickering with Russia. Financial resources Even with these political advantages, Mr Kuchma will need substantial financial resources if he is to persuade his country to endure the initial pain of market reforms. The Dollars 4bn promised by the G7 would be a start, but much of this money is ear-marked for dismantling nuclear weapons, cleaning up the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and technical assistance. In addition to this, the west must also directly support the budget and the currency. One measure worth direct assistance on the right terms would be the New Deal-style public works programme Mr Kuchma would like to create. Western aid must be swift and substantial, for two reasons. First, Mr Kuchma's tentative conversion to the market must be seen to be rewarded. Otherwise, Ukrainians, who still have a touching, indeed naive, faith in western financial institutions, could become as disillusioned as their Russian cousins. Second, Mr Kuchma needs the political leverage a substantial western aid package would give him. Ukraine has not yet resolved the three-way power struggle between the presidency, cabinet and parliament which, in Russia, ended in bloodshed last October. In pursuing tough economic reforms Mr Kuchma faces a fierce battle with Ukraine's conservative legislature. Ukrainians should be made to understand that the west is in their president's corner.</p>

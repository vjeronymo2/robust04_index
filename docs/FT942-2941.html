			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch unemployment falls Unemployment in the Netherlands fell to an average 483,000 people in March-May, the second successive decline since the jobless total peaked at 520,000 in January-March. The central statistical office said the figures indicated the rise in joblessness had stabilised or been reversed. Although the number of registered unemployed rose by 96,000 in March-May from a year ago, this is still a slowdown compared with year-on-year figures published so far in 1994. The latest figures are unadjusted for seasonal factors but, even so, the drop was steeper than would normally be expected. Ronald van de Krol, Amsterdam. The number of unemployed in Poland fell in May for the third consecutive month - by 47,100 to 2.8m people or 15.5 per cent of the country's workforce. Christopher Bobinski, Warsaw The Danish National Bank has cut its securities repurchase rate to 5.60 per cent from 5.70 per cent, effective from July 1.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Digital unveils new products Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer manufacturer, yesterday unveiled a new product and distribution strategy as part of its drive to return to growth and profitability. It announced eight new workstations and midrange machines based on its world-leading 'Alpha' technology, and discounts for dealers. Alpha microprocessors are reckoned to be the world's fastest and Digital has staked its future on their success. Mr Enrico Pesatori, head of Digitals computer systems division, said yesterday that in the first quarter of the current year, Alpha sales increased by 138 per cent. Last year sales of Alpha technology amounted to Dollars 1bn. The computers announced yesterday are an attempt to combine the power of the fastest Alpha microprocessors with the economics of low cost personal computers; this will cut both purchase price and running costs. The new machines are priced between Dollars 7,000 and Dollars 15,000. The new dealer discounts, coupled with improved terms and conditions of service, are an attempt to make Digital products more attractive to dealers and other distributors, a group that Digital has neglected in the past. Now it will provide partners with marketing support to increase demand and broaden the market for Alpha products. The company is already running a substantial advertising campaign to reassure customers and potential customers of its commitment to the computer business and this will be complemented by a rash of product advertising. The Alpha machines, however, face stiff competition from Power PC computers from Apple and IBM.</p>

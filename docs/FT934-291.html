			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Focus shifts to Germany in thin trade Most continental European bond markets drifted lower yesterday, but, with London closed and many continental European market participants on holiday, trading was extremely thin. German bond prices dropped slightly, as dealers tried to hedge the new 30-year German government bond, of which DM3bn was allotted to the traditional bank consortium yesterday. More 30-year bonds will be auctioned today. Dealers believe the total amount of 30-year bonds will be DM10bn. The Bundesbank is expected to hold back a portion of bonds for market operations. Dealers said the terms of the bond, which matures on January 4, 2024, were in line with expectations. The coupon was set at 6.25 per cent and the price at 100.40. The bonds were quoted at 99.50 in the grey market, according to dealers. 'We don't expect to have any problems selling the paper, but it will go to foreign buyers, and they are not around at the moment,' said one trader. French bond prices edged lower at the long-end, in sympathy with the German market, but dealers said thin trading was confined to a 20 basis point range. US bond prices eased slightly at the long end of the maturity range in quiet trading yesterday after news of strong consumer confidence data. The declines followed the moderate losses the market posted on Monday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at 100 5/32 to yield 6.233 per cent. The two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 1/8, yielding 4.168 per cent. Although business was quiet with many participants away on holiday, there was some selling early on after the Conference Board announced that its index of consumer confidence rose to 80.2 in December, up from 71.9 in November. Dealers said that the long end of the market would probably have fallen further but for the positive effect on sentiment of fresh declines in commodity prices, including another large drop in the oil price.</p>

He also talked about  the "responsibility" of the "SDF."    This revealed the sinister intention of the Japanese  reactionaries to drive the "SDF" into overseas aggression,  declares NODONG SINMUN today.    The news analyst says:    The "international contribution" of the "SDF" claimed by the  Japanese reactionary ruling quarters is an excuse to justify  troop dispatch overseas and the use of arms.    By "increasing role" of the "SDF" through the United  Nations,  aichi meant to step up its military advance and operations  overseas by abusing the name of the United Nations.    The Japanese reactionaries are these days preaching the  inevitability of the use of weapons and battles of the "SDF"  units dispatched overseas and calling for malrevision of the  "law on cooperation in UN peacekeeping operations," which  confines their activities to non-military spheres, and for the  "constitutionality" of "military activities under UN command"  and "exercise of the right to collective self-defence." Under  the cloak of "exercise of the right to collective self-defence"  they intend to start military aggression in real earnest on  wider areas, major zones of resources and strategic points of  the world.    Japan today is the world's number two in military spendings.    What must not go unnoticed is that the Japanese reactionary  ruling quarters are actively promoting Japan's nuclear armament.    The Japanese reactionaries must discard the anachronistic  militarist mode of thinking and act with discretion.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / A steely glint in its eye: A look at the revival of a loss-making Brazilian industry Brazil's newly privatised steel industry has become a highlight of the country's inflation-racked economy. After a decade of under-investment, price controls and mounting losses, the sector is expected to have its most profitable year since the 1970s. The costs of this transformation, in terms of job losses and social disruption, have been heavy. But industry and union leaders now admit that the changes were needed for the industry to survive. 'Brazilian society was paying for our losses. Now we employees realise the future is in our hands,' according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of specialist steels company Acesita. The company was privatised last year and returned to profit in the second quarter of this year. It made profits of USDollars 13.3m in the first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 84.8m losses for that period last year. 'We survived instead of died, partly because of the 8,000 people who lost their jobs,' says Mr Luiz de Oliveira Rodrigues, president of the metalworkers union at Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, the country's largest steel producer. Since 1990, when CSN made a loss of Dollars 729m, it has cut its workforce by a third, and this year is likely to announce record production and profits of more than Dollars 50m. The change in fortunes for the sector, which ranks as one of the top 10 in the world in terms of crude steel production, started in 1990. The government, which owned eight steel companies including the country's six largest, announced that steel was to start off an ambitious privatisation programme. The process was completed in September with the auction of Acominas, the last company to be privatised, at a 90 per cent premium to the government's minimum asking price. The sector was chosen because, with some exceptions, it was losing the government millions of dollars each year. This was partly due to poor management and partly due to political interference, which included price controls and job security rules. Mr Eduardo Modiano, in charge of the early stages of privatisation as ex-president of Brazil's development bank, says that since the industry was set up 50 years ago governments have pumped USDollars 26.5bn at prices of the day into the companies that have now been privatised. In the same period, the companies returned dividends of only Dollars 500m to the government. Persuading managements and unions of the need for privatisation was difficult. Steel was an important symbol of the country's industrial emergence after the second world war. The sector also possessed some of the country's most radical unions. A bomb exploded ahead of the first privatisation, the 1991 sale of Usiminas, and there were regular displays of violence at subsequent auctions. The programme was successful mainly because the early examples were seen to work. Once freed of price and other government controls, companies were immediately able to restore margins and profitability. They were also able to address the inefficiencies which had built up in the public sector. Mr Roberto Procopio de Lima Netto, president of CSN since 1990, started paying suppliers on time. This led to immediate savings, as the suppliers cut their prices. They had previously included a premium when supplying state companies because of slow or non-payment. CSN's staff cuts, which saved about Dollars 10m a month, were unpopular. But CSN used some of the money to pay seven months of salary arrears to its remaining workforce. Support for Mr Procopio gradually grew. In all privatisations, shares were reserved for workers. CSN's employees control one of the company's largest shareholdings, with 22 per cent, of which half is held through pension funds. Mr de Oliveira Rodrigues has also become a member of the company's administrative board. 'The new philosophy is of partnership,' he says. Usiminas was seen as one of the most efficient companies, partly because of a long-standing technical relationship with Nippon Steel of Japan, which is also a 14 per cent shareholder. But according to Mr Rinaldo Campos Soares, president, the company was immediately able to introduce cost savings of about Dollars 15 a tonne, or about 5 per cent of total cost, through renegotiated supply contracts and improved purchasing. Before privatisation, all purchases had to be auctioned, and the cheapest bids had to be accepted even if the quality was poor. 'Privatisation allowed the company to be more flexible. The state had become a burden and the company couldn't grow any more,' he says. Cost savings and productivity at Acesita, Latin America's only producer of stainless steel, have been even more sudden. The company had been paying 33 per cent real interest rates on its borrowings. This figure has been reduced to 12 per cent which, while still burdensome, has already saved Dollars 40m a year in lower interest charges. Productivity in the first nine months of the year has increased 50 per cent, of which only half is due to staff cuts. 'With 25 per cent fewer people, we're producing more,' Mr Brumer says. These improvements in productivity and efficiency helped profitability, even if some savings were unrepeatable and the improvements were measured against a low base. More important were the big cost advantages Brazil's steel industry enjoys, and which were masked by state ownership. As the world's largest iron ore producer, Brazil's steelmakers pay about half the average world price because of minimal transport costs. Although levels of labour productivity are low, so are wages and electricity costs. As a result, Brazilian exports are increasingly price competitive and increased 10 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn in the first half of the year. But the domestic market, still protected by average tariffs of 14 per cent and high transport costs faced by potential importers, is more attractive, because it allows high margins. Mr Pacifico Paoli, managing director of Fiat of Brasil, Usiminas's largest customer, says there has been a 'tremendous' jump in efficiency since privatisation, although this has not translated into lower prices. 'They still try to get the advantages of the world market price.' Mr Francois Moyen, president of Belgo-Mineira, a private sector steel and related products group, says the main problem facing the industry is the country's economy. With per capita steel consumption at less than 10 per cent of the levels of developed economies such as Japan's, he and other industry figures talk of the domestic market's 'huge opportunities'. 'But the potential is linked to growth in GDP and that's the problem: when is the country going to grow?' he asks, highlighting Brazil's overall economic uncertainty.</p>

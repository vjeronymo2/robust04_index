			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RIGHT COURSE  </P> <P> I am writing in reference to a letter from Jeanne Kosinski, whose property  overlooks the proposed golf course in Tujunga Wash.  </P> <P> She doesn't really mean to say the golf course would protect the environment,  preserve the wildlife and plant life. Get real. What she really means to say is  the golf course would skyrocket her property value.  </P> <P> I think the wash is one of the few natural settings left. It's beautiful --  leave it alone.  </P> <P> JOANN MONDING, Tujunga  </P></p>

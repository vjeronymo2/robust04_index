			<p>BFN     [Text] As INTERFAX learned from a well-informed source in  Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry, in the past 24 hours all was  relatively calm in the Karabakh conflict area.    At the same time several population centers in two border  districts of Azerbaijan -- Kazakh and Tauz -- came under fire.  This resulted in neither casualties nor destruction.    In the meantime, the headquarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's  Defence Army reports that Sunday [15 May] night and Monday  morning Azeri troops opened fire on the positions of Karabakh  forces in the Mardakert, Agdam and Askeran directions, wounding  two soldiers.    According to the headquarters, the Armenian forces refrained  from opening retaliatory fire.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Korobova: "Crimean Communist Leader </F> Announces His Opposition to Meshkov"]    [Text] The news conference, which was unexpectedly called  by Crimean Communist leader Leonid Grach, generated a sort of  furor because -- for the first time since the presidential  elections, during a time of euphoria, which was cooling down but  still alive -- a force declared its open opposition to the new  authorities. Currently, the Communist Party of Crimea [KPK] has  some 48,000 members. Leonid Grach received more than 13 percent  of the vote and ranked third in the presidential elections. In  the Supreme Soviet elections, communists were supported by fewer  voters -- they won only two out of 14 seats -- because voters,  in general, voted for "Russia's Bloc." The development of  events in the Crimea finally upset the KPK, and Grach voiced  concern over this very fact after the news conference.    We have learned about Meshkov's plans to reform the  executive  bodies -- to liquidate executive commissions within the local  soviets and nominate interim heads of administrations. Grach  believes that this "destruction of some old bodies will at least  bring about some order in the state."    Communists voice doubts over the moves of the new government  (half of this government consists of Moscow residents). In the  opinion of Leonid Grach, "they are failures in science and, to a  greater extent, failures in practice."    The management is experiencing a vertical split, the  government is going to manage the state through duty-shifts  [vakhtovyy metod]. The KPK cannot, in Grach's opinion, remain  aloof when "the Crimea is undergoing humiliating experiments."  Moreover, management "has not only been left without a local  staff, but the basis for an open `witch-hunt' has been  prepared." The depth and tragedy of this precipice, into which  Crimea is headed, are both deepening, according to Grach, due to  the government's inefficiency, the president's lack of  competence, and a generally low level of education (in the  sphere of legal knowledge within the state). Those, who learned  the classic adage -- divide and conquer -- take advantage of  this situation. "I state with full responsibility that if a  shot is fired in the Crimea, it will not be the result of  political or interethnic tensions. Residents of the Crimea  should understand: They will be armed to fight for ownership,"  said Grach. Having rebuked Yevgeniy Saburov for the  "anticommunist yearning after the Moscow model," Grach voiced  surprise over the government's immense expenditures on their own  needs, and said that their holiday hotel "More" -- their  headquarters in Alushta -- was built as an imitation of the  Zavidovo Hotel in Moscow.    Leonid Grach is convinced that, despite the utmost discord  between Kravchuk and Meshkov and lack of direct contacts between  Yeltsin and Meshkov, they are objectively assisting one another.  Kravchuk believes that the worse the situation in the Crimea is,  the better for him, while Russia simply behaves like an owner in  the Crimea. As to the question of why Russia behaves like an  owner in the Crimea, Grach answers without thinking: "Shokhin's  Russia."    The KPK leader also confirmed that communists, who during  the  elections had supported Meshkov with some reservations,  currently represent an opposition because "they cannot sacrifice  anything -- except rallies, tents, and rejected resolutions --  to the fatherland."    Reiterating that the Crimea will not overcome the economic  crisis alone and the union of fraternal republics should be  restored on a new basis, Leonid Grach said that the KPK  considers Leonid Kuchma the most proper candidate for Ukrainian  president.</p>

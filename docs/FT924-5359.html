			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Takeshita has to fight for his political life MR NOBORU TAKESHITA, the former Japanese prime minister, was fighting for his political life last night after lengthy testimony to the Japanese parliament failed to dispel allegations that an organised crime syndicate played a vital role in his election in 1987. Mr Takeshita, still one of the most powerful politicians behind the scenes in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, is likely to come under increasing pressure from opposition parties to resign from parliament. A series of snap opinion polls taken after the testimony showed a majority of the public - even in his own constituency - did not believe Mr Takeshita's account of events leading up to his election in 1987. Mr Kansei Nakano, a leader of the minority Democratic Socialist party, said: 'Mr Takeshita must understand that he is politically finished.' Mr Takeshita told the parliament he would not resign because it would be seen as an admission of guilt. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, led half-hearted efforts by the LDP leadership to support Mr Takeshita and end the scandal that has recently destabilised the party leadership. Mr Takeshita is still the titular leader of the LDP's largest faction, which is almost certain to split after the controversy that engulfed him. He was impassive during most of his two-hour testimony. The case involves whether Mr Takeshita knew that corrupt businessmen - then bosses of Japan's largest organised crime syndicate - were enlisted as intermediaries to quell an embarrassing right-wing street campaign against him. Mr Takeshita admitted he met Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the former president of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company, who is on trial for breach of trust over the company's huge losses. The company made illegal donations of Y500m (Pounds 2.6m) to LDP politicians. Mr Takeshita said Mr Watanabe tried to stop the right-wing campaign of his own accord, and he became aware only in 1988 that Mr Susumu Ishii, the organised crime boss, also intervened on his behalf. In court testimony last month Mr Watanbe said he told Mr Takeshita the right-wingers would cease their harassment campaign only if Mr Takeshita made a humiliating visit to the home of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister. The right-wing group wanted Mr Takeshita to apologise for deposing Mr Tanaka from the leadership of the LDP's main faction in the mid-1980s. Mr Takeshita visited Mr Tanaka's home the day after meeting Mr Watanabe, but said it was a courtesy call, denying it was designed to stop the right-wing campaign.</p>

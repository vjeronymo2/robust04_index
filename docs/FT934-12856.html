			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Number of women directors on the increase THE NUMBER of women directors and executives has begun to creep up while the number of accountants in these positions has dropped sharply, according to a survey by Hemmington Scott, the corporate information publishers, Andrew Jack writes. Just 3.6 per cent of the 12,310 executives and officers of quoted companies are women, although the proportion has increased from less than 2.7 per cent four years ago. The number with fellowships of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has declined from 1,721 to 1,448 over the same period. The number of directors and executives who are masters of business administration has increased from none to more than 100 since 1989, with Harvard proving the most popular of the business schools. The most frequent jobs for women in senior business positions are in finance and administration. There are 16 finance directors and a quarter of the women identified are chief accountants or company secretaries. Nearly half of the 442 women identified in the survey as in senior positions are board members. More than 700 directors are aged over 65, and 654 have been awarded some form of honour.

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Burda confirms move to take stake in Vox Burda, the German magazine publishing group, confirmed yesterday that it was negotiating to acquire a 25.1 per cent stake in the ailing Vox television station, to join Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and the Bertelsmann media group as a leading shareholder. The company said it was negotiating with state regulators in North Rhine-Westphalia to acquire 'a relatively big interest' in the station, which went into liquidation earlier this year. If successful, the move would bring back together the Murdoch group and Burda, which publishes fashion and popular magazines, as well as the conservative weekly magazine Focus. It would also appear to rule out a participation by the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT), which jointly owns RTL, Germany's most profitable private broadcaster, with Bertelsmann. CLT had been rumoured to be bidding for a stake. However, the takeover by the Murdoch group of its controlling stake in the television station could run into problems, notably potential infringement of Germany's strict broadcasting regula-tions. Bertelsmann has been involved in an urgent exercise to save the station and its potentially lucrative access to the cable and satellite television market in Germany, since the original shareholders pulled out earlier this year. The station has continued to broadcast with a skeleton staff in order to maintain its broadcasting licence. Now Mr Friedrich Nowottny, director-general of Westdeutscher Rundfunk, the main public television broadcaster based, like Vox, in Cologne, has demanded that Vox should lose its broadcasting licence, in view of the dissolution of its original shareholding. Meanwhile, Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive of Bertelsmann, confirmed in an interview published yesterday that his company had suffered a loss of around DM450m (Dollars 276m) because of its Vox participation, of which DM350m would be charged to the accounts in the current year.</p>

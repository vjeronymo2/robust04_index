			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> NAVIGATION SATELLITE ROCKETS INTO ORBIT  </P> <P> A Navstar navigation satellite was rocketed into orbit from Cape Canaveral,  Fla., to join a network of spacecraft that guide bombers, warships, missiles  and ground troops with great accuracy. A 128-foot-tall Air Force Delta 2 rocket  boosted the $65-million satellite into orbit after the liftoff was delayed a  day because of a problem with a fuel tank pressurization system. The Navstar  satellites enable U.S. and allied military units to determine their positions  to within 50 feet in any type of weather anywhere in the world.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 2 June TASS -- Turkish President  Suleyman Demirel, currently paying an official three-day visit  to Moldavia [Moldova], went today to the southern part of the  Republic, mostly inhabited by Gagauzs, a people of Turkic  origin. He is accompanied by President Mircea Snegur and other  officials.    Demirel stated the day before that Turkish businessmen were  ready to invest in the Moldavian economy. Most of the  investments will be made in the Gagauz districts. At the same  time, he expressed his support to the efforts of the Moldavian  leadership to ensure the Republic's territorial integrity.    "We back the negotiations process between the Gagauz  population and the Moldavian central leadership, intended to  give our brothers a chance to live on their native land as  citizens, who respect the territorial integrity of Moldavia and  enjoy a legal status making for their further development,"  Demirel stated.    The Gagauz leaders also pin great hopes on Demirel's visit.  "This visit will, without a doubt, contribute to the political  settlement of the Gagauz problem. This will allow us to switch  over to the solution of our economic problems, to the  improvement of the people's living standards," ITAR-TASS was  told by Stepan Topal, the president of Gagauzia.    According to the Gagauz leader, the Turkish side is ready to  help develop telephone services in the Gagauz districts, to  build roads there, and to re-equip the local processing  enterprises and other factories.    Demirel will sign with Moldavian President Mircea Snegur a  treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.  Several agreements on cooperation in the sphere of culture,  transport services, agriculture, and in combatting crime will  also be concluded. The heads of the two states are expected to  decide the terms for large Turkish investments in the Moldavian  economy. On the last day of the visit Demirel will attend the  opening of the Turkish Embassy in Moldavia, after which the  signing of the official documents will take place.</p>

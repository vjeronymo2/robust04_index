			<p>BFN     [Text] For the plenary session of the National Assembly on  27 April, the election of new representatives remains the most  important of the four items on the agenda. Nineteen  representatives, whose actions were incompatible with their  role, have resigned and the two parties -- FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] --  have proposed new representatives: 13 from FUNCINPEC and six  from the CPP.    Despite the agenda, some people have expressed concern that  this issue could raise problems during the examination of the  validity of the representatives. It has not yet been  definitively agreed how this will be done. There is, however, a  hint that the names of the representatives will be read and then  adopted. Some people are not satisfied with this method, saying  that this is not truly democratic. They want to discuss each  new representative. It seems that some new representatives  would cause problems. Let us wait, however, and see when the  meeting takes place.    Following is the list of names of the outgoing and incoming  representatives:    Outgoing representatives:    FUNCINPEC    1.

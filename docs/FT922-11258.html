			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Youghal loss up Increased pre-tax losses of IPounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.4m) were announced by Youghal Carpets (Holdings), the County Cork-based carpets and textiles group, for 1991. For 1990 the loss was IPounds 2.84m. The directors said the results were severely affected by the recession in the UK where demand for carpets had been affected by the slow-down in house sales. In the Irish Republic carpet sales were in line with the previous year. A fall in yarn sales also reflected the difficult market conditions in the UK. Strenuous efforts were being made to control costs. Turnover dropped to IPounds 48.3m (IPounds 55.2m) with an operating loss of IPounds 1.33m (IPounds 255,000), and there was an exceptional loss of IPounds 456,000 (IPounds 401,000) being mainly redundancy costs. Loss per share amounted to 8.33p (6.09p).</p>

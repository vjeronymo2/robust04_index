			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREMONT GENERAL RECEIVES BID TO BUY ITS MAIN BUSINESS  </P> <P> Fremont General Corp. of Santa Monica received an unsolicited offer Tuesday to  buy its Fremont Compensation Insurance Co. subsidiary for about $140 million.  </P> <P> The prospective buyers, an investment partnership called Catalina Acquisitions  Inc., did not reveal terms of the deal and were not available for comment.  </P> <P> Catalina, however, is affiliated with a group of investors that owns a 7.8%  stake in Fremont General.  </P> <P> James McIntyre, president and chief executive of Fremont, said that the company  has not had a chance to review the offer but that Fremont Compensation is not  for sale.  </P> <P> "We are not really open to offers, but as a public company we are required to  look at everything," McIntyre said.  </P> <P> Fremont's stock price jumped $1 per share, closing at $18 in over-the-counter  trading Tuesday. Analysts said the deal was worth about $17.25 per share, and  Fremont shareholders would retain their interests in several other company  subsidiaries, including Fremont's commercial finance operation and its medical  malpractice and life insurance businesses.  </P> <P> However, because terms of the sale -- including whether the buyers would pay  cash or securities for the company -- were not available, analysts would not  evaluate the deal's viability.  </P> <P> Fremont Compensation is Fremont General's primary subsidiary, accounting for  50% of the company's 1989 revenues and 100% of its profits.  </P></p>

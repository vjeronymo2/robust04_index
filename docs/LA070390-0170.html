			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HEPBURN TO AUCTION HER PAINTING  </P> <P> Katharine Hepburn is auctioning off one of her paintings to benefit a wildlife  organization.  </P> <P> It is the only painting she has ever offered for public sale or view, said the  Oscar-winning actress, who has been painting since the 1930s.  </P> <P> The 16-by-20-inch work is an impressionistic look at the Beverly Hills valley,  somewhat hidden by tall trees and framed by a white rail fence.  </P> <P> "I do hope it will bring a price, although I wouldn't give you a nickel for  it," joked the lifelong summer resident of this shoreline community.  </P> <P> Hepburn painted the work while staying at actor John Barrymore's California  home. She guessed she completed it in the 1960s.  </P> <P> The painting will be among works of art to be auctioned this fall to benefit  the North American Wildlife Assn. Inc., which is seeking to buy the house that  serves as its headquarters.  </P></p>

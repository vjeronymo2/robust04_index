			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- Parliament today passed  on first reading amendments to the Act To Provide Financial  Support for Autumn and Spring Farm Works in 1993-1994.  According to the amendments, the act will be extended to apply  to farming cooperatives and will no longer require cooperative  members to have contributed land of proven title in order to  qualify for tied soft loans. The Parliamentary Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) voted against the amendments, arguing  that their passage legitimizes the cooperatives set up by the  "nomenklatura" of the disbanded cooperative farms.    The National Assembly Committee on Agriculture today heard a  report from Deputy Agriculture Minister Todor Markov on the  performance of liquidation councils (which were set up under the  Agricultural Land Tenure Act to wind up the cooperative farms  and distribute their assets). According to Mr. Markov, of a  total of 2,082 liquidation councils nationwide, only three have  completed their work, and another 185 are ready to wrap up their  business. The members of the parliamentary committee said that  the Agriculture Ministry should prepare an accurate timetable  for the completion of liquidation councils' work.    The National Assembly Budgetary and Finance Committee today  approved in principle the 1994 national budget bill. The SDS  MP's on the committee voted against the bill.    The Legislative Committee discussed a bill establishing  terms  and a procedure for the use of surveillance methods.    Parliament today passed by an overwhelming majority  amendments to the Persons and Family Act, introducing a new  procedure for non- profit corporations engaged in religious or  religious education activities, which will now have to register  at court after advance clearance from the government. During  the debate, MP's of different parliamentary groups emphasized  that the act has to be amended because of the invasion of a  number of religious cults, some of which abuse civil rights by  their activities. Under the amended version, any juristic  person engaged in religious activities must reregister within  three months or risk discontinuation of its activity.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: The Gigli Concert: Almeida Theatre There is another Irish theatre triumph in London, this time at the Almeida. Tom Murphy's The Gigli Concert, though it has a cast of only three, has everything: wit, pathos and music. Above all, it contains superlative acting. The play was first performed at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in 1983. This is a slightly revised version which was presented at the Abbey last year. As the British premiere, it cries out to be seen. One could be pretentious about it and say it has a cosmic background, as a programme note claims: I would prefer to say simply that it is deeply humane. JPW King is an Englishman with a Tipperary grandmother who has set up in Dublin as a dynamatologist, which means a kind of quack psychologist. He has few, if any, patients until the appearance of the unnamed Irish Man, who asks for help and has money to pay for it. The Irish Man claims to have been born in Italy where he was a promising boy soprano. He has since made a sizeable fortune out of the Irish building industry, but craves now to be able to sing like Gigli. Both JPW and the Irish Man are alcoholics, though in the Irish sense of drinking steadily from morning onwards rather than being particularly dangerous. Both ask themselves separately how they can get through the day. The therapy is talk, vodka and listening to Gigli as the Englishman and the Irish Man discover how much they have in common and how dependent they are on each other. Whereas the Irish Man has built a thousand homes, JPW claims to be devoted to a woman called Helen who never appears. Instead he makes love to Mona, whom he has met in a supermarket and who spreads her favours around the city but has a special affection for JPW. The talk, being Irish, is unstopping, going through childhood, sex and religion, and if the play has a fault, it is that it is slightly too long. But it is also full of satire. You will remember the acting, however, long after most of the words have been forgotten. All three performances are superb. Barry Foster as JPW is a big man capable of wonderful facial changes. He can be the kind, sympathetic Englishman, then switch to anger or ecstasy. Tony Doyle as the Irish Man has a slightly less developed part and seldom gets out of his overcoat. Ruth McCabe's Mona strikes me as entirely credible despite her strange life-style. She is vulgar, loving, faithful and promiscuous all in one. The trio between them are capable of variations of pace unusual on a London stage. There is a thoroughly appropriate set of JPW's surgery, with the Dublin streets outside, designed by Ashley Martin-Davis. The direction is by Karel Reisz, more normally associated with the cinema. Here, like everyone else, he seems in his element.</p>

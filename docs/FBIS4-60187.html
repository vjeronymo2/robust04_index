			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Renaissance Movement has declared its  categorical and vigorous rejection of the historical crime of  secession committed by the secessionist gang in the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP]. The movement called the move high  treason against God, the homeland, and the people.    In a statement it issued today, the Renaissance Movement  emphasized that it supports the legal leadership as it defends  Yemen's unity, and urged the unionists inside the YSP -- the top  and lower echelons alike -- to speak out against this step and  join a national effort to thwart that evil plan.</p>

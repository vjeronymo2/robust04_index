			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Soft speech and big sticks PRESIDENT George Bush, who made the phrase 'new world order' fashionable in the autumn of 1990, quietly dropped it one year later, presumably because it had raised unrealistically high expectations. Indeed, in 1992 the phrase has come to ring uncomfortably hollow, especially in Europe. In an article in yesterday's Daily Telegraph the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, referred aptly enough to 'the new world disorder', a phrase popularised earlier in the year by the French strategic analyst, Pierre Lellouche. To Mr Hurd has fallen the task of managing the foreign policy of one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. He has thus found himself at the heart of such inchoate world order as there is. ' 'Something must be done.' That is,' - he said in a speech last September - 'an impulse which we all feel, and we should realise where that impulse leads us. It leads to the repainting of parts of the map of the world in new colours - but this time the blue of the UN rather than the red of England or the green of France or Russia.' The concept of 'benevolent international interventionism' might, he conceded, be attractive, 'but we should not wander down the new road without serious thought.' It would involve a restructuring of armed forces and a massive increase in the funds required from member states by the UN and its humanitarian agencies. Clearly he was, and remains, uncertain how big a burden of this type public opinion in Britain, or in other countries, would be willing to shoulder. His instinct is to fall back on diplomacy; to emphasise (as he did in yesterday's article) that 'war cannot be the eventual arbiter between Serb, Croat, Moslem or Albanian any more than it can between Israel and the Arabs'. Yet the article also revealed a foreign secretary painfully aware of his own argument's inadequacy. The trouble is, of course, that in the past war has all too often been 'the eventual arbiter' between parties in conflict, and the Serbs clearly believe that it can be so in Bosnia. Up to now the war has gone mainly their way, with horrific consequences for the Bosnia Moslems; and unless the balance of force is changed by outside intervention, the 'peace process' Mr Hurd favours can only ratify, or at best minimally adjust, the results of the war process. So Mr Hurd finds himself playing 'soft cop' to the 'hard cop' of his American colleague, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger. He does not quite tell the Serbs he is on their side, but he dilates at length on his own dislike of military intervention, only to conclude by warning the Serbs that their conduct has 'brought even those of us who hold that view to the point where we can imagine armed action against them'. If this convinces the Serb leadership that the threat of such action is real and that they must retreat quickly in order to avoid it, well and good. But the constant display of doubt, by one of the main powers that will be called on to take armed action if it happens, has helped ensure that previous threats were not taken seriously, and may have that effect again. Mr Hurd's anxieties about the use of force are legitimate. But he should be aware that the public airing of such doubts is not the best way to instil respect. Those whose task it is to enforce world order need to speak with greater self-confidence and firmness - in a word, with greater authority.</p>

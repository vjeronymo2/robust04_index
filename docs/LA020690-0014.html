			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES TAX ON RELIGIOUS ITEMS  </P> <P> Russell Shaw ("Slouching Toward a Religious Levy," Editorial Page, Jan. 27) is  put out with the media because they "yawned" at the U.S. Supreme Court's  decision to tax the sale of religious items.  </P> <P> I yawn at several of Shaw's points.  </P> <P> First, his contention that parochial schools do a better job than public  schools is his opinion, to which he is entitled. It is not a fact. Where it is  true, it is true because private and parochial schools can and do dismiss any  students who do not follow their rules. Public schools must take everyone, and  cannot expel any but the most hardened criminals. You can be successful if you  can select to serve only those who fit your expectations.  </P> <P> Second, religious institutions are not taxed because they are nonprofit  organizations. Jimmy Swaggart and his "ministries" are in fact businesses,  fleecing people of all they can get. Taxing them should be only the first step  the government takes in attempting to put them out of business.  </P> <P> ANN BOURMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

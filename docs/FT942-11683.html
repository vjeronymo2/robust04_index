			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (9): Agriculture sector still a collective mess - Many land disputes have yet to be resolved, but private farming is slowly being reborn Monika Singer knows all about agriculture in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Before she became mayor of the small village of Gross-Wustenfelde in 1990, she had worked for eight years on the nearby State Collective farm, or LPG. Now, she spends hours in her small office dealing with queries and farmers' complaints, leaving her with little time for her five children. 'Its tough. The enormous pace at which agriculture has been restructured has left people disorientated largely because so many have lost their jobs,' she said. 'Maybe it has been too fast, because at the same time we also had to integrate our agricultural sector not only into the west German system but into the European Union as well.' There is hardly a village in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which has not been affected by these changes. United Germany inherited a complex farm sector in eastern Germany. After the second world war, the large estates of the former German aristocratic families had been expropriated by the Soviet authorities which administered eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949. These estates were broken up and distributed among ethnic Germans forced out of eastern Europe. Many received plots of land of about six hectares. Not long after, the east German communist regime placed about 75 per cent of the private farms under co-operatives, normally about 4,500 hectares in size. The remainder of east Germany's 6.2m hectares were turned into giant LPG state farms. Coping with that legacy has proved one of the other difficult aspects of restructuring the east German economy. After unification, the federal government embarked on a two-pronged strategy: the right to restitution and compensation was granted to former owners of land under 100 hectares. This right did not extend to those owners of the large estates which had been expropriated by the Soviet authorities between 1945 and 1949; and the Treuhand privatisation agency set about privatising or leasing 1.3m hectares of land, a third of the total arable land in eastern Germany. By the middle of this year, the Treuhand will have leased out 700,000 hectares, many on 12-year contracts. Mr Otto Bammell, a senior official at the federal ministry of agriculture, admits the re-privatisation of land has thrown up many unforeseen problems. 'Many people now have their land back. But in the process, they soon discovered they had a giant silo stuck in the middle of their property, or found huge barns which once belonged to the collective farm. There are now disputes about who owns these buildings and who should remove them. It's a mess,' he said. Then there was the unresolved question about how much former small landowners would receive in compensation instead of restitution. Apart from property disputes, the government is also faced with very high levels of unemployment in states such as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Brandenburg where entire communities depended for their livelihood on the state, or collective farms. 'Under the old system, there were 850,000 people working on the land, or about 14 people per 100 hectares. That's at least three times the number compared with western Germany,' said Mr Bammell. Since 1990 this figure had fallen to about 200,000 people as a result of restructuring, he said. 'The reforms have been successful to the extent that farming is now more efficient. But in some villages, about 60 per cent of the population have no work. There is no industry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern into which people can move. Politically, and socially, it is extremely dangerous,' he added. Restructuring also co-incided with integrating east German agriculture into the European Union system. 'When we started the reform of agriculture we also had to reconcile levels of production with EU regulations, which entailed putting aside 15 per cent of arable land,' explained Mr Bammell. 'This meant limiting crop production here in eastern Germany to 3.6m hectares. This is the base area which would make us eligible for EC price support,' he added. In the process, German officials had discovered that the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had planted 17 per cent above permitted levels, and the states of Saxony and Thuringia had overshot by 10 per cent. In total, eastern Germany has exceeded the base area by 350,000 hectares. As a result, farmers in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern may be asked to set aside a total of one third of its land, without compensation, in order to pay the penalty for over-production. Agricultural officials say it will be some time before east German agriculture stabilises. 'The people have had to cope with so much change on the land. A complete breakdown of the former system took place after unification. We now have to restructure the entire sector stage-by-stage both socially and economically,' said Mr Bammell. For Ms Singer, the completion of that process cannot come soon enough.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Going to work on a curate's egg - Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who is nursing a limping but not crippled Saatchi IN JANUARY 1990 the unthinkable happened in the advertising world; Mr Charles and Mr Maurice Saatchi relinquished management control of their sprawling marketing services group to an outsider, Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus. Some 16 months later he successfully pushed through a recapitalisation scheme gaining Pounds 60m in new equity. Stage one - the prevention of the group's financial collapse after its over-expansion - was over. Stage two - the return to former glories - has hardly started. The kind of clout the Saatchi brothers once enjoyed has gone and business is tougher to get. Today, Saatchi, the world's second largest marketing services group, will announce results for the 15 months to the end of December 1991. Analysts are predicting group losses of up to Pounds 50m; that figure is probably optimistic. The losses are largely due to provisions against some 100,000 sq ft of empty offices in the US and the UK and the deficit incurred through the winding-up of a small agency in the US. But even without such exceptional items, the group may register losses of Pounds 8.6m on revenue of some Pounds 720m, down from 1990's Pounds 808m. The reasons for such losses are complex; the fault lies partly in structure, partly in morale, and partly in the collapse of advertising revenue generally. But there are indications that within three years the group could rise phoenix-like from the ashes. Structurally, the group is rather like a person with one leg shorter than the other. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide (SSAW) and BSB Worldwide (BSBW) are the group's two international agency networks. While SSAW strides along, BSBW has been limping badly; as a result the group has a stumbling gait. Changing a self-reinforcing poor image of BSBW will be tricky. In November 1991 Marketing Week magazine published a survey of 150 advertisers who were asked which agencies they most valued. Saatchi took second place, after J Walter Thompson, and with Ogilvy &amp; Mather third - both of which are subsidiaries of WPP, Saatchi's rival. But BSBW slid from 10th in 1990 to 17th in 1991. BSB's New York office lost important accounts, including Prudential, Fisher Price and Xerox. Mr Louis-Dreyfus has restructured BSBW's New York management in order to stem the defections. Furthermore, advertising revenue has been badly affected by economic recession both in the UK and the US. Internationally, advertising revenue dropped in real terms by some 3 per cent in 1991, the first such decline in 20 years. The worst fall was in the US, which according to Zenith (the media-buying arm of Saatchi) experienced a 5.9 per cent real drop. That particularly affects Saatchi; in 1990 its revenues were almost entirely from advertising (93.4 per cent), with 52 per cent of that from the US market. Cost cutting has been necessary. Saatchi's operational staff has shrunk from 1989's level of more than 18,000 to 12,900 now; the severance bill for 1991 may total Pounds 15m. The redundancies have damaged but probably not destroyed morale. And the group appears to be winning important new business, about Dollars 270m (Pounds 153.4m) net of new accounts since January 1, including large business from Toyota and BAT Industries. The only major client loss on the horizon is Rover, from the already badly hit BSB Dorland agency. Mr Charles Scott, chief operating officer, has the task of further tightening financial control over the slimmed-down operation. His view is that 1992, not 1991, should be the yardstick by which the new management is judged. 'Since April 1991 we have been getting management sorted out and the structure right. The 1991 results will show the impact of everything that's been done up until now. Rather than looking at 1991's results, 1992's will really show how well or badly the company operators have done.' In a sense the big pain came in March 1991 with the group's recapitalisation. That removed the threat of having to redeem Pounds 211m of Euro-preference shares in 1993. But the current share price of 16 1/2 p is a far cry from mid-1989 (before the financial difficulties hit the group) when it stood at about 300p. Mr Scott's plans include the phased introduction of a system of payment by results rather than the fat fixed salaries of old. 'It's a highly paid industry and it would be foolish to try to change that overnight. But we are engaged in trying to change the overall compensation breakdown of the company. While it is not possible to lower fixed salaries, there will be a higher variable component, in terms of annual bonuses,' says Mr Scott. Salaries currently represent 60 per cent of Saatchi's fixed costs, an annual bill of roughly Pounds 300m; in 1991 about 300 executives earned salaries of Pounds 150,000 and above. Saatchi - like many other troubled agencies - is also banking on the probability of an upturn in global advertising spending this year. Between 0.7 and 5 per cent real growth in advertising expenditure in 1992 is projected by different analysts, against an annual average 3.2 per cent between 1970 and 1990. Growth will not be through fresh acquisitions, says Mr Scott. He prefers organic growth. 'Shareholders have taken a lot of pain because of the acquisition policy. It's strongly my view that organic growth is high-quality growth, acquisitions mean low-quality growth. Such drawing-in of horns is now an industry commonplace. The group has net debt of Pounds 225m. The first debt repayment of Pounds 20m is not due until December 1993, but the group could be cashflow positive to the tune of Pounds 4m in 1992, and improving thereafter. Mr Louis-Dreyfus wants to strengthen the long-term international competitiveness of the group by building a third network around Campbell Mithun Esty, the Minneapolis-based agency, and KHBB, the London agency, to satisfy multinational client demands for a global service. One problem overhanging the group - besides the difficulties in lowering high fixed salaries of disgruntled executives - is, says a recently departed Saatchi employee, that 'the holding company's size is just not justified'. At an estimated cost of Pounds 20m annually, the somewhat bureaucratic head office establishment may still need pruning. Less immediate and less quantifiable worries might yet prove a threat. If advertising expenditure does pick up, will we see a rash of disenchanted staff leaving to set up their own agencies? What will Mr Louis-Dreyfus do if BSBW in the US fails again this year, or if the incipient CME-KHBB network fails to gel? And as media-buying in Europe becomes a more centralised business, will the otherwise thriving Zenith begin to suffer? In other words, the group is still in difficult flux, needing careful nursing; only SSAW is holding its own in world rankings.</p>

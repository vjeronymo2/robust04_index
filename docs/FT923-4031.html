			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Red-blooded leaders change battle cry to 'Pensions': Behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings by the big unions in the wake of the Maxwell affair TO RED-BLOODED union leaders the issue of pensions has been best left to the backroom boffins at HQ - worthy, but hardly the stuff of which stirring speeches are made. The scandal over the Maxwell pension funds has changed all that, highlighting the potential threat to employees and pensioners from lack of controls on the operation of occupational pension funds. The pensions ombudsman recently expressed his frustration about the narrow limits of his watchdog role and said he had been overwhelmed by the volume of complaints. The union movement, marginalised for so long, clearly has a legitimate interest as the only national grouping to represent those employees and pensioners. Mr Bryn Davies, actuary with Union Pension Services, says: 'The debate at last year's TUC didn't excite a lot of interest. But this year everyone I talk to in unions sees pensions as perhaps the key issue for unions in the 1990s.' The debates scheduled today at the TUC conference will conclude by restating the movement's wish for a number of legal reforms. But for all this, it is not the TUC itself which will make the running on the issue. Pensions do not even figure on the list of six areas identified by the TUC earlier this year as priorities for action. An unofficial grouping of the larger unions, initiated by the GMB general union and including the TGWU general union and the MSF general technical union, has been meeting for some weeks behind the scenes to discuss pensions strategy. This could be seen as further evidence of the increasing irrelevance of the TUC - if pensions are one of the most important issues for unions in the 1990s, it is significant that the leaders of the big unions feel happiest getting on with the job on their own. The group's target is the independent commission, under Professor Roy Goode, set up by the government to review the framework of pension legislation over the next year. The group hopes to raise the profile of unions in the pension debate and put forward a number of well-constructed submissions to the commission. A TUC fringe meeting today will launch a 'charter for pension-fund democracy' and a special conference on the issue is likely to follow at the end of the year. The campaign will focus on representation on boards of trustees. From arguing that there should be an equal division of power between employees and companies, unions have moved to demanding that employees should have majority representation. The argument is that pensions are pay, so fund members should have the right to control fund assets. The charter will also demand the legal separation of company and pension-fund activities and assets, the right for pensioners to be represented on trustee boards, the right to full and up-to-date information for scheme members, paid time off for employee representatives to receive training and carry out their duties, and trustee powers to appoint outside advisers. Apparent contradictions in unions' arguments over control and use of surpluses remain unresolved. Employers say that if they bear the risk of having to top up funds to pay benefits, they should control those schemes and benefit from pensions holidays when times are good. Employers say unions want to have their cake and eat it - that they are asking for both democratic control and financial guarantees. Mr Davies says existing guarantees are, in law, virtually worthless. 'Employers rarely have an inescapable commitment to pay the expected benefits, come what may,' he says. The next stage of the debate within unions on pensions may need to move to a more sophisticated level with the offer - currently impossible for some unionists even to contemplate - of a trade-off between some of that phantom security and increased democracy.</p>

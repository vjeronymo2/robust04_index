			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, Jan 23, CANA -- Bahamas has  recorded a definite decline in trafficking of illegal drugs  through a new anti-drug effort between the Bahamas, Turks and  Caicos Islands and the United States, says Public Safety and  Transport Minister Arlington Butler.    Operation Bahamas Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT), a  cooperative effort involving the three territories, was started  in April 1992 to stamp out the drug trade.    And already, 18 months later, Butler says cocaine  trafficking through the islands has dropped.    The public safety minister added that the 1993 total for  cocaine seizure, though not yet official, was expected to be  just about 700 kilos.    "This is an 86 per cent decline from the 4.85 metric tons  seized in 1992 and it is the lowest annual seizure total since  late 1970," he said.    The minister explained that another first for the Bahamas in  1993, was that there was not a single interception of cocaine at  an airstrip in the Bahamas.    "The fact that only two airdrops were intercepted in  Bahamian territorial waters compared to six in international  waters show great respect for the OPBAT and an obvious decline  in the traffic."    Butler noted that for the 18 months OPBAT has been in  operation--from April, 1992, through December 31, 1993--only  1.59 metric tons of cocaine was seized in Bahamas.    And 1.85 metric tons were seized in international waters,  much of it close to the north coast of Cuba.    "I think we can conclude that our remarkable joint OPBAT  programme has brought the traffic of cocaine from Colombia to  South Florida through the Bahamas down to irreducible minimum  during this 18 month period."    The public safety minister also reported a fall by more than  half, in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment, as a  direct result of the anti-drug programme.    This, he said, indicated that the drug problem was  "receding" or "stable."</p>

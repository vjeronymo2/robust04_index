It says that the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] is an  impregnable one because its idea is great, its faith and will is  incomparably strong and it is united in one mind.    In the first part, the article says that the WPK is a party  with a great idea.    It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying:    "The chuche idea, the world outlook of our party, is the  guiding idea of our times which indicates the most correct way  of achieving the independence of the popular masses."    The article continues:    The unique guiding idea of our party is the immortal chuche  idea, the idea and theory developed and perfected by Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    The idea and theory of our party is an ever-victorious  banner  leading the struggle of the popular masses of the present era  for achieving their independence to victory and is a strategy  and tactics of the revolution for defeating imperialism and  accomplishing the cause of socialism, the human cause of  independence. As it has the great idea and theory bearing the  August name of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, our party is so great  and is an invincible revolutionary party which does not waver in  any storm.    Comrade Kim Chong-il has comprehensively systematized and  solved all the theoretical and practical questions arising in  revolutionary party building including the question of  conducting party construction and activities with the chuche  idea as the guideline, the policy of building the party into a  mass party for the working people and firmly guaranteeing the  uniformity of thought and leadership within the party, the  policy of taking the unity and cohesion of the party as a basic  task of its building and building it up with main emphasis laid  on thought and the question of realising the exclusive sway of  one idea and definitely ensuring the political leadership over  the whole society.    With this chuche-based idea of party building propounded by  the dear leader, our party has been able to conduct its building  and activities without the slightest deviation or twists and  turns, and steadfastly defend its revolutionary character.    With the great idea, our party is further consolidating its  organisational and ideological foundations, consolidating and  developing its singlehearted unity and successfully paving the  road of socialism, overcoming whatever trials and obstacles.    In the second part, the article says the WPK has an  unshakable faith and will.    It continues:    All the activities and struggles of our party today are  based  on the firm resolve to follow the path of chuche opened by the  great leader and the unshakable faith and will to lead the  people to accomplish the cause of socialism.    Its faith and will are not shaken in acute political,  military and ideological confrontation with the enemy and get  stronger with the change of generations and the advance of the  revolution.    With an indomitable faith and will, our party has become a  great party which courageously smashes the imperialists'  anti-socialist campaign and turns adversity into bliss.    It is the staunch stamina of the Workers' Party of Korea  guided by General Kim Chong-il, an iron-willed brilliant  commander, to counter arrogant pressure from the imperialists  with an indomitable spirit and frustrate the  counter-revolutionary offensive with a revolutionary offensive.    For its unshakable faith and will, our party has always been  tough and resolute in confrontation with the imperialists.    Our party with firm revolutionary faith and will is  displaying its grand appearance as a most revolutionary party  which does not retreat a step from the revolutionary principle.    Its firm revolutionary position is that a principle  certainly  wins and that the fundamental idea and demand of socialism can  never change even if the situation and conditions of  revolutionary struggle may change.    For this firm faith and will, our party has become a  revolutionary party with an invincible might which fulfills any  vast task in socialist construction.    Our party carries into practice whatever it wishes to do,  and  carries to completion whatever it has started.    In the third part, the article says the WPK is a party  united  in one mind.    It continues:    The might of its singlehearted unity is demonstrated in that  the entire members of the party have an absolute worship of  their leader, deeply revering and following him, and move as one  with strong organisation and discipline in accordance with the  leader's idea and will.    Our party has the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the  centre of unity and leadership, so the bonds between the leader  and his men are unbreakable. These bonds are based on an  absolute worship of their leader.    In our party, the leader's decision represents that of the  entire membership. All the party members speak the same words  and walk in the same manner.    The invincible might of our party deeply rooted among the  popular masses including workers, peasants, soldiers and  intellectuals is being fully demonstrated in the revolution and  construction.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Albanian Foreign Ministry in Tirana </F> on 30 April: "Calculated Provocation by the Greek Embassy in  Tirana" -- read by announcer]    [Text] Yesterday, on 29 April 1994, Mr. Toulupas, charge  d'affaires at the Greek Embassy in Tirana, twice presented  himself at the Foreign Ministry of Albania and, in the name of  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, protested in a  provocative, slanderous, and improper way some hindrances  allegedly imposed by the Public Order Ministry impeding the  Albanian Orthodox community's normal celebration of the Easter  holiday.    The Foreign Ministry considers this to be an act of  premeditated and calculated provocation and a continuation of  previous statements by Greek authorities on their alleged  concern over whether the Orthodox Easter holiday is to be  normally celebrated in Albania. This provocation testifies to  the fact that there exists a clear connection between these  statements by the Greek authorities regarding the Easter holiday  and the action of the Greek diplomat in Tirana. It aims at  aggravating the atmosphere before the meeting of both countries'  foreign ministers in Zurich on 3 May 1994.    The Foreign Ministry clarifies that all festivities related  to the Albanian Orthodox Easter holiday have been and will be  held normally, because Albanian law ensures and guarantees  freedom of religion to all its nationals who are believers.    There have been no complaints from any secular or church  representative of the Orthodox community to Albanian state  authorities regarding any obstacles or difficulties impeding the  performance of religious festivities.    We reiterate that the Albanian Orthodox Church is and will  remain autocephalous and any arbitration by the Greek Embassy in  the name of Orthodox believers aims at infringing its  autocephaly and is considered to be interference in the internal  affairs of the Albanian state.    The Greek Government spokesman's statement on 29 April 1994,  after religious ceremonies were normally held, maliciously  distorts the truth and facts and constitutes a dishonorable  tendency to exploit religion, the freedom of which is guaranteed  in Albania, and casts doubts over the Greek Government's desire  to go through with the meeting of foreign ministers scheduled  for 3 May 1994 in Zurich, a meeting that the Albanian Government  was seriously engaged in. The government believes that the  nonrealization of this meeting will not serve the mutual  interests of both countries and even less the region's, and that  responsibility for this will fall on the Greek Government.</p>

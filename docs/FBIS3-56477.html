			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Viktor Luchin has been reinstated as a  Constitutional Court (CC) justice and ended his hunger strike.    "I do not feel triumphant," he told Interfax Friday morning  [14 January]. "The justices acted as professionals." He said  that the court members reinstated him in a nine to four vote by  secret ballot.    Luchin went on a hunger strike Tuesday demanding a vote on  his membership which was suspended on December 1 because of his  alleged political activities.    A CC source told Interfax that in a seven to six vote by  show  of hands the court had put off consideration of reinstating  Valery Zorkin.    The source believes that by reinstating Luchin the CC  justices "disavowed the presidential decree advising that the  seats occupied by Luchin and Zorkin should be regarded vacant."</p>

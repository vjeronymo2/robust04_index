			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, May 18 (AFP)--A blast wrecked the third  floor offices of U.S. computer giant IBM in a building in  central Athens Tuesday evening, but no injuries were reported,  police said.    A caller who said he was from the November 17 extremist  group  phoned a commercial radio station to give a warning a few  minutes before the blast in the Sindagma building.    He said November 17 were going to fire a rocket at the  building, although police could not immediately establish that a  rocket had caused the blast.    Police cordoned off the entire area, which includes the  Greek  parliament and the new European parliament headquarters.    November 17 has assassinated more than 20 people and carried  out around 50 bomb or rocket attacks since it surfaced in 1975  with the murder of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Athens  station chief Richard Welsch.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin at news </F> conference in Moscow -- live]    [Text] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, I shall come to the  main point straight away. U.S. President Clinton's first visit  to Russia has passed off very fruitfully. It could not have  been otherwise: we know one another too well, there was too much  that had to be done, and our peoples too were expecting much of  us. This visit is based upon the realities of today, and at the  same time looks to the future. As regards the difficult past,  the U.S. President and I closed that book very firmly back in  Vancouver.    The work in Moscow proceeded at a tense pace, and  purposefully. Specific accords and agreements have been reached  which are important both for Russia and for the United  States--and for the whole world. The negotiations took place at  a crucial time for our country. The old habits and stereotypes  are crumbling, an active search for something new is under way  both in our country and in the United States.    We could be said to be in the throes of a common  Russo-American revolution. The citizens of the Russian  Federation approved a new constitution at free and democratic  elections, and for the first time elected their own parliament  without duress. I do not agree with those who think that our  first attempt was a flop. If one looks deeper than the  individual names and popularist slogans, then all in all, the  people have opted for a better life, for legality, and for  predictability.    This is a lesson which we all still have to learn from in  order to prevent mistakes being repeated. I confirmed quite  definitely to the U.S. President that our course is aimed at the  development and deepening of the reforms, and with stepping up  social orientation. I am sure that the country will gain more  stability and a sound social peace. Bill Clinton has expressed  a subtle understanding of the peculiarities of our situation.  You see, the Americans have experienced and are experiencing  quite a lot, too. We can count on complete support for the  reforms being carried out by the Russian president, the  Government, and the reformers in the new parliament.    I have talked about both the problems in our economy, about  the positive changes in it, and about the elements of  stabilization. I stressed that at the present time it is not  humanitarian aid that we need but full-blooded cooperation,  taking into account the transitional nature of the young market  economy of Russia.    Specifically I find that, together with the Tokyo package  and  with Clinton's package in Vancouver, that the most tangible  support for Russia would be for the American market to open up  to our exports, be it raw materials or machines. I am very  content that today an agreement on uranium has at last been  signed after two years of talks.    Cold war restriction must be removed altogether,  restrictions  like the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Artificial barriers imposed  under the pretext that Russia is dumping should be removed. And  let's just say that the case with our uranium is more likely  just fear of competition from more advanced technology and  cheaper material.    Bill Clinton has done much since Vancouver. He has kept his  word as regards dismantling the economic obstructions of the  cold war. Discriminatory restrictions have been removed from  U.S. internal legislation, or most of them. About 5,000 types  of Russian goods are no longer subject to increased taxes. The  U.S. President has done much to introduce Russia into  international financial and economic organizations. I do not  think it will be long before the G-7 becomes the G-8.    Russo-American relations have finally moved into the phase  of  mature, strategic, global partnership in all spheres during  these talks. The partnership has opened the way to general  understanding, both of the new prospects ahead and of the new  problems. We are both convinced that the modern world should be  democratic, open, and integrated.  As regards equality, mutual benefit, and accounting for each  others' interests, there is no need to talk about this anymore,  it goes without saying. This principle vector of our  partnership is set out in the Moscow declaration which we have  signed. It reflects and reinforces the historical improvement  in Russian-American relations in Eurasia and the world as a  whole.    Our mutual activities aimed at strengthening strategic  stability and security are taking on new substance. Thanks to  them, in the last few months alone the world and our countries  have avoided many traps and errors. There is also an evident  positive result--the strengthening of cooperation in the sphere  of security and disarmament, peace-keeping, cooperation, and  economic openness.    The ground-breaking step which has finally been taken in  Moscow is a denouement in documents leading to the elimination  of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. I consider the document which  was signed today by the three presidents to be historical.  Everyone wins from this, first and foremost the Ukrainian  people themselves. The agreements reached at our trilateral  summit meeting save resources, get rid of disagreement, and give  a good example to other countries. They are reinforced by the  Russian-American statement on strengthening all regimes for the  non-proliferation of weaponry of mass destruction. And the  durability of non-proliferation is at present, as is well known,  being seriously tested.    The U.S. President brought us right up to date on the  'Partnership for Peace' concept adopted in Brussels. The idea  is seemingly from NATO, but it contains a primordial element of  Russian-U.S. joint creative work. This concept is an important  step in the creation of a security system from Vancouver to  Vladivostok, which rules out the formation of new divisive lines  or zones of unequal security.    We see in this idea one of the options for building a new  Europe -- one of them, but not the only one, of course. We  shall put specific content into this channel of cooperation,  including in the military sphere. And in doing so we shall not,  of course, forget the other collective security structures in  Europe, above all the well-tried institutions of the United  Nations and CSCE.    I briefed the President in detail about the integrationary  processes that have got under way on the territory of the former  Soviet Union, and in particular about the latest summit meetings  within the context of the CIS. There need be no fear of any  neo-imperialist lust here--Russia's only interest is in  stability. It is undertaking honest mediatory efforts to  extinguish the hotbeds of conflicts on the perimeters of its new  borders. We are ready to cooperate widely and even to  coordinate our actions here with the United Nations, the CSCE,  and with the entire international community. Unfortunately, the  international community itself has not as yet shown a great deal  of enthusiasm. There has been a wary reaction to our specific  proposals, whether in Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, or in  Tajikistan.    I think that the United States and ourselves will now have a  greater understanding on this very important question.    I firmly raised the question of human rights violations  among  national minorities, especially in the Baltic area. There  should be no double standards here, whether it is taking place  in Haiti or in the Baltic area. As a result we adopted a  statement with teeth on ensuring human rights, and the President  confirmed that he personally would adopt corresponding measures  on contacts with the Baltic countries, so that discrimination  against the Russian- speaking population there will ultimately  be abandoned.    I do not want things to sound too upbeat. That does not  reflect the nature of our frank and businesslike conversations.  There were, and will be, disagreements. But the main thing is  the desire to seek understandings, which is later embodied in  specific policies. Such is the flight assignment for the  Russian-American partnership. It will be a good replacement for  the flight assignment for strategic missiles, which will now not  be aimed at one another. Thank you.</p>

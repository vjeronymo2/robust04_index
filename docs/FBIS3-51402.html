			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 15 January.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 12 January reports Cubana Airline  President Heriberto Prieto Musa's statement that Cubana  transports 40 percent of the tourists coming into Cuba. Prieto  adds that over 450,000 tourists were served in 1993. Ninety-five  flights a week by 29 foreign airlines arrive in Cuba.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 13 January reports that over  800,000 crates of fresh grapefruit have been exported during the  current grapefruit harvest on the Isle of Youth.    Radio Reloj at 1505 GMT on 13 January notes that Varadero's  tourist organizations took in $188 million in 1993, a figure  much higher than 1992, but $12 million less than called for  under the 1993 plan.    Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 13 January reports that  "the ecumenical council today presented the official certificate  of a donation of two biological laboratories to the Roberto  Fernandez and Sexto Congreso agricultural-livestock production  cooperatives in Matanzas Province. The agricultural laboratories  cost over 200,000 pesos."    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 14 January carries the following  reports:    Light Industry Establishment No. 122 in Pinar del Rio plans  to deliver 1 million meters of fabric covers to the province's  tobacco plantations on 20 January. Other Pinar del Rio  textile-industry centers have guaranteed three fourths of the 3  million meters the province needs. This work began on 8  December. Over 400,000 meters of textile have already been  produced, with 40,000 meters being produced daily. Establishment  No. 122 usually makes military cloaks, backpacks, and other such  articles.    The Third International Caribbean Fair will be held on 28  June in Santiago de Cuba during the Second Businessmen's  Meeting, which is part of the effort to incorporate Cuba into  the world market. This meeting will also encourage business and  economic partnerships. Installing the organizing committee,  Cuban Chamber of Commerce President Carlos Martinez Salsamendi  stressed that the goal is to strengthen trade ties with other  countries.    A third of the near 4,000 tons of metallic and aluminum  structures produced last year by the Paco Cabrera Enterprise in  Las Tunas Province have been sold for hard currency under the  system for self-financing established by that enterprise. The  products were earmarked mainly for nickel installations in Moa  and projects of the Cubanacan and (Simex) corporations, as well  as other organizations and agencies that operate in hard  currency.    A group of businessmen from the Canary Islands is on a work  visit to Sancti Spiritus Province. The visitors made a donation  of assorted articles to Cabaiguan Municipality.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 14 January reports that Albert  Fleming, governor of St. Martin, met with children from the  Presencia de Lenin school for children without parents, to whom  he made a donation of clothing and school supplies. Fleming said  this was the beginning of an important link between the two  islands. The school is located in Playa Municipality, Havana  City Province. "He was also very affectionate and caring with  the children, staying longer than protocol had scheduled."  Fleming also announced that children from St. Martin would soon  be visiting Cuba, and Cuban children would visit St. Martin.  Present at the ceremony were Comrade Jesus Montane, assistant to  the commander in chief; Havana People's Government leaders, and  other members of the governor's delegation.    Rebelde also reports that Mexico donated 120 specialized  books to the University of Havana on 14 January. On 19 January,  Mexico will donate school notebooks to the children of Cuba.    Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 15 January reports that the (Sagnav  I)  Enterprise in Santa Clara manufactured over 3.04 million bags in  1993. The bags were earmarked for the sugar industry and for use  in rice production.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Holguin's basic  electric power organization repaired "close to 400" transformers  in 1993, thereby reducing the need for imports and saving the  nation over $120,000.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 15 January reports the following:    "While in 1989, the excess currency in circulation in Cuba  was 4.163 billion pesos, there is today over 10 billion pesos of  excess currency circulating, and it is believed that figure is  going to continue to increase."    (Luo Hung), a PRC Embassy officer in Cuba, in a message of  greeting over local radio on the Isle of Pines, highlighted the  ties of friendship that unite the Chinese and Cuban people, and  donated books and pamphlets the municipal library.    "The National Water Resources Institute considers the  preservation of the patrimony accumulated by the Revolution,  enterprises, and the irrigation system a priority task for  1994." In 1958, the nation's reservoirs could hold only 46  million cubic meters; they can today hold 9 billion cubic  meters. Cuba today has 218 dams, thousands of km of canals, and  a great number of costly pieces of equipment. It is also  building several aqueducts, one of which -- the Santiago de Cuba  aqueduct, currently under construction -- will have cost, when  completed, $40 million pesos.    Radio Havana Cuba at 0000 GMT on 15 January reports the  following:    Enrique Correa, minister secretary general of the Chilean  Government, announced that the State Bank of Chile has granted  its Cuban counterpart a special loan of almost $10 million for  the purchase of foodstuffs. The minister said that the loan was  approved by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and is part of the  economic opening policy between Cuba and Chile. According to  Correa, this will allow other banks to follow Chilean investors  and businesses which already have serious trade ties with Cuba.</p>

In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir  Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British  Government's refusal to embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a  political solution until the IRA ended violence permanently.    With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored  another propaganda victory in Mr Adams' U.S. visit, Sir  Patrick's uncompromising position was endorsed by Mr John Major,  the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York, Mr Douglas  Hurd, Foreign Secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been  characterised by "ambiguity and evasion."    The U.S. administration also moved quickly to emphasise that  its decision to admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect  policy differences with the British government over Northern  Ireland.    President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more U.S.  pressure on Britain, said at a press conference: "Let's be  fair. The people that have to resolve this are the Irish and  the British." He described the peace initiative taken by Mr  Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as  "astonishing" and said Mr Adams should back it.    Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for  clarification as delaying tactics.    After a briefing to members of the congressional committee  on  Irish affairs, Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal  to put to the IRA to end its conflict. "The ball is firmly in  the British court," he said. Mr Adams repeated his calls for  British government action when he addressed the national  committee on American foreign policy.    But Sir Patrick, who said it was "a pity" that Mr Adams had  been given a platform in the U.S., insisted that it was Sinn  Fein which had "the key" to a peaceful solution. He said: "The  only rational choice for a organisation that has a political  objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence and make  it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what  has been offered, Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their  ability to give up violence."    Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr  Major, Sir Patrick said that it "did not seek any clarification  or explanation of any specific matter at all. It is entirely  clear that what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration."    He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific  meant that there was no "genuine request for enlightenment and  the most likely candidate for an alternative explanation is the  desire to play for time."    Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the  mechanics of a negotiated settlement, said: "Mr Major has talked  of a first step in the peace process. What is the second step  and the third step?" He said peace would be difficult to  establish but prospects were better than ever before.</p>

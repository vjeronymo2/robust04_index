			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- China has decided to  become more active on world market to increase coal exports in  the next few years.    Jing Tianliang, president of the China National Coal  Industry  Import and Export Corp. (CNCIE), said that China's coal export  this year is expected to exceed 20.2 million tons, hitting a new  record.    By 2000, he said, China's coal export is estimated to be  more  than 30 million tons.    Jing's company, specializing in handling coal exports, was  founded in 1982, when only about 6.4 million tons of Chinese  coal was sold abroad. However, China's coal exports have since  increased by an average 1.4 million tons, or ten percent, each  year to reach 20.2 million tons in 1992.    The aggregate export in those ten years amounted to 160  million tons, worth more than 5.9 billion U.S. dollars, Jing  said.    However, Jing termed such a volume as "inappropriate to  China's status as the world's leading coal producer". In 1993  China's coal production stood at 1.14 billion tons, ranking  first in the world, its exports accounted for only 1.6 percent;  the coal trade volume in the world the same year was nearly 420  million tons, China had a barely 4.5 percent market share.    Under these circumstances, Jing said, China should join in  the competition in the world market to enhance its profile.  This will contribute to the development of China's coal  industry, as well as its economic growth, he added.    The domestic coal market remains stagnant while the demand  on  the world market is beginning to revive. From January to May  this year CNCIE exported 8.6 million tons of coal, which Jiang  said was an encouraging sign.    Market analysts predicted a reasonable increase in coal  demand around the world, especially in Asia, in the coming  years. This will push prices up, they said.    CNCIE said it would carry out a multi-polarized export  strategy and make use of flexible trade methods. "We will try  every method as long as it helps to increase coal exports; we  will be open and equal to every customer, whether new or old,"  Jing said.    The corporation has won the confidence of customers in  nearly  20 countries and regions, including Japan, South Korea, France  and Italy. Its exports are conducted mainly through long-term  contractual trade, with Asia being its principal market target.    Jing said his company will work jointly with modern  coalmines  such as Datong, Pingshuo, Yanzhou and Zaozhuang, which are  prominent among other things in terms of mining conditions and  economic efficiency, to build coal export bases.    For example, he said, the coal mined in Yanzhou, in east  China's Shandong Province, is famous for its good quality, low  ash and sulphur contents and high caloric value.    However, he acknowledged that China still has a long way to  go before it can catch up with the world's leading coal  exporters such as Australia, the United States, South Africa and  Canada.    "We must raise coal quality, improve transportation, port  storage and ship loading, and harmonize every link in the chain  from coal production to export, so as to make China's coal more  competitive on the world market," he said.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE SCHOOL FOR MINORITIES CALLED PERILED  </P> <P> California State University Chancellor Ann Reynolds on Thursday said a  university-sponsored math and science high school intended primarily for  minority students is in jeopardy because of opposition from the Los Angeles and  Compton school districts.  </P> <P> The university has been working with the Los Angeles Unified School District  since 1986 on plans to open a school concentrating on math and science on the  Cal State Dominguez Hills campus. The proposed school would be open to students  from throughout Los Angeles County with special emphasis on recruiting minority  youngsters who, university officials say, need extra encouragement and  preparation to enter science professions.  </P> <P> In a letter to Reynolds this week, however, Compton school district officials  challenged the legality of opening the special school within its boundaries and  said the Cal State program would "cause irreparable damage to the  infrastructure of Compton's educational system" by draining away many of its  brightest students.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school board, which had co-sponsored the project with the  university, temporarily withdrew its support on Tuesday, a little more than a  week before an April 13 deadline to apply for state funds to plan the school,  university and district sources said.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement released Thursday, Reynolds expressed her alarm about  the school boards' opposition, saying that it could hinder badly needed efforts  to train students in science, mathematics and engineering.  </P> <P> "It is important to note that by the year 2010 the United States could  experience a shortfall of about 560,000 bachelor's degree holders in the  natural sciences and engineering," Reynolds said. "If this nation is to have  any chance of maintaining its leadership role throughout the world,  universities will have to respond to this critical shortage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shortage of Scientists  </P> <P> "Given the shortage of scientists confronting this nation and the approach  integrated within our plan, it is impossible to accept the premise, as alleged  by the Compton board, that our efforts would have caused 'irreparable damage' "  to the district, Reynolds said.  </P> <P> Cal State officials said they hope to meet with Compton board members to  resolve the conflict before the April 13 deadline. Compton officials could not  be reached for comment Thursday. However, according to a board resolution, a  copy of which was provided by university officials, Compton opposes the school  because it would be "in direct competition" with its new science and math high  school. Compton's program opened last September at Dominguez High School, which  is near the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus.  </P> <P> According to the Compton school board resolution, "The establishment of the  high school on the CSUDH campus may cause the removal of our more able students  from the three high school campuses, which would cause a detrimental drain on  the vitality of the secondary program in the district."  </P> <P> The resolution also states that the university needs Compton's permission to  open a school within the Compton district boundaries.  </P> <P> Los Angles District Deputy Supt. Sidney Thompson said the Los Angeles board's  decision to withdraw its support is temporary and does not mean that it opposes  the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reason for Action Told  </P> <P> "When our board members heard of Compton's board members' concerns, they said  we don't think we want to move forward until this is resolved," he said.  </P> <P> According to Yolanda Moses, Cal State Dominguez Hills vice president for  academic affairs, guidelines drafted by the university stipulate that no more  than two or three students per high school would be accepted into the special  school. Students who have demonstrated a special ability in math and science or  who have shown potential would be targeted for admission.  </P> <P> "Their fear is that we would take away the cream of their students, which would  not happen," Moses said.  </P> <P> The university is trying to meet an April 13 state deadline to apply for  $400,000 in development money. According to Moses, the university had  envisioned opening the school in the fall of 1990 with 100 to 150 students and  eventually enroll up to 500 students.  </P> <P> In addition to all of the courses required for high school graduation, students  would be offered extra instruction in math and science. They would also have an  opportunity to collaborate with university professors on research projects and  work during the summer in science-related industries, Moses said.  </P></p>

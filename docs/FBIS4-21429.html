			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Environment Agency  endorsed a local government assessment Friday [8 April] that a  planned reclamation project near a tideland internationally  recognized as an important waterfowl habitat will have little  effect on the birds.    The agency put its seal of approval on Fukuoka city's  assessment concerning the construction of an artificial island  in Hakata Bay, off the Wajiro tideland, clearing the way for the  controversial project.    The agency nevertheless submitted a statement to the  Transport Ministry, making a strong call for the preservation of  waterfowl habitat conditions throughout the entire bay, on  Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu.    The agency's approval paved the way for the ministry's  permission for the 460 billion yen project, which is expected  later Friday.    The ministry plans to call on Fukuoka to prepare for  registration of the tideland with the Ramsar Convention to  preserve waterfowl and other wildlife.    The project, to create a research and housing complex on a  400-hectare tract of reclaimed land, is expected to start at the  end of June.    The Wajiro tideland is known as a wintering site for many  water birds, some of them endangered species.    The project has drawn opposition from environmentalists at  home and abroad.    Besides the preservation of living conditions for waterfowl,  the agency also called for keeping the water clean in Hakata Bay  and for long-term surveillance of the regional environment for a  review of the assessment after five years.    Environment Agency Director General Wakako Hironaka said her  agency will seek Fukuoka's efforts to acquire the cooperation of  local communities to register the entire Hakata Bay with the  Ramsar Convention.    The Wajiro tideland preserves much more nature than the  Yatsu  tideland in Chiba Prefecture, which is already registered with  the convention, she said.    ``I believe the environmental protection in the region can  be  compatible with the (reclamation) project but I would like to  ask for reconsideration if it greatly affects the ecosystem.''</p>

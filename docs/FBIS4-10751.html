			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Senate has rejected the constitutional reform  bill. The group of senators who proposed the bill are  frustrated over the failure to approve the bill after several  months of negotiations. There were various short recesses to  try to iron out the differences but the bill was finally  rejected. Against the motion were senators of the Battleist  Forum, the Cruzade 94, and the Broad Front, which added 10 votes  to the total [sentence as heard]. The bill was supported by  senators of the National Party, Colorado and Battleist Union,  List 15, and the Government of the People.    The element that brought about the failure of the bill was  the proposal presented by the group headed by Julio Maria  Sanguinetti, who wanted to submit the reform to a plebiscite on  the last Sunday of November, that is, the same day as the  national elections. This proposal also included the elimination  of cross-party voting and the approval of a norm allowing a  system of coalitions between parties with multiple candidacies.  The proposal was rejected by the National Party. As a result,  the reform was rejected. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty King Husayn received at Raghadan Palace  today Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies,  and his delegation. The meeting was attended by His Highness  Crown Prince Hasan.    His majesty held a closed meeting, attended by the crown  prince, with Nabih Birri, followed by an expanded meeting  attended by a number of officials from both sides.    At the outset of the meeting, his majesty welcomed Birri and  his delegation and emphasized importance of such meetings on all  legislative and political levels in Arab countries, and the need  to intensify these meetings in the service of the causes of the  Arab nation and to lead the nation toward its aspirations.    His majesty emphasized the importance of continuous contacts  between political leaderships and the need to intensify efforts  in a manner that realizes serious and constructive coordination  between the Arab countries to the peace process, because this  continuous coordination is a national and pan-Arab interest to  which all should adhere.    For his part, Birri stressed the appreciation of the  Lebanese  people for His majesty King Husayn's pan-Arab and honorable  positions and his eagerness to support the brotherly Lebanese  people and the Lebanese leadership in defending the just  Lebanese cause. He expressed admiration of the wise leadership  of His Majesty King Husayn and his positions on various crucial  pan-Arab issues.    The meeting was attended by 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, prime  minister; His Excellency al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the  Royal Hashemite Court; Ahmad al-Lawzi, Senate president; Tahir  al-Masri, speaker of the House of Representatives; advisers of  his majesty the king; the Jordanian ambassador in Beirut; and  Deputy 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali, head of the Foreign Affairs  Committee at the House of Representatives.    On the Lebanese side, the meeting was attended by Deputy  Asmar Asmar, Deputy 'Ali Mita, Deputy Astafan al-Duayhi, Deputy  'Ala' al-Din, and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] We know how  much you love Lebanon and its people. What can say after this  meeting with Speaker Birri and the parliamentary delegation?    [Husayn] This meeting is a blessed one. The beloved members  of the delegation are now in their second homeland, and I am  happy to have this chance to welcome my brothers. The hopes and  aspirations of both sides are the same. We are the closest to  each other among the Arabs. We pray God that henceforth, the  march of real coordination and cooperation will resume. We have  great expectations that wider Arab coordination and cooperation  will take place in these difficult circumstances and in face of  the challenges. There is much love for Lebanon in the hearts of  all Jordanians from various origins. We are proud of our  strong, brotherly, and continuous relations with God's care.    [Correspondent] Your Majesty, Speaker Birri described you as  the most patient Arab leader. How do you view the future of  this region, especially Lebanon and Jordan?    [Husayn] This is nice coming from my brother, and it is an  honor to me and to Jordan. In fact, these circumstances require  patience. But on the other hand, we feel that these  circumstances will not continue in terms of our suffering in the  whole of the Arab world. Therefore, we are patient and we wait  for a real awakening and a serious and meaningful Arab move. We  believe in the Arab individual and that it is inevitable that he  will have the right to live and will attain all his rights in  his greater Arab homeland.    [Correspondent] Thank you Your Majesty.    [Husayn] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

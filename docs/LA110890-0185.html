			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRST STEPS TO SWING  </P> <P> Beginners who want to learn to swing dance should don comfortable shoes and  head straight to class, rather than wing it in a nightclub, says Betty Ladwig,  president and co-founder of Orange County's West Coast Swing Dance Club.  </P> <P> "If they've never danced before, I'd recommend beginning swing lessons with a  good teacher," says Ladwig, 54, who's been dancing all her life.  </P> <P> To find a good teacher, the Placentia resident suggests asking good dancers  where to go. Orange County has plenty of teachers, but not all are top-notch or  even acceptable, she said.  </P> <P> Initially, two lessons a week plus one independent practice session should  suffice. "You need to become uninhibited," she said.  </P> <P> A "street dancer" who never had a lesson, Ladwig surmised that it could take  from three months to a year before tyros are able to go out in public and  confidently hold their own. "It all depends on the person's individual  ability," she said. Zan Dubin  </P></p>

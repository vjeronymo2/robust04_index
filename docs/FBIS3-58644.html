That makes a large number of people, not counting saxophone  lovers, who are beginning to find the presidential tone a little  thin. Perhaps too many people. And everybody is already  wondering: Who will pay for the U.S. President's ulterior  motives or errors of analysis?    President Clinton's behavior on the Bosnian issue has not  allayed these fears; quite the reverse. Despite the efforts  made, particularly by France, for the United States to become  involved, Bill Clinton turned a deaf ear; there is no question  of Washington intervening in the crisis or encouraging the  Muslims to accept the peace plan laboriously drawn up by the  Europeans. All the information we have suggests the opposite:  U.S. services are not refraining from secretly arming the  Muslim forces which have launched a counteroffensive. The  Bosnian crisis does not jeopardize American interests. The  Europeans, who last year rejected the American proposals for  attacking some Serbian positions and lifting the embargo on arms  for Bosnia, will therefore have to extricate themselves from the  mess.    Although things are even less clear, the Twelve must expect  more unpleasant surprises as regards the Central or East  European countries, toward which they have shown far too much  indifference: There will be growing American pressure to make  the European Union bear more of the burden and be less reluctant  to open its borders to the products of these fragile  democracies. The United States will be in a good position in  this sphere and will find interested listeners in Warsaw,  Prague, or Budapest when it explains that the strengthening of  the reemerging democracies depends more on economic development  than on entry into a military alliance which might only whip up  Russian hegemonistic tendencies.    Neoisolationism and the defense on all fronts of American  economic and commercial interests are the two axes of the  foreign policy pursued by the former governor of Arkansas, who  is still heeding the opinion polls that tirelessly tell him this  is the desire of U.S. public opinion. One, two, or three trips  to Europe will not be enough to alter this fact, unless there is  a Russian disaster. Averting such a disaster was the main aim  of Bill Clinton's visit. Officially, the U.S. President is  working for the integration of a democratic Russia in Europe.  In practice, it is as if he was prepared to make do with a  democracy that is more superficial than real, and with accepting  the legitimacy of a Russian sphere of influence coinciding  (aside from Ukraine and the three Baltic Republics at present)  with the borders of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, there is  nothing to say that Boris Yeltsin, who knows his country better  than the American strategists, is particularly interested in his  country's hypothetical integration into Europe. On the other  hand, he seems infinitely more interested in maintaining  Russia's role as a nuclear superpower. Hence the importance he  attaches to the agreement on the denuclearization of Ukraine,  even if it has little chance of being approved by the Kiev  Parliament: He will have shown his "goodwill," whereas the  Ukrainian deputies will have confirmed their irresponsibility.    Europe is no more certain of its destiny after Bill  Clinton's  visit than it was before.    But it can no longer put forward false excuses or cherish  illusions: It knows, because it has been told, that it can only  rely on its own forces and its own will.</p>

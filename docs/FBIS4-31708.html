			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- U.S. Ambassador to Croatia  Peter Galbraith visited Knin and the republic of Serb Krajina  [RSK] today where he held talks with RSK President Milan Martic  and his associates, the ISKRA news agency has reported.    The basic topic of their talks was, as both Galbraith and  Martic said at a news conference, the issue connected with the  implementation of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, i.e. the  removal of the remaining misunderstandings between the Croatian  and Krajina sides ahead of negotiations on economic issues and  cooperation to be held this week. Galbraith and Martic assessed  the talks as useful and stressed that they encompassed a wide  spectrum of current issues and problems.    Galbraith particularly stressed that at the meeting today  the  Krajina side told him of their concern over Croatia's failure to  comply with the cease-fire agreement and a reduced level of  monitoring by military observers of the demilitarized zone on  the Croatian side of the separation line. He said that he was  taking these demands extremely seriously and that he would  inform his government and the Croatian side about them.    President Martic particularly underlined Galbraith's stance  that the Krajina-Croatia conflict could no longer be resolved by  force. The war option accomplishes nothing, Martic stressed and  added that today's talks focused specifically on the conduct of  the Croatian and Serb police in the buffer zones. He also said  that most misunderstandings have been removed as far as the  Krajina side was concerned, while Ambassador Galbraith promised  he would take similar steps to remove misunderstandings in  Zagreb.    Asked by reporters which issues could be agreed on quickly  at  the upcoming negotiations, Martic replied: These issues concern  the securing of water supplies for Zadar by us, in return for  the delivery of spare parts for the Obrovac hydroelectric power  plant and the securing of water supplies for Teslingrad and  Drnis by the Croatian side.    We would then review humanitarian issues regarding  compensation to hard currency account holders and pensioners --  57,000 pensioners on the territory of the RSK. Only then will  we discuss the opening of the Adriatic oil pipeline, on  condition that it is completely opened all the way to Pancevo  where Krajina crude oil is processed, Martic concluded. He  added that communications issues could only be tackled after  peace was stabilized and other issues are resolved.    Ambassador Galbraith will also be visiting the Benkovac  area,  especially the devastated Serb villages of Kasic and Islam  Grcki, ISKRA reports.</p>

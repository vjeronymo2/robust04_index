			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Working in Germany I HAVE moved to Germany to work on a self-employed basis for an indefinite period. Should I continue to pay Class 3 voluntary contributions or would it be more beneficial to invest this money myself? The decision will turn on how long you expect to remain outside the UK. If you continue working in Germany, it is probable that you will in due course be required to start contributing to the German social security system. In the interim period, payment of Class 3 contributions will keep the door open for return to the UK system. We suggest that you write, setting out your position and quoting your National Insurance number, to: Department of Social Security, Overseas Branch, Longbenton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE98 1YX. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

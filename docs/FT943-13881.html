			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Gates decides to soften his line: Computer software leader Microsoft takes a pragmatic approach Microsoft, undisputed leader of the personal computer software industry, has done what it vowed it would never do by signing a consent decree to antitrust charges levelled by the US Justice Department and the European Commission. Still proclaiming innocence, the company headed by Bill Gates took a pragmatic approach when faced with the imminent prospect of being dragged through US and European courts on charges that it erected barriers to competition, bullied PC manufacturers into buying its products and tried to impose restrictive agreements on other software developers to maintain its dominant role in the PC operating system software market. 'We had very much in mind what happened to IBM,' said Mr Bill Neukom, Microsoft chief counsel, referring to the computer company's decade-long struggle against antitrust charges in the US which, when finally dropped, were picked up in the European courts. By settling the complaints on what it called 'reasonable terms', Microsoft has brought to an end four years of speculation surrounding the antitrust investigations, which raised a far broader range of allegations than those specified in the official complaint. Notably omitted from the official complaint, for example, were the allegations of several Microsoft competitors that the company's applications software group had unfair advantages over competitors because of internal links - a charge which if it had been upheld, might have led to a forced division of the company. The Justice Department may also be relieved to have resolved a case which could have placed the Clinton administration in an embarrassing battle with one of the most successful companies in the US information technology industry, while promoting high technolgy as the 'engine for US economic growth'. Thus some may see the settlement as a let-off for Microsoft, despite the strong rhetoric of Ms Janet Reno, US attorney general, who charged that Microsoft was being forced to abandon 'illegal monopolistic practices' that have 'choked off competition and preserved its monopoly position'. 'Today's settlement levels the playing field and opens the door to competition,' said Ms Reno. PC buyers will have a wider choice of operating systems and PC manufacturers will no longer have to pay royalties to Microsoft for computers not containing its software, she said. In practice, however, industry analysts do not expect the settlement to have a significant impact on the balance of power in the software market in the foreseeable future. 'The operating system wars are over - Microsoft is the winner,' said Mr Richard Shaffer, president of Technologic Partners, a technology research company in New York. The huge installed base of Microsoft operating systems - some 120m PCs have MS-DOS installed - together with the plethora of applications designed to run on Microsoft's operating systems, virtually guarantee that Microsoft will continue to dominate the field for some time. IBM, Microsoft's strongest rival in the PC operating system market, sold about 3m copies of its OS/2 program last year compared with Microsoft's sales of about 2m copies of Windows a month. The consent decree might create a short-lived opportunity for Novell, one of Microsoft's fiercest antagonists on the antitrust issue. The Utah company offers an alternative version of Microsoft's DOS, called DR-DOS, and has been struggling to persuade PC manufacturers to adopt it. 'We will be knocking on the doors of PC makers on Monday morning offering them an alternative to MS-DOS at competitive prices,' said Mr David Bradford, Novell's chief counsel. However, with Microsoft planning later this year to launch 'Chicago' - a new PC operating system that incorporates all of the functions of MS-DOS, Windows and more - Novell's chances of stealing Microsoft custom may prove to be limited. Had the antitrust settlement come a year ago, it might have had a greater impact, industry analysts said. Now, with Chicago on the horizon, Microsoft has little to lose because none of its competitors has a product that can match the new operating system. The only obvious beneficiaries of the Microsoft settlement are PC manufacturers, who now have the right to demand new licensing terms from Microsoft. Yet their bargaining strength is still limited by Microsoft's dominant role in the PC industry. PC buyers are unlikely to notice the effects of the settlement. Operating systems represent a very small portion of the total cost of a PC - in the region of Dollars 15-Dollars 50 - so any cost savings by PC makers are likely to have a minimal effect on prices. Microsoft is not, however, entirely off the hook. The company is 'wide open to private antitrust suits', said one industry lawyer. Although Microsoft has not admitted guilt in the consent decree, the Justice Department allegations might bolster charges brought by competing software companies, he said. Microsoft also faces a 6 1/2 - year period during which its activities will be closely monitored by the department and by EU competition authorities. Concerns about antitrust infringement are widely seen as one of the factors in IBM's fall from industry leadership because the company's day-to-day management activities were for many years routinely reviewed by lawyers, slowing decision-making. 'We have been largely successful in avoiding that syndrome,' during the antitrust investigations, said Mr Neukom. 'We have not let it slow us down or distract us.' He acknowledged, however, that if Microsoft should become 'slow -footed or start second-guessing ourselves too much we could fall behind the pace of the industry.' Other companies have dominated sectors of the computer industry for a period of years, only to fade into oblivion when new technology overtakes them, Mr Neukom recalled. It is a fate that Microsoft must now work harder to avoid.

Germany wants to contribute toward integration  and cooperation with East and Central Europe very much in the  spirit of the last NATO summit, through an international  security policy conference entitled "Stability as a Pan-European  Task," which began in Berlin today, the minister said prior to  the start of the conference.    As can be seen by the composition, with representatives of  14  European countries and the United States, this is a conference  at the heart of Europe, "where -- as people used to say -- East  meets West."    This is also important for Berlin, Ruehe stressed. He knew  of no better place, "when it is a matter of extending the  stability we enjoy to all of Europe."    Asked about a possible NATO mission in Bosnia, Ruehe said it  is a matter for the United Nations to decide. In any event,  things cannot continue as they have until now. The world  organization has "to stand by what it has said." Germany has "a  perfectly normal influence" on the United Nations, Ruehe said.    The defense ministers of Denmark, Austria, and Slovakia,  high-ranking officers and civil servants as well as leading  academics, are taking part in the conference. They intend to  work out specific steps for fashioning fresh political prospects  in Europe. The individual rounds of talks at the German defense  minister's official residence in Berlin will deal mainly with  NATO and the European Union transfering stability, as well as  central Europe's security expectations. The conference will  conclude tomorrow with an exchange of opinions on European  stability as a focus of Russo-American security interests.</p>

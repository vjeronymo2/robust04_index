			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Press moves to head off statutory controls THE NEWSPAPER industry yesterday outlined steps to strengthen self-regulation in an attempt to head off statutory controls. The plans range from altering the membership of the Press Complaints Commission to ensure a non-press majority, to the creation of a telephone helpline for the public. The helpline, to be run by the commission, will give immediate advice to anyone fearing that the code of practice governing journalists' behaviour is about to be breached. It will also provide the telephone and fax numbers of the editors involved. Mr Harry Roche, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance (Pressbof), the body which co-ordinates the newspaper and magazine industry's actions on self-regulation, said yesterday that the industry was 'totally opposed to statutory regulation'. However, it recognised the need for a responsible press which commanded the respect of the public. The changes announced yesterday come in response to proposals for a statutory press complaints commission from Sir David Calcutt, who chaired the commission on the press and privacy. The Commons national heritage committee has advocated a statutory press ombudsman, and the bill put before parliament by Labour MP Mr Clive Soley proposed a press authority with statutory powers. In future the Press Complaints Commission, the self-regulatory body funded by Pressbof, will be made up of eight non-press members, seven editors and the independent chairman. Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, said there should be talks across the industry to see whether a common approach could be agreed on how newsgatherers treat victims of tragedy. The government has not yet announced its position apart from emphasising that it plans to go ahead with measures to outlaw electronic eavesdropping and the use of telephoto lenses on private property. Such measures are accepted in principle by the industry as long as they apply to everyone and not just to journalists.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Drug groups forge global link-ups: Wide-ranging deals aim to counter cuts in government spending on medicines FOUR of the world's largest drugs companies yesterday announced wide-ranging deals as part of the global industry's attempt to adapt to reduced government spending on medicines. Warner-Lambert of the US and Britain's Wellcome have negotiated a global joint venture which will fuse their over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription medicines businesses. The US group has also formed a strategic alliance with Glaxo Holdings, Europe's biggest drugs company, to market OTC versions of the British company's prescription drugs. The deals provide Warner-Lambert with top products which it can market over the counter and enable Wellcome and Glaxo to generate revenues from the fast-growing OTC market, while relieving them of the need to spend large sums promoting OTC medicines. Meanwhile, US-based Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, has agreed to acquire Medco Containment, the largest US mail order drugs distributor, for Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn). The deal will bring Merck into the fast-growing drugs mail order market, which was worth about Dollars 3.9bn last year. Warner-Lambert's deals give it access to two of the world's eight top-selling prescription drugs - Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment Zantac, which had prescription sales last year of Dollars 3.4bn, and Wellcome's anti-viral medicine, Zovirax, which had sales of Dollars 1.15bn. Neither Zovirax nor Zantac has been licensed as an OTC product by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, most successful OTC products have previously been prescription medicines. Although Warner-Lambert is one of the world's leading OTC companies, it has few prescription drugs that could be sold over the counter. The OTC market is expected to grow rapidly as more prescription drugs lose their patent protection. Governments are encouraging products to switch from prescription to OTC status, as consumers pay directly for non-prescription drugs. 'This is a first-class deal for Wellcome,' said Mr John Robb, chief executive. 'There will be more of these deals, and we are pleased to have stolen a march on the opposition.' Warner-Lambert's joint venture with Wellcome, to be called Warner Wellcome Consumer Health Products, would have had sales last year of Dollars 1.6bn, making it the third largest OTC company in the US after Johnson &amp; Johnson and American Home Products. It will be the fourth largest in Europe. Mr John Walsh, president of Warner-Lambert's consumer sector, said the new business continued to be weak in Germany and would need to be strengthened. Zovirax was the only licensed treatment for genital herpes in the US and had huge potential, he said. There were no plans to submit an application in the US for a Zovirax cream for cold-sores. In Germany and the UK the drug has OTC approval for this illness. Mr Robb said Zovirax's move in the US from prescription to OTC status was sensitive because it involved genital herpes, but the company was working constructively with the FDA on the subject. Last month, Syntex, the US company, had its application to switch an analgesic called Naprosyn turned down by the FDA. Wellcome's OTC business had sales last year of about Dollars 340m, representing about 14 per cent of group sales. Warner-Lambert will not be bringing its Rolaids anti-acid treatment or Halls cough drops to the joint venture. The US group will be the managing partner of the new company and receive 70 per cent of US profits. Wellcome, which will have three of the seven members of the board, will receive the remainder. For the rest of the world, the profits will be shared on an approximately equal basis. Glaxo's alliance with Warner-Lambert confirms chairman Sir Paul Girolami's insistence that his company will not diversify from prescription medicines. Mr Franz Humer, Glaxo's chief operating director, said there was no link between the deal and the recent sacking of Dr Ernest Mario as group chief executive. Glaxo's joint venture will concentrate on developing Zantac in the US and Europe, although not Japan where it already has an agreement. In London, Wellcome's shares rose 31p to 696p, while Glaxo closed up 10p at 558p. Warner-Lambert closed unchanged at Dollars 67 1/4 on Wall Street. Merck's shares ended down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 3/4. Page 15 Muscle behind a counter offensive Lex Page 16 Merck in Dollars 6bn deal Page 22</p>

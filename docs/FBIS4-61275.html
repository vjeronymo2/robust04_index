			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow and Washington for the first time showed  complete agreement on the necessity for an urgent international  meeting on a settlement in Bosnia. This was announced by  Kozyrev's Advisor Galina Sidorova when commenting on the meeting  between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S.  secretary of State Warren Christopher in Cairo today.    Sidorova said that they had discussed a possible meeting  between the foreign ministers of the states involved in the  settlement of the Bosnian crisis which might take place in  Geneva in the near future. Sidorova said the terms were still  being worked upon. For instance, Russia, the USA, three EU  members -- France, Germany and Great Britain and international  mediators Torvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen are expected to  participate. The final date will be defined during  consultations between the future participants in the meeting.    This meeting will open the way for a summit on a settlement  in Bosnia with the same countries participating. Kozyrev and  Christopher were deeply concerned over the situation around the  Bosnian city of Brcko. The situation in Brcko calls for an  agreement in order to put an end to all military actions on  Bosnian territory, Sidorova said.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Police arrest Nadir tax inspector A TAX investigator involved in inquiries into the financial affairs of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive tycoon, was arrested yesterday by detectives probing 'alleged corruption'. Mr Michael Allcock and his wife Sally were taken from their home in Chelmsford, Essex, to London for questioning by Metropolitan and City of London Fraud Squad officers. The couple were released on police bail and ordered to report back to Holborn police station in October, Scotland Yard said. Mr Allcock is the tax inspector accused by Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, of 'improper collusion' with the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Mates, who resigned over the Nadir affair last month, said that Mr Allcock tipped off the SFO. However Mr Allcock, in an interview with the Financial Times earlier this month, insisted instead that he had reported his suspicions about Mr Nadir, who jumped bail in May, to the Stock Exchange. Mr Allcock was suspended in September as head of the Revenue's Special Office 2, its crack investigative unit, on full pay pending a Fraud Squad investigation following an internal inquiry, not related to the Nadir affair, by Revenue officials. In the FT interview he gave details of how he worked closely with the exchange in its investigation of Mr Nadir's financial affairs and those of Swiss companies believed to be fronting for him. The exchange has acknowledged that it received corroborative information from the Revenue that led it to ask the SFO to carry out the first of its raids on Mr Nadir's companies.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum faces an uphill struggle ABERDEEN Petroleum, the US-based oil and gas company, faces an uphill struggle in its attempt at a friendly merger with Brabant Resources, the North Sea exploration group. Large shareholders expressed scepticism last week over the approach by Aberdeen. 'At the moment we have not got a firm proposal,' said one shareholder. 'We have only got an idea.' Aberdeen admitted that it had not yet presented any terms or conditions of any potential merger. It is likely, however, that any offer would be made purely with shares. On Friday, Aberdeen's shares closed steady at 8 1/2 p while Brabant's were firm at 27p. Both companies have proved disappointing for investors since coming to the USM in the late 1980s. Aberdeen's share price has fallen from an early peak of 34p, while the shares of Brabant have declined from a high of 160p in its first few weeks of quotation. They each had a market value of less than Pounds 5m last week. Although there is widespread sympathy for consolidation of the vast number of oil and gas stocks which are too small to raise any useful finance, investors said they would prefer to see a merger of more similar companies. One investor said: 'It would be more sensible to have the merger of companies operating in similar areas.' However, he added: 'There is a case for companies to start getting together and . . . it pays to do it at the beginning rather than at the end.' Other investors said they were not averse to a merger for Brabant, although they would prefer it to be with another exploration company. Aberdeen, which itself has been the subject of takeover speculation, rejected the criticisms of its choice for merger.</p>

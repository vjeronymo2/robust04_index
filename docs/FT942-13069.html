			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Dhaka business halted by strike Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, was brought to a halt yesterday by the second general strike in a month called by opposition parties in an effort to put pressure on the government of Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister. The parties are calling for an early general election under a caretaker government well before Mrs Zia's term expires in 1996. They want to take advantage of what they see as waning support for the ruling Bangladesh National party, which fared badly in municipal elections last month in Dhaka and Chittagong, the second city. Mrs Zia, widow of the murdered former president, General Zia ur Rahman, shows no sign of acceding to demands of the opposition - the Awami League, headed by Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujib ur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence leader, and the Jatiya party of the former president and military dictator, General Hossain Ershad, who was overthrown in 1990 and is now in jail on corruption charges. Diplomats say much Bangladeshi politics consists of feuds between Mrs Zia, Sheikh Hasina and Gen Ershad's followers in which policy differences are unimportant. Nevertheless, the recent council elections showed some voter opposition to Mrs Zia's economic policies - especially a World Bank-endorsed liberalisation programme which includes plans for cuts in state-owned industries. Opposition parties claim that, because the government was defeated in the council polls, the Bangladesh National party will try to rig the general election. They argue that the fact that the 1990 poll won by Mrs Zia was fought under a caretaker government is a useful precedent. A senior aide of Sheikh Hasina argues that caretaker governments are a good way of ensuring fairness and stability in a young democracy. Businessmen fear that the strikes are already disrupting trade and undermining efforts to promote the country among foreign investors.</p>

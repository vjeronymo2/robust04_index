			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov is  currently in Vietnam to attend the third session of the  Russia-Vietnam Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade,  Scientific, and Technological Cooperation.    Mr. Yarov, in an interview with Radio Voice of Vietnam,  spoke  of the results of this session.    [Begin Yarov recording, in Russian fading into English  translation] It marks a new step in the comprehensive  cooperation between Russia and Vietnam. The conference decided  to continue the cooperation between the two countries,  especially in energy and oil and gas joint ventures. It also  considered the renovation of some enterprises. The two sides  agreed to cooperate in building industrial and agricultural  sectors and fishery. The two countries also signed an agreement  on cooperation in postal and communications fields. [end  recording]    Mr. Yarov spoke of the cooperative relations between Vietnam  and Russia in the present situation. He said: What Russia has  done in Vietnam, it does not want to shift to other countries.  We plan to consolidate and develop the relations between the  two countries. Now Russia will continue to cooperate with  Vietnam as the former Soviet Union did in the past, because old  friends are always better than new ones.    During his visit, the deputy prime minister of Russia also  attended the inauguration of the eighth generator unit of the  Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Voice of Vietnam asked  for his comments and whether Russia plans to cooperate with  Vietnam to build other projects on such big scale. He said:    [Begin Yarov recording, in Russian fading into English  translation] The Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Project is a  combination of the joint effort of Vietnamese workers and  Russian experts. I would like to congratulate Vietnam for  building this project through its own effort. It proves that  Vietnam is able to do other bigger projects. The Hoa Binh  Hydroelectric Project is the symbol of the close relations  between Vietnam and Russia. It makes relations between Vietnam  and Russia as well as other countries in the Commonwealth of  Independent States become closer and closer. In future, Russia  may install two other generator units at the Hoa Binh  Hydroelectric Power Plant, and two other generator units at the  Pha Lai Thermal Electric Power Plant. When Russia is [word  indistinct] from its crisis, and it is certainly getting out of  the crisis, we will have more joint ventures and investment in  Vietnam. [end recording]    Mr. Yarov then gave his impression about Vietnam and its  people. He said: The Vietnamese people are hardworking and  hospitable. During my working visit to Vietnam, the Vietnamese  Government has created favorable conditions for us, especially  during my visit and in our presence at the inauguration of the  eighth generator unit of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant.  The weather in Vietnam is very beautiful.</p>

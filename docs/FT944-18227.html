			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Azerbaijan in state of emergency Azerbaijan's President Haydar Aliyev imposed a state of emergency yesterday after interior ministry troops held the general prosecutor captive overnight to demand the release of jailed colleagues, Reuter reports from Baku. In a television address President Aliyev said the seizure of general prosecutor Mr Ali Umarov by the special interior ministry police amounted to a 'coup d'etat'. 'What has happened testifies to the fact that aggressive forces inside and outside the country are still trying to destabilise the republic,' he said. Mr Umarov was freed yesterday after being held by a 100-strong unit which seized control of the building where he worked. The president said the force demanded the resignation of the general prosecutor and the interior minister. He rejected these demands. Government troops then encircled the base to where the disgruntled units had withdrawn after releasing Mr Umarov. All telephone lines were cut between the capital Baku and Russia and other former Soviet republics. Some satellite lines had also been shut down and the main post office in the capital was closed. A night-time curfew was expected to come into effect. The state of emergency tightens regulations on entering and leaving the country, imposes media censorship and bans demonstrations and strikes. It also empowers the president to suspend the activities of political parties seen as destabilising the country. Witnesses reported that several tanks were patrolling Baku streets, guarding government buildings and military installations. News reports said government troops had briefly exchanged fire with the interior ministry forces but there had been no casualties.</p>

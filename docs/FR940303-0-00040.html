If the binding agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently is rescinded under state law, and the taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enters into a new binding agreement for allocation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific housing credit dollar amount to the building, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer must apply to the building the appropriate percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the elected month of the rescinded binding agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if no prior election was made with respect to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rescinded binding agreement, the taxpayer may elect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate percentage for the month of the new binding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Increases in credit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The election under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), once made, applies to any increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit amount allocated for a building, whether the increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs in the same or in a subsequent year. However, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of a binding agreement (or carryover allocation that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as a binding agreement) to allocate a credit amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 42(e)(1) for substantial rehabilitation treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a separate new building, a taxpayer may make the election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) notwithstanding that a prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) is in effect for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior allocation of credit for a substantial rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was previously placed in service under section 42(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amount allocated.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The housing credit dollar amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eventually allocated to a building may be more or less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount specified in the binding agreement. Depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency's determination pursuant to section 42(m)(2) as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the financial feasibility of the building (or project), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency may allocate a greater housing credit dollar amount to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the building (provided that the Agency has additional housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit dollar amounts available to allocate for the calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year of the allocation) or the Agency may allocate a lesser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing credit dollar amount. Under section 42(h)(7)(D), in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocating a housing credit dollar amount, the Agency must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify the applicable percentage and maximum qualified basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the building. The applicable percentage may be less, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not greater than, the appropriate percentage for the month the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building is placed in service, or the month elected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer under section 42(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). Whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate percentage is the appropriate percentage for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 70-percent present value credit or the 30-percent present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value credit is determined under section 42(i)(2) when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building is placed in service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Taxpayer.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The taxpayer must give the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original notarized election statement to the Agency before the close of the 5th calendar day following the end of the month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which the binding agreement is made. The taxpayer must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain a copy of the binding agreement and the election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement and must file an additional copy of each with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's Form 8609, Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification, for the first taxable year in which credit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimed for the building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agency.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency must file with the Internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revenue Service the original of the binding agreement and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election statement with the Agency's Form 8610, Annual Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report, that accounts for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year the allocation is actually made. The Agency must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain a copy of the binding agreement and the election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Scope of the Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment shall remain in effect for ten years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment shall apply to Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. and to each of their successors, assigns, and to all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who shall have received actual notice of the Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Effect of the Proposed Final Judgment on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The relief set out in the proposed Final Judgment is designed to prevent recurrence of the activities alleged in the Complaint. The proposed Final Judgment's provisions are designed to remove the artificial restraints that the defendants have imposed on competition among automobile body repair shops and create an environment in which more vigorous competition may take place. It is intended to ensure that marketing and pricing decisions of Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are made independently, without any discussions and conversations with each other. The Department of Justice believes that the proposed Final Judgment contains sufficient provisions to prevent further violations of the type alleged in the Complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The alternative to the proposed Final Judgment would be a full trial of the case. In the view of the Department of Justice, such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted because the proposed Final Judgment provides relief that will remedy the violations of the Sherman Act alleged in the United States' Complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Remedies Available to Private Litigants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the Final Judgment has no  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prima facie <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against any defendant in this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposed judgment should be modified may submit written comments to Gary R. Spratling, Chief, San Francisco Office, Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California 94102, within the 60-day period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Government's responses to them, will be filed with the Court and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed judgment at any time prior to its entry if it should determine that some modification of the judgment is necessary to the public interest. The proposed judgment itself provides that the Court will retain jurisdiction over this action, and that the parties may apply to the court for such orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the modification or enforcement of the judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Determinative Documents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No materials and documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed judgment. Consequently, none are filed herewith. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Gary R.

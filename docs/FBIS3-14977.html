			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned from  informal sources on 1 March that President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton  recommending that Minister of Economy Roman Shpek be appointed  Ukraine's new prime minister. Observers from government circles  connect the American President's inclination toward Roman Shpek  with the success of the Ukrainian Government delegation's  negotiations in Washington at the end of January 1994. UNIAN  was unable to obtain official confirmation of this report by the  press service of the president and the Cabinet of Ministers.</p>

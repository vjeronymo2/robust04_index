			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Two North San Diego County men were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter after  their boat sank during a fishing trip. Steve Turner, 40, of Leucadia, the owner  of the 18-foot boat, and George Beitner, 33, of Carlsbad, were hauled from the  water about two hours after they sent a 12:30 p.m. distress call. Coast Guard  Chief Mark Vavra said the rescue was delayed because the location they radioed  was in error. Rescue vessels from Oceanside and fishing boats in the area could  find no trace of the missing men or wreckage and stopped searching after an  hour. The Coast Guard's chopper finally found them 10 miles off Oceanside --  more than 5 miles from the position they had reported. Turner and Beitner were  flown to Palomar Airport, where they were reported unhurt.  </P></p>

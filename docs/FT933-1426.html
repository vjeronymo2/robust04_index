			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan warned on trade sanctions US TRADE negotiators this week warned Japan that 'radical action' must be taken to improve the current bilateral trade imbalance. If not, the economic relationship between the two will be 'irrevocably harmed.' The US trade deficit with Japan stands at some Dollars 60bn so far this year, compared with Dollars 50bn for all of last year. Senior US administration officials are in Hawaii, where the two sides have begun to map out the details of the 'framework agreement' reached at the Tokyo economic summit in July. However, the only substantive news from the meetings this week was the release of the figures for market share held by foreign semiconductors in Japan, which fell in the second quarter from 19.6 to 19.2 per cent - the second one-quarter drop in a row. The US-Japan semiconductor agreement calls for a slow, steady increase in market share, which hit 20.2 per cent in the last quarter of 1992, and US trade officials insist that the average share this year be no less than 20 per cent. A senior US official characterised the Japanese response to US proposals as 'moderately receptive' but said that could change. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, is to meet President Bill Clinton at the UN in New York next week. 'It is conceivable that instruction has gone out to not make waves,' the official said. 'But we made it clear that our resolve stems from the White House, (from) public reaction to the economic imbalance in this relationship and the view that Japan's trade policies are a drag on global growth.' Under the framework agreement, the Clinton administration embarked on the latest US attempt to avoid retaliatory trade clashes with Japan, while insisting that sanctions would follow unless there were immediate progress.</p>

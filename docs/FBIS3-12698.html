His Majesty King Hassan II, may God render him victorious,  has sent a cable of condolences to the Palestinian president  Yasir 'Arafat. The cable says:    His Excellency and dear brother Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, head of  the fraternal State of Palestine;    We were taken aback by the news of the savage, terrible  massacre, whose victims were a large number of our innocent  Palestinian brothers in the occupied territories while they were  performing the Dawn Prayers in the safe sanctuary of the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque and on this Friday of the blessed month of  Ramadan at the hands of criminals who were made by virtue of  hatred and racism to commit the most ugliest of crimes and take  mankind back to the dark ages. We strongly deplore this  abominable and terrible massacre and strongly condemn its  perpetrators and all those who participated in carrying it out  by not taking the necessary precautions to avoid it. We beseech  God Almighty to extend His mercy to the righteous martyrs and to  grant you and their folks patience and condolences. We also  request you to be the best interpreter of our feelings to their  families and relatives.    Signed: Your brother Hassan II, King of Morocco.    In the same context the official spokesman of the Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs and Cooperation has stated that the Moroccan  Kingdom has learned with deep sorrow the news of the Hebron  massacre, which resulted in the death of scores of innocent  Palestinians while they were performing their religious duties  during the blessed month of Ramadan and at a place which is holy  to all heavenly religions. The spokesman added that Morocco,  while bowing with respect before the souls of the martyrs -- the  victims of blind extremism -- strongly condemns this abominable  crime carried out at a time when the international community was  hoping to establish peace soon in the region and was devoting  special attention to the recent Palestinian- Israeli agreement.  The spokesman concluded by saying that Morocco, while appealing  for the severe and resolute punishment of the perpetrators of  this abominable crime and for putting an end to the escalation  of violence, is of the opinion that such acts should be an  incentive for the international community to mobilize to secure  peace and security and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian  people.

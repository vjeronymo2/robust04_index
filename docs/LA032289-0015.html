			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECISIONS MAY SPUR EXPANDED DRUG TESTING  </P> <P> Tuesday's Supreme Court decisions on drug testing will encourage California  employers to expand their testing programs, particularly to determine whether  drugs played a role in causing an accident, a lawyer who has represented many  California companies in drug-testing litigation believes.  </P> <P> Additionally, the decisions may encourage private-sector employers to expand  their pre-employment testing programs, even though neither of the two decisions  dealt directly with that issue, said Victor Schachter, a San Francisco lawyer  who wrote a friend-of-the-court brief in one of the cases on behalf of the  California Employment Law Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Strong Message'  </P> <P> The decisions "send a very strong message" that the Supreme Court believes  safety issues are going to be weighed "very heavily" when employees or their  unions raise objections on grounds that their privacy rights have been  violated, Schachter said.  </P> <P> But other lawyers who have represented employees in drug-testing litigation say  that the decisions are very narrowly drawn and are unlikely to have much effect  on workers whose jobs do not involve public safety or security issues.  </P> <P> "I don't think the decisions have as wide a ramification as one might initially  think," said Ed Chen, staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of  Northern California.  </P> <P> "Both cases involve very limited types of testing under extraordinary  circumstances -- in one testing rail crews after accidents and the other  involving customs employees in law enforcement. In each case, the court said  there was a compelling government interest to justify the invasion of privacy,"  Chen added.  </P> <P> Employees in non-sensitive jobs in California, such as court clerks, have  nothing to fear from the opinion, said Glen Rothner, a Los Angeles labor lawyer  who represents unions. However, he added, "If you're a police officer who  carries a firearm, it's going to be a difficult battle" to resist drug testing.  </P> <P> The effect on some occupations -- such as firefighters and truck drivers  hauling loads of toxics -- is not immediately clear, Rothner said. "The  decisions Tuesday placed considerable emphasis on the unique work environments  and job missions" of railway employees and customs agents dealing with drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constitutions Differ  </P> <P> Rothner also said that the decisions by no means resolve all drug-testing  issues for Californians because the U.S. Constitution does not have a specific  privacy provision, as the California Constitution does. "It's still possible  for the California Supreme Court" to limit drug testing more broadly in some  circumstances than the U.S. Supreme Court did Tuesday, he said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Jay Roth, who also represents unions in drug-testing cases,  said he is concerned that the decisions might encourage companies who do  business with the federal government to instigate random testing programs in an  attempt to comply with new federal regulations calling on government  contractors to maintain a "drug-free" workplace.  </P> <P> Gordon Kirby, director of employee relations for the California Trucking Assn.,  said that he thinks the decision might have a significant effect on a case  already pending in California. Some employees of large trucking companies and  owner-operators have challenged various aspects of regulations promulgated by  the U.S. Department of Transportation last year. In January, U.S. District  Judge Marilyn H. Patel in San Francisco enjoined parts of the program,  including all random testing and some post-accident testing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Likely to Be Upheld  </P> <P> Kirby said that Tuesday's ruling upholding testing of all employees involved in  a rail accident, regardless of whether there is individual suspicion of drug  use, makes it likely that the Transportation Department's post-accident testing  regulations ultimately will be upheld.  </P> <P> "Like Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, we are heartened by the decisions," said  Cmdr. William Booth, chief spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. He  said that the rulings will have no immediate effect on the LAPD's testing  program but that he hopes it is a sign that the high court ultimately will  approve random testing for "those who by the very nature of their jobs hold the  lives of others in their hands."  </P> <P> The Orange County Transit District, which has had a drug-testing policy in  effect since the early 1980s, has no plans to change, spokeswoman Claudia Keith  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We have pre-employment drug testing and that's for all (potential) employees,"  Keith said, adding that drivers may be subject to drug testing when they have  been involved in an accident on duty.  </P> <P> "Generally speaking, if a supervisor feels the circumstances of the accident  warrants it or if there's any type of injury, the employee will be drug  tested."  </P> <P> "We don't do any type of random drug testing at all," she said. Keith added  that an employee may also be drug tested if a supervisor believes that the  person is under the influence, but she said it is "very rare that it happens at  all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact on Pilots  </P> <P> John Mazur, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said that he thinks the  decision will not have a major impact in California or nationally on the 41,000  pilots flying for the major carriers.  </P> <P> "We have never said that testing after an airline accident was not  appropriate," Mazur said. "That's one of four circumstances where we see a  legitimate use of drug testing."  </P> <P> Two major cases on drug testing are pending before California appeals courts.  One involves the challenge of two Stanford athletes to a drug-testing program  imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> The other involves a challenge to a pre-employment testing program by Matthew  Bender &amp; Co., a legal publishing firm that is a subsidiary of Times Mirror  Co. That program has been challenged by three prospective employees and the  American Civil Liberties Union.  </P></p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Motoring: Xantia will drive off with the awards IF CITROEN fails to win Europe's prestigious Car of the Year competition with its Xantia, it ought to fly a banner over its head office in Paris saying: 'We were robbed.' Picking a Car of the Year winner two months before the jury votes might seem as chancy as picking a Derby winner two months before the off. But, having driven the short-odds favourites like the Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall (Opel) Corsa and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, as well as the Xantia, I think the Citroen is a racing cert. It certainly should be, although Car of the Year juries can be as unpredictable and perverse as those in courts of justice. Why am I so sure? I suppose that because each time I drive the Xantia, I like it better. This is not so with all new cars. Some do not live up to favourable first impressions. The left-hand drive 1.8- and two-litre Xantias I tried in Spain last February before the car's official debut rode and handled beautifully, looked elegant and had lots of room inside. But I thought the 1.8 sounded a bit buzzy at 80 mph (130 kmh) and 4,000 rpm. The right-hand 1.8 I drove for nearly 500 miles (800 kms) in Britain last month was significantly quieter although I still have reservations about low gearing. Does one's motorway driving at business user speeds have to be at 4,000 rpm-plus (as it was, incidentally, in the admirable Ford Mondeo two-litre Ghia estate I have just used for an enjoyable week)? I don't think so. The up-side of the low gearing is that it makes the Xantia - and Mondeo - extraordinarily flexible. Both accelerate smoothly in top gear from 25 mph (35 kmh). But driving the turbo-diesel version last week removed any lingering doubts that the Xantia should become Car of the Year 1994. The 92 horsepower, 1.9-litre turbo-diesel produces more torque (pulling power) at far lower revolutions than even the most muscular (155 horsepower) 16-valve, two-litre petrol engine. So the Xantia TD has been given taller gearing (25.3 mph/40.7 kmh per 1,000 rpm in fifth) against just over 20 mph (32 kmh) for the petrol-engined models. For a diesel, it is unnervingly quiet; so quiet that you forget it is a diesel when on the move. Even when idling in traffic, the only reminder is a remote sort of chuckle from under the bonnet. Figures show the TD out-performs the 1.6i petrol but not the 1.8i. But there is more to performance in the real world than brutally-obtained, standing start acceleration times and maximum speeds which are illegal and unusable. It is the pulling power of the 1.9-litre turbo-diesel at modest revolutions that makes it the most agreeably driveable Xantia of all. At 80 mph (130 km), it whispers along at a shade over 3,000 rpm compared with a petrol-engined Xantia's near-4,000. Yet, pick-up from 50-70 mph (80-128 kmh) is so strong that the Xantia TD accelerates in top gear up hills that would demand a downward change in many other cars of moderately high gearing. The non-turbo Xantia diesel is less vigorous: 99 mph/159 kmh maximum against the turbo's 111 mph/179 kmh, and a standing-start kilometre in 38.2 seconds (34.4 secs). But it runs as smoothly and quietly and promises even better economy, averaging 44.6 mpg (6.32 l/100 km) against the turbo's 43 mpg (6.57 l/100 km). For many buyers, the price will be the clincher. At Pounds 10,895, the 1.9D costs the same as the petrol entry model, the 1.6i, which makes it a bargain. The cheapest turbo-diesel, the Xantia TD LX, is Pounds 12,795. Diesel car sales in Britain are rising. Last year, 200,000 were sold and, at the beginning of this year, the industry estimated a rise to 225,000 in 1993. But this has been overtaken by events. Between January and the end of June, 141,974 (16.92 per cent of the market) diesel cars were registered compared with 87,276 (11.35 per cent) in the first six months of 1992. In this month's L-registration sales rush, mainly by private buyers, diesel's market share is expected to climb higher still.</p>

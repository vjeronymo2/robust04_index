			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser was back in uniform Monday night at Dodger Stadium. No, his  rehabilitation isn't a year ahead of schedule. He was merely filming a public  service spot. . . .  </P> <P> As has become his custom, Hershiser worked out for two hours before watching an  inning of the Dodger-Houston game and going home. . . .  </P> <P> "I'm lifting weights," he said. "I've had only one bad day -- I worked too  hard. Everything else has been positive. I'm not running or doing other kinds  of exercise because I don't want the rest of my body to be too far ahead of my  arm in the rehab process." . . .  </P> <P> Don't mention the T word -- timetable -- to the 1988 Cy Young Award winner, who  underwent shoulder surgery April 27. . . .  </P> <P> "The whole rehab process is based on patience," he said. "What would ruin that  patience is a timetable." . . .  </P> <P> Hershiser went on the last Dodger trip, and trainer Pat Screnar wants him to  continue to accompany the team so his progress can be monitored. . . .  </P> <P> In the clubhouse in Houston last week, Long Beach reporter Gordon Verrell asked  Hershiser if he could throw a baseball. The pitcher picked one up and flung it  off a wall 30 feet away. Better velocity than Mike Maddux showed against the  Astros that night. . . .  </P> <P> Another Dodger who might have to undergo surgery is Tom Lasorda. Dr. Frank Jobe  thinks it will be necessary to repair damaged cartilage in the manager's right  knee after the season. . . .  </P> <P> "There is no cartilage," Lasorda said. "It's bone against bone. All that  batting practice I've pitched and all that running I've done." . . .  </P> <P> Lasorda said he can't run and can hardly walk, but Monday afternoon he swam 100  laps in the Olympic-sized swimming pool at the Los Angeles Police Academy  behind Dodger Stadium. . . .  </P> <P> It was some of the most rigorous exercise Lasorda has done since May 30, 1948.  That was the night he pitched all 15 innings in the Schenectady Blue Jays' 6-5  victory over the Amsterdam Rugmakers. According to an article in the  Schenectady Gazette that was on his desk Monday, he singled home the winning  run and struck out a Canadian-American League-record 25 batters. . . .  </P> <P> "Canadian-American League," scoffed coach Bill Russell. "Terrible league." . .  .  </P> <P> Even the most logical intentional walk will be booed by the home crowd. . . .  </P> <P> Quite a home run race the St. Louis Cardinals and Cecil Fielder are having. . .  .  </P> <P> Barry Bonds used to be known as the son of Bobby Bonds. Now Bobby is known as  the father of Barry. . . .  </P> <P> The Atlanta Braves have been over .500 only eight days since June 1, 1987. . .  .  </P> <P> If there had been a match-play format for the Hale Irwin-Mike Donald playoff  Monday, Irwin would have won the U.S. Open on the 18th hole. . . .  </P> <P> There should be no complaints from the Sunday Silence camp about the 126 pounds  he has been assigned for the $1-million Gold Cup Sunday at Hollywood Park. Ack  Ack carried 134 when he won in 1971, Affirmed 132 for his victory in 1979.  Alysheba finished second in 1988 at 126. . . . Pat Riley, reportedly putting  the finishing touches on his deal with NBC in New York, will be a guest on  "Late Night With David Letterman" tonight. . . .  </P> <P> Tony Clark, who averaged 43 points a game for El Cajon Christian High School  and was taken second overall in the baseball draft by the Detroit Tigers, will  play in the Fabulous 44 state prep basketball tournament Sunday at UC Irvine.  Thursday night, the sponsors will take the athletes to a baseball game --  Tigers vs. Angels at Anaheim Stadium. . . .  </P> <P> Of the 22 players in the boys' game Sunday, only one is going to attend college  east of the Mississippi. . . .  </P> <P> Junior-lightweight prospect Gabriel Ruelas, whose brother Rafael went 10 rounds  for the first time in a decision over Abe Gomez at the Forum Monday night, is  expected to fight again in September after suffering a broken elbow in April. .  . .  </P> <P> The Edmonton Oilers won the Stanley Cup and raised the price of tickets by as  much as $2.50. The Kings were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs  and raised the price of tickets by as much as $17.50.  </P></p>

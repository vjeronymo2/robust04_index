			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Bankruptcies rise in Japan THE SLUMP in the Japanese economy is continuing to take a heavy toll on companies, with a sharp rise in corporate bankruptcies last month and a further fall in confidence among small businesses. There were 14,441 corporate failures in the year to the end of last month, up 22.7 per cent from the year before, according to a report by the Teikoku Databank, the private research company. The rise in bankruptcies is increasingly concentrated among smaller companies. In spite of the rise in the number of business failures the combined debts of the companies involved fell by 4.2 per cent to Y7,445bn (Pounds 43bn). The rise in bankruptcies was mainly accounted for by a 42.7 per cent increase in manufacturing failures, a 29 per cent increase in failures in the service sector and a 22 per cent rise among construction companies. In March there were 1,340 bankruptcies, up 18.2 per cent from the year before and 20 per cent up on February. The severity of the slump among smaller companies was reflected in Ministry of International Trade and Industry figures which show small business confidence declined sharply in the first three months of the year. A Miti survey of more than 17,000 small companies found that business confidence fell to minus 36.6 per cent from minus 32 per cent in the previous three months. The index measures the percentage of companies reporting an expected improvement in business conditions, minus the proportion of pessimistic firms. The sales index for the three months to the end of March stood at minus 35.5 per cent, down from minus 28.9 in the final quarter of last year, while the pre-tax profits index stood at minus 39.8 per cent, compared with minus 34 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>

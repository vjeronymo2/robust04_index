			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana regime faces European Court challenge THE EUROPEAN Community's controversial new regime for banana imports could be suspended if complaints by Germany are upheld by the European Court of Justice, which hears the case today in Luxembourg. A judgment may take another 10 days, but will have to be reached before July 1, when the new quota and tariff system comes into effect. The new regime, agreed in February after almost five years of wrangling, sets a quota of 2m tonnes on cheap Latin American banana imports. This quota would attract a uniform duty of 20 per cent, but imports above this level face a tariff of Ecu850 (Pounds 670) a tonne, or roughly 170 per cent. The Latin American exporters have already had a challenge to the current regime upheld by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and yesterday got the Gatt to set up a panel to investigate the new regime. The new regime's object is to set up a single market for bananas now that EC border controls have gone; to meet Uruguay Round requirements for tariffs on all farm produce, which then can gradually be reduced; and to protect the EC's traditional but high-cost suppliers in its outlying territories and former colonies. Germany previously had no duty on bananas, and in 1991 consumed more than half of the 2.4m tonnes of so-called 'dollar bananas' from Latin America, which dominate the 3.7m tonnes EC market. Supported by Belgium and the Netherlands, Bonn sought to block the regime in February but was outvoted. The European Commission and the majority of the member states say the EC is bound by undertakings in the Lome Convention with 69 African, Caribbean and Pacific states to protect their banana industries. Officials in Brussels were confident yesterday that the court would uphold this treaty undertaking. But Germany says it is protected by a 'banana protocol' in the EC's Treaty of Rome, guaranteeing it unimpeded access to the fruit. German banana importers, who have launched a separate legal action, claim they stand to lose half their business, because 30 per cent of dollar fruit import licences will be allocated to traditional importers from the ACP countries. Mr Gerrit Schohe, a lawyer for the German importers, describes this as 'public intervention to shift market share'. The damage will be irreparable, all opponents of the regime argue, and they are asking the court to suspend it. Mr Schohe says the Court's suspension last year of Germany's unilaterally introduced road user charges on foreign trucks, in part because they would irreversibly redistribute market share in the road haulage industry, offers the complainant importers their most hopeful precedent. If the regime were suspended, some officials in Brussels fear, not only chaos in the banana market would result. A failure to set tariffs on bananas could complicate the Uruguay Round outcome, one said, providing an argument for Japan to take its rice out of the tariffs package.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Takayuki Hikuchi] </F>   [Text] During a series of meetings with Japanese cabinet  ministers, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who visited Japan  last week, said: "Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will assume the  overall responsibility for the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks." His statement has raised controversy within the  government. The Foreign Ministry has asked the U.S. Government  to correct Mr. Kantor's statement, claiming, "The foreign  minister never made a statement to that effect." The U.S.  Government, which is pinning high hopes on the Japan-U.S.  foreign ministerial talks to he held shortly before the  Japan-U.S. summit talks slated for 11 February, has yet to  answer the request.    The interpretation of Mr. Kantor's statement is that Foreign  Minister Hata has assumed the position of Japan's top negotiator  responsible for the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. A  source familiar with the talks, who attended two rounds of  meetings between Mr. Kantor and Foreign Minister Hata, said the  foreign minister made no remark to that effect.    On 7 February, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito shook  his  head, saying, "Since (Mr. Hata) is foreign minister and deputy  prime minister, Mr.Kantor probably thought Mr. Hata would assume  overall responsibility for the talks." He also flatly denied  Mr. Kantor's statement, saying, "It is not proper for Mr. Hata  to assume the overall responsibility for the talks." It has  been agreed that vice ministerial officials from the two  countries would hold the talks. Agreements reached by both sides  will be compiled in a report for presentation at the Japan-U.S.  summit talks, but no ministerial talks are scheduled. At first,  the Japanese Government was annoyed by Mr. Kantor's visit to  Japan, but it treated him as a special envoy to the U.S.  President.    It is unclear why Mr. Kantor made the statement, but he is  believed to have made the statement with the aim of bringing a  hasty political settlement to the talks by drawing Prime  Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata out to ministerial  talks if vice ministerial negotiations fail to hammer out any  agreements.    At first, the Foreign Ministry tried to ignore Mr. Kantor's  statement as "publicity for back home." But it later decided to  ask the U.S. Government for a correction, fearing that  controversy might spread within the government.    The United States has pressed Japan for concessions in the  automobile negotiations, which have continued to face rough  sailing. Vice Foreign Minister Saito stressed that the  automobile issue is out of our ministry's jurisdiction, saying,  "How to deal with the automobile issue is primarily up to the  international trade and industry minister." It seems that the  real intention of the Japanese side is that: "It does not want  to break a good relationship among the Foreign Ministry, the  Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry." Did Mr. Kantor's feint operation not work in the  face of the bureaucratic barrier of the three ministries that  remain more cohesive than at any time in the past?</p>

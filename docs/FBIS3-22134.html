			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tony Dawe: "Polluted Cities Fail To Monitor </F> Deadly Cocktail"]    [Text] Most of Britain's big towns and cities fail to  monitor the air their citizens breathe and have no plans to do  so, despite mounting concern at increased levels of pollution, a  survey released today reveals.    They include Aberdeen, Dundee, Newport and several English  industrial centres such as Bradford, Stoke and Wolverhampton.    The gaps in the monitoring of potentially dangerous  pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulphur dioxide  are disclosed in a study commissioned by The Times  and carried out by Friends of the Earth.    The results underline the criticisms being expressed by many  health and environmental groups at apparent lack of concern in  local and national government at the risk to the nation's health  posed by air pollution.    Dr Malcolm Green, chairman of the British Lung Foundation,  said: "People are affected not just by one source of pollution  but by a cocktail of pollutants. Studies are pointing towards  the cocktail as the major culprit for the health problems  associated with poor air quality."    Separate figures collated for the first time from the  existing monitoring stations show hundreds of occasions in 1992  when pollutants exceeded international guidelines.    The findings follow a survey of all local authorities by the  National Society for Clean Air, which reported that air-quality  guidelines are exceeded in more than 100 areas, yet 60  authorities that measure pollutants do not know what are the  guidelines.    Friends of the Earth checked the air-monitoring arrangements  in 58 British towns and cities with populations of more than  100,000 and found most did not monitor the air.    Some intend to start and the Government is to set up a  further 12 "enhanced urban monitoring sites" that will measure  five key pollutants. Friends of the Earth said, however, that  even when all the new sites were operational, 20 of the largest  towns and cities would still have no nitrogen dioxide  monitoring, 23 would fail to monitor sulphur dioxide and 24  would not check ozone levels.    The survey also reveals how often the main pollutants exceed  international guidelines. The figures for 1992 show that levels  of ozone, which aggravates bronchitis and asthma but also  affects normally healthy adults, exceeded World Health  Organisation guidelines on 269 days at 21 monitoring sites.  Levels of nitrogen oxide exceeded guidelines on 60 days at four  London sites, and Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield also  reported several days with worrying levels.    High levels of sulphur dioxide, which comes mostly from  power  stations and heavy industry, were recorded on 100 days at the  two worst sites in central Belfast and Barnsley, South Yorkshire.    "The figures show what a chronic problem air pollution has  become, especially for the millions of people at risk," Fiona  Weir, senior pollution campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said.    Her concern is shared by the Environment Department,  although  not by the rest of the Government, according to health experts.  In a recent report on environmental protection, civil servants  at the department admitted that Britain's commitment to reducing  nitrogen oxide emissions this year "will be a tougher target  than we had expected."    The report continued: "In the longer term, traffic growth in  line with current projections could ultimately reverse the  improvements we will secure from new vehicle standards." The  civil servants also expressed concern at the continuing high  levels of sulphur dioxide recorded in Belfast.    Scientists accept that none of the guidelines by which air  pollution is measured can address the problem of inhaling  several different pollutants and it is this immeasurable  cocktail that is causing the greatest concern.    Friends of the Earth believes the figures underestimate the  problem because of the shortage of monitoring sites. Britain has  only seven sites, designed in compliance with European  directives to measure nitrogen dioxide, compared with 53 in The  Netherlands, 85 in France and 200 in Germany.    It also criticised the Government for the way it monitored  ozone levels, warning people of poor air quality only when the  levels exceeded high-peak figures.    Friends of the Earth believes that people should be warned  of  poor air when lower limits are breached for eight-hour periods.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Visits to institutions raise RJB Mining's fund raising prospects RJB Mining's prospects of receiving backing for its Pounds 914m bid for British Coal's English mining regions looked brighter yesterday after a week of institutional visits, in spite of doubts which have dogged the company's plans. Institutions said they were encouraged by the details revealed in meetings this week, which have been published by the Financial Times. One fund manager, who admitted he had been shaken by public doubts over RJB's coal price and volume assumptions, said he left the meeting 'very reassured'. Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB, had given a 'very good performance'. Shareholders have sought comfort on at least two issues before giving their support to the expected Pounds 425m equity issue: that RJB should be able to pay off the debt it incurs - at present expected to be bank debt of about Pounds 528m; and that price and volume assumptions are realistic, particularly after 1998 when lucrative electricity generator contracts come to an end. On the first issue, institutions are believed to have received comfort over the level of debt RJB will have to pay. In addition, institutions expect capital investment to be half the rate of depreciation. This will free cash flow to service debt. On RJB's price and volume assumptions, institutions still vary. One said the recent publicity would ensure close questioning when RJB presented its proposals. 'Looking at the prices they hope to achieve, they seem a bit optimistic,' the shareholder said. Volume assumptions also seemed a bit high. However, the shareholder said he would reserve judgment until after the presentation. Another shareholder dismissed the doomsday scenarios which have raised questions about the volumes of coal that Mr Budge said he would be able to sell after 1998. 'It is certainly not the case that on April 1 1998, when the contracts end, the whole thing disappears up his backside,' he said.</p>

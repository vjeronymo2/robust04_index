			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / EU walks a tightrope on global trade deal European Union leaders face the delicate task at their Brussels summit today and tomorrow of buying off France and other member states adamant that the Gatt world trade deal now in sight will damage vital national interests. The 12 heads of government will need carefully crafted formulae to satisfy demands the EU will mostly have to meet internally, without breaking a European budget already at its limit. French insistence on a guarantee that EU farmers will not have to 'set aside' or take any more land out of production under a Gatt deal could prove potentially the most expensive. The most divisive issue is likely to be the Franco-Spanish demand that the EU equip itself with tougher anti-dumping and safeguard weapons against unfair trading, as well as trade retaliation instruments to match the US Section 301 legislation. On both counts, Paris could collide with Bonn, which is firmly against new EU trade weapons and fears that the set-aside condition could lead to a further drop in EU farm prices which would hit inefficient German farmers. Portugal feels the EU has failed to reduce significantly US protection of its textile industry, and wants aid to restructure its own, large textiles sector. Greece, which is said to own 40 per cent of the world shipping fleet, believes the Gatt deal on maritime transport will allow the US to remain protectionist in ocean shipping. The deal 'will raise the costs and inefficiency of international maritime transport', says Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek alternate foreign minister. Greece may also seek compensation. On the farm question, if the EU's reform of its common agricultural policy works, European farmers should be able to evade the 21 per cent Gatt cuts in subsidised food exports. The reform's production cuts - through set-aside - mean the EU should be exporting less than the Gatt limits, and its goal of lowering prices to world market levels means the EU could export as much as it wants without subsidy anyway. If this forecast proves wrong, France wants even lower prices rather than more set-aside, plus full compensation for the price cut. And each Ecu10 gap between EU and world prices would cost the Union Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.52bn). The Commission is confident enough of its forecasts to believe a commitment to Paris will cost nothing, but the main EU paymasters, Germany and Britain, are less sanguine. 'I can live with any wording which has no cost to the UK taxpayer. If it looks like a cheque book I'm not signing,' one senior British official said. Bonn apart, attitudes are less hard on trade weapons. A Uruguay Round deal should see the Gatt succeeded by a Multilateral Trade Organisation, which would license all signatories' use of such weapons, so that new European defences would go into an internationally policed mutual deterrence system. The US is still reluctant to place its 301 arsenal under an MTO. The question is, one EU diplomat said, 'does European rearmament make US disarmament less likely?' A possible solution is to make any new EU trade weapons conditional on securing a satisfactory MTO in the Geneva negotiations - provided Bonn concedes the principle. But German officials have hinted for some time that if the French dig in, Chancellor Helmut Kohl could give in.</p>

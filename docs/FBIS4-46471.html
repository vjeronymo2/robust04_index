			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 1st Rank Ye. Privalov: "Russia's </F> Khvalynskoye Line"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    Today the interests of various states, including those that  have been recently formed, are once again beginning to clash on  the water area of the Caspian Sea. Therefore, the strategic and  economic significance of the Lower Volga and the Caspian are  once again dramatically increasing, making them Russia's toehold  in this region. Currently, the Caspian , from an at one time  "internal" sea, the shores of which still recently belonged to a  total of just two countries, is being transformed into a sea  with a complicated international legal regime. First of all,  this has been caused by the need to delimit the territorial  waters and the economic zones among the sovereign states that  have been formed on its shores. And although today Russia has  been left with a total of 770 km of coastline, it needs to be  defended. However, there are still no borders that are precisely  defined by treaties and, therefore, there is no proper order.  This is the second reason. At the present time, a mass of  Russian goods and minerals are exported along the Volga through  Astrakhan. Even cases of the export of weapons and other  military equipment have increased -- there is a war going on  nearby. Furthermore, due to the lessening of monitoring by  Russia in the northern Caspian, fish and seals are being caught  on an ever increasing scale here and, if this unlimited  "fishing" continues further, the Caspian's wealth will be  substantially reduced in several years. Take just sturgeon. The  Russian fish hatcheries located in Astrakhan and in the oblast  are exclusively involved with their restoration. It turns out  that Russia is breeding valuable species of fish and the other  states are catching them.    And this is far from all of the reasons why this region is  increasingly acquiring the characteristics of Russia's southern  coastal "outpost" on the Caspian. Add to what has been said that  the process through which the Caspian region states are  acquiring their sovereignty is naturally accompanied by the  creation of institutes and all that is inherent to them,  including armed forces with navies. Already right now the  Iranian Navy contains 62 ships and the Azeri Navy has 15. Both  Kazakhstan and Turkmeniya plan to have their own navies. Under  these conditions, the role of the Caspian Flotilla is once again  increasing for Russia. However, after the transfer of some of  the flotilla's ships, bases, and infrastructure facilities to  the former union republics, its forces have been significantly  reduced. Furthermore, it has lost more than a third of its  officer personnel: part went to Ukraine, part to Belorussia  [Belarus], others have remained in Azerbaijan or have been  released into the reserve. Losses of warrant officer cadres  exceed half of their former strength. The state of the  flotilla's surface combatants and ships also leaves a lot to be  desired.    But despite everything, the flotilla exists, is developing  infrastructure in new basing locations and is even expanding. In  connection with this, the seamen need to resolve a mass of  problems that are not characteristic to them. The redeployment  has proceeded with difficulty and, first and foremost, due to  the time factor. The time periods in which the Caspian Flotilla  was transferred to new locations is not proceeding in any  comparison with the planned time periods for the withdrawal of  Russian troops from other regions. And it was vitally important  to create at least the minimal conditions for its basing.  However, there was practically nothing at the new locations. In  the first stage, in 1992, there was a catastrophic shortage of  buildings, wharf frontage, housing and financial support. The  Russian Government, recognizing the significance of defending  this region, has rendered substantial support to the flotilla.  Both the President and the Prime Minister have visited it. The  Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus Aleksiy II also consecrated this  ground.    The leadership of Astrakhan Oblast was prepared and met the  seamen as it could. Only that person who knows all of the  difficulties of rebasing can really assess the work done by  them. The seamen's families have been mainly housed in Astrakhan  itself: because it is practically impossible to build houses in  very short periods of time under current conditions, they found  a solution in leasing some of the dormitories from fishermen,  VUZs [higher educational institutions], and other organizations.  Plots of land were allocated for the flotilla. The issue on the  transfer of the fishing boat repair plant to the military seamen  is approaching resolution. Some ships came to Astrakhan to a not  altogether empty place; one of the flotilla's battalions was  already deployed there. Its base was the foundation for the  further development of the needed infrastructure. But there's  still a great deal of work in this direction.    In accordance with the plan, by 1995 the flotilla must  become  a full-fledged combined formation that is capable of  accomplishing all of the missions assigned to it. At the present  time, this plan is being made a reality. So, for example, last  year the flotilla had already obtained a number of ships and  this year several crews left for their delivery and acceptance  from industry. Other, including social, problems are also being  resolved. In the social aspect, the construction of a separate  garrison, normal housing, outpatient clinics, and a modern  hospital are planned...    At the present time, some of the flotilla's ships are based  at Zolotoy Zaton. It's supposed to be a location with a  developed infrastructure but it has its own difficulties.  Approach routes cause a great deal of concern. Unfortunately,  for the time being they are ordinary dirt roads which can be  utilized only in the dry period of the year because the first  rain makes them impassable. And this is practically the link to  the world: both fuel, food, spare parts and other consumable  materials are delivered using them. Wastes, garbage, and spent  POL [petroleum, oil, lubricants] are carried off on them. Not  everything is satisfactory with the supply of electric energy  and steam, especially in winter. Sometimes we have to drive the  boilers and diesel engines of surface combatants and boats  because of this, thereby reducing the period of their service.    One more problem that is new for the flotilla consists of  the  fact that the Volga freezes during the winter and therefore some  of the ships need to be transferred to more southerly areas so  that they can accomplish their missions and where we also need  to provide living conditions for them. In the process,  icebreakers are needed and the issue of obtaining them is very  urgent for the flotilla. Furthermore, some of the flotilla's  forces are located at Makhachkala. The situation there, as we  know, is much more complicated than in Astrakhan and its  repercussions are being felt in military posts and garrisons and  there is an outflow of the Russian-speaking population from  there. Officers and warrant officers are justifiably concerned  about the safety of their families and they don't wish to serve  in that situation. There are also not only cases of threats  directed at the seamen and at their family members but also  cases of direct hooligan attacks. And a tragedy occurred quite  recently even in Astrakhan: Senior Lieutenant Yu. Plodiyenko,  who saved his comrades at the cost of his own life, died at his  combat post.    Under these conditions, it is difficult for the flotilla  command authorities to resolve the very complex missions that  face them today because the flotilla is practically being reborn  all over again. And the fact that this has become possible is  due first of all to the contributions of the people who are  serving here: the warrant officers, officers and admirals. Right  now the hardiest have remained at it and those who were "weaker"  have left it in hard times: they have either left for the other  navies, they have remained at their old places or they have bid  farewell to the navy. Because Captain 1st Rank S. Pashkin and  Captain 2nd Rank V. Filozop, who proved himself to be a hero in  the emergency situation and who has been submitted by the  command authorities for the order "For Personal Bravery",  Captain 3rd Rank A. Gushchin, Senior Lieutenant A. Doronin,  Senior Warrant Officers V. Ovchininkov and V. Dovgopolov enjoy  such high prestige in the flotilla. Seamen from other fleets are  also expressing the desire to serve in the flotilla.    The flotilla command authorities are resolving the problem  of  cadres, that is so complicated for the entire Navy, by quite  aggressively enlisting women for military service, the fraction  of which is reaching 6-7 percent in some units. But then again,  assessments of their service are very positive and the  experience of foreign navies attests that the female social  stratum in the army can total 10-12 percent without damage for  combat readiness.    The gray-haired Caspian is uneasy. Strong northerly winds  frequently sweep over it, bringing fierce storms with them.  Covered by steep waves, the sea becomes threatening and  dangerous. Unfortunately, today "storms" of another kind are  blowing over the Caspian today: storms sowing disunity,  destruction and, at times, even death. And since there are now  several owners on the Caspian, they will have to work together  to resolve problems and issues that arise among them. And it is  better to do that using a friendly, peaceful method on a treaty  basis.    History has completed its latest loop. The Lower Volga is  once again becoming one of the regions where Russia will have to  urgently solve a mass of problems. Once again, Russians will  hear the words that they have become familiar with since  childhood -- Volga, Astrakhan, and Caspian. Once again Russians  must set up border posts there, guarding the peace, calm and  great wealth of Rus. Let's hope that this time our outposts will  be durably placed.    Russia is great and there is nothing more to hand over!    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.</p>

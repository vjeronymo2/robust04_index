			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CORD 810 DESIGNER BUEHRIG DIES  </P> <P> Gordon Buehrig, who revolutionized automotive design with such masterworks as  the Duesenberg Model J, the Cord 810 and the Auburn Boattail Speedster, died  Monday. He was 85.  </P> <P> The son of a banker in Mason City, Ill., Buehrig dropped out of Bradley  University in Peoria to work as a body shop apprentice in Wayne, Mich.  </P> <P> Buehrig, the dean of classic automotive design, crafted cars that tickled the  imagination and were unconstrained by the limits of mass marketing.  </P> <P> The Cord 810 was the talk of the 1935 New York Auto Show. Not only was it one  of the earliest front-wheel drive cars, it also featured flip-up headlights and  allowed drivers to step, rather than climb up, into a car for the first time.  </P> <P> In 1951, the Museum of Modern Art selected the Cord as one of the outstanding  automotive designs of all time.  </P></p>

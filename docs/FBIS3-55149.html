The Russian prime minister pointed out in reply to a  question asked by ITAR-TASS that "today, Russia and Belarus have  not only come up close to the merger of their monetary systems,  but to the deepening of economic integration in the CIS  framework."    Chernomyrdin pointed out that the creation of the single  rouble space between the two countries has a mutually  advantageous character, adding that "none of us is seeking to  gain any advantage at each other's expense". The prime minister  declared that "by signing today's statement, Russia does not  encroach on Belarusian sovereignty. The document is aimed at  deepening the coordination of our activities in the economic  sphere and this is the principle followed by the whole Europe in  its development."    As a result of Russo-Belarusian talks held in the building  of the Russian Government on Wednesday, Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Vyacheslav Kebich signed an agreement on trade and economic  cooperation in 1994. Vice-premiers of the two countries,  Aleksandr Shokhin and Vladimir Zalomay, signed an agreement on  supplies of Russian natural gas to Belarus and the construction  of a system of gas pipelines on the Belarusian territory.</p>

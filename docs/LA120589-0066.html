			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Alabama Coach Bill Curry said he will send a letter to Southeastern Conference  officials criticizing what he said was a missed penalty on Auburn's first  touchdown in Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Auburn spoiled Alabama's previously unbeaten record with a 30-20 victory.  </P> <P> Curry said a review of the game film revealed that Auburn had 12 men on the  field as the Tigers scored to take a 7-0 lead with 12:10 to play in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> "We knew at the time it was an illegal formation but at the time the play was  over and nothing could be done," Curry said.  </P> <P> However, Curry added that officiating was not the difference in the game. "The  difference was that they beat us," he said.  </P></p>

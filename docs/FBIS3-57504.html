			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Liberal Democratic Party </F> leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, by correspondent Anna Prokhorova;  including recorded excerpts from news conference; From the  "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Today the procurator general's office instituted  criminal proceedings against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.  Zhirinovkisy, State Duma deputy and leader of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia], who was to go to Yugoslavia, held a  news conference in Moscow today.    [Correspondent Anna Prokhorova] Journalists were interested  most of all in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's attitude to the fact that  the procurator general has instituted criminal proceedings  according to clause 71 of the Russian criminal code, that is,  war propaganda.    [Zhirinovskiy] I have been telling you for an hour -- no  violence, not a single shot, and the same is true for all my  speeches. I have already said that if there are people with  sick minds who claim that my speeches or books contain some kind  of call for war, they should be examined by a psychiatrist.    [Prokhorova] Asked whether the LDPR was set up with money  received from the Communist Party or the KGB, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy said that greedy communists did not give him money  and....    [Zhirinovskiy] If the State Security Committee had helped  me,  I would not be sitting here now but in the Kremlin. This was  their downfall precisely -- they did not admit people like  myself while they themselves withered away, went into decay, and  the country and the economy collapsed together with them.    [Prokhorova] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that his party  favors  stopping aid to any regions outside Russia, immediately stopping  conversion, and hitting at crime. The LDP is prepared to take  part in forming the government but....    [Zhirinovskiy] I would like very much if Kozyrev, Chubays,  Shokhin, and Fedorov would leave the government. They are in  the process of leaving it. I think, they all will have left by  May. But those who will replace them will not be able to  extricate Russia from the crisis, either. We ourselves will  form the government in autumn and normal positive development in  the country will start.    [Prokhorova] On 28 January Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will fly to  Belgrade. He is visiting Serbia in order to try and help his  blood brothers.</p>

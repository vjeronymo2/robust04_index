			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Necessary but not sufficient - Conference Notebook SO HE WON. Just. At one minute to midnight enough unions and constituency delegates stepped back from the abyss to give Mr John Smith a knife-edge majority for his proposals to loosen Labour's institutional links with the trades unions. The vote could not have been closer. Victory came only after a day of pleading, armtwisting and desperation not seen at a Labour conference for a decade. For Mr Smith the result was no less important for that. Most people are confused by the implications of a one-member-one-vote system for the selection of Labour's parliamentary candidates. Mr Smith, in his last-ditch plea to the conference, said it would actually strengthen the union link. In words which will have been carefully noted at Conservative Central Office he declared unequivocally: 'Let me make it clear that as leader of the Labour party I am totally committed not only to maintaining but to strengthening the vital links between our party and the unions.' Mr Bill Morris and Mr John Edmonds of the TGWU and GMB respectively said that it was the beginning of the end. It was the thin edge of a wedge which eventually would prise apart the Labour party and the unions which gave birth to it. Mr Morris and Mr Edmonds were closer to the truth. The process of separation  -reflected also in less controversial decisions yesterday to reduce the unions' voting power at annual conference and in election of the leader - is probably unstoppable. It might, though, take yet another general election defeat for it to come to fruition. But the immediate significance of yesterday's vote lay not in the arcane technicalities of the new voting system. Instead it was a question of Mr Smith's personal authority. In the easy jargon of the headline writers the issue was 'Who runs the Labour party?' Mr Smith does. The symbolism was all-important. Last night he was looking forward to this morning's headlines to convey that message to a wider world. So the leader has received a significant boost. He was confronted by his party's most powerful paymasters. He did not blink. Messrs Edmonds and Morris must now find another way to secure a prominent place on the nightly news bulletins. But one-member-one-vote is not enough for Mr Smith. He set victory in Brighton as the condition for defeat of the Conservatives at the next general election. It was necessary but it was not sufficient. There has been much else this week to depress those in the shadow cabinet who have argued now through election defeats that it is not enough for Labour simply to underpin the support of its natural supporters. In the hall and on the fringe most of the speakers have been looking inward  -addressing the 30 per cent of the electorate who will probably vote Labour come what may. The other 10 or 15 per cent - the aspirant classes of southern England who will decide the election, have been largely forgotten. What, asked one of Mr Smith's senior colleagues, will the housewife in Basingstoke have made of all this? There are obvious explanations. Mr Smith's determination to win on one-member-one-vote meant this was hardly the time to extol Labour as the party of the public service consumer rather than of its trades union producers. He needed the votes of Nupe and Cohse. The disarray in Mr John Major's government has strengthened the voice of the one-more-heave tendency in the party. Even sensible people who have seen such dreams disappear in the ashes of the 1987 and 1992 defeats believe that this time the Conservatives might really have a death wish. But the delegates who cheered each time a speaker rose to the conference rostrum to extol the virtues of Clause 4 public ownership, of union rights, and of spending, taxing and borrowing had signed up, it seemed, to a new 'No more heave tendency'. Others argued that a simple return to the prescriptions (always referred to as the principles) of the past would be enough. Mr Tony Benn has been deposed from the party's national executive committee but his spirit lives on. No one had the temerity to tell this conference that Labour needs the votes of millions of people who would never dream of joining a union. The Labour leader is impatient with analyses like this. He believes that some of the party's so-called modernisers have lost sight of the need to take their supporters with them. Foundations must be put in place, bricks laid in careful rows. He believes in the electoral force of the moral high ground, of leadership that people can trust. He senses that the undoubted anger of the electorate at unemployment, with insecure employment, with rising crime and with hard-pressed public services can successfully be exploited. He used his main speech to the conference to stake out that ground. It was effective. He has the manner of a prime minister in waiting. With one-member-one-vote out of the way he will begin to define his agenda. Mr Gordon Brown resents suggestions that his decision this week to stress the commitments to full employment and fair taxes mark an abandonment of his post-election strategy of restoring Labour to fiscal responsibility. The first two strands in the shadow chancellor's approach - that Labour wants low inflation as well as higher growth and will never tax for the sake of it  -have not been snapped. He has no intention of being drawn into debates over whether Labour might raise this tax or that to pay for bill for better public services. But Mr Brown's careful path has diverged this week from that of Mr Tony Blair, the most committed and determined of Labour's modernisers. The two hitherto have been joined like Siamese twins. But watching Mr Blair tour the Brighton fringe has been to see a politician frustrated by the complacency of those around him. The shadow home secretary has decided, come what may, to stand firm on the ground of modernisation. The question is whether Mr Smith and Mr Brown will decide to join him.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> VALUE OF CROSSING EASEMENT DISPUTED  </P> <P> A disagreement between the city of Fullerton and the Orange County Flood  Control District over the value of a creek crossing might prompt the city to  take the county to court.  </P> <P> The City Council tonight will consider whether to ask a court to decide the  value of a crossing over the Brea Creek Channel, linking two sections of  Burning Tree Road near Malvern Avenue.  </P> <P> The Flood Control District has said it will allow the bridge to be built, but  another county department, the General Services Administration, says the  developer will have to pay $100,000 for that easement, said Terry Swindle,  Fullerton's real property agent. A city appraisal values the creek crossing at  $1,000.  </P> <P> "The basic dispute is the dollar amount," said Thomas Galvan, manager of the  county GSA's real estate division.  </P> <P> Fullerton is requiring a developer to build the bridge to allow a second access  to an industrial subdivision now under construction. But the linked road would  also ease traffic through the area and allow better access for police and fire  units, Swindle said.  </P> <P> The developer, Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., agreed to build the bridge as a  condition of the city's 1987 approval of the industrial subdivision.  </P> <P> The county's appraisal of the creek crossing took into consideration how much  the developer would benefit by having another street leading into the  subdivision, Galvan said. Since the creek is owned by the county, its taxpayers  should get fair value for allowing the crossing, he said.  </P> <P> Money gained from allowing the bridge crossing would be used by the flood  control district for other projects, Galvan said.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

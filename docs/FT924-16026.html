			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Unrelieved pressure on dollar THE DOLLAR lost more than a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, as investors became nervous about the release of tomorrow's non-farm payroll figure in the US, writes James Blitz. The market seems convinced that the August figure, which is regarded by many as the most important indicator of the state of the US economy, will be weak. Mr Jim O' Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, believes that it will register a monthly drop of 110,000. But it is a very difficult figure to predict, because of the impact of the US summer jobs programme on the data. A particularly poor figure could be followed by a cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, widening the differential between US and German rates, and forcing the dollar down further. In anticipation of this, the dollar closed in Europe at DM1.4135, after hitting a low of DM1.4040. Several London-based dealers said that the dollar was being sold by major institutional players, as well as the banks. The dollar will probably be supported tomorrow if the Bundesbank delivers another cut in short-term interest rates at its council meeting. The arguments against a cut seem strong, but they are being ignored by many in the market. 'Nearly half the dealers believe that there will be a cut in rates,' said one analyst yesterday, 'and if there isn't, there will be intense disappointment.' In this atmosphere, the weaker European currencies suffered. There was another run on the Italian lira in Europe, with the currency losing 5.8 per cent of its value against the D-Mark as it touched L900. It later closed at L876. Fears of the imposition of a deposits tax by the Bank of Italy triggered the currency's decline. According to several analysts, the sellers were Italian depositors not international banks. The lira's fall undermined sterling, as investors recalled that the last heavy fall on the lira was the curtain-raiser to 'Black Wednesday.' Sterling touched a historic low of DM2.50 in Europe, but later rebounded to close at DM2.5175. The currency's fate is in the hands of the German and American central banks tomorrow. If their interest rate differential widens, Mr O'Neill expects the pound to visit DM1.45. The UK's foreign reserves figure, due out tomorrow, could also be market-sensitive, with forecasts of the drop in reserves ranging between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 18bn because of uncertainty over the extent of the Bank of England's recent intervention. The French franc closed at FFr3.384 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.3810. Speculators have lost money as the franc escapes the peril of devaluation, and another assault on the currency is unlikely.</p>

Raja Mohan: "Clinton Set-up Bent on Attacking </F> India?"]    [Text] Washington, Jan. 23--The Clinton Administration  appears determined to go out of the way to hit out at India on  human rights issues. It is no longer possible to attribute the  statements emanating from the White House on the situation in  India to mere callousness and insensitivity. Only unremitting  hostility, spurred by interested quarters, among the White House  aides can explain the fact that the President, Mr. Bill Clinton,  had signed two letters on the same day, December 27, that make  provocative statements on two of the most sensitive issues  relating to India's security.    Yesterday, Mr. Gurmit Singh Aulak, the self-proclaimed  president of the Council of Khalistan based in Washington  released a letter written by Mr. Clinton to the Congressman, Mr.  Gary A. Condit. The letter said: "I am aware of the chronic  tensions between the Indian Government and the Sikh militants,  and share your desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh  rights."    Referring to the recent improvement in the ground situation  in Punjab, the President talked of continuing police abuses in  the State. He declared, "It is clear that abuses still occur,  however, and we regularly raise our concerns about them with  senior officials in the Punjab Government and the Indian  Government." Stating that "human rights is an important issue in  U.S.-India relations," the President assured Mr. Condit that  Washington would "continue to make our concerns known to the New  Delhi authorities."    Reevaluation of ties needed: Two weeks ago, Mr.  Clinton's letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, an activist for the  Kashmiri militants here, declaring his desire to "bring peace to  Kashmir," had been publicised. It was possible to make light of  that letter, seeing it as something that just slipped through  the normally tight system in the White House that regulates  presidential utterances on foreign policy issues. The fact that  Mr. Clinton has now signed a nastier letter on Punjab to a  Congressman must necessarily force reevaluation in New Delhi of  the State of political relations between India and the United  States.    It is no longer possible for New Delhi to downplay the  significance of the Clinton letters. Until now, it could be  argued that the Khalistan cause is being taken up only by a few  Sikh militants, their lobbyists and Congressmen who are funded  by them. The reference to Punjab now comes from the President  himself, the highest authority of the executive branch of the  U.S. Government.    It is necessary to recall that under the previous  administration, despite a far graver situation in Punjab, the  Sikh militants here could not get the President, Mr. George  Bush, to endorse their cause. Now Mr. Clinton has done it when  normality has returned to Punjab. That there is not a single  reference to terrorism in either of Mr. Clinton's letters  suggests that this administration does not even care to pretend  there is some balance when it refers to the internal situation  in India.    New Delhi has until now shown great restraint in reacting to  the provocations from Washington. Such restraint and the  attempts to sincerely engage American concerns on human rights  have obviously no value.</p>

The source justified the actions by one of the  brigades that on 26 February destroyed approximately 2.5  hectares of coca farms in San Pablo colony.    He said there is no reason for either suspending or  interfering with the development of reduction plans.    The forceful eradication of coca farms began on 28 February,  during carnival celebrations, and less than five hectares of  illegal coca farms have been destroyed since then.    Despite the small area of eradicated coca farms, its  connotations did have repercussions because of the violent  procedure and the clashes between coca growers and police who  protected the eradication brigades.    The Direco source said that in all the cases in which coca  farms were forcefully eradicated, the farms were affected by the  interdiction work because they had maceration pits, and this  makes them illegal.    Said the source: "In the three cases, we did as established  by Article 71 of Law No. 1008, that is, the farms were destroyed  without any compensation. The law authorizes transfer of the  land to state ownership, but this has not been done yet."    The new coca eradication brigades are made up of some 400  officials, most of them antinarcotics policemen who provide  security and coverage, while Direco officials contract personnel  for the destruction of farms.    In addition to compulsory eradication, voluntary eradication  after payment of $2,000 per hectare is still in force.    The source added: "Many peasants have registered on the  Direco lists for eradication of their coca farms, asking for the  corresponding compensation."    He said that during the 26 February incidents, no Direco  personnel were injured or mistreated, but there was a big shock.</p>

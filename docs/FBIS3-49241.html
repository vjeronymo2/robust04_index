The Muslim attacks started [word indistinct] 22:00 hours (local  time) Wednesday but stopped after about two hours when the Serb  side returned fire. They were resumed early in the morning  Thursday.    The Serb side lodged a complaint with the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] Command asking for the attacks to be halted  fault of which it would answer back with all means of arms at  its disposal.    Muslim artillery and infantry attacks were reported in north  Bosnia in the Maglaj region and an attempt of a Muslim sabotage  group to infiltrate into Serb territory was thwarted in the  Doboj front.    Serb military sources report that in the region of Srbobran  (formerly Donji Vakuf), central Bosnia, Muslims are attacking  Serb positions and concentrating their forces which could mean  that they are getting ready for more heavy fighting. In (?the  night) of Wednesday/Thursday the Muslims also mounted attacks  from the Gorazde enclave, eastern Bosnia, on Serb defence  positions around Foca and Cajnice.    Along the Sava river (north Bosnia) the Croat forces renewed  artillery attacks last night firing 30 grenades on Serb  positions. The attack stopped when the Serb fighters returned  fire.    In the Mostar valley, south-west Bosnia, fierce fighting  continues between Croats and Muslims, erstwhile allies against  the Serbs. Both sides use all means of weapons at their  disposal in the combats in Mostar and its surroundings,  including artillery and tanks, acording to Serb military sources.</p>

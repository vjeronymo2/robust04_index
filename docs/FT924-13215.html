			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: French groups split Sema stake FT LIS, the information technology arm of France Telecom, the French telecommunications authority, and Paribas are establishing a company to hold the French bank's 39 per cent shareholding in Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company quoted in London. The new holding company will be owned 50.1 per cent by Paribas and 49.9 per cent by France Telecom Group. Mr Charles Rozmaryn, head of France Telecom, and Mr Michel Huet, head of FT LIS, will join the Sema board. The arrangement is part of Paribas' industrial rationalisation programme which has already generated deep controversy through its disposal of Ciments Francais to the Italian company Italcementi. After purchasing a controlling stake in the cement company, Italcementi discovered substantial off-balance sheet losses at its new acquisition. Sema Group, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.73m (Dollars 13.29m) on turnover of Pounds 195.4m at the interim stage, has been seeking a partner to extend its coverage of the communications sector where at present sales are only about Pounds 7m annually. It hopes to treble its volume of communications business through its association with France Telecom. Talks some years ago with British Telecom with a similar objective were called off at an early stage.</p>

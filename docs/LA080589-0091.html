			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FIRST TEST TO DIRECTLY FIND AIDS VIRUS APPROVED  </P> <P> The first lab test that can directly detect the AIDS virus has been approved by  the federal government, the test manufacturer announced Friday.  </P> <P> The new test directly detects a minimum of one of the virus' antigens or  proteins, whereas other tests search for antibodies, which do not appear until  somewhat later.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration gave Abbott Laboratories the go-ahead to  market the test after several medical journals published studies showing that  it could help doctors diagnose the human immunodeficiency virus and forecast  how the disease will progress in a given patient.  </P> <P> "You can tell by tracking the levels of the antigen how seriously the disease  is going to progress," said Catherine Babington, spokeswoman for Abbott. Also,  "it allows us to track the effectiveness of various treatments for AIDS," she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earlier Detection of Infection  </P> <P> Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., the New  England Journal of Medicine, the British journal Lancet and the British Medical  Journal has shown that the HIV antigen sometimes can be detected before  antibodies form. Those detected with the antigen often have acquired immune  deficiency syndrome or other forms of immune deficiency, and detecting the  antigen helps in treating those infected with the virus.  </P> <P> Antigens are toxic particles and part of the virus. When the virus strikes, the  body's immune system produces antibodies.  </P> <P> "HIV antigens can appear temporarily as early as two weeks after infection,  whereas antibodies are first detectable within six to 10 weeks," said Dr.  Harold Kessler, director of the HIV treatment program at Chicago's Rush  Presbyterian Medical Center.  </P></p>

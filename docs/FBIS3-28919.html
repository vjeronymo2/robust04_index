			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 13 KYODO -- A Japanese business  leader cautioned the United States against hasty retaliatory  action against Japan following the breakdown of trade talks,  saying it would worsen bilateral relations.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), also said in Washington that it was  wrong to begin the talks that collapsed Friday [11 February]  while leaving the definition of "numerical targets" vague. The  U.S. had sought such targets as a way of gauging progress in  import penetration into the Japanese market.    Hiraiwa was speaking at a reception for Japanese and U.S.  business leaders held in preparation for a conference between  them slated for this summer in Tokyo.    Some 30 business leaders from the two countries attended the  reception, with the Japanese side led by Yotaro Kobayashi,  chairman of the Japan-U.S. Economic Council, and the U.S. side  by Joseph Gorman, chairman of the U.S.-Japan Economic Council.  Kobayashi is chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. and Gorman of the  Ohio-based high- technology firm TRW Inc.    The councils are to hold a joint meeting starting Monday to  discuss political and economic issues, including the chronic  trade imbalance between the two countries.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is scheduled to give  a speech at the meeting.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Golden Mile is tarnished BLACKPOOL'S Golden Mile, which is preparing for the holiday season, reacted with outrage yesterday to the European Court of Justice ruling that its beaches do not meet environmental regulations. Mr John Donovan, secretary of the 1,300-strong Blackpool Hotel and Guest House Association, which caters for many of the 15m visitors a year, said: 'The reason people don't go into the sea is because it is too cold, not because it is dirty.' The court said that nearby Southport also fell below European Community standards, but the European Commission withdrew its complaint against Formby Point. Yesterday's ruling carries no financial penalty, but the UK has been ordered to pay costs. The EC bathing waters directive, agreed in 1975, requires countries to meet specified standards within 10 years. The court rejected the government's argument that the timetable should apply from the date when a stretch of coastline was designated a place 'where people bathe in large numbers', not from the date of the directive. The UK, which designated only 27 beaches, now has 455 on the list, with Blackpool added in 1987. The government dismissed the ruling as largely 'technical'. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said: 'The commission has accepted we are doing everything possible to bring these bathing waters up to standard as soon as practicable.' The water industry was spending some Pounds 2bn to ensure that 'virtually all' waters met the directive by 1995, he added. According to government figures, recent investment has brought '79 per cent of (UK bathing) waters within compliance in 1992 compared with 56 per cent in 1987'. This still makes the UK the second dirtiest country in the EC league table, ahead only of Germany which has 76 per cent compliance. All other countries report more than 90 per cent compliance, but the Commission acknowledges 'problems with the comparability' of the data. North West Water, the water and sewerage company which supplies Blackpool, said yesterday that 'planning wrangles' had delayed modernisation. 'Everybody wants the beaches cleaned up but not everybody wants treatment works on the doorstep,' it said. In the next three years it will spend some Pounds 400m on the north-west coastline, including Pounds 150m at Blackpool.</p>

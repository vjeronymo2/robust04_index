			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Dutch agriculture faces a Herculean task - Over-stocking farm land with animals has created a problem of Augean proportions Professor Dr Ir van Dijk has three academic qualifications and three jobs. He is professor of agricultural co-operation at Wageningen University, director general of the Dutch National Co-operative Council and chairman of the International Agricultural Strategy Council for the Dutch government. But when I met him a few days ago he had his arm up the back of one of his pedigree Texel ewes which was having difficulty lambing. It must be said that he and his family have only a small flock at their old farmhouse in the Dutch village of Lienden and that the sheep are kept more for a hobby than as a business. But it was immediately clear that in spite of the long list of letters after his name this was a practical man who understood farming. I visited Prof van Dijk to learn about 'Ter Zake', of which he is one of the authors and which literally translated means 'To Work'. It is a rallying call to Dutch farmers to get on with sorting out their problems themselves rather than relying on the European Union or the Dutch government. It epitomises the purpose of a 'great debate' now under way across the rural areas of The Netherlands on future policies for farming. For although Dutch farmers have a long-standing reputation for being among the most innovative and efficient in Europe they are now, as Prof van Dijk explained to me, facing declining incomes, severe environmental restrictions and a deteriorating relationship with the Dutch public. The Great Debate, he hopes, will identify and define these problems so that obvious solutions may emerge and ancillary organisations and businesses can get 'to work' on implementing them. There can be no doubt that Dutch agriculture is in crisis. Unlike British farmers, who have seen incomes rise during the past two years, incomes in The Netherlands have continued their downward trend. Moreover the Dutch experience is what the authors of the reform of the EU's common agricultural policy intended. British farmers' good fortune is, to a large extent, the result of the devaluation of sterling in September 1992 and the subsequent statutory adjustments to green currencies to bring UK farm prices up, by some 20 per cent, to their real value compared with other EU currencies. During earlier years, in the 1970s and 1980s, Dutch farmers had overcome the shortcomings of their small-farm structure by intensifying their management methods, especially with livestock. Dutch traders discovered alternative animal feed ingredients, such as manioc from Thailand, which could be cheaply imported from third countries, by-passing EU tariff restrictions. Dutch food processors developed markets for farm produce all over the world. And in spite of its small land area, The Netherlands became one of the biggest exporters of agricultural goods in the world. But animal feed, once it has passed through the animal, turns into dung. There are now so many animals on Dutch farms eating so much imported feed that the business of disposing of their wastes on the limited land available has become unbalanced. Indeed critics have suggested that some areas in the east and south of the country are like a gigantic sewage farm. Inevitably this has led to environmental problems. Soils have become so overburdened with certain minerals that they have become a pollution hazard. In spring, when animal slurry, stored all winter, is spread, or as is now decreed, injected into the land, the smell across wide areas of the country is unpleasant, even to a farmer's nose. Attempts have been made to contain the problem by limiting the number of animals kept on each farm and by government regulations on the quantity of slurry applied to land. But the restrictions were applied after the animal population had reached unmanageable proportions and there has so far been no serious move to cut livestock numbers. The Great Debate has at least resulted in this possibility being discussed - although the current priority seems to be to find some way to feed pigs, for instance, so that they produce lower mineral levels in their dung. The fact that exports of intensively-produced livestock are so important to the Dutch balance of payments is clearly significant to the debate. It goes without saying that this intensity of livestock production has been significant in the deterioration of Dutch farmers' public relations. The Great Debate has been going on for several months now. Every region and every sector of Dutch agriculture and horticulture has been involved and some preliminary conclusions are, apparently being reached. Quite apart from the excess of livestock it has, for instance, been admitted that there are too many abattoirs in the country and some kind of rationalisation seems to be on the cards. The farm supply trade, dominated as it is by co-operatives, has recognised that it is overmanned. The three farmers' unions representing Catholics, Protestants and Liberals have begun to talk of forming one federation. A recent survey has indicated a growing acceptance among Dutch farmers that they need to farm in more environment-friendly ways. Prof van Dijk told me of new targets to reduce farm emissions of potentially polluting chemicals, minerals and gasses by between 70 and 80 per cent. Exactly what that means in terms of inputs and in turn production is not yet entirely clear, although establishing this is exercising the minds of Dutch agricultural economists. Some of the 100,000 farmers in The Netherlands have begun to realise that there may not be an adequate living for more than half that number by the end of the century. The growing self-awareness that appears to be coming about as the Great Debate progresses is being achieved through discussion and without confrontation. And it is beginning to lead to pragmatic decisions by individuals and groups. Some are addressing problems with a view to beating them. Others are planning to get out of business while they still have time. All in all the debate seems to be a catalyst for change. And although the British farming industry is nothing like as intensive and does not yet face the same degree of crisis, I feel sure that it would benefit from a similar self-examination.</p>

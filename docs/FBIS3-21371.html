			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khemais Chammari: "After the Crisis, Hope"] </F>   [Text] The fourth LTDH Congress, the keynote of which was  the autonomy and freedom of associations, was not the failure  that some people were expecting. Quite the contrary.    Let us overlook the dismaying and tragicomic episode at the  opening session, the only reason for which was the outgoing  president's deliberate refusal to accept the democratic rule  that called for submitting his opening speech--designed to be a  speech of defiance and pique--to the Managing Committee for its  review.    Let us also overlook, despite its seriousness, the violence  done to a journalist-photographer and the terrorism in the form  of insults and threats that a tiny minority of congress  delegates belonging to the extreme left tried in vain to impose  on the congress, which remained a congress of free expression  and energy.    Instead, let us remember the remarkable calmness of the  officers of the congress (Taieb Baccouche and the seven other  officers), the efficient organization thanks to the logistic  support provided by the Arab Institute of Human Rights, the  productive discussions in committee and in the plenary sessions,  the pluralistic debate, and, last, that democratic space that is  unique in our country and that we absolutely must preserve.    Yes, it is with heads held high that the old members are  leaving the league today. With their heads held high not to make  verbal attacks on personalities they themselves invited or to  slander the men and women who have taken over the leadership of  the league. But I am convinced that the latter will be able to  scathingly refute those who, in an insult to the future, are  announcing "the disappearance of this last democratic space"  because, in their eyes, democratic rules can only be a one-way  street.    Following the crisis, there is again hope that the league  will return to the idea that gave it its prestige and specific  character as a major and responsible opposition force that  protests without going to excess and is concerned to develop its  capacity for dialogue and negotiation and its ability to make  proposals.    At the head of the league today, we have passed the reins to  a new and younger team whose president is not likely to drift  into the narcissistic and despotic ways that we have been  subjected to for four years. The essential thing is to preserve  the league's independence and, in the internal debates by the  Managing Committee, to return to that tradition of mutual  respect, tolerance, dialogue, and social interaction, which  unfortunately wound up disappearing under the combined effect of  bitter political conflicts, the contagion of unbearable  paranoia, and a policy of "sloganization" that sterilized most  of the essential debate.    Besides the exemplary democratic way in which the final  balloting took place, one reason for hoping that we have now  left the crisis definitely behind us is the content of the  resolutions adopted with respect to internal regulations and the  law on associations. The fight for human rights and the rights  of citizens and peoples is an ethical and political fight for  freedoms, for equality, against discrimination, for physical  integrity and against torture, for the universality of standards  and procedures for protection of the human person, and for the  indivisible nature of those rights, which are not only civil and  political but also economic, social, and cultural.    The extreme left, which has fought and continues to fight  for  freedom of association and pluralist democracy, has not yet  fully realized that to finish this fight, it is necessary to  leave behind sectarian reflexes and archaic ideas concerning the  rights of peoples as opposed to human rights and to abandon a  populist-nationalist particularism that sets itself against  universality in a simplistic and suspicious manner.    Above all, both in the league and in the university, that  left is paying the price for an erroneous strategy aimed at the  systematic and partisan besieging of the democratic space for  associations.    Fighting for the rights of the human person means deeply  rooting our convictions in a constant reference to the standards  of the state of law and to international statements and legal  instruments for the promotion and protection of human rights.    Attentive to the appeals and the distress of the outcasts,  those without a voice, the oppressed, and the victims of  repression, we must voice their appeals to the public  authorities while also performing a function of indispensable  training and education for promoting a true human rights  mentality. Last, the fight for human rights presupposes an  availability to others, the qualities of a listener, and a  conception of democratic citizenship that cannot possibly be a  monopoly controlled by the leading lights of a certain kind of  thundering "human rights-ism" with perverse effects.    Because quite obviously, such a monopoly constitutes a poor  substitute for partisan political action or, what is even more  tragic, clinical therapies that it is serious and useless to  evade any longer.    Those are the errors that the league's new leadership will  have to go to work on. We wish it good luck so that the  independent and democratic Tunisian league will have a long life.</p>

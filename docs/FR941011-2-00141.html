The Trust will consist of a series of unit investment trusts, each of which will be similar but separate, and designated by a different series number (``Trust Series''). Each Trust Series will invest exclusively in equity securities (including common and preferred stocks) or in equity securities and zero coupon obligations. The objectives of the Trust series will vary in accordance with the nature of their respective portfolios. Each Trust Series will be registered under the Act, and under the Securities Act of 1933 by a registration statement on Form S&hyph;6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Each Trust Series will be created pursuant to a trust agreement that will contain information specific to that Trust Series and that will incorporate by reference the master trust indenture between the Sponsor and a financial institution that is a bank within the meaning of section 2(a)(5) of the Act and that satisfies the criteria in section 26(a) of the Act (the ``Trustee''). The trust agreement and the master trust indenture are referred to collectively as the ``Trust Agreement.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Sponsor will perform the normal functions of a unit investment trust sponsor. The Sponsor will deposit the zero coupon obligations, if any, and equity securities (collectively, ``Securities'') in the Trust Series at the price determined by an independent evaluator. The Sponsor expects to deposit in each Trust Series substantially more than $100,000 aggregate value of equity securities or zero coupon obligations and equity securities. All zero coupon obligations in any one Trust Series will have essentially identical maturities, and the Sponsor will purchase all Securities from third parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Growing pains at Microsoft THE NEWS that the US Justice Department is considering anti-trust action against Microsoft raises intriguing issues of public policy. On the one hand, Microsoft's dominance of the computer software industry is on a scale calculated to arouse the old US trust-busting instinct. On the other, the Clinton administration is pledged to create high-tech employment. Does it really want to take a sledge-hammer to the national champion in a vital technology of the future? The latter point deserves careful consideration. If US manufacturers have maintained their grip on the world market for personal computers, that is partly because Microsoft created an industry standard for the software which drives them. It may now seem easy to dismiss Japan's software industry as handicapped by the Japanese language and written characters. But these have formed no barrier in other fields of technology. It is thought-provoking to consider how the world computer industry might have evolved over the past decade if Microsoft had never existed. The trust-busting argument is no less persuasive. There seems no question that Microsoft is, to put it mildly, a highly aggressive company. The list of its alleged abuses of power is a long one, from striking exclusive deals with its customers to misleading the public about rival products. How far all that is true - and if true, illegal - has yet to be established. But it is worth remarking that complaints about the company's behaviour have been raised in other jurisdictions, including the UK. And in principle, it remains the case that suppression of competition harms the consumer and risks stunting the development of the industry. National interest But the administration might perhaps consider the national interest on wider grounds. Even supposing the US consumer and Microsoft's smaller US competitors are being hurt, perhaps that might be a price worth paying if the US computer industry as a whole is thereby strengthened against world competition. In this context, it is worth considering the recent history of IBM, itself the subject of close anti-trust scrutiny in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the event, IBM was left intact; but given its own recent efforts to loosen its monolithic structure, breaking it up earlier might have been no bad thing. As it is, IBM's relative decline in recent years has not opened the door to foreign competition. On the contrary, it has let in a younger generation of US companies, from Compaq and Intel to Microsoft itself. Dominant companies Nor does history suggest that the breaking up of dominant companies has in in fact harmed the economy in question. The break-up of Standard Oil produced a formidable array of US oil companies, from Exxon and Texaco to Mobil and Chevron. When the giant German chemical combine IG Farben was dissolved by the allies at the end of the second world war, the effect was to liberate the German industry under the separate banners of Hoechst, Bayer and BASF. When the US anti-trust authorities broke up AT&amp;T, it went on to be perhaps the most formidable telecommunications company in the world. It has been suggested before now that Microsoft should be broken up into two parts, one producing the basic operating software which represents the industry standard, the other producing the next stage of applications software in competition with the rest of the industry. At present, the Federal Trade Commission seems to have backed away from anything so radical; but if the case were to be taken up by the Justice Department, radical solutions could be back on the agenda. Failing that, it would help if Microsoft were to take a more mature view of its responsibilities. IBM has come to accept its role in the worldwide computer hardware industry, and is careful not to be seen stamping on emerging competitors. In just the same way, the big Japanese electronic companies have come to accept that the old killer approach to international competition makes diminishing sense in a world dominated by political sensitivities. As a young company with a phenomenal record, Microsoft might perhaps dismiss all that as wimpish. If so, it is the job of the Clinton administration to persuade it otherwise.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Schools criticise council review Schools and their governors have launched a campaign against the English local government review. They believe it will create weak, unnecessarily expensive education authorities, staffed by inexperienced officers. The government will be concerned as this suggests that not only heads but also parents and governors, given more power recently, oppose the review. A coalition of educational interest groups last year forced national curriculum changes. Mr Peter Downes, vice-president of the Secondary Heads Association, received loud applause from the association's annual conference when he told Mr John Patten, education secretary: 'We are very firmly of the opinion that the two-tier system works pretty well as far as education (the biggest part of local government services) is concerned, and we think that the prospect of spending Pounds 1.5bn in transitional costs to produce a new structure which would arguable be worse than what we have got at the moment is nothing short of a scandalous waste of public money.' The review, being carried out by the Local Government Commission, aims to produce plans for a local government structure for all of non-metropolitan England this year. Education, now a county council function, would be transferred to smaller single-tier authorities. The National Association of Governors and Managers predicted that schools would 'hardly take kindly to being run by inexperienced administrators' with small budgets.</p>

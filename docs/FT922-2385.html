			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / MGN chiefs set to go today: Directors decide chairman and head of finance should stand down THE chairman and the finance director of Mirror Group Newspapers, one of the two public companies at the centre of the Maxwell empire, are expected to resign today. Preparations for the departure of Mr Ernest Burrington, formerly MGN managing director, who succeeded Mr Ian Maxwell as chairman early in December, and of Mr Lawrence Guest, the company's finance director, were made in their absence at a meeting of directors which lasted for most of yesterday. MGN was floated on the stock exchange 13 months ago. Its shares have been suspended since December 2 when losses in the pension fund became apparent and it is now in effect controlled by a consortium of banks. After yesterday's decision on changes at the top of MGN, the directors decided to consult Mr John Talbot, of accountants Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell companies. The private interests control more than 50 per cent of MGN shares, which have been pledged against bank loans. Mr Talbot did not disagree with the proposed changes, which are expected to go ahead today. The two men may remain with the company in other positions. No impropriety is alleged on the part of either Mr Burrington, a former editor of the People newspaper, or of Mr Guest. An influential group of MGN directors, however, decided that resolute action had not been taken quickly enough when the first signs of irregularity began to emerge in the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Burrington has said he first became aware of impending trouble on August 29 last year, during a sports awards ceremony sponsored by the People at the Savoy Hotel when he shared a table with Mr Guest. During the lunch the Mirror finance director had expressed concern that Pounds 40m appeared to have gone missing. The matter was taken further, and all but Pounds 11m, said to be with the US stockbroker Goldman Sachs, was returned to the Mirror. On September 26, Mr Guest reported another money movement. After other members of staff were questioned it was said that that money was on deposit and would be returned. During that month the two men were involved in rows with Mr Robert Maxwell, who had accused them of troublemaking. Mr Burrington has said he raised the question of his possible resignation with Mr Robert Maxwell on October 2, but the matter was not settled before Mr Maxwell's death on November 5. The popular newspaper group - which publishes the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, People and the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail - is trading profitably but needs the support of the banks for working capital. A Pounds 250m two-year financing facility is now being negotiated. Full accounts of the group are expected to be published on June 22 - setting out its financial state and the sums missing from its accounts and pension fund.

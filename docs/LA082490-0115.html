			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PIRATES POWER PAST THE REDS AGAIN, 9-3  </P> <P> Barry Bonds says if pitchers don't want pitch to Bobby Bonilla, then, "They're  going to have to pitch to me." If the truth be known, most pitchers would  rather not pitch to either one and Thursday night was an example why.  </P> <P> Bonilla hit a grand slam to cap Pittsburgh's six-run fifth inning and Bonds  added a two-run homer as the Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds for the fifth  consecutive time, 9-3, at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Zane Smith (9-7) gave up two runs in 6 1/3 innings to win his third in a row  since being traded to Pittsburgh on Aug 8. The Pirates have won 10 of their  last 12, including their first four-game sweep ever in Cincinnati's Riverfront  Stadium last weekend.  </P> <P> "(The Mets) thought we'd get uptight," Bonilla said. "Hey, we're having fun. If  you don't have fun now, you're going to start having ulcers and getting gray  hairs."  </P> <P> Don Slaught doubled, tripled and drove in a run as the Pirates improved to  44-20 against the National League West.  </P> <P> Bonilla (29 homers, 89 runs batted in) and Bonds (25 homers, 92 RBIs) have  given the Pirates baseball's most powerful 1-2 combination east of Oakland.  </P> <P> Bonilla has four home runs and nine RBIs in his last five games against  Cincinnati. His 29 homers are by the most by Pittsburgh player since Jason  Thompson hit 31 in 1982.  </P> <P> San Francisco 6, Philadelphia 3 -- Ernest Riles tied a club record with his  fourth pinch home run of the season and reliever Francisco Oliveras pitched  three scoreless innings for his first NL victory as the Giants defeated the  Phillies at San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Giants, who have won three of four games, moved to within 6 1/2 games of  first-place Cincinnati in the NL West and broke a six-game losing streak  against the Phillies.  </P> <P> Riles' three-run homer off reliever Dennis Cook (8-3) came in a four-run,  fourth-inning rally and gave the Giants a 4-3 lead. He tied the franchise  record set in 1978 by Mike Ivie and tied by Candy Maldonado in 1986.  </P> <P> Houston 8, Atlanta 3 -- Glenn Wilson had four of Houston's season-high 18 hits,  scored three runs and drove in two to lead the Astros at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Mark Portugal (7-9) scattered seven hits over six innings and won his third  consecutive decision.  </P> <P> The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the second on consecutive singles by Wilson, Mark  Davidson and Rafael Ramirez off Charlie Leibrandt (5-8). Franklin Stubbs' RBI  single and Carl Nichols' sacrifice fly made it 3-0 in the fourth.  </P></p>

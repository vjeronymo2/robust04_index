			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic from Brcko] </F>   [Text] The intensity of the Serbian aggressor's combat  activities escalated on the Brcko battlefield last night.  Sporadically but persistently throughout the night, the enemy  used 60-mm mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, antiaircraft  guns, and rifles to attack the defense positions of Brcko. The  defense positions in Djukici, in the central part of the  battlefield, and in Vranovaca were targeted the most frequently.    An enemy saboteur group was chased away in the region of  Boderiste at approximately 2000 last night, and at 2200 the  defenders repeated their success in thwarting an attempt by  chetnik saboteurs to penetrate into the Vranovaca area.    The aggressor continues to encounter major difficulties  mobilizing soldiers. Intelligence information suggests that,  over the past month and a half, the Serbian aggressor has  carried out a whole series of raids in Bijeljina and in nearby  villages. The chetnik military police are rounding up potential  military conscripts in apartments, on the streets, bus stops,  and even in hospitals, regardless of their (?rank), profession,  or health condition, to transport them to special training camps.    However, not even this latest aspect of mobilization has  provided much of a chance for success for the aggressor. As  soon as they arrive on the front, these forcefully mobilized  soldiers of the so-called Srpska republic army desert the front  lines in the Bosnian Sava Basin and Mt. Majevica at the first  given opportunity.</p>

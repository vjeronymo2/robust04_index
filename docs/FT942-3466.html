			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia in demand The Swedish government said yesterday its public offer of a 23 per cent voting stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals groups, had been heavily oversubscribed. It suggests the government will increase the size of the public offer to 47.5m shares from 40m shares, equal to 27.5 per cent of the votes. However, it will wait until Friday, after the offer to Swedish and international institutions has closed, before setting share allocation and price. The government's aim is to sell as many as 82.2m shares in the group, raising some SKr10bn in Sweden's largest ever privatisation. This would cut the state's voting stake to 10.1 per cent from 57.5 per cent.</p>

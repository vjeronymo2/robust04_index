			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Hammersmith in court over interest rate swaps CHEMICAL Bank went to the High Court in London yesterday to claim Pounds 2.94m from the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in an action arising from the interest rate swaps debacle. The action is one of six lead cases selected from the multiplicity of litigation between banks and local authorities that followed the House of Lords ruling in January last year that all swaps deals were invalid because they had been outside councils' legal powers. The ruling left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m on swap transactions with 130 councils. Their only recourse was to try to recover about a quarter of their losses by suing councils for funds they earned by writing swap contracts. The lead cases were selected because they covered most of the points of law arising from the Lords' ruling. The intention was that they would enable the court to give guidance for the remaining cases and reduce litigation. That intention was frustrated when four of the lead cases were settled out of court. The opening of Chemical Bank's claim was delayed for an hour by last-minute discussions at the door of the court yesterday. Although they did not bear immediate fruit, negotiations are continuing and it seems unlikely that the case will run its estimated six weeks before terms are agreed. Mr Richard Southwell QC, for Chemical Bank, told Mr Justice Hirst that the bank, which had made two swaps contracts with Hammersmith in March 1988, had assumed that local authorities entering into such transactions were hedging their interest rate risks as end users. It had been a considerable surprise to the bank to learn during the litigation that led to the Lords' ruling that in its contracts with Chemical, Hammersmith had been trading for profit in the swaps market and acting as an intermediary between the bank and two rate-capped London councils, Haringey and Camden. If Chemical had known the true position, it would not have entered into the contracts. Its policy in relation to swaps had been not to deal with rate-capped councils. Hammersmith now contended that intermediation could be justified as amounting to the management of interest risks on its debts. The council's defence was that Chemical had voluntarily assumed the risk that the deals might prove to be beyond Hammersmith's powers and its payments to the council had therefore been voluntary and irrecoverable. Mr Southwell said it was a somewhat remarkable proposition that a bank would voluntarily hand over large sums on such a basis. He said Hammersmith had been party to 592 swaps deals involving a notional Pounds 6bn. The potential loss to its ratepayers - had the Lords not ruled such transactions void - would have been Pounds 194.2m. The fact that Hammersmith had been saved from making good that loss could be taken into account when considering whether it was reasonable for it to make restitution to Chemical Bank, Mr Southwell said. The hearing continues today.</p>

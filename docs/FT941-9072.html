			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: S Korea abandons rules on seeking funds from abroad South Korea's finance ministry said it would allow domestic companies to issue overseas equity-linked securities with no prior approval from securities authorities, Reuter reports from Seoul. At present, companies hoping to raise funds abroad through convertible bonds, bonds with warrants or depository receipts are required to get approval from the Securities Supervisory Board and the Securities Exchange Commission. The commission is expected to scrap the obligation on February 28, although a finance ministry official said firms would still be required to notify the ministry of their plans. The ministry expected a total of Dollars 2.5bn of overseas bonds to be issued by South Korean concerns overseas this year. Issue of equity-linked securities would total between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.3bn from Dollars 920m in 1993. South Korean non-manufacturing firms will now be able to raise funds abroad to expand into overseas markets or for royalty payments. Such issues were limited to manufacturers planning overseas investment or the import of manufacturing equipment or research facilities.</p>

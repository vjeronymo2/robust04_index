The final resolution rests with the Cabinet after it has  received an official invitation from the alliance.    The Baltic presidents in their Jan. 11 statement already  voiced their wish to participate in the cooperation plan, which  NATO offers to the East European countries and the Baltic states  as an avenue to eventual NATO membership.    Latvia has not decided yet how it will participate in the  program. The establishment of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion  is the first task now, said Pavlovskis.</p>

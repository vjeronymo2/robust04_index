			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 21 June.    The Banco de Maracaibo intervention board believes it is  still possible to rescue this failing financial institution. The  intervention board has completed a Banco de Maracaibo rescue  plan that will be presented before the Banking  Superintendency--the agency responsible for making a final  decision on the issue. If the intervention board's plan is  accepted, Banco de Maracaibo could begin operating again some  time before 29 June--the date when Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and  Banking Protection Fund] is scheduled to reinstate additional  losses of 7.2 billion bolivares. According to the intervention  board, Banco de Maracaibo is in a position to reimburse Fogade  all of the 120 billion bolivares it has received in financial  assistance so far. (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200  GMT 20 Jun 94)    The banking liquidity coefficient has fallen to 30.6  percent.  The coefficient, which measures cash availability in terms of  total funds deposited in banks, was 30.6 percent in May. This  means that for every 100 bolivares deposited by the public, the  banking system is in a position to immediately provide slightly  more than 30 bolivares. (Caracas Union Radio in Spanish 1245 GMT  20 Jun 94)    According to Charles Roccia, vice president of Banco  Provincial de Venezuela, a financing agreement was signed on 15  June with a syndicate of Portuguese banks headed by Banco de  Fomento de Portugal. The terms of the agreement include a $20  million line of credit to be used to finance clients of  Venezuelan banks who wish to import products from Portugal. Mr.  Roccia pointed out that the agreement is very significant,  particularly at this time, because it shows Portugal's  confidence in the Venezuelan banking system. (Caracas EL GLOBO  in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 12)    In Caracas, state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA) has  announced that Venezuela will begin selling orimulsion, boiler  fuel made from heavy oil comprising 70 percent bitumen and 30  percent water, in the Chinese market as result of a recent  agreement signed between the North Industries Shenzhen  Corporation and PDVSA's Bitumenes del Orinoco subsidiary. The  agreement includes the supply of orimulsion for an electrical  plant scheduled to begin operations in 1995. The Venezuelan  company will be responsible to market, sale, and supply the  orimulsion, as well as providing technical assistance to the  client. (Paris AFP in Spanish 2018 GMT 20 Jun 94)    Recently released figures from the Central Statistics and  Data Processing Office show that imports totaled $2.649 billion  in the first quarter of the year, reflecting a 31.9 percent drop  from the same period in 1993. The report also shows that 46.1  percent of all imports originated in the United States; 7.1  percent from Germany; 7.0 percent from Japan; 4.6 percent from  Colombia; 4.2 percent from Italy; 3.2 percent from Brazil; and  3.0 percent from France.

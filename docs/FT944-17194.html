			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Vital statistics on visas - Do you need one for the US? Michael Skapinker explains Do you need a visa to visit the US? It depends. The Visa Waiver Program allowed many travellers to go to the US without a visa. The programme expired at the beginning of this month, but it continues to apply until the end of October. There is every chance that it will continue after that, but it is best to check at the end of the month. Another problem is that, if you do need a visa, from tomorrow you have to pay to apply. You do not pay at the US embassy, however. You pay at Barclays Bank. Confused? You are not alone. Let's go through this slowly. 1. Do I need a visa to travel to the US? Yes, unless you are a citizen of Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland or the UK. If you are not a citizen of one of these countries, go to question 6. If you are a citizen of one of the above, move on to question 2. 2. So that means I don't need a visa? Possibly not. But read the whole of this answer first. You might need a visa if you also plan to visit Mexico, Canada or the Caribbean. If you do, go to question 4. You will also need a visa if you plan to visit the US for more than 90 days. In which case go to question 6. You will need a visa if you are a government official, journalist on assignment, part of an airline crew, or studying in the US. If so, go to question 6. If none of these applies, check you do not fall foul of the provisions in question 3. 3. So I am of the right nationality and I am not a government official or journalist. What is the problem now? You still need to submit a visa application if you have ever been afflicted with a serious communicable disease or a dangerous physical or mental disorder, or if you have ever been a drug abuser, addict, drug trafficker, prostitute or procurer. Similarly, you need to apply for a visa if you have ever been arrested for or convicted of any offence, or if you plan to enter the US to break the law. You also need a visa if you had Nazi connections during the second world war. If you fall into any of these categories, go to question 6. If not, go to question 5. 4. I plan to visit a neighbouring country as well as the US. Do I need a US visa? Not if you have a ticket home. Go to question 5. If you have an onward ticket to a neighbouring country but no ticket home, you will need a visa unless you are a res-ident of that country. Go to question 6. 5. Good. So I really don't need a visa? No you don't. But you still need to arrive in the US with evidence of the purpose of your visit, of funds to support yourself and your plans to go home. 6. So I need a visa. What next? From tomorrow, you will need to pay a fee after getting your visa application form but before submitting it. In the UK, the fee is Pounds 13.75. It is non-returnable, whether you get the visa or not. The fee cannot be paid to the US embassy. In the UK, it should be paid in cash at a branch of Barclays - other banks may accept payment but might charge a fee. In other countries, ask the US embassy if the fee has come into effect and where you have to pay it.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Osprey buy-out claim countered MR STUART Duncan, chair-man of the management team which has negotiated the Pounds 2.2m buy-out of the marketing services division of Osprey Communications, yesterday countered a City claim on Friday that his group was expected to make a loss in the current year. Indeed Mr Duncan said: 'The historical profits of the marketing services division have always been in the order of Pounds 500,000, and profit forecasts for the current year - as Osprey can confirm - will also be in line with this.' The buy-out company - Communications in Business Group - has the support of Montague Private Equity, part of the HSBC Group, and the Bank of Scotland. CBG consists of three companies - Bryan, Constantinidi &amp; Brightwell, TOP Counsel and Communications in Business - which have operated side-by-side mainly in the leisure and travel areas. Clients here include Brittany Ferries, Texas Tourism, Bermuda Tourism and Stansted Airport, while non-travel clients include Costain and the City of Westminster. The buy-out is one of a series of moves involving Osprey. Conditional on the completion of the disposal is the acquisition of SMS Communications Group, headed by Mr Jack Rubins. Osprey is also to launch a 1-for-3 rights issue to raise Pounds 1.3m net. Its shares rose from 32 1/2 p to 34p on the day.</p>

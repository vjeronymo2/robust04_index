			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE POOR world economic outlook led to a dull and featureless trading session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealing in the March contract opened at 2,560 but light selling soon sent it lower to touch 2,550. A modest rally was attempted around 9am when March rose to 2,562 but the gloomy outlook soon sent the contract into retreat once again. The disappointing US jobless figures, together with the poor Wall Street performance, only served to increase the selling of the contract. March eventually closed at 2,545, down 22 on the previous session and 9 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Volume reached just under 5,000 contracts. In traded options, turnover at 29,858 contracts was just shy of the 30,000 break-even level as dealers reported increased activity in the stock options. The FTSE 100 index option traded 6,602 contracts. Among the stock options, BTR was particularly busy, trading 2,724 lots with the February 420 calls the busiest series. This was followed by Forte, which traded 1,818 lots with 220 puts. Also busy was Hanson in which 1,694 contracts changed hands.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] When conducting investigations and study in Zhuzhou  City, Chen Bangzhu, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor, pointed out that it is necessary to  uphold reform, development, and stability. Leaders at all  levels must do solid work and carry out work in all fields of  endeavor in a down- to-earth manner.    From 9 to 10 April, accompanied by Cheng Xinhan, secretary  of  the Zhuzhou City party committee and Mayor Wang Xinming,  Governor Chen Bangzhu and his party successively inspected  enterprises which have had difficulties in operations, such as  the Zhuzhou Ramie Spinning and Weaving Mill, the Zhuzhou Tyre  Plant, and the Zhuzhou Welding Rod Plant, and some township and  town enterprises in Zhuzhou and Liling.    On 11 April, Governor Chen held separate discussions with  factory directors and managers of some large and medium-sized  enterprises in Zhuzhou and city party and government leaders on  such issues as how to establish modern enterprise systems and  help enterprises change operational mechanisms and become market  oriented. He said: At present, enterprises universally feel  that funding strains are plaguing them, and some enterprises are  operating under capacity. However, the solutions are more than  difficult. He pointed out: To overcome difficulties, on the  one hand, enterprises must devote efforts to tapping their  internal potential, manage funds flexibly, strengthen  management, reduce consumption, bring the enthusiasm of staff  members and workers into play, tide over difficulties with one  heart and one mind, and, on the other hand, party committees,  governments, and departments at all levels must foster the idea  of eliminating trouble and solving difficulties for enterprises  and help enterprises get out of their fix.    He remarked: This year, reform is being carried out in an  overall way. The introduction of taxation system reform, which  requires intense efforts to accomplish, is in the interests of  all sides. Moreover, Zhuzhou City is a national pilot city for  optimizing the capital structure and enhancing enterprise  strength. He urged leaders at all levels in the city to carry  out, in a down-to-earth manner, ideological work in an organized  manner and by employing necessary supporting measures and doing  solid work to uplift the city's work to a new level.</p>

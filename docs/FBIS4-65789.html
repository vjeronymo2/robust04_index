			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Riitta Vainio: "Defense Administration To Become </F> More Efficient, Major Personnel Dismissals To Be Avoided"]    [Text] Staff Headquarters and the Defense Ministry have  found mutual ground on the development of new ways to administer  the Armed Forces, and on the spending cuts that will result  thereby. Elisabeth Rehn, the minister of defense, and Jan  Klenberg, commander of the Armed Forces, made a joint  presentation on the reorganization of Armed Forces  administration during peacetime. The presentation included  unveiling the program that will be followed in applying  scientific principles of management to develop the Armed Forces.    The program deals with developments to be implemented for  the  21st century during the years 1996-97. The primary purpose in  these implementations is not to decrease the number of  employees, but deliberate reorganization of staff and operations.    Up until now less than 200 employees of the Armed Forces  have  been dismissed from their jobs, mainly in the armories. Other  dismissals were prevented by the government's job contract  negotiations.    The program that has now been adopted will mean a certain  amount of staff transfers, according to Rehn, but hardly any  dismissals. Personnel reductions will be achieved mainly by the  natural departure from the work force by individuals. "The  personnel will not come to suffer hard times," promised Rehn.    According to Admiral Klenberg, clarity on the issue has been  especially important for Armed Forces personnel. The agreed-upon  program is not what everybody wanted, "but even a difficult  decision is better than continued confusion on the issue," said  Klenberg.    After the government asked for designated funds, the defense  ministry drafted a streamlining program for the land forces in  1992. This program would have closed 15 military bases. Staff  headquarters agreed to the main points of the ministry spending  cuts proposal.    According to staff headquarters, the spending cuts are only  part of the reason for reorganization. While the number of  conscripts has been reduced from 40,000 to about 30,000, the  organization is still dimensioned according to the higher number  of conscripts.  <H5>  Concentrations and Transfers </H5>   The Armed Forces Training Development Center will be moved  to  Tuusula in 1996.    The operation of the Iisalmi, Kuopio, Vammala, and Ahtari  armories will be changed according to scientific management  principles in a way that has already been agreed upon.  <H5>  Land Forces Troop Units </H5>   The training of reserve officers needs to be kept,  principally, as one entity. Reserve officer training methods  will be developed in Hamina.    Part of the infantry training conducted in Oulu will be  transferred to Kajaani. Conscript training will be terminated in  Ylamylly, and be transferred to Kontioranta and Mikkeli.  Infantry units in Helsinki will be consolidated.  <H5>  Field Artillery </H5>   The main training center for the field artillery will be  reorganized at the Niinisalo Field Artillery Brigade.    The field artillery units will remain in the Light Infantry  Brigade, Kainuu Brigade, Karjala Brigade, Armored Brigade and  the Uusimaa Brigade.  <H5>  Antiaircraft </H5>   The Kymi Antiaircraft Regiment will cease to operate as an  independent unit.

A unit for training  infantry, combat engineer, and signal corps training will be  formed in Oulu. Part of Oulu's training mission will be  transferred to Kajaani.    Northern Finland's Signal Corps Battalion will be reassigned  to the Pohja Brigade by 1997.  <H5>  Eastern Defense Zone </H5>   The training and maintenance and supply organization of the  Eastern Defense Zone will be formed at eight different bases.    The Kymi Antiaircraft Regiment will be terminated as an  independent unit. The Salpausselka Antiaircraft Batteries will  be an attached unit of the Reserve Officers' Training Center.    Conscript training in Ylamylly will be terminated by the end  of 1997.    Parts of the Paratrooper and Military Police training, plus  the Transport Flight Squadron, will be united to form a Special  Forces Training Center in Utti in 1997.  <H5>  Western Defense Zone </H5>   One infantry unit, (the Kaarti Light Infantry Regiment) will  be formed in the Helsinki area.    Scientific management practices will be applied to the  operations of the Helsinki Antiaircraft Regiment. The  antiaircraft training battery in Santahamina will be transferred  to Hyryla.    Scientific management practices will be applied to the  Varsinais-Suomi Antiaircraft Regiment. The Signal Corps company  there will be terminated in June of 1994.    Scientific management practices will be applied to the Hanko  Coastal Artillery Battery. The real estate on The Boulevard will  be disposed of.  <H5>  Air Force </H5>   The Transport Flight Fleet will be terminated by 1997. A  transport flight squadron will be transferred to Tikkakoski, and  a helicopter flight squadron will remain at Utti.    Parts of the Scouting Flight Fleet and the Transport Flight  Fleet will be reorganized as the Support Flight Fleet and based  in Tikkakoski and Utti.  <H5>  Navy </H5>   A study will be made on possible savings resulting from the  proposed transfer of the Naval Combat Training Center to the  naval units themselves.    The gunship fleet, the guided missile array of the gunship  fleet, and the Pansio guided missile service center will be  terminated.  <H5>  Military Bands </H5>   A supplementary report on military bands will be drafted  before the end of 1994.</p>

They also  called for cutting short all intervention hampering reforms in  agriculture.    The picketers, who are participants in the congress of the  association, which opened in the Kyrgyz capital today, decided  to make their views known to the government and the public on  the very first day of the gathering.    Their representative Askarbek Bazarkulov said "the  government  headed by Apas Jumagulov has not justified our confidence,  because it is only paying lip service to reforms in agriculture.    "We ask only one thing -- that they do not interfere with  our  activity and give us loans. The 150 million soms (about 15  million dollars) allocated to agriculture recently has been  wasted in supporting unviable collective farms, and only ten  million soms (about 1 million dollars) of that amount of money  were given to private farmers.    "We, free land owners and farmers, have not received  anything", said Askarbek Bazarkulov, one of the organizers of  Kyrgyz peasant movement.    The congress is expected to raise a question about the  resignation of the republic's government.</p>

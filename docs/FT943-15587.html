			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: The Schoolmistress - Theatre If you are English and live in England, you have at least two notions of your native land: the real present-day England in which you live, and the old ideal England, the green and pleasant land of tradition. And you relish those occasions when these two Englands seem to merge into one - maybe watching cricket on the village green, maybe picnicking at Glyndebourne. But the experience is only valuable if the present-day England does not vanish beneath the illusion of the old one. Today's cricket must be good; and Glyndebourne takes its audiences seriously enough to challenge them with tough-minded productions. Not so Chichester. The audiences at the Chichester Festival Theatre look predominantly English, middle-class and middle-aged, and yet they lap up productions that present them with cheap reproductions of Ye Olde Englande - the kind of England that should only fool the kind of tourist who is 'doing' England in a week. I cannot remember when I saw anything worse than its new production of Pinero's 1886 comedy The Schoolmistress - a featherweight little late-Victorian farce about secrecy, class and marriage, dragged down by execrably heavy Comedy Effects from the entire cast - but its first-night audience gurgled and chortled. This is theatre as the most futile kind of escapism, offering an England of perpetually puerile behaviour and crummy caricatures. Still, even these viewers would surely prefer to see more three-dimensional acting; and this Pinero play would be surely more delectable if its cast took it seriously for a moment. This is one of those late-19th century farces in which marriages are kept secret and secrets are kept within marriages. The schoolmistress, Miss Dyott, has recently married a penniless aristo, the Hon. Vere Queckett - in secret. She supports him, but she keeps secret from him her amateur career as a comic opera singer. He keeps his chums secret from her. Meanwhile one of her pupils, Dinah Rankling, has married Mr Reginald Paulover in secret. It is particularly important that Dinah's parents, Rear Admiral and Mrs Rankling, do not discover the latter marriage. Peggy Hesselridge, pupil of Miss Dyott's college and in training to be a governess, emerges as a key manipulator of events - and in so doing falls in love too. And so forth. All of which could, I suppose, be delicious - a perfect summer sorbet - but Matthew Francis's staging treats Pinero's characters like mere marionettes, and treats young love and repressive old age as if they were both very silly. Most bizarre of all, it asks us to believe that Patricia Routledge (Miss Dyott) has married Guy Henry (the Hon. Vere Q). Now, Routledge has been middle-aged as long as I can recall, and she has grown stouter with the years, whereas Henry is a wide-eyed young beanpole who does not entirely convince as an emblem of maritally fulfilled heterosexuality. If Pinero had wanted a hippo to marry a giraffe, he would have made that central to his comedy. But since we are not asked to be amused by this marriage of opposites, we can only find it grotesque. But everything about the way The Schoolmistress is played says 'Don't believe this'. The schoolgirls are supposed to be of marriageable age, but behave like pre-teenage ninnies. A squeaky naval cadet (his shrill, unbroken voice, concocted from the merest hint in the text, is laboured by the production to idiotic extremes) bumps into a sofa, has his voice break (falling more than two octaves), and is soon spooning with one of the ninnies. The trainee governess (Victoria Hasted) is adenoidal and speaks with vowels few Victorian employers would permit into the schoolroom. Routledge and others go in for the most jerky double-takes, jolting changes of voice, and other strenuous devices. Dulcie Gray and Michael Denison, as the parental Ranklings, turn every Pinero touch of delicate characterisation into ponderous turgidity. At least Guy Henry seem to find himself funny, and sometimes makes his own panic-stricken antics funny to us too. But it is time that Chichester realised, or remembered, that Pinero's comedies require playing as subtle as do Wilde's. Time, too, that it stopped treating its audiences like tourists for whom plays must be reduced to the level of sit. com. In repertory at the Chichester Festival Theatre</p>

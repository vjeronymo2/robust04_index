			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DICK GREGORY WON'T POST BAIL  </P> <P> Comedian-activist Dick Gregory and two other people declined to post bail and  were being held in jail after being arrested in an anti-drug paraphernalia  demonstration at a convenience store, police said.  </P> <P> The protest was their second Monday at the Smoke Connection, where pipes for  cocaine and marijuana and other items are sold.  </P> <P> In the first protest, Gregory was among seven people arrested and released  after receiving citations for trespassing.  </P> <P> Late Monday, police said Gregory, 57, the Rev. George Clements, 57, of Chicago  and Robert Brown, 54, of Milwaukee returned to the store to continue the  protest. They were being held after declining to pay bail, authorities said.  </P> <P> The three were expected to appear in Municipal Court today.  </P> <P> The sale of drug paraphernalia is now legal in Wisconsin, although lawmakers  have passed a measure that would outlaw such sales. The bill awaits the  signature of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.  </P> <P> In the first demonstration, protesters included Clements and the Rev. Michael  Pfleger, two Chicago priests who oppose the sale of drug paraphernalia and have  participated in similar demonstrations.  </P></p>

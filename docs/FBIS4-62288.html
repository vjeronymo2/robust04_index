			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Russian National Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 14 ITAR-TASS -- Most national newspapers  continue to cover and comment on President Boris Yeltsin's visit  to Germany and his meeting with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA says that as a result of the successful visit  Russia is now entering a new phase in relations with the West,  and not as a loser. "But let us not give in to illusions. The  new stage in relations with the West will not be simple. Our  policy is now facing a double danger of lingering  confrontational prejudices on the one hand and a belief in  exclusively good-natured intentions of our partners on the  other".    Russia's federal budget approved by the State Duma on first  reading is another subject highlighted by many newspapers.  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as  saying "even prejudiced observers cannot fault the government in  this case. We expect the deficit of the federal budget to reach  68.8 trillion roubles, not to exceed 9.5 percent of the gross  domestic product. The expenditures are increased by 10.1  trillion roubles to amount to a total of 103.3 trillion roubles.  Revenues will grow on a more modest scale, by 3.7 trillion  roubles, to amount to a total of 124 trillion roubles." The  minister added that "culture and health services will get an  additional 968.4 billion roubles, and the allocations to support  the mass media, particularly radio and television, will increase  by 434 billion roubles."    State Duma Economic committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev  disagrees. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA quotes him as saying at a press  conference that "the government has not made any substantial  modifications in the budget. The policy behind the budget is to  share out the resources between the fuel-and-energy and the  agricultural sectors. It completely ignores the priorities set  forth in the president's message on the state of the nation,  which call for support of the science-intense industries and  conversion of the defence industries to civilian production".    PRAVDA is sceptical about the draft federal budget: "Can one  really rely on the articles of the budget, while the slump in  production slides to 50 percent and while inflation gallops  ahead of any forecasts of its mythical decline? How are  factories and plants expected to pay taxes if they are not  working?"    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA cites informed sources as saying that  "on the desk of the president of the Russian Federation there  lies a decree, already signed by Boris Yeltsin, dismissing  Sergey Shakhray as the minister of nationalities, while  retaining him as vice- premier in the Government of the Russian  Federation". The newspaper believes that "Shakhray's  resignation is due to the struggle between the regional elites  of the north and the south. Being a minister, Shakhray  succeeded in obtaining the endorsement of several agreements on  the development of the northern territories, as a result of  which the south was deprived of some state orders and budget  infusions".    Shakhray himself explains in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI why the  government adopted a resolution to change the mechanism of state  support and supplies of goods and foods to northern areas of the  country. He says in particular that "the disruption of economic  ties in the far northern areas and territories equal to them,  sharp cuts in mining for raw materials, including oil, and the  growth of transportation rates have placed under threat the  delivery of vitally important goods to the population of the  region". Shakhray also says that "many needs of the northerners  are fully met only through supplies from other parts of the  country. In the eighties, these supplies were financed through  the crediting system, which is no longer possible at present".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes an article by State Duma  international affairs committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin, who  says that "lately our foreign policy has been getting rid --  fully in words and to a certain degree in deeds -- from its  pro-Western orientation. But there still remain many problems  which have yet to be resolved on the path of overcoming this  infantile syndrome".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA continues to comment of the "case" of  Army  General Valentin Varennikov who rejected the recent amnesty and  is now working toward the institution of criminal proceedings  against those who are to blame for the disintegration of the  Soviet Union. The newspaper publishes an interview with Valentin  Varennikov's defence lawyer Dmitriy Steinberg, who thinks that a  new trial would not be long. "True. Everything will depend on  whether the people whose testimony the court wants to hear,  including (former Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev, will  choose to turn up for questioning," the newspaper comments.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PAIR'S BREAKUP TO BLAME IN FATAL SHOOTING AUTHORITIES SAY  </P> <P> A dispute over the breakup of a relationship apparently provoked a shooting in  which a North Hollywood woman and her mother were killed during a struggle in  front of three children, Los Angeles police said Monday.  </P> <P> Police said Kimberly Vandenberg, 25, and her mother, Elizabeth Vandenberg, 46,  were shot to death in the mother's house in the 11100 block of Acama Street  about 5 p.m. Sunday. Luis Palacio, 34, with whom Kimberly Vandenberg had been  living, was arrested in Hawthorne and was being held without bail on suspicion  of murder, police said.  </P> <P> Palacio had been shot in the chest before he was captured and police believe  that he was wounded during a struggle with the Vandenbergs.  </P> <P> Detective Mike Coffey said the shootings were partially witnessed by Kimberly  Vandenberg's two children, a 4-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy who is  Palacio's son. They also were seen by Kimberly's 12-year-old sister.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Children in Custody  </P> <P> The children have been taken into custody by the Division of Youth Services  until authorities can place them with relatives.  </P> <P> "They were scared to death," Coffey said of the children. When the shooting  started, "They hid in the kitchen. They were still in there when the police  arrived."  </P> <P> Coffey said Palacio and Kimberly Vandenberg lived together in North Hollywood  but were in the process of breaking up. Vandenberg had taken her children to  her mother's house for a visit Sunday, and a dispute began after Palacio  arrived.  </P> <P> "It was a slight discussion, not even a heated argument as far as we can tell,"  Coffey said. Palacio took out a gun and the shooting began, Coffey said.  </P> <P> Palacio fled in Kimberly Vandenberg's car after the shooting. Coffey said  Palacio went to the house of a friend in Hawthorne and said he had been shot  and needed help. The friend called police and Palacio left.  </P> <P> Hawthorme police learned of the North Hollywood slayings and received a  description of Kimberly Vandenberg's car. Palacio was arrested at 7:30 p.m.  when a Hawthorne officer found him in a telephone booth after seeing Kimberly  Vandenberg's car parked at Rosecrans and Ramona avenues.  </P> <P> Coffey said that Palacio was in good condition with a serious but not  life-threatening chest wound and that he was being treated at an undisclosed  hospital. Palacio was expected to be transferred later this week to the jail  ward of Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.  </P></p>

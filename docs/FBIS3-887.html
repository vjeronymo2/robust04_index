In an interview with the weekly MESSAGER, the Social  Democratic Front (SDF) leader said he wanted to bring diplomats  who have negotiated for the two countries in the past back into  the process to help resolve the dispute. "We want to bring  together all the members of the various commissions set up over  the years...to establish that the border has been known for a  long time, and should not be changed," he said. [passage  omitted]    Fru Ndi said in particular he wanted to meet former Nigerian  presidents, who he said were "living witnesses," to see if they  could help resolve the dispute.    Meanwhile press reports in Lagos said Cameroon President  Paul  Biya has agreed to meet his Nigerian counterpart General Sani  Abacha, but not on Nigerian soil. [passage omitted]    French involvement in the dispute also came in for renewed  criticism Tuesday. France has a military pact with Cameroon,  and has sent a number of troops and ammunition to Yaounde. In  Accra, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibn Chambas was quoted as  saying: "Ghana is very worried about the French intervention,"  and calling on Paris to withdraw immediately. Fru Ndi told  MESSAGER that France's "aim is to make us buy arms and kill each  other while the whites laugh."</p>

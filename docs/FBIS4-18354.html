			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by </F> Marianna Polikhroniadhou; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Polikhroniadhou] Who is responsible for the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia and how do you believe this  crisis can be resolved?    [Iliescu] It is true that during the past two years foreign  factors encouraged the elements of dispute in the region instead  of promoting dialogue toward achieving a peaceful settlement.    We believe, and so does Greece, that the solution to the  crisis cannot be achieved by force. This is interpreted to mean  that neither the path of military intervention nor embargoes are  acceptable solutions; instead of settling things they complicate  the situation even more and can only lead to a deteriorated  situation.    So, the only way to a settlement is by promoting political  solutions between the negotiating parties that are involved in  the crisis. After all, one should not forget that these  communities have coexisted for decades; they withstood German  pressure and, in certain cases, jointly resisted the Germans.  [passage omitted]    We welcome efforts such as those exerted recently by the  United States and the European Union [EU] to persuade the  conflicting sides to find a path to a dialogue that can lead to  a political solution.    [Polikhroniadhou] Does the dispatch of Turkish Blue Helmets  contribute toward the peaceful settlement you have mentioned?    [Iliescu] No, because the dispatch of troops violates the  principle of nonparticipation of bordering states. The official  position not only of Romania and Greece but also of the United  Nations is that bordering states should not be used. Such a  dispatch would be harmful primarily now when some steps are  being made toward a dialogue and relaxation of the crisis.  However, we see that the United Nations "has frozen" this  dispatch and we hope that this will be its final decision.    [Polikhroniadhou] During the current critical times that the  Balkans are passing through, some quarters talk about the  promotion of Muslim arrows and circles that aim at striking  against Orthodoxy. Do you agree with such conjectures?    [Iliescu] No, all this merely intensifies nationalistic  stress. I do not believe it is a question of Orthodox,  Catholic, or Muslim states. Why is Poland, which is a Catholic  country, facing huge problems? Why is the same also happening  in Hungary? The whole of Europe is now facing a lot of problems  with the increasing economic crisis, unemployment, and  inflation. So, let some quarters not hurry to oversimplify  their judgments. [passage omitted]    [Polikhroniadhou] On your country's accession to the EU,  what are the prospects and what do you expect from the EU's  Greek presidency?    [Iliescu] My country recently managed to overcome the  prejudices that many Western countries had about it by signing  the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO, which took place  last year, and the recent Romanian-IMF agreements. Today, many  foreign analysts agree that Romania will play an extremely  interesting role in the region. This is because Romania has  natural resources, which under government guidance can be  utilized exceptionally; its geographic position also allows  Romania to play the role of a link between Europe and the Middle  East.    Concerning our accession to the EU, we are on a good path  because promising conditions have been created for Romania's  integration into Europe and the development of its relations  with all European Community [as published] countries.    We express our satisfaction for the support of Greece, which  is now holding the presidency, and believe there will be  positive developments.    [Polikhroniadhou] With regard to the Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, what is your view?    [Iliescu] We consider your country's position as reasonable.  Your country does not have any claims against this republic and  respects the will of this newly established state to exist as a  sovereign entity.    We also consider as positive your country's stance on  assisting this state's economic development so that it will  become viable. So, as long as Greece has crystal-clear positions  and good intentions toward this state, the latter should also  have equally clear positions and not express some tendencies  against the status of the existing borders. Relations of mutual  trust that safeguard the existence of good-neighborliness should  be achieved through dialogue.    [Polikhroniadhou] Some quarters claim that some powers, by  strengthening [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence,  aim at destabilizing the region.    [Iliescu] I do not believe there are such interests. I do  not understand what the prolonged preservation of a conflict in  this region would serve. It could have only negative results  for everyone. On the contrary, I believe the interests of both  the United States and the European countries should be directed  toward resolving this dispute, something that would lead to  stability in the region.</p>

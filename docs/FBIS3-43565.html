			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Call To Disband SDUs -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English  on 7 January in its page 6 editorial thinks it "would be better  if the ANC [African National Congress] immediately disbanded all  SDUs [Self-Defense Units] that are causing trouble and phased  out the rest. After all, the 10,000-strong National  Peacekeeping Force is about to be formed and trained and will be  deployed not later than the end of March. We never thought SDUs  were necessary in the first place -- and recent events show what  an undisciplined and dangerous crowd some of them are."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   TEC Must Intervene in SAP-PAC Dispute -- The death of a  14-year- old boy in a clash between South African Police, SAP,  and Pan- Africanist Congress, PAC, supporters in Gugulethu near  Cape Town, "has aggravated an already tense situation," declares  a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 10  January. The SAP and Transkei have both appealed to the  Transitional Executive Council, TEC, to intervene, and "so it  should. But the Transkei demand -- voiced by its military ruler  Bantu Holomisa -- that the TEC should appoint an independent  commission composed of foreigners should be rejected. The TEC  has a chance to prove that it can help South Africans to resolve  their own disputes. It must accept the challenge."    `Tenuous' ANC Hold on Self-Defense Units -- Patrick Laurence  writes in an article on the same page that the "tenuous hold" of  the ANC on township SDUs, "some of which are spinning  dangerously out of control," is "hardly reassuring, particularly  because of the ANC's status as government-in-waiting." Laurence  cites "discontent among former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation -- MK] members" as contributing to the "threat posed by  out of control SDUs. Many former MK members are ensconced in  SDUs." The formation of the National Peacekeeping Force and the  emergence of a new national defense force "may help by providing  work for MK members who want to serve as soldiers in a  'liberated' South Africa." Ultimately, what South Africa needs  is 'a political settlement which will make private armies,  including SDUs, obsolete."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Banks Suspend Mortgage Loans to East Rand Townships -- "The  row over the major banks' decision to suspend mortgage lending  to the East Rand townships is, like other politically rooted  disputes, unlikely to be solved until a government committed to  restoring law and order is in place," points out a page 6  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 January.  "The bank's position is understandable. One third of mortgage  loans to blacks are in arrears, with a far higher proportion on  the East Rand. Anarchy there prevents the banks from servicing  loans or valuing properties. It is unclear is arrears are due  to hardship, anarchy or bond boycotts. But nothing will be  resolved even by a new government if anarchy persists."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Call To Abolish Internal Security Act -- The PAC has been  "inconsistent and equivocal in its statements on violence and  terrorist outrages such as the Heidelberg atrocity," notes a  page 4 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 5  January. They have "only themselves to blame" if there is  little public sympathy for the Western Cape PAC leaders who have  been detained for interrogation under Section 29 of the Internal  Security Act, ISA. However, the use of the ISA is "retrograde  and wholly unacceptable." The country should be "turning its  back on this kind of thing, which is a travesty of law. It is  up to the TEC to put a stop to it. You cannot fight barbarism  with barbarism."</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Arts: Wonderful Tennessee - Theatre Brian Friel's new play is something of a puzzler, a product of the writer's mystic side, which was only hinted at in his previous success, Dancing at Lughnasa. It has none of the warm nostalgic glow that formed such a strong part of Lughnasa's appeal, nor its manic, life asserting energy. It is set firmly in the present day with three rather ordinary middle class couples as protagonists. A cynic could describe the play as six characters going nowhere. A romantic would say that it is all about the healing power of the irrational, the elemental and the wonderful which are generally missing from modern life. It takes place on a stone pier in a remote part of Donegal (Ballybeg again) where the six wait for a boatman to take them across to the island. He never shows up. After an uncomfortable, sometimes drunken, night, they are collected again by their minibus driver. Joe Vanek's set consists of a solid looking narrow stone pier which crosses the middle of the state and has 'water' in front, behind and at one end. As the 'misty' white drape is pulled off the set you can hear the waves lapping and the cries of gulls. The arrival of the trippers with their banal, unsober songs and jokes, destroys this illusion of peace. At first we are beguiled into believing that we are watching a realistic play about the amiable bookmaker, Terry, his wife, Derna, her sister and husband and Terry's sister and husband reacting to the dis-comfort of an outing gone wrong. But there is of course far more to it than that. The name of the island that the party cannot reach, for example, translates from the Irish as 'Island of Otherness, Island of Mystery'. Soon after arriving at the pier Terry makes everyone take off their shoes, to conform to the old custom observed when the island was a place of pilgrimage. As their long night wears on, the three couples find themselves unconsciously conforming to the originally pagan rites of the pilgrimage. Stones are built up into a cairn, tokens are hung on the lifebuoy's wooden stand; there is music, dancing, story telling, drinking and eventually visions. At the end they resolve to return next year, and every year after, 'to attest, to affirm, to acknowledge'. The cast, under the direction of Patrick Mason, are uniformly strong, but the constraints of the narrow horizontal set combined with the fragmented nature of most of the dialogue seems to impede any development of character. Donal McCann's Terry remains enigmatic: was the outcome of his birthday outing premeditated, or were the strange events of their night on the pier merely accidental? Robert Black, an accordion player making his acting debut, brings a quiet poignancy to the part of George who is dying of throat cancer and communicates chiefly by playing tunes. Ingrid Craigie is alternately fragile and strong as Gerry's mentally unstable wife. Marion O'Dwyer and Catherine Byrne make the best of characters who struck me as predictably 'Frielsian', the latter earthy, sexy and intuitive, the former one of those plain bovine salt-of-the-earth women who seem to abound in Ballybeg. Perhaps the characters fail to engage much interest because, in spite of the efforts that Friel makes to disguise the fact, this is essentially a play of ideas. For all the accomplished artistry, the memorable story telling, the jokes and the evocative tunes, its plea for the power of the lost rituals of the distant past failed to ignite any latent spark of paganism in this witness.

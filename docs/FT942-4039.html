			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Not so much a rally, more an upward drift - Wall Street As summer rallies go, this one hardly looks electrifying. Talk of a seasonal take-off for share prices has been commonplace almost since the last snows melted (such talk reflects in part an effort by brokers to drum up business  -the volume of trading on Wall Street has sagged in recent months.) But with humidity beginning to fall like a damp towel across the eastern seaboard, there is no sign yet of a buying spree. It has looked more like an upward drift than a rally. Before yesterday morning, when share prices jumped on technical factors, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained around 50 points: in the past two or three weeks, it had edged up only 10. For brokers seeking buy orders this is not particularly good news. But investors have little to complain about. 'You can have a perfectly respectable market without a lot of enthusiasm,' says Dick Hoey, an economist and fund manager at Dreyfus, the mutual funds group. In fact, a slow and steady progression, without the fervour of the buying spree which pushed the Dow to a peak at the end of January, is just the thing to send investors to the beach happy. Short of some extraneous event - an international crisis over North Korea's nuclear intentions, for instance - there seems little to disturb the market's genial summer drift. The economic data remains satisfyingly mixed: not too positive - which would set off another sharp decline in the government bond market - and not too negative - which would hit expectations of future corporate earnings growth. Producer price figures for June, released yesterday, continued this ambiguous trend. The index fell 0.1 per cent, compared with an expected rise of 0.2 per cent - good news for inflation-watchers. But the core producer price index, excluding energy and food, rose faster than expected. There were other indications, last week, that the disinflationary forces which have prevailed in the US economy so far in the 1990s remain strong. On Thursday, PepsiCo provided a gloomy outlook for sales of its soft drinks in the US, and for its restaurant business. The memory of Marlboro Friday still haunts the stock market: if consumers are turning away from big-brand cigarettes to cheaper alternatives, why not colas or hamburgers as well? Pepsi's announcement battered other soft drink and restaurant stocks. It may not be good news for some consumer goods stocks, but the message it sends about consumer habits is positive for the stock market as a whole. Profits warnings like those at Pepsi, are few and far between. Companies remain in the midst of a strong profits advance, which should flow though in the form of higher dividends for the remainder of this year. Abby Cohen, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects dividends to grow on average by 7 per cent this year, compared with just 1 per cent in each of the last three. Companies have used the extra cash generated as they came out of recession to pay off debt or invest in renewed growth. Now, says Cohen, they are ready to give more to shareholders. That, in turn, will underpin one of the market's most important valuation criteria, the dividend yield. Even after the fall in share prices this spring, the dividend yield on the broad-based S&amp;P 500 remains under 3 per cent (a level last reached in the overheated summer of 1987.) Higher dividends will help. Low inflation, though, may remain a more important factor. The rise in bond yields since last October, reflecting nervousness about inflation, has already opened a bigger gap between fixed income and equity yields. The yield on the 30-year benchmark government bond has risen 1.5 percentage points, to 7.3 per cent, while the dividend yield has hardly budged. The higher bond yields rise, the more that relationship becomes strained. Not that all the dividend news has been good. Alexander &amp; Alexander, a big insurance broker, cut its dividends by 90 per cent last week, to just 2.5 cents a share. What was most notable about this announcement, though, was its rarity: it looked like a hangover from early 1993 or 1992, rather than a hint of more widespread earnings pressures. Another encouraging sign for stock prices has been the continued flow of cash into mutual funds which invest in equities. The funds attracted Dollars 11.7bn in April, up from Dollars 7.9bn in March and well ahead of gloomy projections. The April level is close to the average monthly inflow into mutual funds over the past year or so - a period during which such funds, which now own around 10 per cent of US shares, have become among the most important marginal buyers of equities.  ---------------------------- Monday      3768.52   - 03.70 Tuesday     3755.91   - 12.61 Wednesday   3749.45   - 06.46 Thursday    3753.14   + 03.69 Friday      3773.45   + 20.31  ----------------------------</p>

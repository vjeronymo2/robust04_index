			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Spirax-Sarco achieves 24% expansion to Pounds 14m Spirax-Sarco Engineering, the Cheltenham-based steam equipment specialist which sells 85 per cent of its products overseas, reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 14.1m, in the six months to June 30. Operating profit increased 23 per cent to Pounds 14.8m and operating margin improved from 13.3 to 14.2 per cent. Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said: 'The return to volume growth which we achieved in the last quarter of 1993 has been maintained consistently throughout the period, emphasising the international strength of our business.' He said the group was beginning to experience some increase in the price of raw materials, but these were not a significant element in the final sales price and would not have a material effect on margins. Turnover increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 103.9m, of which 6 percentage points were attributable to a full contribution from Spirax-Jucker, the group's former Italian licensee which it bought for Pounds 13.4m last year. The group said that while volume was unchanged in the UK, margins improved and it was seeing the first signs of returning confidence. Volumes grew in continental Europe in spite of continuing difficulties being experienced in Germany and Italy. In particular, the group's sales operations in France, Scandinavia and Spain achieved good improvements. Mr Tappin said the main manufacturing activities in the UK, US and France enjoyed higher levels of demand, in part following last year's inventory reduction, and increased their shipments to its selling operations around the world. Good productivity gains, coupled with tight cost control, resulted in the improved manufacturing margins. Group companies in the Americas increased volume and strong growth in Asian markets helped subsidiaries in Korea, Singapore and Thailand to increase their contribution to profits. Gearing fell from 35 to 13 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 26 per cent to 10.7p (8.5p). An interim dividend of 3.5p compares with 6.6p last time when the payment was boosted to maximise the benefit from an enhanced scrip dividend.</p>

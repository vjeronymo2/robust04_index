			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Economies no better under PR DIFFERENCES between the economic performance of countries cannot be explained by differences in their electoral systems, according to a study published yesterday by the Electoral Reform Society. Proportional representation is neither the threat to economic progress alleged by the prime minister, nor a panacea for the UK's economic ills as claimed by the Liberal Democrats and other supporters, the society says. The study, by Professor Richard Rose of Strathclyde University, compares five economic indicators for 21 OECD countries to see whether there is any link between their economic performance and their electoral system. It finds virtually no difference between countries with proportional representation and those with first-past-the-post systems in their average annual growth rates, debt interest as a proportion of GDP or unemployment rates. Public expenditure and inflation have risen faster on average in countries with proportional representation. What are the Economic Consequences of Proportional Representation?

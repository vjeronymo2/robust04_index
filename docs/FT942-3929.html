			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / GMB to state choice of Labour leader The GMB general union, the second-largest affiliated union to the Labour party, is likely this week to endorse one of the party leadership candidates. The three leading candidates are to speak today at the union's conference in Blackpool. Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, will address the conference, and Mr Tony Blair and Mr John Prescott will speak at a rally for delegates. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary, said that the union's choice would be decided in time to meet the party's deadline of midnight on Thursday. The GMB has 836,000 members of whom 749,000 pay the political levy and thus can vote in the party leadership ballot. Papers sent to members in the union's postal ballot - conducted by the Electoral Reform Society - will be accompanied by a separate document stating the GMB's choice for leader. The union's ballot papers will be distributed by post on June 27 and the ballot will close on July 18. Mr Edmonds said creating full employment should be the issue that decided Labour's leadership election. 'Jobs and how to create them is the common platform of a candidate for Labour's leader, making full employment the vision of the next Labour government', he said. Mr Edmonds at a press conference issued evidence from a MORI poll for the union that found 66 per cent of voters who had switched their party allegiance since the 1992 general election said policies on creating jobs and reducing unemployment were important in them making this decision. He added the poll had also found that two-thirds of respondents backed a national minimum wage and 57 per cent wanted Britain to sign the social chapter of the European Union's Maastricht treaty. Mr Edmonds also said that the cause of full employment rated more highly with the voters than health, education, or taxation.</p>

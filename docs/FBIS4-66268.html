			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shi Ding (0670 0002): "Outlook of Situation in </F> Japan for 1994"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  III. New Adjustments Brewing in Japan's Foreign Affairs </H5>   With the world quickening its pace toward multipolarity,  disputes in Japan over its strategy for national development  will become fiercer than ever before. Right now, Japan's basic  line for its foreign affairs is to continue its readjustments  and seek changes while holding its ground so as to keep pace  with the changes of its external environment which have taken  place after the Seattle meeting. Due to the fact that  readjustments in its diplomacy are often affected by its  domestic affairs, it is possible Japan may delay or hesitate in  taking action.    1. Create an internal and external environment, pave the way  to becoming a powerful nation in political affairs.    Since Hosokawa took his office, Japan adopted the tactics of  making concessions to gain advantages on the issue of becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan attached  importance to "being recommended by other nations" rather than  fighting for this membership and taking the initiative by  itself. As for the international environment, Japan believes  that the conditions for Japan to become a permanent member of  the UN Security Council have become ripe in each passing day.  Its next move will be to win popular support at home, while  trying to skirt around the barrier of "amending its  Constitution." In foreign affairs, it will launch another round  of offense with emphasis on becoming the fifth permanent member  of the UN Security Council and try to win more votes from  developing nations.    2. Exert greater efforts in promoting "Asian Diplomacy," and  expand Japan's economic interests and political influence in  Asia. In view of its increasing economic dependence on Asia,  Japan will further try to raise its diplomatic status in Asia in  coordination with its domestic economic structural readjustment;  turn the Asia-Pacific region into its economic backyard and  diplomatic prop; and strive to gradually play a leading role in  managing Asia-Pacific affairs.    In dealing with Southeast Asia, Japan will "make use of  economic means to expand its political influence," pave its way  with the outputs of its capital and merchandise, and develop  multilateral economic cooperation, while strengthening bilateral  relations. It will seize the forthcoming opportunity in the  normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations to strengthen its  infiltration into the Vietnamese market, advocate unified  actions to help Cambodia develop post-war reconstruction  projects, and expand its influence in Indochina. In dealing with  Northeast Asia, it will advocate peaceful dialogue; help the  United States and North Korea solve the nuclear issue with  peaceful means; try to officialize the dialogue on security  issues among Japan, the United States and Russia; and set up a  "regional system for the control of exports of technologies  which can be used for both military and civilian purposes."    3. Readjust its relations with the United States, and  gradually extricate itself from the situation wherein it  excessively relies on the United States for its economy and it  is politically contained by the United States. Within this year,  Japan and the United States will have their final showdown in  their "overall economic negotiations." In view of the fact that  agreements were already reached at the Uruguay Round of Talks,  the emphasis of U.S. strategy on its economic and security  matters will be shifted from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific  Ocean. It is making preparations to start a "Pacific Round of  Talks for Trading" aimed at opening up the markets in Asia.  Japan's market will be the first to be affected. The return of  the United States to Asia will inevitably intensify the  U.S.-Japanese contention for the leading role in economic  cooperation in the region. In addition to showing Japan's unique  status as a link between the United States and the ASEAN nations  within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), it will try  to play an even more active role in the East Asian Economic  Council (EAEC) proposed by Malaysia so as to balance U.S.  efforts in making use of the APEC Seattle meeting to increase  its influence in Asia.    4. Improve political relations between Japan and Europe, and  increase the radius in diplomacy. Hosokawa will visit Europe in  May. He plans to make use of his trip as a turning point to  strengthen the weaker link of the triangular relations among  Japan, the United States and Europe, and achieve a balanced  development. He will try to rely on the Japanese-European mutual  support to have more say in foreign affairs when he deals with  the United States. Japan will try to add new contents in the  "Japan-EC Joint Statement" and raise the bilateral political and  diplomatic relations between Japan and the European nations in  the past to the level of Japanese-European cooperation. It will  try to become a "quasi NATO member nation," and make use of the  European Union and the European Security Council to "push the  Japanese-European political cooperation into a new stage" and  turn this type of cooperation into another strategic pillar in  Japan's diplomatic structure.    5. Strengthen political dialogue between Japan and Russia,  and create a "soft environment" for the normalization of  Japanese-Russian relations. In view of the fact that the  improvement of Japanese-Russian relations will help Japan  reverse its unfavorable position in the quadrilateral relations  among Japan, the United States, China and Russia, and improve  the strategic environment in Northeast Asia, Japan's Foreign  Minister Hata and Prime Minister Hosokawa plan to visit Russia  on different occasions in March and May. Japan will reaffirm its  stand to continuously support Russia's line of reform within the  framework set up by the group of seven Western nations;  implement its plan to aid Russia which it had announced before;  promote bilateral political dialogue; and encourage the exchange  of visits by leaders of both countries. Meanwhile, Japan will  continue to carry out negotiations on the issue of Japan's  Northern Islands and try to pave the way to finally solve the  problem in the "post-Yeltsin" period.  <H5>  IV. Japan-China Relations To Enter a New Historic Stage </H5>   At a time when Japan is changing its political and economic  system and readjusting its foreign and domestic policies, it  will duly adjust its strategy toward China. Japan will seek to  establish a "new-type post-war relation" with China and to  ensure that the development of the Japan-China relation will not  be controlled by the United States. It will seek to establish a  Japan-China relations "in the world" and "in the Asia-Pacific  region" and maintain an "ordinary relation between one state and  other" which is not "restrained by history."    1. Proceeding from Japan's strategic interests, Japan will  not change its main foreign policy in maintaining the  Japan-China relations of friendship and cooperation. Recently  Hosokawa once again emphatically pointed out that Japan regarded  the establishment of a "better Japan-China relations toward the  21st Century" as the basic principle for its China policy. He  placed the Japan-China relationship on a par with the Japan-U.S.  relationship, and stressed that both of them are important  pillars of Japan's diplomacy.    In the development of its relations with China, Japan takes  into consideration the following new factors:    A) It takes Japan-China relations as the key for Japan to  attain the status of a "major nation in political affairs."  After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Japan-China  relationship is strategically becoming more and more important  in Japan's foreign policy. Japan needs China's cooperation to  hold sway in the new order in the world and in the Asia-pacific  region. China holds a key vote if Japan is to become a permanent  member of the UN Security Council. The Japan-China relationship  is a trump card if Japan wants to raise its strategic diplomatic  status in dealing with the United States and to seek  independence in handling foreign affairs.    B) Japan regards the Japan-China relationship as an "anchor"  in stabilizing the situation in Asia. This relationship is a  necessary condition for the promotion of economic development in  the Asia-Pacific region. Japan believes that peace, stability  and security in the Asian-Pacific region are still being  threatened by various factors even after the cold war ended.  Without a stable Japan-China relationship, there will be no  peace in this region. Whether the rapid economic development in  this region can be maintained or not depends on the economic  development and cooperation between Japan and China. Japan will  encounter endless difficulties in promoting its "new Asian  diplomacy" without China's support.    C) Japan seeks to develop the Japan-China relation so as to  check China's excessive growth which may harm Japan's interests.  In face of the increasing changes in China and the improved  relations between China and the United States after the Seattle  meeting, Japan is worried about the possibility of China and the  United States joining their efforts to contain Japan. It is for  this reason that strategically Japan needs to develop its  relations with China while containing each other.    2. Based on the developing situation, Japan is adjusting its  strategy in dealing with China.    First, Japan's strategic ideology has changed from one of  "allying with China to resist the Soviet Union" in the past to  one of relying on China's support to stabilize Northeast Asia  and the Western Pacific Region, and help Japan have more say on  international affairs and become a major nation in political  affairs. It is for this purpose that it must attach greater  importance to the Japan-China relationship in its foreign  policy, and improve the situation whereas the development of the  Japan-China relationship is constrained by the United States.    Second, the core of Japan's foreign policy has changed from  economic cooperation to paying equal attention to politic,  economic and security matters and from bilateral relations to  cooperative relations of a regional or even world nature.    Third, its China policy is to change from a "special  relationship" to an "ordinary relationship." That means to shake  off the yoke of historical issues and establish the Japan-China  relationship on the basis of reciprocity. Meanwhile, in its  China policy, Japan will stress the need to maintain a balance  in the triangular relationship among Japan, the United States  and China, and ensure that the situation is always to Japan's  advantage. In short, the Japan-China relationship will witness  new developments in the new year. The two nations will rely on  each other even more, and they would cooperate with each other  in more fields. Politically there will be more contacts at the  high level between the two countries, and a new situation will  emerge in economic cooperation. There will be more dialogue on  security matters in the Asia-Pacific Region and bilateral  security issues. However, with the continuous growth of China's  overall national strength, there will emerge competitions  between the two countries. While Japan enlists the support of  the United States and joins the ASEAN nations to strategically  contain China and "psychologically hold back China," some of its  movements merits our attention.    A) It stressed the need to achieve an "overall balance"  between economic cooperation and political security, and played  economic cards on the issue of politics and security. It  shortened the credit period of its loans to China so as to  maintain its influence over China. It imposed many restrictions  on the use of loans from Japan, the credit period and other  terms. It linked financial and economic cooperation between the  two nations with China's national defense modernization program,  the so-called military sales and the bilateral dialogue on  security matters.    B) Some of the members of Japan's ruling group who advocate  the establishment of a "quasi-government relation" between Japan  and Taiwan are gaining ground. Their aim is to safeguard Japan's  commercial interests in Taiwan and make Japanese products  economically more competitive. At the same time, they try to  make use of this to strengthen Japan's containment over China.  It is reported that Japan is negotiating with Taiwan on how  Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumatani  may visit Taiwan, and that it plans to invite Li Denghui to  visit Japan during the APEC summit meeting in Tokyo in 1995.  Nevertheless that does not conform with Japan's "one China"  policy.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Retail price cuts push RPI down RETAILERS' attempts to woo consumers by holding down prices pulled the annual rate of inflation back down to 1.4 per cent last month, compared with 1.8 per cent in September. Competition was fiercest among supermarkets, clothes shops and household-goods retailers. Their efforts to undercut each other led to a 0.1 per cent fall in retail prices on the month, the first October fall since 1962. A steep fall in seasonal food price inflation, from 4.1 per cent year-on-year in September to - 0.3 per cent last month, shaved 0.1 percentage points off the retail prices index. The fall mainly reflected special offers on fruit, potatoes and home-killed lamb. The monthly reduction in non-seasonal food prices was the sharpest for 21 years with inflation in this category falling from 3 per cent in the 12 months to September to 2.4 per cent last month. Cheaper beef, poultry, milk and processed vegetables were behind the fall. Statisticians said that the reductions in food prices were fairly evenly spread across stores and that since the October figures were collected many supermarkets had introduced further price reductions. Petrol prices also fell slightly in October, having risen sharply in the previous October, a move which cut a further 0.1 percentage points off the headline inflation rate. The slowdown in price rises was not confined to the traded-goods sector. Motoring expenditure inflation fell from 6.1 per cent in September to 4.9 per cent in October, reflecting the lower petrol prices and reductions in second-hand car prices, which outweighed rises in motor insurance premiums. Fares and other travel costs rose by 4.7 per cent in the year to October, an improvement on September's 5.1 per cent. Household services inflation over the same period was 3.6 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent in September. But the big reductions occurred among retailers. Clothes shops in particular attempted to avoid price rises even though the season's new fashions entered the shops last month. Consequently price increases in this sector were the smallest for any October since 1984 and the inflation rate for clothing and footwear fell to 0.8 per cent compared with 1.8 per cent in September. The 0.3 per cent month-on-month fall in household goods prices was the biggest for any October since records started in 1956. The Central Statistical Office said special offers and sales in furniture continued throughout October while prices for electrical goods changed little at a time when there are usually increases. The UK inflation rate is now one of the lowest in the European Union and well below the G7 average of 2.6 per cent.</p>

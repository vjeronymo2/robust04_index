			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Members back anti-racist moves DELEGATES yesterday agreed to enhance the status of ethnic minorities within the party and called for the expulsion of any members found to have resorted to racist tactics. Mr Ramesh Dewan, an Asian delegate, led a determined attempt to counter racist charges against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets, east London, where a candidate from the far-right British National Party was elected to the local council last week. He said that 507 of the 711 members of the Tower Hamlets party are Asian and he challenged Labour to say what percentage of its Tower Hamlets party members is Asian. The vote to elevate the ethnic minorities group to the status of a specified associated organisation easily satisfied the two thirds majority required for such a constitutional change. Earlier, party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown reaffirmed that expulsions would follow if the inquiry he has ordered establishes that Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets had used racist tactics. Endorsing this approach, Mr Dewan promised: 'If we discover a boil we will lance it'. The debate came as Labour challenged Mr Ashdown to 'come clean' over his involvement in the campaigns in Tower Hamlets, claiming the Liberal Democrat leader was warned about his party's tactics three years before last week's by-election. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, referred to a letter sent to Mr Ashdown by a Labour MP in March 1990 complaining about attempts to 'stir up racial antagonism' in a Liberal Democrat leaflet distributed in the Isle of Dogs.</p>

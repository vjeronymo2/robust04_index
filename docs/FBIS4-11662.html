			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 25 March  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Israeli Academic Center Spies on Islamic Group    2. Student Demonstrations Force Israeli Ambassador to  Work at    Home    3. Police-Islamic Group Vendetta in Asyut    4. Human Rights Violations in Prisons    5. Islamist Cleric Defended  <H5>  ISRAELI ACADEMIC CENTER SPIES ON ISLAMIC GROUP </H5>   A 5,000-word "analytical study" by Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad on  page 3 discusses the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and its  "spying activity and attempts to penetrate the Islamic Group in  Egypt, in coordination with the Israeli Embassy and the Mosad  apparatus, as well as its recruitment of Egyptian youth to spy  for Israel under the cover of scholarships in the  Mosad-affiliated Ulpan 'Aqiva Institute in Jerusalem."    The study says that AL-SHA'B has obtained a number of  "secret  messages" sent by the center to "researchers and spies of both  sexes." The messages, of which samples in Hebrew and Arabic are  published, begin by thanking the persons involved for earlier  services, enclose large sums of money--varying between 2,000 and  5,000 Egyptian pounds--and close with a specific request for the  person to continue to send reports and studies about extremist  Islamic groups in his governorate. The messages are usually  signed by Dr. Emanu'el Marx, director of the Israeli Academic  Center in Cairo, and bear the center's stamp and the Israeli  Embassy's secret stamp. A copy of each message is forwarded to  the "official concerned" at the embassy.    Maintaining that the center violates the protocol under  which  it was established, which describes the center as "a private  organization established under and subject to Egyptian laws,"  the study asks if the center really operates in accordance with  Egyptian laws and if "collecting information, recruiting spies,  and penetrating the Islamic group with the goal of destroying it  and the homeland from within can be described as activities  subject to Egyptian laws." Noting that the protocol was careful  to emphasize the dissociation of the center's scientific  undertakings from any political activity, the study wonders why  copies of these secret messages are sent to the Israeli Embassy.  It deduces that "the center practices clear political spying in  coordination with the Israeli Embassy."    The study cites an "official letter" the Israeli Foreign  Ministry sent to the center's previous director about four  Egyptians who were supposed to take a course at the Ulpan 'Aqiva  Institute, "which belongs to Mosad, according to the Jews  themselves." It asks: Since when does the Israeli Foreign  Ministry concern itself with teaching Hebrew to Egyptian  students and researchers?    The study also cites the center's "secret report" to the  Israeli Foreign Ministry, which the Egyptian Foreign Ministry  knows nothing about. The report talks about the deteriorating  security situation in Egypt, several attempts to assassinate  senior officials, and the persons who have been recruited. Of  these, the report mentions a "counselor who had a financial  problem with the Jewish Congress in Switzerland in 1988." The  counselor claimed to have lost $30,000, and the report adds that  "this sum should be provided so that we will not lose him as an  important source and a weighty friend." The report also talks  about the center's spying activity and methods applied in  penetrating national research groups and requests increased  financial and moral support for the persons cooperating with it,  the study says.    The study finally notes that an Egyptian working in the  center has been caught selling the center's documents to Arab  and foreign reporters.   <H5>    STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS FORCE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO WORK </H5> AT HOME    A 300-word report by Mu'tazz al-Hadidi and Nasir Faruq on  page 1 says that Cairo University students organized  demonstrations at the campus during the past few days, in which  "they shouted anti-Zionist slogans and denounced the continued  massacres against the Palestinian people." The students burned  the Israeli flag, raised the Palestinian flag, and denounced the  government's feeble stance.    The report adds that the Muslim Brotherhood students at 'Ayn  Shams University organized demonstrations last Tuesday to  denounce Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem. In a statement they  issued, the students said that their demonstrations "forced the  Israeli ambassador in Cairo to perform his job from his home in  al-Ma'adi, file a request with the government to permit him to  use 40 guards, and send a memorandum to the Zionist Ministry of  Tourism, warning it against the organization of excursions to  Egypt."  <H5>  POLICE-ISLAMIC GROUP VENDETTA IN ASYUT </H5>   A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi on page 1 maintains that  clashes between police and the Islamic Group in Asyut have  turned into "a fierce vendetta." The report adds that the  Central and Public Security forces have placed a siege around  the al-Walidiyah neighborhood in Asyut over a week ago and  prevented the people from entering or leaving.  <H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN PRISONS </H5>   A 200-word report on pages 1 and 7 says prison inmates have  been subjected to a one-month "discipline campaign," in which  dozens were injured and deprived of food and water, their  personal effects confiscated, and their heads and beards shaved  inhumanely.  <H5>  ISLAMIST CLERIC DEFENDED </H5>   Mustafa Bakri's 1,500-word article on page 4 criticizes the  government for preventing Islamic cleric 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from  preaching. He affirms that 'Abd-al-Kafi does not preach  violence and has always warned against it.    Bakri maintains that only groups that pursue "political  violence" stand to gain from this measure. He emphasizes the  need for an exhaustive, rudimentary solution for society's  problems and demands political and intellectual freedom for all  nationals, without discrimination.    A related 150-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im on page 7  contends that 'Abd-al-Kafi was banned from preaching because of  security reports submitted to the political leadership on the  type of audience that frequents his mosque. Security reports  indicated that the majority of his audience were rich  businessmen who reside in high-class neighborhoods, state  officials, and famous artists, 'Abd-al-Mun'im says. These  reports also noted 'Abd-al-Kafi's ability to persuade his  listeners. The report adds that the ban was preceded by  repeated warnings that 'Abd-al-Kafi might be arrested.</p>

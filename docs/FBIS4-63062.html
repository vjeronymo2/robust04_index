			<p>BFN     [Text] A conference of experts ended in the CIS  headquarters in Minsk Wednesday. The meeting completed the  development of the constituent documents of a new standing CIS  body, Economic Union Commission, under the CIS Coordinating and  Consultative Committee.    According to the documents, the functions of the new body  include developing documents for setting up a mechanism for the  creation of a single economic space and analyzing the progress  of the economic development of the CIS states with the purpose  of shaping up coordinated economic and social policies.    The Economic Union Commission is also expected to develop  measures to support CIS interstate structures.    It is planned for the commission's headquarters to be  located  in Minsk.    If the CIS member-states decide to set up the commission,  this will require an amendment in the CIS Charter which does not  envision such a structure.</p>

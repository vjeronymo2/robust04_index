The client eligibility requirements of rule 205&hyph;3 reflect the SEC's recognition that certain high net worth clients have the capacity to bear the perceived additional risks of performance fees, as well as the ability to protect themselves adequately against the potential abuses of performance fees. Applicant is unable to rely on the rule because the non-qualifying trusts do not meet the $500,000 under management or $1,000,000 net worth requirement. However, applicant believes that exemptive relief from section 205(a)(i) is appropriate because: (a) the individuals charged with making the investment decisions for applicant and the non-qualifying trusts satisfy the net worth requirements, are financially sophisticated, and are fully able to assess the potential risks of performance fees; (b) the trustees and custodians of the non-qualifying trusts are either close family members or long-term family employees, have substantial assets invested in applicant and are therefore subject to the same risks as the beneficiaries; and (c) the net worth of each beneficiary of the non-qualifying trust exceeds $1,000,000. Applicant believes the beneficiaries of the non-qualifying trusts are wealthy investors who, together with the trustees and custodians, can understand the effect on their investment of performance-based compensation and bear the potential risks of such fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Because those exercising investment authority for the non-qualifying trusts have such intimate and strong familial relationships to the beneficiaries, applicant believes it is not unreasonable to presume that the commonality of such interest will result in the decision-maker behaving in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Except for the requested exemption for the non-qualifying trusts and custodianships, the requirements of rule 205&hyph;3(b) are satisfied in all other respects. Thus, applicant believes that granting the requested exemption is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Advisers Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

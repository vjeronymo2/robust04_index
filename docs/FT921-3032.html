			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tory attack focuses on pensions THE Conservatives yesterday launched a wholesale onslaught on Labour's shadow Budget with an attack on the plans to end the concession for people opting out of the state earning-related pension scheme (Serps). It was denounced as a retrospective penalty on the 4 1/2 m people who had taken out personal pensions. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, leading a team of cabinet ministers attacking Labour's initiative, condemned the proposals as 'a shadow Budget in more than name'. He called the increased investment allowance 'the first invisible kick-start ever', as it was not mentioned as a cost in 1993-94, and said that while the proposals attributed no cost to the phased release of local authority capital receipts, these would add to government borrowing. The specific charges came within a broad campaign assault on Labour's plans which would, the Conservatives said, leave everyone worse off because interest rates would rise, the housing market would be devastated, and the tax bills of 'all those on whom we depend to help this country out of recession' would rise sharply. In their general attack on the impact of Labour's economic policies, the Tories highlighted the finding of the Financial Times/Mori poll of board-level executives in yesterday's FT, which said a quarter of respondents suggested that their companies might reduce their investment spending if Labour were elected. 'So much for the proposition that Labour would lead to higher investment,' said Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman. Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, underlined the impact of the Serps change on young people, saying that more than half of personal pension contract holders were under 30 years old. 'Within less than one month the basis of all 4 1/2 m personal pensions will be wrecked,' he added. Labour responded that it had consistently made clear its opposition to the concession, and had said it would be ended. Though it would be preventing people from receiving the final year's benefit of the five-year arrangement running from 1988, it would not be taking away what people had already received. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, targeted Labour's spending plans, saying they would not produce any public benefit. He said that the extra Pounds 1bn for the health service, for example, would not go on patient care but on introducing the minimum wage, ending compulsory competitive tendering and bringing in a Pounds 100m no-fault compensation scheme.</p>

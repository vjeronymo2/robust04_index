			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim  military engineers have continued work in the Sarajevo area,  especially in Sokolje and Mojmilo, in order to get close to the  Serb defense lines, Srpska republic army [VRS] sources have told  a TANJUG correspondent.    Serb military sources are saying that the pull-out of Muslim  units and military equipment from Sarajevo has continued via a  tunnel underneath Sarajevo airport and on board lorries across  the runway, before the very eyes of UN peacekeepers.    The Serb military sources are also saying that, once out of  Sarajevo, Muslim units are setting off in the direction of  Hrasnica and Mount Igman in an attempt to link up in force with  the area around Gorazde. The VRS are foiling all these  attempts, while Muslim soldiers, who surrendered to the Serb  side upon leaving Sarajevo, are talking about an "extremely low  morale among Muslim formations" which are heading toward  Gorazde, because "a vast majority do not want to take part in  these senseless actions," the VRS sources explain.</p>

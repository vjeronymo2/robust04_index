			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan Affairs  Office under the State Council today held a forum to discuss  Deng Xiaoping's scientific thought of "peaceful reunification"  and "one country, two systems".    Wang Zhaoguo, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, said  the  principle of "one country, two systems" is the concrete  application of Marxism in contemporary China.    Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that it  is the outcome of the party's line of seeking truth from fact  and constitutes one important part of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    He called for earnest study and implementation of Deng's  idea  of "peaceful reunification" of the motherland and "one country,  two systems", adherence to the one China principle, safeguarding  China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and opposition to  any advocacy of "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" and  "Taiwan independence".    Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association of the Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that his association  aims to develop the exchanges and relations across the Taiwan  Straits and to promote peaceful reunification of the motherland.    He said that with the approach of the 21st century, the  Mainland and Taiwan should enhance their economic cooperation to  attain mutual benefits.    Cai Zimin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan  Democratic Self-Government League, said that the Taiwan people  have a patriotic tradition which remains unchanged.    He said that the principle of "one country, two systems"  respects the realities on the two sides across the Taiwan  Straits and agrees with the Taiwan compatriots' wish for being  their own masters.    He said that the claims for "two Chinas" and "one China, one  Taiwan" advocated by some people in Taiwan or outside Taiwan are  doomed to fail.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Haiti's junta tries to block Aristide HAITI'S military rulers are intensifying their efforts to frustrate the return to the country of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president who was overthrown and sent into exile last September. They have also prevailed on legislators to delay indefinitely negotiations with the Organisation of American States for Mr Aristide's return. The military is attempting to prolong the interim government which it set up after the coup, and wants to organise elections. In another development, soldiers and policemen attacked the office of Mr Rene Theodore, the prime minister-designate, at the weekend, killing one of his bodyguards. The attack, the second on Mr Theodore's offices this month, has raised concerns in the Caribbean state over his safety, while Haitian legislators consider whether to ratify his appointment. Ratification would clear the way for the return of Mr Aristide. The OAS and Mr Aristide have agreed on Mr Theodore as the interim prime minister, but the army has been forcing parliamentarians to delay a decision on his ratification. The senate has imposed a 10-day moratorium on negotiations with the OAS, apparently to appease the military. Following the attack, Mr Theodore said the country was being held hostage by thugs. 'Two things must be clarified now, at this moment of deepening crisis,' he said after the attack. 'We need to know whether the commander-in-chief cannot control his troops, and whether parliament will or will not prolong the mandate of the interim government.' The country's military rulers appear emboldened by the limited effect of a trade embargo imposed by the OAS, the European Community and several countries. A shortage of fuel has been relieved by three shipments since the embargo was imposed. Mr Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the OAS, said last week: 'We must come to the conclusion that it is not possible to implement the embargo.' The political stalemate in the country of 7m has led to a resurgence of refugees seeking asylum in the US.</p>

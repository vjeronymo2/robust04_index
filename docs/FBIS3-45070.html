			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- As the year 1993 is  about to end, Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National  Committee, and Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee recently visited the central organs of the  Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China  Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction  Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the  Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi  Gong Dang, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic  Self-Government League.    When Li Ruihuan visited the offices of the central  committees  of these democratic parties' he shook hands with their leaders,  extended his best regards to them, heard briefings about their  situations, and solicited their views. Applause and laughter  could frequently be heard wherever he visited.    Li Ruihuan had separate heart-to-heart talks with the  leaders  of the eight democratic parties' central committees. Speaking  in a warm and friendly atmosphere, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei  Jieqiong, Lu Jiaxi, Li Peiyao, Cai Zimin, Yang Jike, and Hao  Yichun expressed important views on many issues.    Recalling the history of the united front, Li Ruihuan said:  This year is the centennial of Comrade Mao Zedong. Concerning  Comrade Mao Zedong's precious legacy, the thinking and theory  about the united front are particularly important. Comrade Mao  Zedong gave equal importance to the united front, armed  struggle, and party building, describing them as the three magic  weapons. We should thoroughly study this observation. The  quintessence of Mao Zedong's united front thinking lies in the  fact that Chinese Communists must strive to unite with their  allies, unite all forces that can be united with, and mobilize  all positive factors to form a mammoth revolutionary and  construction army, and do everything possible to minimize  hostile forces and problems so as to achieve the historic  missions of national liberation and national rejuvenation, and  push the revolutionary and construction cause forward. This  shining thinking of Comrade Mao Zedong still has important  guiding significance during the new historical period.    Commenting on building a socialist democracy, Li Ruihuan  said: While we do not reject democracy, we firmly oppose certain  foreign forces' interference in our internal affairs under the  banner of "democracy," and we also oppose any act of  indiscriminately transplanting or copying other countries'  democratic systems. We always believe that democracy is an  important benchmark of social progress and an inevitable trend  of historical development. China's Constitution, the CPC  Charter, and the report of the 14th National Party Congress have  all stated that building a prosperous, democratic, and civilized  socialist modern country is our objective. We also believe that  the form of democracy of a country as well as the process by  which it achieves democracy must be determined by the situation  of this country. Instead of having genuine democracy, there may  even be chaos if we simply demand democracy without considering  the country's situation. Facts have proved that the people's  congress system and the system of multiparty cooperation and  political consultations under the CPC leadership are socialist  democratic systems in line with China's situation. We must make  genuine, effective, and consistent efforts to expedite China's  democratic construction.    Speaking on the roles played by democratic parties, Li  Ruihuan said: China's reform, opening up, and modernization  endeavors have now entered a new stage of development, and the  14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee have put forth the grand and formidable  mission of building a socialist market economic system. If the  people in our country do not work hard together, this mission  cannot possibly be accomplished. Since you democratic parties  have large numbers of talented people and a great pool of  intellectual resources, and your connections are extensive, the  roles you play during this historic change are irreplaceable.  You should and can mobilize the masses you have ties with to  contribute their strengths, resources, and efforts to the  gigantic cause of building a socialist market economic system.  Party committees and governments at all levels should maintain  close ties with democratic parties and attach importance to  giving full scope to democratic parties' roles and listen and  respect their members' views.    During the meetings, some democratic party leaders expressed  views on expanding their organization, replacing the old leading  groups, and organizational development. They also frankly  reflected the practical problems about their working conditions.  Li Ruihuan said: We have stressed long-term coexistence,  mutual supervision, multiparty cooperation, and political  consultations; but these things must be predicated on the other  side's existence and development. Democratic parties' hard work  is essential for their development. As the leader in multiparty  cooperation, the CPC also has the responsibility of helping  democratic parties do a good job in this respect. Li Ruihuan  pointed out: Respecting and heeding the interests of democratic  parties and people of all walks of life and performing good and  practical services for them are concrete united front projects  which the CPC must do to demonstrate its readiness to serve the  people wholeheartedly, which is the objective of the CPC, and  these projects are also important means to enable the united  front to become more cohesive and to have greater appeal under  the new situation. All CPC committees must consider it their  responsibility to assist democratic parties improve their  working conditions and solve their practical problems. The  purpose of our visit is to establish ties with you [ren men 6126  7024], seek your advice, have heart-to-heart talks with you, and  serve you. Party leaders at all levels must perform more good  and practical services for democratic parties by demonstrating  the communists' broadmindedness and high sense of responsibility.</p>

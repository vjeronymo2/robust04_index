			<p>BFN     [Text] Water Commissioner Gid'on Tzur says that autonomy  agreements could critically endanger Israel's water supply. In  a briefing to the Knesset State Audit Committee, the  commissioner said the country's water supply could be damaged by  seeping sewage and industrial waste from the autonomous regions.  He said he believes that Israel should have secured better  guarantees for its water rights during negotiations.</p>

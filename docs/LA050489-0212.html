			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA STUDENTS STAGE ANOTHER HUGE RALLY  </P> <P> Legions of students marched through Beijing today and occupied Tian An Men  Square to mark the 70th anniversary of China's first student movement with  another stunning display of their craving for democracy.  </P> <P> About 100,000 people, more than half of them students, defied police and  peacefully gathered in the huge square for a festive rally to seek greater  freedom, cleaner government, a free press and official recognition of the new  independent student union that authorities say is illegal.  </P> <P> Students held much smaller demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing and Changsha,  and about 300 journalists from the official Chinese media joined the student  rally in Tian An Men. Throughout Beijing, crowds of workers applauded the  students and shouted encouragement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'China Has Hope'  </P> <P> "Perhaps the march will not bring democracy today, tomorrow or the day after  tomorrow, but if we keep working on it, China has hope," said one worker who  claimed that he risked being fired by attending the demonstration.  </P> <P> After initially saying the student marches were designed to undermine China's  government, the communist leadership in recent days has said that the  demonstrators are being manipulated by unspecified people and that most  protesting students are patriotic.  </P> <P> Student activists appeared ready today to shift their tactics. After six  successful marches in defiance of the government, they indicated that future  activity may not center on demonstrations. They also announced that a nearly  2-week-old boycott that shut down most Beijing University classes would end  Friday.  </P></p>

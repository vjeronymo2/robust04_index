			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Spain returns with DM4bn Eurobond THE Kingdom of Spain returned to the international capital markets yesterday with a DM4bn, 10-year Eurobond, which benefited from the timely cut in German interest rates. An official at Dresdner Bank, which arranged the deal, said that the Bundesbank's move fanned demand, which allowed the issue to be increased from DM3bn. The deal was priced to yield 31 basis points over the 7 1/8 per cent bund due December 2002, at the lower end of the indicated range of 31-34 basis points. Yesterday's deal was Spain's first venture since last September, when turbulent conditions in Europe's financial markets, caused by the currency crisis in the exchange rate mechanism forced it to delay the pricing of its first Eurodollar bond, as well as substantially increase the yield on the Dollars 1.5bn deal. Syndicate managers said yesterday's offering from Spain was attractive to domestic investors since it yielded about 20 basis points over domestic mortgage bonds. The paper also found favour in Austria, which has a special tax agreement with Spain. The issue traded close to its re-offer price of 99.50, to yield 7.32 per cent, in the late afternoon, outperforming German government bonds which fell on profit-taking after the cuts in the Lombard and discount rates. The Spanish region of Andalucia is due to launch a DM300m issue via Dresdner Bank in the next two weeks. Syndicate managers expect further sovereign and supranational issues shortly, including five-year Eurobonds from the World Bank and Belgium. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on speculation that it would arrange the World Bank deal. Elsewhere, Abbey National raised a further Pounds 100m through its second reverse floating-rate note in as many days. Syndicate managers said that investors were discouraged by the issuer's option to call the FRN in a year's time, which they believed would considerably reduce their potential gain. Similarly, the three-and-a-half year maturity on the European Investment Bank's Pounds 200m reverse FRN, compared with the three-year duration of Wednesday's offerings, proved unpopular with investors since it increased their risk on the interest rate front. The pricing of the EIB deal was also viewed as aggress-ive. Syndicate managers said distribution of the FRNs launched yesterday was much slower than those brought on Wednesday. 'The market is getting saturated as there is only a finite pool of demand for this sort of paper,' one syndicate manager said. The Canadian province of Saskatchewan provided a further variation on the theme, with its 10-year, DM200m reverse FRN. The Irish government is planning a new Eurobond issue of some IPounds 400m equivalent, writes Tim Coone. Mr Adrian Kearns, head of foreign currency borrowing at the National Treasury Management Agency, said the funds would be raised in D-Marks, Swiss francs or French francs. Ireland returned to the Eurobond market last October as the European currency crisis and speculative attacks upon the punt exhausted the Irish government's reserves.</p>

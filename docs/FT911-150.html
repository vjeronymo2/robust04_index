			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian groups to mine Peruvian zinc TWO BRAZILIAN mineral groups have just clinched a deal to mine an estimated 720,000 tonnes of zinc and 180,000 tonnes of lead in a mine near Lima, Peru. Companhia Paraibuna Met-ais, the second largest zinc producer in Brazil, has entered in-to a joint venture with Brazilian-based Construtora Norberto Odebrecht, Peruvian-based Mineracao Barra Ventura, and Minero Peru, the state-owned mineral group of Peru. The groups will have shares in the project of 45 per cent, 15 per cent, 15 per cent, and 25 per cent respectively. Mr Ronaldo Salerno, president of Paraibuna, said the company signed the deal to guarantee a zinc supply for its Brazilian refineries. 'Control over the mine will also guarantee quality,' added Mr Salerno. Brazil has few known zinc reserves. Salerno also announced that the group was exploring reserves in Bolivia, with an eye to opening up zinc mines in that country. The Peruvian joint venture will require a Dollars 50m investment over the next four years. By 1996, Mr Salerno expects the mine to be in full production. Mr Salerno cautioned that, although the joint venture has been agreed, the group will not put any money into the project until it has confirmed Peru's estimates of zinc deposits in the area.</p>

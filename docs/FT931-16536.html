			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Observer: Uneconomical With lawyers having filled most of the Clinton administration's top economic posts, the hopes of professional economists are now pinned on the crucial second round of sub-cabinet appointments. The really attractive unfilled posts are the undersecretaryships for international and economic affairs in the Treasury and State departments - posts held in the Bush administration by David Mulford and Robert Zoellick, respectively. However, there is also a vacancy at the new White House National Economic Council where ex-Goldman Sachs boss Robert Rubin badly needs a high-powered economic assistant if he is to carry any international clout. Passed over for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers, World Bank chief economist Larry Summers appears a strong runner for Mulford's Treasury job, which would make him the administration's point man in Group of Seven policy co-ordination exercises. Then again, David Hale, chief economist at Chicago's Kemper Financial Services and omnipresent on the international lecture circuit, would dearly love a crack at it. Stanley Fischer of MIT (Summers's predecessor at the World Bank) is reportedly running hard for Zoellick's job at State, which will carry responsibility for fashioning a coherent US response to economic chaos in the former Soviet republics. However, Harvard's Jeffrey Sachs, currently an adviser to the Yeltsin government, could be an imaginative alternative. Elsewhere Larry Katz, a bright young labour economist at Harvard, is expected to land the chief economist post at Robert Reich's Department of Labor - a big job given Clinton's determination to overhaul US industrial training, and Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and Business Week columnist, is set to become one of Laura Tyson's deputies at the Council of Economic Advisers. Blinder's appointment should help balance Tyson's unconventional views on trade and industrial policy.</p>

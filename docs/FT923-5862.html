			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: End of US ban promises LME options boost THE LONDON Metal Exchange expects a substantial increase in business from the US following the removal of a ban on the sale of its options there. The exchange has been working for two years to have the ban removed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are obviously very pleased. We felt that US users of the LME were at a disadvantage compared with their European and Japanese competitors who could use options.' This success comes at a time when the LME, the world's biggest terminal market for physical metal, has been experiencing phenomenal growth in trading. The accounts show that last year the exchange handed back to members Pounds 1.2m previously collected in levies and fees. Turnover jumped by 32 per cent in 1990, by another 27 per cent last year and in the first six months of 1992 soared by a further 39 per cent. US clients have been contributing about 15 per cent of the exchange's turnover but this has been growing fast since LME-authorised metal warehouses were opened in the States last year. Mr King said there was a 30-day gap before the CFTC's decision about LME options became effective to give time for any objections to be raised. The LME was taking legal advice on what its members might or might not do when marketing options in the US, where regulations were very tight, he added. This would be passed on to members after the 30 days were up. Mr King suggested that the sharp rise in turnover showed exchange's own marketing efforts, 'making itself more user-friendly', had been paying off. 'Also the world is becoming more financially aware. Companies first started to hedge their foreign currency exposure and now they are looking to hedge other aspects of their business.' Options trading on the LME has been expanding even faster than its traditional futures business - it rose 149 per cent in the first half of this year. Mr King said: 'Many people were wary about options but more and more they have come to realise that these are a valid way to hedge risk, lock in prices and make better use of the market'. The LME's accounts, recently filed, show that its income rose from Pounds 4.26m in 1990 to Pounds 4.54m last year and that pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds 1.41m. Retained profits at the year-end had increased from Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 2.5m. The accounts show that Mr King's emoluments (pay and pension contributions) increased by 8.5 per cent last year from Pounds 112,810 to Pounds 122,453. The New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) will launch platinum futures and options and palladium futures on September 8, reports Reuter from New York. They are already listed on New York Mercantile Exchange. Comex will open trading for its platinum contract five minutes before Nymex platinum opens. Trading will end five minutes after the Nymex close.</p>

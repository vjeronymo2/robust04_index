			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: Iphigenie en Tauride - Opera There is, of course, no one way to tackle a masterpiece. While Welsh National Opera is busy touring southern Britain with its new production of Gluck's penultimate opera, it seems peculiarly rewarding that the same work should have been chosen by English Bach Festival for Sunday's annual presentation at the Royal Opera House. The contrasts of style and approach between the two stagings are extreme; since both are valid and deeply affecting on their own terms, our appreciation of the work's naked power can only be sharpened thereby. Welsh National Opera, true to its fashion, has come up with a hard-edged modern re-invention of the tragedie-lyrique form and Gluck's magnificently concentrated dramatic language. English Bach Festival, true to its, has tried to re-create, as faithfully as its not limitless resources allow, the 'period' usages of that form and language. People familiar with the recent English Bach Festival accounts of Gluck's Paris Orfeo and Alceste and Mozart's Mitridate and Idomeneo will have known what to expect: the deft scene changes, the classically proportioned scenic vistas, the graceful floating movements of chorus and dance-troupe, the helmets, breastplates, feathered head-dresses and ballooned skirts, the aristocratic plastique of the principal players. What may have surprised them were the qualities of lightness, clarity and intensity that these 'period' traits and properties, carefully trained and focused, can strike up in the opera. This performance, conducted by Marc Minkowski, produced by Alain Germain, designed (after 1770s Paris models) by Terence Emery, choreographed by Stephen Preston and lit by Roger Frith, was indeed thus trained and focused. The 'beautiful simplicity' that Gluck once proclaimed the goal of all his innovations was its guiding principle. Every movement seemed musically inspired, every combination of word, action, vocal colour and instrumental detail unforced, and newly meaningful. From the raised pit the orchestral sound issued with a tensile directness worlds away from any applications of driving force or mere loudness. Similar concerns were evident in the phrasing of the leading singers, none more distinguished, eloquent or affecting than Jennifer Smith in the title role. The dignity of Miss Smith's performance lay above all in its expressive refinement; a slight curdling of tone at the top of the stave appeared here a chosen interpretative device, not a vocal failing. Russell Smythe's Orestes, in spite of minor pitch sharpenings, was of classically French baritonal authority - lean, pure, noble; Andreas Jaggi (Pylades) gave a skilful display of his more slender vocal means; Donald Maxwell was far more successful at conveying the dark terrors of Thoas's single aria than the usual bawler of modern productions. This Iphigenie en Tauride seemed to me the peak of EBF achievement in recent years.</p>

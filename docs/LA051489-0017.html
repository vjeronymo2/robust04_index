			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SISTERHOOD IS MUSICAL  </P> <P> It's strictly at the formative stage, but Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and  Patti LaBelle may join as Sisters in the Name of Love next year for what  Warwick terms "a major world tour." Recording as a trio is also a possibility,  Warwick told Outtakes.  </P> <P> They'll make their first concert appearance as Sisters in the Name of Love on  June 10 at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall, part of NYC's "That's What  Friends Are For" AIDS fund-raising weekend, which Warwick is spearheading.  </P> <P> The three famed singers, who first teamed for a 1986 HBO special, have been  talking about regrouping ever since, Warwick explained. Now, "We're going to  plan a second HBO special, which will form part of the foundation for the tour.  </P> <P> "This is really Gladys Knight's baby, her dream child, and it's coming to  fruition with the help of her two gal friends. We're all very excited about  it." Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

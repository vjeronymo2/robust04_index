			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: MAKING HORSE SENSE OF NEW YEAR'S  </P> <P> Did you ever wonder why the symbol of New Year's is a kid wearing a diaper and  a top hat and carrying a horn?  </P> <P> You don't have to run over me with a truck. I've already associated the diaper  with change. But why the party hats and horns?  </P> <P> To be honest, I haven't lost a lot of sleep over this, but you have to admit,  it sends out some mixed messages. Do we all strip and go naked into the new  year? What happens to the old guy digging around with a scythe with his  bathrobe open? Why would I follow anyone into a new year who in 365 days ages  110 years? I'd just as soon march behind the Energizer batteries on TV that  bang through people's lives as if they have a passkey.  </P> <P> Maybe little New Year is supposed to exude innocence, freshness and optimism .  . . like Bobby in the shower on "Dallas." He's born again to tackle another  season, another year, another decade.  </P> <P> I looked at the symbol the other day and got a flash. Wouldn't it be reasonable  that this urchin in a diaper is a reminder to shed some of the baggage of last  year and go into the new one in our birthday suits?  </P> <P> Maybe we shouldn't have any pockets holding names of old adversaries to whom we  are not speaking -- and can't even remember why. No hair shirts of self-pity  that we've worn for too many years without cleansing. No glasses that allow us  to see all of our differences but none of our likenesses. No designer  accessories, such as self-inflicted pain and guilt, and out-of-control ambition  and perfection.  </P> <P> Maybe we shouldn't have any shoes that have walked in the same ruts of old  ideas and stubborn resistance to change for too many years. No luggage to kick  along holding years of yellowed hatred and crumbling prejudices toward people  no longer alive. No neckties or scarfs to choke out laughter, joy and words of  forgiveness.  </P> <P> Maybe we should be like a baby who has just entered the world ready to  celebrate life on its terms. Maybe this child does represent a newness, yet  another chance to grow, to develop, to learn anew. Maybe we all need a new  wardrobe: short enough to be interesting, yet long enough to cover the subject.  </P> <P> I ran this theory by my husband the other day. He said, "Hey, New Year's is  just another day when all the horses are a year older. It's no big deal."  </P> <P> Maybe. Actually, it would account for the top hat and the noisemaker.  </P></p>

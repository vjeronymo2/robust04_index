			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Elisa Guimaraes Ferreira: "White Books and </F> Green Books" -- first paragraph is PUBLICO introduction]    [Text] The citizens of Europe, lulled by bureaucrats and  supported by funds, increasingly aspire to a peaceful spot in  the protective shade of bureaucracy and have distanced  themselves more and more from any ambition to create competitive  and dynamic enterprises.    Although history demonstrates that the Old Continent always  manages in the end, for better or worse, to find solutions to  apparently dramatic crises, the construction of Europe--at least  at the pace and with the enthusiasm with which it progressed  starting in the middle of the 1980's--appears to have reached an  impasse.    More serious than this, at times one has the feeling that  Europe is increasingly lacking in thinkers and politicians of  sufficient stature and charisma to reach the citizen and, in  some way, to touch him--not to say excite him--to mobilize him  behind an ideal that is not limited to the ambition to consume  more and better products.    The Old Europe appears to be showing troubling signs of real  aging, in terms of lack of imagination, excessive bureaucracy,  and the "officialization" of the system.    Without going into a discussion of the very serious  manifestations of this tendency (such as the relative  unreadability, for most citizens, of such basic documents as the  Single Europe Act or the Maastricht Treaty, a situation which is  even worse when the respective government leaders determine that  it is irrelevant to submit them to debate and referendum), it is  at the very least troubling to look upon the dearth of ideas and  the "deja vu" of the solutions recently appearing in such highly  publicized and much discussed documents as the so-called green  book ("European Social Policy--Options for the Union") or the  white book ("Growth, Competitiveness, Employment--Challenges and  Pathways to the 21st Century").    Both documents are a perfect illustration of the impasse  that  has been reached with regard to the evolution of the European  Union and, moreover, of the inability to arrive at a convincing  way out. The central issue is that, for many and various  reasons, Europe is faced with a massive 17 million unemployed  (who cannot be seen as occasionally or temporarily jobless), a  situation which is not showing any significant signs of abating  naturally.    There are those who will say that unemployment is the price  to pay for increased productivity, technological innovation, and  the corresponding replacement of men by machinery. In fact,  there are many examples of this; assessments of the French  chemical industry, for instance, reveal that whereas production  rose by 51 percent between 1980 and 1992, employment fell by 12  percent. Studies at the company level confirm this trend, as  producers in various sectors (aluminum, glass, etc.) today need  40 to 50 percent of the workers they needed in 1981 to achieve  the same volume of production.    However, when it is acknowledged in the forward of the white  book itself, that in the last 20 years the European Union has  been losing ground to Japan and the United States in terms of  foreign market shares, research and development, and economic  growth, it would be expected that the problem of unemployment  would afflict the latter powers much more than the European  continent, which was apparently less actively engaged in the  productivity race.    Hence it is strange that, in the European Union, the  unemployed represent 11 percent of the active civilian  population (unemployment has risen regularly since the beginning  of the 1970's, except for the period between 1986 and 1990),  whereas the jobless rate has not gone beyond 7 percent in the  United States and is barely 2.5 percent in Japan. Thus there  seems to be no doubt that, for all that unemployment is a world  problem, it must be admitted that it has a specifically European  mien and salience.    And it is precisely in the specifically European proposals  intended to point toward a solution to the problem that the  dearth of ideas becomes dramatic, particularly when it is argued  that the European Union cannot be seen as a merely economic  project, but is, above all, a political project with determined  social goals and a humanistic conception of the rights and  guarantees of the workers.    Thus the response to an issue of this dimension and with  this  degree of political and social risk must necessarily call for  deeper and more radical thinking than the mere reiteration, by  the officials of the Commission and their advisors, that the key  to the problem will be in the introduction of some modifications  to the system of education and professional training, the  strengthening of the social dialogue, the stimulation of  competition within the single market, the creation of a  trans-European communications network, the encouragement of  research and development, and the vitalization of activities in  support of the aged, children, etc. There is nothing radically  new in these proposals, nothing that has not been said and tried  in the past, nor can one hope for results that will be powerful  enough to check or reverse the hemorrhage.    In fact, the European Union seems more and more to be  approaching relative isolation from the outside and real world,  making decisions based on documents of an academic tone,  prepared more to respond belatedly to requests for reports than  to come up with serious solutions to the real problems (it is  seen how Europe moved toward the single market, with political  decisions based merely on estimates of the corresponding  positive impact on some economic variables, and how, when such  estimates were not confirmed, it simply undertook further  studies on how to relaunch employment and competition...).    Since the degree of exaction is relatively limited, who  better than the Community officials, assisted by their advisers,  to justify "a priori" the merit of certain hypotheses and to  find "a posteriori" reasons for their failure? Meanwhile, they  are always putting forward lines of thinking whose utility is  closely linked to the criteria for the management of the  structural funds, which are the true sources of power and  influence.    Thus Europe is closing up, becoming artificial and  bureaucratized, managed by civil servants and supported by  funds. And, dangerously, the entire social structure is  beginning to fall under the influence of this way of life.    An article appearing recently in NEWSWEEK notes that, since  1990, the European Union--which has one-third again as many  inhabitants as the United States--has generated only 20 percent  as many jobs as the United States (8 million jobs, as against 41  million jobs); perhaps even more telling is the fact that  between 1970 and 1991, the United States created six new jobs in  the private sector for each new job in the public sector,  whereas the European Union only created less than two new public  jobs for each new job in the private sector! [as published]    And this may be the greatest risk hanging over Europe. In  this rut, the citizens of Europe, lulled by bureaucrats and  supported by funds, increasingly aspire to a peaceful spot in  the protective shade of the bureaucracy and have distanced  themselves more and more from any ambition to create competitive  and dynamic enterprises. It might be more worthwhile to promote  deep and straightforward reflection regarding issues of this  kind than to engage in discussions that are only seemingly  broad, considering that the documents under discussion are  themselves grievously limited.</p>

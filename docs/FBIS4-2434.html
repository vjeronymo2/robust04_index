			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Healy in London and Danny Gittings] </F>   [Text] The influential House of Commons Foreign Affairs  Committee will this week publish its long-awaited report,  expected to set the agenda for Britain's relations with Beijing  in the final years before 1997.    A new deal on nationality rights for Hong Kong's ethnic  minorities, strong criticism of China's human rights violations,  and full backing for Governor Chris Patten's political reforms  are among its findings. The report -- which Mr. Patten has  already predicted will mark an "important milestone" on the road  to 1997 -- is the outcome of a nine-month high-profile probe  into relations with China and their effect on Hong Kong.    It is being kept under tight wraps ahead of publication on  Wednesday, with members warned any premature disclosure would  amount to contempt of Parliament. But a close committee source  has revealed it will urge the British Government to act to  protect the position of the 7,000 members of non-Chinese ethnic  minorities living in the territory, who run the risk of becoming  stateless after 1997, by giving them either British passports or  other nationality rights.    The report will also issue a tough warning about the  concerns  Hong Kong people and the British Government feel over Beijing's  poor human rights record. However a source stressed this was  not meant to be seen as "anti-Chinese".    The main focus will be to support Mr. Patten's handling of  the constitutional reform issue, and reject criticisms by former  foreign affairs adviser Sir Percy Cradock in his evidence to the  committee. Some committee members had earlier expressed doubts  about the Governor's failure to visit Beijing before announcing  his October 1992 political reform proposals. But the committee  has now united behind Mr. Patten and the report, written by  chairman David Howell, a former Conservative minister, will be  unanimous.    It also contains a call for the Government to grant British  nationality rights to Hong Kong's 25 war widows -- a request  that has now been overtaken by events with Whitehall already  agreeing to grant them right of entry to Britain.    Mr. Patten said on his return to Hong Kong last night the  campaign for right of abode for the ethnic minorities -- which  will be boosted by this week's report -- had continued during  his visit to London, where he raised the issue with British  officials.    The document seems certain to receive a much warmer  reception  in Hong Kong than the last, which appeared shortly after the  June 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and was widely criticised locally  for rejecting the right of abode in Britain for Hong Kong people.    The committee's current inquiry into Hong Kong has also been  controversial, dominated by a war of words between Mr. Patten  and Sir Percy over the Governor's policies. The Chinese  Ambassador to London, Ma Yuzhen, also tried -- and failed -- to  influence the report, with a letter warning that Beijing was  serious about dismantling the three-tier political structure in  1997.    Meanwhile Mr. Patten revealed last night that he had held a  private meeting with former prime minister Lady Thatcher, during  his nine-day visit to London. "I had an interesting meeting  with Lady Thatcher, with whom I've been in regular contact over  the last couple of years," he said.</p>

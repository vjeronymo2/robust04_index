			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / People: Yorkshire Building Society Peter Courtney, 60, who two years ago took early retirement from Boots where he had been group finance director, becomes non-executive chairman of Yorkshire Building Society, Britain's 12th largest society. He succeeds Denis Macnaught, the former chief executive between 1975 and 1987, who is now stepping down from the board at the age of 66. 'Macnaught is a retiring Scottish accountant; Courtney is also a chartered accountant but a very different personality,' says a Yorkshire Building Society spokesman, who adds that 'no deliberate change of style is being sought'. Courtney, who has been on the society's board since he left Boots, is also a director of Throgmorton Trust and Hays.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pepe Leira] </F>   [Text] Montevideo, 5 May (EFE) -- In Uruguay salary demands  are leading to ever-increasing labor unrest, with indefinite  strikes and the occupation of schools paralyzing public services  and overshadowing the election campaign.    The third democratic Uruguayan Government to be chosen  following the 12 years of the military regime (1973-1985) will  be elected in this vote, which is scheduled for 29 November.    The conflictive situation has placed Luis Alberto Lacalle's  government in a difficult position, due to a constitutional  clause that prevents the party in power from using demagogic  methods, and so does not permit salary increases for public  employees during an election year.    The clause, which is traditionally respected by the  government in power and by the labor unions, places obstacles in  the way of any type of negotiation, and polarizes the sectors  that are in conflict.    The problems originated with the settling of increases that  had been approved last year, and their updating every four  months based on the rate of devaluation and inflation.    The government has exerted strict financial control in order  to maintain a fiscal balance, which seems to be far from what  the public employees from some sectors, especially the judicial  branch and the University of the Republic, expected.    The stoppages have increased, and the judicial branch has  not  functioned properly since it reopened after the yearly January  vacation closure.    The employees are working "as a rule" no more than two hours  daily, with continuous stoppages in order to participate in  meetings.    A meeting has been called for today, and the employees may  decide to call an indefinite strike "in view of the  insensitivity of the Lacalle administration in not wishing to  grant resources to the judicial branch to pay improved  salaries," it was stressed.    In the university sector, seven colleges have been occupied  for a week after professors, students, and officials called for  an indefinite strike.    The government refuses to hand over fresh resources to the  university, and has asked it to reduce expenditures, or at least  make the students who can pay tuition fees, as has been  authorized, and take deductions from wages for the days  employees have been on strike.    The autonomous authorities of the university refuse to give  up the traditional "free tuition" for higher learning.    The strike is also affecting Montevideo's main hospital,  which belongs to the university, and scientific research  institutes.    The conflicts have intensified as the political activities  heat up in the search for votes in the national and municipal  elections scheduled for November 1994.    The last two remaining ministers from the opposition  Colorado  Party left the cabinet on 5 May in order to participate in the  election campaign: Industry Minister Eduardo Ache and Tourism  Minister Jose Villar, who were replaced by Miguel Galeano and  Mario Amestoy of the National Party (Blanco), which is currently  in power.    Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle thanked a sector of  the Colorado Party for its cooperation and "patriotism" in the  government coalition, which was forged on 1 March 1990, but  which slowly eroded after the resignations of two of the four  opposition ministers in less than two years.    The opposition has begun to attack the government, accusing  Lacalle of having started the election campaign early with tours  in the interior of the country in an attempt to improve the  government's image.    Lacalle's National Party is, for the first time in history,  in third place in the polls, behind the Colorado Party and the  leftist coalition Broad Front.    The president defends himself in stressing that his  government has always been close to the people, and that he has  taken on only those tasks that he promised to before becoming  president.</p>

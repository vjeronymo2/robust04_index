			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Rail companies to pay Pounds 2.2bn for track use The private rail companies which take over the British Rail passenger operations from next year can expect to pay about Pounds 2.2bn a year in charges for the right to run their trains on the national rail network, the government announced yesterday. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said these charges were 50 per cent higher than the sums which BR charged in its own accounts, although BR did not take into account items such as depreciation and a reasonable rate of return. The figures have been calculated on the assumption that Railtrack, the company which will own and maintain rail track and signalling, will make a 5.6 per cent return on its assets, which have been valued at Pounds 6.5bn. The Treasury requires the rate of return to rise to 8 per cent within four years. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, said this return would be achieved by improved efficiency and not by higher fares. He added that higher track charges would not lead to any increase in fares, reduction in services or the level of investment, currently Pounds 400m to Pounds 500m a year, because they would be compensated for by an increase in the public subsidy paid to the railway operators. The subsidy will rise from Pounds 930m to Pounds 1.6bn. This would not lead to any increase in the external financing limit of Pounds 1.26bn, Mr MacGregor said. Increased corporation tax payments from Railtrack and BR and repayments of government loans are to balance out the higher payments. The level of track charges is a crucial element in the calculation that potential bidders for rail franchises will make when assessing whether to make a bid and the level of their bids. Mr MacGregor said in answer to a parliamentary question: 'The new arrangements establish for the first time the real cost of providing railway infrastructure. Charges will be set in a transparent and commercially realistic manner.' But Labour yesterday warned that some services could be cut. Mr Brian Wilson, opposition transport spokesman, said: 'What is the point of massively hiking the track charges if the only result is that subsidy has to be raised by a similar amount?' Previously track costs could not be clearly identified from BR's accounts. A precise calculation of costs based on the use of stations and electricity and wear and tear of different services has made detailed figures possible. Refinements in the figures will be made in the coming months, taking into account possible changes in the levels of service provided by private rail operators.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Track charges to rail operating companies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          poundsm                               poundsm                           1994/5                                1994/5                           prices                                prices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- East coast                   169   Tilbury and Southend             39 West Coast                   171   SouthEast                       177 Cross Country                104   South Central                   107 Midland Mainline              44   Thameslink                       43 Great Western                120   South Western                   168 Anglia                        28   ScotRail                        175 Gatwick Express                8   Northeast                       159 Thames                        36   Northwest                       120 Chiltern                      23   Merseyrail                       38 Northampton/N London          55   Central                         134 West Anglia/                       South Wales &amp; West               51 Great Northern               125   Cardiff Valleys                  22 Great Eastern                 67   Total                         2,183  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

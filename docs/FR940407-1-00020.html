			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November 15, 1990, and annually thereafter. The EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to the EPA through the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: certification of data accuracy, source identification information, operating schedule, emissions information (to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions), control equipment information, and process data. The EPA developed emission statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide the EPA with a status report that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should report quarterly to the EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncorrected for rule-effectiveness. States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent in submitting their emission statement and that emit 500 tons per year (TPY) or more of VOC or 2500 TPY or more of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year. Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement program will become a part. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 110(l) similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAAA must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, under section 110(k)(1)(B), a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by the EPA six months after receipt of the submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State passed an emergency regulation after following all applicable State Administrative Procedures Act requirements for submittal to the EPA by November 15, 1992, to satisfy CAA requirements. The State subsequently entered into State rulemaking for a permanent regulation. It was submitted to public hearing on December 30, 1992. The State addressed public comments and made minor adjustments. Following the public hearing, the final rule was adopted by the State and submitted to the EPA as a proposed revision to the SIP on March 3, 1993. The permanent emission statement regulations were then codified at LAC 33:III.919.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March 3, 1993, SIP revision was reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated August 3, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. The provisions of the regulation are outlined under the analysis of the State's submission below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

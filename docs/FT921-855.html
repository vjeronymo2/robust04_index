			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Amsterdam may not act on car ballot AMSTERDAM'S citizens showed so little enthusiasm for Wednesday's non-binding referendum on the future of car traffic in their city centre that the authorities may not act on the slim majority of the ballot. Just under 27 per cent of the 600,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum, the first in the city's history. Of these, 52.9 per cent favoured halving inner-city parking spaces and other measures to cut car traffic 60 per cent by the end of the 1990s. The referendum gave residents the choice between existing policies, which aim to achieve a more gradual decline in car traffic, and a more radical plan virtually to ban most cars from the canal-lined city centre. Amsterdam's city politicians say they will consider the views of those who voted but the limited response has reduced pressure on them to ban cars immediately. The council decided to hold the referendum as a way of reversing the widespread apathy seen in the 1990 municipal elections.</p>

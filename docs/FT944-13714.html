			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Johnson &amp; Johnson in rare appearance with Dollars 400m offer Johnson &amp; Johnson made a rare appearance in the euromarkets yesterday with a Dollars 400m unusual two-tranche deal. The offering, which received praise from other houses, was split into two Dollars 200m parts. There was a 7 3/8 per cent coupon, three-year maturity tranche aimed at retail investors and an 8 1/4 per cent coupon, 10-year maturity tranche targeted at institutional customers. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the three-year tranche met very strong demand and the spread tightened from 15 at issue to around 14 when the bonds were free to trade. Spreads on the 10-year tranche stayed around 34 to 32 compared with the 33 at issue, said Morgan. The rest of the dollar sector was dominated by deals from Paribas Capital Markets, which brought three dollar issues for different borrowers, each for Dollars 200m and in various short-dated maturities. Citic Pacific Finance made an offering guaranteed by Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Citic, the Beijing foreign investment company. Paribas Capital Markets and HSBC were selected as joint books on its debut eurobond, a three-year Dollars 200m floating-rate note issue at 50 basis points over six-month Libor. There was general agreement in the market that Paribas had been selected for its European base and HSBC for its Asian links. Electricite de France brought a Dollars 200m two-year deal with a 7 per cent coupon via Paribas, which said the issue had met strong demand in Europe from investors attracted by the rare appearance of this strong name. Paribas led a four-year Dollars 200m offering with a 7 1/2 per cent coupon from SNCF, the AAA rated French railway operator. Paribas fed this into unsatisfied demand for the Rabobank deal at the same maturity on Monday and met good demand, much of it from Germany. The day also saw two L150bn two-year deals with 11 per cent coupons launched within an hour of each other, the first when Aa1 rated Norddeutsche Landesbank made its lira euromarket debut via BNL and the other from AAA rated Bayerische Vereinsbank via Credito Italiano. Credito Italiano said the lira market went down after the Norddeutsche deal and the Bayerische deal was launched into a tougher market. The European Investment Bank brought a Pta20bn, four-year deal with a 10.9 per cent coupon via Banco Santander, with UBS as joint lead. This was the first move into the primary peseta market by UBS, which recently upgraded its Madrid office to a full branch.</p>

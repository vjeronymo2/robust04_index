			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / German output continues to fall GERMANY'S industrial slump is continuing unabated, despite signs of a modest improvement in output during January. Output is falling by an average 2.5 per cent each month and the construction industry is now the only sector showing any growth, according to figures published by the Economics Ministry yesterday. Meanwhile, steel output has plunged and details of incoming orders in the engineering business showed further falls in domestic and foreign demand. Total industrial output in January was 3 per cent higher than in December despite widespread short-time working in the automotive industry, according to the Economics Ministry. The apparent recovery followed a 3 per cent month-on-month fall in December (corrected from 2 per cent), when most of industry took extended Christmas breaks. A comparison of production in December and January together with the same period a year earlier showed total output had fallen 6.8 per cent: manufacturing was down 7.7 per cent. Within this figure, production of capital goods slumped almost 11 per cent, while construction rose 2.5 per cent. New figures from the VDMA engineering and plant makers association showed new orders in January were 18 per cent lower than a year earlier. Domestic demand fell 24 per cent and new foreign contracts were down 11 per cent. This sector, second only to the motor industry as an export earner, has now recorded falling orders for almost a year with only slight signs of improvement from overseas markets more than cancelled out by diving domestic demand. In the three months to the end of January total orders were 13 per cent lower than the comparable period 12 months earlier. The knock-on effects of this downturn, cuts in the motor industry and the international steel crisis are now wholly apparent in the steel sector, where January output of steel and rolled finished products was 25 per cent and 15 per cent lower than in January 1991. Other government statistics due out later this week are expected to show further sharp increases in unemployment and falling orders across the whole of manufacturing industry.</p>

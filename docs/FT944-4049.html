			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Essen summit agrees on plan to help EU compete European Union leaders reached a broad consensus yesterday on measures to strengthen competitiveness and job creation at a summit overshadowed by the failure to stop the war in Bosnia. With the host, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, nudging colleagues toward areas of co-operation, the summit rallied behind proposals for a new advisory board on European competitiveness, likely to be headed by a European business leader. The focus of the two-day summit in Essen is the German-led strategy for integrating the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe, but the opening sessions were devoted to talks on how to compete more effectively with the US and Japan. Taking their lead from Chancellor Kohl's pledge to 'move the European Union forward', summit leaders avoided earlier ideological clashes over deregulation and labour market mobility. Instead, they balanced pledges to lift burdens on industry with a commitment to training and action to help the long-term unemployed. Senior diplomats said the 'steady as she goes' mood suited leaders, several of whom are beset by health or political problems. They include President Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Mr John Major of the UK and Mr Albert Reynolds of Ireland, who is leaving office. The idea for an advisory council on competitiveness was put forward by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission. Mr Delors cut a serene figure at this 28th European Council summit, despite a flurry of speculation that he will disclose tomorrow night whether he will enter the race for the French presidency. Mr Major warmly praised Mr Delors and supported the Commission's suggestion of an annual report on member states' progress in tackling unemployment in Europe, which stands at around 18m. The mood of harmony grew as leaders backed an Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) aid package for Northern Ireland to encourage the peace process. Chancellor Kohl also sought a meeting with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, to defuse Spanish threats to block the entry of Austria, Sweden and Finland into the Union next year unless it improves its fishing rights. Germany also backed Franco-Spanish demands to establish parallel funding for eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries, despite reservations by the UK and the Netherlands. The discordant note came over Bosnia, with Britain and France warning that pulling out United Nations peacekeeping troops could lead to a massacre and a wider war in the Balkans. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark want the summit to restate strongly a commitment to keep troops in the region. Britain and France assured their partners that they would seek to stay as long as possible. Summit reports, Page 2</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rolly Alano] </F>   [Text] Fort Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal -- New People's Army  (NPA) rebel stragglers are intensifying terroristic acts against  civilians as part of a last ditch propaganda campaign to show a  still active presence of a rebel movement now in its dying  throes, military authorities said yesterday.    Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, Army 2d Infantry Division  commanding general, said that last week alone, small teams of  communist guerrilla terrorists attacked several groups of  civilians in mountain barangays [villages] in three provinces.    In Barangay Casay, Lupi, Camarines Sur, last 24 March,  rebels  fired a grenade from an M-203 launcher at a "pulong-pulong  [gathering]" of residents who were planning a livelihood project  in cooperation with the military. A barangay captain, a woman  and her seven-year-old son were wounded during the attack while  scores of other residents were injured in the stampede for  safety.    In a resettlement area in Barangay Caldon, Sampaloc, Quezon,  three suspected NPA rebels sprayed another gathering of  civilians, wounding a resident identified only as a certain  "Boy" of the barangay last 20 March.    Last 25 March, at Barangay Salipsip, Polilio, Quezon, rebels  fired on a house during a heavy rainfall.    Elements of the 236 PNP [Philippine National Police] Mobile  Force who had taken cover from the rain in the house fired back  at the rebels and a firefight that lasted for about 30 minutes  ensued.    Residents said that three dead rebels were carried away by  their companions when they escaped and policemen recovered from  the encounter scene one M16 Armalite rifle.</p>

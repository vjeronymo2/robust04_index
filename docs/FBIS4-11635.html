			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad: "The Significance of </F> Washington's Reservations on Resolution 904"]    [Excerpts] The stand taken by Madeleine Albright, U.S.  delegate to the UN, on UN Security Council [UNSC] Resolution  904, which was passed on Friday and which condemns the Hebron  massacre, is worthy of our attention for more than one reason.  The United States abstained on two points: The definition of  the occupied territories as Palestinian (paragraph 2) and the  statement that these territories include part of Jerusalem  (paragraph 6). Washington's argument is that these territories  are still subject to negotiations and consequently, they cannot  be considered as Palestinian before the negotiations are over.  This is because the negotiations may result in giving them to  Israel.    Washington's position deserves deep thought because it sheds  light on developments that have escaped our attention regarding  what is being planned for the future final resolution of the  Palestinian issue. Washington's position implies that  everything on which there is no agreement between the  Palestinians and Israelis must be left open regardless of the  existing Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 242,  which is the basis of negotiations. The preamble of Resolution  242 notes the "inadmissibility of seizing others' territories by  force." Since Israel is occupying the land, this means that the  United States, a cosponsor of the negotiation process, accepts  the Israeli interpretation on any issue where there is no  Palestinian-Israeli agreement, even if this is contrary to the  opinion of the entire world community and the other Security  Council members. Based on this logic, the Israeli settlements  in the Palestinian territories are not necessarily illegal and  thus they do not necessarily need to be removed. Therefore,  their presence is not necessarily against the law. [passage  omitted]    The fact is that it would have been difficult for the  Clinton  Administration to accept Israel's position that Jerusalem is the  unified and eternal capital of Israel had it acknowledged that  all the occupied territories in Palestine are Palestinian,  because East Jerusalem is occupied land and is in fact  Palestinian. Hence, it is clear that Washington's positions on  the Palestinian territories and even Clinton's recent remarks on  Jerusalem were not just a slip, but have a basis and are  consistent. The United States, like Israel, proceeds from the  premise that the occupied territories must not be organically  linked to the Palestinians and that their status must remain  "open." This is because to acknowledge in advance that the land  is Palestinian implies questioning the legitimacy of Israel's  existence in the first place and that Israel is a lawful state  (etat de droit) [preceding words in French as published]. Thus,  in order for the Hebrew state to have irreversible legitimacy it  is necessary from the start not to acknowledge that the  territory of Palestine has a primarily Palestinian-Arab identity.    The U.S. position on Resolution 904 shows the kind of  argument that Israel is expected to use in the final stage of  negotiations. The prevailing thought is that the Gaza-Jericho  First formula is the first stage of a Palestinian entity that is  ultimately expected to include most, if not all, of the  Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. It is true that  Israel has always emphasized that it will not change its stand  that Jerusalem is its eternal capital. It is also true that it  has continued to build settlements relentlessly. But the  parties' continued commitment to Resolution 242 was construed to  mean that "exchanging land for peace" could apply in the end to  all fronts, including the Palestinian front.    But the U.S. vote on Resolution 904 now shows that this  premise may not be true and that the "interim period", scheduled  to last for five years at least, is meant to delay a decision on  the Palestinian issue until the other aspects of the conflict  are settled. The purpose of this is to separate the Palestinian  issue from the other fronts so that Israel can impose its views  in full.    The question we need to ask in this regard is: Why is the  United States standing firmly against the intervention of the UN  and the world community in the administration of the occupied  Arab territories even after the occurrence of such appalling  crimes as the Hebron massacre? In the meantime, the United  States has just as firmly backed intervention in other tense  conflicts such as Somalia, Bosnia, etc. Why presume from the  start that Israel's "right" to administer the occupied  territories until it gets a peace formula it considers  acceptable is an "absolute" right?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Armed villagers attacked soldiers near Burundi's  capital, Bujumbura, and four people were killed when a grenade  was thrown into a crowded cafe in the city. Reports said men  armed with automatic weapons attacked the Army post in Kaidi at  Nyambuye, 20 km from Bujumbura. Diplomats said the attackers  had not been identified and the motives were unclear. The  government had recently been conducting searches for illegal  weapons, apparently fearing attacks on government forces. They  had no information of casualties in the attack and official  sources in Bujumbura declined to comment.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALABAMA;  </P> <P> BLACK CLASS BOYCOTT SUSPENDED FOR TESTS  </P> <P> Civil rights activists in Selma, Ala., suspended a classroom boycott by black  students until Jan. 16, after final exams, and announced plans to sue the  majority white board that ousted the city's first black school superintendent.  </P> <P> One picket was arrested on the second day of the boycott, and the absentee rate  dropped from 25% to 15%. Protest leader Hank Sanders said he would file suit  challenging the act creating Selma's school board. Supt. Norward Roussell's  contract was not renewed after an evaluation by board members accused him of  being dictatorial and intimidating teachers. Roussell has called the evaluation  unfair but opposes the boycott.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Skalkova: "Signing the Ingolstadt Agreement </F> Signals the Beginning of Construction of the Pipeline on the  German Side"]    [Text] Oil could begin flowing into Bohemia from the  West in the fall of 1995; the site of the tank farm will become  the property of the Czech Republic.    The festive groundbreaking at the tank farm in the refinery  at Vohburg in the suburbs of Ingolstadt, from where a  170-km-long oil pipeline will start on the German side,  yesterday signaled the actual first stage of work on the  movement of oil from Germany to the Czech Republic. The  groundbreaking immediately preceded the signing of a  Bavarian-Czech agreement on the takeover and sharing of  guarantees for so-called uninsurable damages, an agreement which  was the culmination of virtually six months of work by experts  on both sides to obtain the approval of the Bavarian parliament  regarding the approach to the right-of-way through which the  pipeline will pass. With a view to the interests of Bavarian  landowners, the Munich Government is assuming guarantees for any  damages that could occur, for example, as a consequence of  natural catastrophes or because of the halting of pipeline  operations. The Czech side would compensate such claims with an  amount of 80 million German marks [DM], taken from resources of  the National Property Fund which it deposited with the Czech  National Bank.    For the Bavarian side, the agreement was initialed by  Michael  Schneider, chief of the Office of the Ministry of Economics and  Transportation; for the Czech side, by Tomas Jezek, chairman of  the National Property Fund, Jan Princ, first deputy chairman of  the National Property Fund, and Karel Siedler, director general  of the corporation for the construction operation of the  pipeline from Ingolstadt, Mero CR, corporation.    Part of the signing also involved a proposal for a letter to  be exchanged by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus with his Bavarian  counterpart, Edmund Stoiber, according to which the Czech  Republic would pledge to fulfill all its commitments, even after  the possible demise of the National Property Fund or the Mero  firm.    Radomir Sabela, Czech Republic deputy minister of industry  and commerce, who also participated in the signing ceremony,  call yesterday's action an important step toward the  independence of the Czech petrochemical industry from Russian  oil. According to the deputy minister, the Munich parliament  should adopt a law on the pipeline construction and on the  possibilities of temporary access to land parcels of property  owners who were resisting the project, at the latest by 20 May.  T. Jezek several times emphasized the forthcoming nature of the  Bavarian side in that connection.    Together with representatives of Czech diplomatic circles in  Bonn, Jezek expressed his conviction that the German side would  issue the building permit to initiate construction of the  pipeline portion in the fall. According to the view expressed by  a high-ranking official of the Bavarian Ministry of Labor,  Reinhard Schug, whose ministry grants such permits, Munich is  not planning to take the step until November or December. Even  so, the need not be a threat to the deadline for starting test  operations of the pipeline, which the Czech side optimistically  is counting on for September of next year. More realistically,  operations could begin by the end of 1995. The tank farm site,  construction of which began as of yesterday, thanks to the  preliminary permit issued by the Bavarian Government, is located  on 6.5 hectares of land which should soon become the property of  the Czech Republic. It will even house a repumping station for  oil fed in from Trieste.</p>

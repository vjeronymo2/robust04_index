			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal up 9% Bank of Montreal opened the second-quarter reporting season of Canada's 'big six' banks by posting a 9 per cent rise in earnings. The improvement was attributed largely to higher volumes and a drop in loan-loss provisions. However, it was partly offset by slimmer margins, especially in money market operations, and a 6 per cent rise in non-interest expenses. Net income grew to CDollars 188m (USDollars 136.2m), or 69 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, from CDollars 173m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Loan-loss provisions fell to CDollars 157m from CDollars 163m.</p>

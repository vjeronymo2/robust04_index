			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Study urges review of accounting requirements LISTED and unlisted companies in Europe should be subject to different accounting requirements, an analysis from the Federation of European Accountants suggests. 'Profound' differences in accounting policies exist as much between listed and unlisted companies as they do between different European countries, it concludes. The survey also provides a hint that companies can expect the European Commission to pay greater attention to the treatment of intangible assets and lease contracts in the coming months. Writing in a preface, Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, EC commissioner for financial institutions and company law, said the EC-sponsored Accounting Advisory Forum will be considering these two issues. The 1992 survey of published accounts from Federation des Experts Comptables Europeens (FEE)which represents accountancy bodies across Europe, is based on a study of the accounts of 441 small and medium-sized companies in 11 EC countries, and four EFTA countries. Companies traded on secondary markets are treated as unlisted. It found that listed companies are more likely to provide information than unlisted companies, although they offer less on off-balance sheet financing. Different practices between the two categories were most pronounced in topics such as availability of financial statements, provision of additional statements, changes in valuation policies, off-balance sheet information and use of current values. The study found listed companies tend to change accounting policies more frequently, but they are no more likely to use accounting policies which flatter profits than unlisted companies. It recommends greater accounting guidance on the treatment of long-term contracts. 1992 FEE analysis of European accounting and disclosure practices. Routledge. Pounds 60</p>

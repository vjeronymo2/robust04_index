			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA THEATER  </P> <P> Your article (Sept. 5) on the demolition of the California Theater quotes me as  saying, "It should come down."  </P> <P> I did not say that and did not imply that. For two years my organization, the  Los Angeles Conservancy, has led the fight to prevent the demolition of that  theater. We stopped the demolition in the autumn of 1988. We worked for more  than a year in seeking tenants for the building. Though we lost this particular  fight, we remain unalterably opposed to the destruction of historic buildings  of such significance, and would never advocate the demolition of the California  Theater.  </P> <P> JAY ROUNDS, Executive Director  </P> <P> Los Angeles Conservancy  </P></p>

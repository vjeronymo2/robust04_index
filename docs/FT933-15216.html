			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Australian TV network unveils float prospectus DIRECTORS of Seven Network, the Australian television operator sent into receivership in 1989, yesterday released details of a fully-underwritten public flotation to raise ADollars 611m (USDollars 427.3m). The company will issue just over 300m shares, at ADollars 2 each, and raise another ADollars 125m in debt. Proceeds will be applied to repayment of just over ADollars 700m worth of loans owed to a banking syndicate which restructured the company in 1991. The Seven Network prospectus confirmed that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Australian media group, and Telecom, the Australian phone company, would subscribe for 15 and 10 per cent respectively of the company's shares. Seven indicated yesterday that the company's earnings before interest and tax had fallen markedly for the year ended June, 1993, reflecting high costs associated with televising the Barcelona Olympic games. The prospectus shows earnings before interest and tax falling from ADollars 70.9m to ADollars 56.1m for last year, but forecasts a recovery to ADollars 85.4m in the current year. That compares with just ADollars 10.6m in 1990. Analysts suggested yesterday that the Seven flotation could benefit from unsatisfied demand for the share issue by Woolworths, the Australian retailer. Woolworths subscriptions, due to close today, are believed to be running at more than twice the ADollars 2.45bn sought.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Suitable subjects for reform - A small, international force would help extend the United Nations' peace-enforcement role The new United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt, is taking over an organisation which has recently seen a great boost to its authority and prestige, but which still has a long way to go to attain its founders' ambitious goals. The difficult task the world's top civil servant faces is to capitalise on the UN's new scope for action resulting from the end of the Cold War, by extending its role as a peace-maker and peace-keeper to the civil and ethnic conflicts which are likely to dominate the world scene until the turn of the century. If, for the greater part of its 46-year life, the UN has had more detractors than admirers, superpower rivalry must take much of the blame. Though member nations never ceased to pay lip-service during the Cold War years to the UN's idealistic objectives, the maintenance of international peace and security, the organisation became little more than a forum for confrontation between the great powers. The ending of the Cold War changed all that. The new spirit of co-operation between the US and the former Soviet Union was exemplified by the Security Council's endorsement of the US-led military operation against Iraq, one of the most effective joint actions in the UN's history. But with the break-up of the Soviet Union into several independent republics, the cosy new relationship built up between Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union and the west risks being transformed once again. Russia, it has been agreed, will take over the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat. Plainly, it will not, given its present state of economic chaos and the prospect of more political upheavals, want to cross the US and its western allies or play too active a role on the international stage for some years. That might be seen as a benefit by some western governments. But Russia's very weakness, and the risk that growing internal social and economic tensions could lead to further violent upheavals in the states of the former Soviet Union, is posing an entirely new problem for the UN. Instead of a balance of power, the international organisation is now likely to suffer from an imbalance of power. The checks and balances within the Security Council which existed even during the declining years of the Soviet Union, could disappear altogether, leading to what even Washington's friends might consider an unduly dominant position for the US. That is an unhealthy situation in the longer term and it raises a question which most members of the Security Council, the permanent five in particular, have been unwilling to answer: has the moment arrived to increase the permanent membership of the council? That two of the world's leading economic powers, Germany and Japan, the world's second most populous state, India, and South America's leading nation, Brazil, should continue to be excluded from the UN's core institution is an anachronism which takes no account of international developments since the Second World War. Neither membership of the nuclear club nor being one of the Second World War victors should continue to be the main criterion for permanent Security Council membership at a time when economic factors arguably play a much greater role than military power in preserving or undermining international security. No doubt, any suggestion that the number of permanent Security Council members should be increased would open a Pandora's box of problems. If Brazil, why not Nigeria? If Germany, why not Italy? Should the European Community be given a permanent seat instead of the separate seats held by Britain and France? All these and many other questions are as valid as they are complex. But the difficulty of finding solutions cannot be a permanent pretext for failing to tackle a problem which is fundamental to the organisation's credibility. If the composition of the Security Council is a suitable subject for reform, a revision of the limitations the UN has hitherto set on the kind of military actions it can undertake is also required to meet entirely new situations. The break-up of previously unified states such as Yugoslavia in an atmosphere of civil strife and bloodshed often has much wider than purely domestic implications. Because of regional ethnic dimensions it could set alight much of the Balkans, and therefore clearly comes under the heading of a situation that could threaten international peace and security. So far, the UN has restricted itself to two kinds of military actions. The first are peace-keeping operations, strictly circumscribed by a number of criteria under which UN forces can be deployed only with the consent of all parties, after a ceasefire is in place, and on condition that their arms are used only in self-defence. The other main military option open to member countries is the kind of large-scale operation which can be authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, such as the one undertaken to counter North Korea's attack on South Korea in 1950 and to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1991. In both cases an ad hoc multilateral force was assembled under US command. Yet in spite of his official designation as commander of UN forces in Korea, US General Douglas MacArthur never reported directly to the Security Council and the US decision to cross the 38th parallel dividing North and South Korea did not receive the advance approval of the other Council members. In short, the Security Council had no control over the military operations undertaken on its behalf. In the case of the Gulf conflict, a UN joint command was not even formally established and it long remained unclear whether US war aims would lead American forces to take Baghdad in an attempt to overthrow President Saddam Hussein. This was certainly not an objective spelt out in any of the Security Council resolutions on the subject. A growing body of opinion considers that contemporary 'internal' conflicts such as the ones in Yugoslavia and Somalia and the earlier civil conflict in Liberia, require operations 'somewhere between peace-keeping and peace enforcement,' in the words of Sir Brian Urquhart, a former UN Under-Secretary-General. The big sledge-hammer used in the Gulf is clearly not appropriate for use in such circumstances. But a genuine alternative solution is offered by article 43 of the UN Charter, under which all members would undertake to make armed forces available to the Security Council by special agreements 'for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security'. Such a relatively small international force could be assembled quite quickly, since it would be made up of units previously earmarked by member states for contingencies of this kind. Placed under a UN commander directly responsible to the Security Council, it would be clearly identified with the UN from the start, instead of with the country providing the largest military contribution, as in the Gulf conflict. The imprimatur of impartiality given by a genuine UN force would be of great political advantage in a situation such as the one in Yugoslavia, where the respective factions are particularly prone to accuse outsiders of bias in favour of one ethnic nationality or another. Moreover, nobody else, certainly not the European Community or the US, is likely to do the job required in Yugoslavia. Mr Boutros Ghali and the member states should not miss the best opportunity that they have had for decades to put the UN's peace-keeping and peace-enforcement capacity on a permanent footing.</p>

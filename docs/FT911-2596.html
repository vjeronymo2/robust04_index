			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Democrats warned on banking reform MR Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, will this week attempt to save as much as possible of his comprehensive banking reform legislation after warning House Democratic leaders against pursuing their plan for a narrow bill excluding changes in the structure of the industry. Congressmen Henry Gonzalez and Frank Annunzio, Democratic chairmen of the House banking committee and a key sub-committee, have introduced legislation proposing recapitalising the financially strained bank insurance fund, new bank accounting standards and tighter supervision of problem banks. This would omit the Treasury's proposals for interstate branch banking and for allowing bank holding companies to become involved in a wide range of financial services. Mr Brady has described as 'the height of folly' the suggestion that any legislation this year should be restricted to recapitalising the fund. 'We should reform the industry and fix the problem, not just feed it and fund it.' The issue of the scope of banking legislation will come to a head in this week's talks aimed a producing a compromise. Mr Brady argues that a majority of the House banking committee, including the minority Republican caucus, joined by a number of Democrats, have expressed support for the need for comprehensive bank reform, in contrast to the views of their leaders. This view is also supported by all the banking regulators, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in spite of reservations on detailed features. Senate banking committee members are more sympathetic to Mr Brady's position and this summer are expected to pass legislation which will not only recapitalise the fund but will also reform deposit insurance and allow some extension of bank activities. There is plenty of time, Mr Brady argues, to consider comprehensive reform since the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said more resources will not be needed before October, and perhaps much later than that. The urgency of recapitalising the fund has been underlined by new estimates by the General Accounting Office that without quick action the fund will 'almost certainly be insolvent by next year.'</p>

Shortly before making his  address, Solana said that the final decision on air strikes on  Bosnian Serb positions is up to the military command of the UN  peacekeeping force on the ground in accordance with the legal  framework of the United Nations and NATO. Martin Garcia Vega  reports from the Congress of Deputies:    [Garcia Vega] Javier Solana said definitive conclusions  cannot be drawn from the statements made by the warring sides at  such a delicate time. He was speaking to journalists in the  lobby. The Spanish foreign minister prefers to look at the  positive aspects of some actions.    [Begin Solana recording] For the first time in a long while  we have a several day ceasefire holding in Sarajevo. This means  that Sarajevo, at the moment, is a city which is no longer  shelled. Therefore, there are no victims in Sarajevo. Something  like this has not happened in months. If only this has been  achieved, then perhaps all the efforts we have engaged, on the  diplomatic front over the past few weeks, have been worth it.  [end recording]    [Garcia Vega] Solana and Garcia Vargas are now addressing  the  Congress outlining the situation in the area.</p>

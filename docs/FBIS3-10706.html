After a three-hour discussion during which passions ran  high,  the Constituent Congress upheld the text that bans the head of  state from running for the presidency a second time. The  reelection of governors and mayors was also rejected.    The motion seeking to reduce -- to 90 days before the  elections -- the deadline for the president, governors, and  mayors to resign from office in order to run for another  government post was also voted down. The original  constitutional text, which provides for a six-month deadline  before the elections for government officials to resign their  posts to run for office, was thus passed without amendment.    Before adjourning, the Constituent Congress decided that the  other item included in the order of the day, namely the  amendment extending maternity leave for congresswomen, will be  voted on at the end of the week.    At 1000 local time today the Constituent Congress will vote  on political matters. The order of the day includes, among  other subjects, political affiliation, the voluntary vote, the  mixed district voting system, and parliamentary immunity.</p>

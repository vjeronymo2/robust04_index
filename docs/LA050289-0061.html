			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An Oakland woman was arraigned for allegedly letting two men sexually abuse her  6-year-old son for $20 apiece -- money police believe she used to buy cocaine.  Joanne Brooks, 26, a convicted prostitute who told police she has been using  cocaine for five years, was charged in Oakland Municipal Court with two counts  of procuring a child for lewd and lascivious acts. Brooks is alleged to have  allowed the men to commit oral copulation on the boy. Police said the boy, the  oldest of Brooks' three children, described the sex acts and told them he still  loves his mother "but she did wrong, and I won't forgive her." Brooks claimed  that her son was lying and that she would never do anything to harm him.  </P></p>

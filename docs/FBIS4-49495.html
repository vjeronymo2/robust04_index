			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top judge said  here today that China has basically completed the legal system  for the protection of intellectual property and other invisible  property.    Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, made  the remark at the opening ceremony of the Licensing Executives  Society (LES) International Conference '94, with businessmen,  jurists and scholars from some 30 countries and representatives  from international organizations in attendance.

The president said that China has finished the amendments to  the patent law and the trademark law, which have further  enlarged and strengthened the protection of patent and trademark  rights.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 21 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan  Government today proposed keeping the troops of the Sandinist  People's Army [EPS] only in the cities and roads in the northern  part of the country, in an attempt to negotiate with "recontra"  leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front the disarmament and  demobilization of that rebel organization.    This evening, the Government Ministry released a press note  reporting that it also agreed to "clean" El Zungano region of  any military presence. The rebels headed by Jose Angel  Talavera, also known as "Chacal," operate in that region.    According to official information, the EPS will only leave a  small unit in the Cautalu sector, another bastion of  approximately 400 former rearmed "contras," known as "recontras."    "Seven days after the opening of the (recontras')  reconcentration zone, the (eight-point) agenda will be discussed  in total. This agenda was presented by the Northern Front on 15  February," the note added.    These counterproposals by the government will be sent to  "Chacal" at an undetermined date through the OAS' International  Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) which,  together with representatives of the church, is serving as a  mediator in these negotiations.    In addition, the government will focus its efforts on social  development in the country's northern area with the support of  ministries and other state agencies and with the opening of an  interinstitutional office in Quilali, near the border with  Honduras.    A group of six from the 3-80 Northern Front's staff demanded  the incorporation of "recontra" chiefs to the Jinotega and Nueva  Segovia Police in order for them to disarm and demobilize. Other  (recontras) should be incorporated into the Quilali, Jicargo,  Murra, San Juan del Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma, Ciudad Antigua, la  Concordia, San Rafael del Norte, Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay Police.    They also asked for the creation of a development center  located in Quilali, the reconcentration of the EPS' troops, and  the maintenance of no more than 60 soldiers in those  municipalities, except in Murra.    Other rebels demands are the demilitarization of the  northern  part of the country -- once the 3-80 Northern Front's  disarmament progresses -- as well as benefit programs for the  wounded, widows, and orphans.    Additional rebels requests are the repair of rural roads in  the region, the creation of a special fund for the north's  economic reactivation, and legal status for the "3-80 Northern  Front" organization.    The first direct meeting between the government of Nicaragua  and "recontra' chiefs of the 3-80 Northern Front slated to be  held today, Monday, was put off for several days after the  rebels argued that "there was still strong Army presence in the  nation's northern regions."    The problem of the rearmed rebels arose in 1990 shortly  after  President Violeta Chamorro took office as several thousand of  the 22,000 former demobilized "contras," not happy with the  government, broke the agreement to turn over their weapons and  once again took up arms.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Where have all the young men gone? - US Masters / Why it would be good for golf if someone aged under 30 won at Augusta Is it me or are golfers getting older these days? Here, for instance, were the players favoured to win the US Masters: Greg Norman, Nick Price, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, Fuzzy Zoeller, and Nick Faldo. Not one is under the age of 35. Jose-Maria Olazabal was described on American television last week as having had a 'phenomenal career when you consider all that he has achieved and he's still only 28.' Heavens. Jack Nicklaus had won seven majors by the age of 28. Never mind winning seven. Never mind winning one. Olazabal has only been in contention to win on a couple of occasions. Johnny Miller has some interesting things to say on the subject. You remember Miller. He was the man who, 20 years ago, took scoring to another level. Before Miller, a 66 or a 67 would get you the lead in a tournament. If it was an easy course, someone would shoot 65. Miller shot 63. Not once or twice, but on many occasions. Miller even shot 63 at Oakmont, which is considered by many to be the toughest course on the US Open rota. 'I just don't understand what's going on,' he said. 'I've always believed, and it was certainly true in my case, that 27-30 were the best years for a golfer. That's when I shot the bulk of those scores. 'At 28, you stand over a 10ft putt and you know you're going to make it. At 35, you're still feeling pretty good and most of them go in. At 40, you just breath a huge sigh of relief when it disappears below ground.' That was then. Now, the only player in the top 12 in the world rankings who is under the age of 30 is Davis Love, and even he reaches that landmark age next week. The only players under the age of 25 in the top 50 are Ernie Els from South Africa and the American, Phil Mickelson. There is not one British player in that age group in the top 100. 'I think the Europeans must be wondering if anyone is ever going to come along to replace the Faldos and the Langers and the Seves,' said Miller. 'They are all around the age of 36 and without being disrespectful to the young guys, you just can't see a player on the horizon who is going to make the impact on the game that they have made in the last decade.' Tony Jacklin was 25 when he won the Open, and a year older when he won the US Open. He was burnt out at 35. So was Miller, and so was Watson. Raymond Floyd, 23 when he won the US PGA Championship, remains a contender almost 30 years on. Floyd said: 'I can't give you a direct answer as to why the players who are in their 20s are no longer winning majors, but l can tell you why the top professionals are having longer careers these days. 'The overriding factor is the way technology has improved both the golf club and the golf ball. I'm obviously nowhere near as strong or as agile as I was when I was 25, but I hit the ball, if anything, further than I did then because the equipment is now so much better.' There are other explanations. Diet, for one thing. The pros have joined the health beat. They eat bananas instead of burgers. They drink Gatorade rather than Glenfiddich. Said Miller: 'There was certainly a lot more nightlife when I was on tour. The players are much more family-orientated now, and the growth of the prize funds has helped in that respect. The players are earning so much that they can afford to have their wives and children travel to every tournament.' Money is also a consideration in another respect. The remarkable growth of the senior's tour in America has meant that the players have every incentive to prolong their careers beyond middle age. All of which explains why many players are now finding that some of their best years occur when they reach their late 30s. But why are all of the top nine players in the world aged between 34 and 39? Why are there currently only two players under the age of 30 who have won major championships? Why are there only four, indeed, whose ages fall outside that seemingly magical 34-39 bracket? Miller says: 'Maybe we're just going through one of those dormant periods when there are no good young players around or certainly not ones you can compare to previous generations. But it will turn around again. You will get one player in his late twenties 20s who will win a couple of majors and then he will inspire his peers. 'That's what happened with the Europeans. First, Ballesteros won the Masters, and Langer said to himself: 'Well, if he can do it, so can I' And then when he won, Faldo started to believe that he could claim a green jacket. And so on. It will happen again.' It would be good for golf if it happened at Augusta this weekend.</p>

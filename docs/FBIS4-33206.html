			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- The national secretariat  of the General Confederation of Labor [CGT] today expressed in a  communique its "unconditional solidarity with the Tierra del  Fuego workers who are striking in defense of their labor rights  and their salaries."    Referring to the strike being staged by the Tierra del Fuego  metalworkers, the CGT stated that it supports the workers' calls  "for maintaining the source of jobs, and warned that any delay  in adopting measures to protect the regional economies, create  jobs, and strengthen national industry will result in further  social conflicts that will become increasingly more difficult to  solve."    The CGT also called for "the immediate adoption of measures  to ensure that all provincial and municipal workers receive  their overdue salaries."    The CGT believes that "the alarming unemployment level --  which has surpassed historical records -- lays bare the reality  of an ever-increasing impoverishment of large sectors of  Argentine society, which results in social marginalization  problems, forces students to quit school, causes infant  malnutrition, and so forth."    The communique concluded by pointing out that "unemployment  is caused by lack of incentives for production and the unfair  competition faced by products manufactured in Argentina."</p>

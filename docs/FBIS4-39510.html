			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tatyana Khudobina, Vesti presenter] </F>   [Text] We have received an urgent report from the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry which says U.S. Ambassador Thomas  Pickering was invited to the Russian Foreign Ministry, where  [Anatoliy] Adamishin, first deputy foreign minister, told him  the following:    On 7 June at 1328 hours Moscow time [0928 GMT], Air Defense  Troops spotted a plane 150 km south-west of the town of Adler.  The plane failed to respond to the relevant Russian services.    The Air Defense Troops informed the plane's crew that  overflight of Russian territory was forbidden. However,  ignoring the ban, the plane continued on its course and entered  80 km into Russian airspace.    At 1410 the plane, accompanied by the Air Defense Troops'  fighter planes, was forced to land at the airport in Adler. It  was established that the plane belongs to the United States,  flying the Frankfurt-am-Main - Tbilisi route. No flight plans  involving overflight of Russian territory were filed.    The Russian Foreign Ministry expects the American side to  adopt disciplinary measures concerning those guilty of the  incident, so as to prevent similar dangerous incidents from  occuring in the future. The U.S. Ambassador promised to inform  the United States leadership immediately of the Russian  statement. He expressed gratitude for the fact that in this  extraordinary situation the Russian authorities showed tact and  understanding and that, once the situation was cleared, the  plane was allowed to continue on its way to Tbilisi.</p>

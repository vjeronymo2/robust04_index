			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly of the People's Government  recently entrusted the government with the adoption of measures  to gradually eliminate and avoid the repetition of the problems  regarding excess currency that currently affect us, and which  are an obstacle to Cuba's economic recovery. Among these  measures was the possibility of raising the prices and fees of  selected products and services that are not considered basic  necessities.    Considering these elements, the Executive Committee of the  Council of Ministers adopted, at the suggestion of the Ministry  of Finance and Prices, several measures relating to prices and  fees, and applicable from the date indicated in each case.    The first decision establishes retail prices for cigarettes  sold in boxes of 20. In the case of (Rubio) cigarettes, the  price will be 2.50 pesos for those sold through the basic  controlled quota; 6.50 for those sold though controlled  distribution; and 10.50 for those sold uncontrolled. In each of  these cases, black cigarettes will be sold at 2, 6 and 10 pesos,  respectively. These prices will go into effect for the next  selling cycle which begins on 1 June.    In the meantime, until a balance is established between  production and consumption, a measure leaning toward  liberalization of cigarette sales could be developed at prices  adjustable to market demand.    Regarding twisted tobacco [tabaco torcido], the agreement of  the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers establishes  the following prices per unit, according to the conditions of  sale: twisted tobacco through the controlled basic quota, one  peso; twisted tobacco through controlled sale, which is  currently a minimal figure, two pesos for Nacionales, Coronas,  and the regular Cazadores; three pesos for the special Cazadores.    These prices will become effective for the next selling  cycle  which begins on 1 June. Corresponding prices for twisted tobacco  of superior quality, which could be produced in the future, will  be established for each case. With the stabilization of  production and consumption, a policy leaning toward free sale of  twisted tobacco at prices adjusted to the behavior of the market  could be developed.    Beer distributed in a controlled manner will cost 1.20 pesos  for a 350-milliliter container, 1.70 for a 500-milliliter  container or its equivalent when sold in large quantities. The  price for a bottle of rum will be 40 pesos for class A, 30 for  class B, and 20 for class C. Brandy will cost 20 pesos per  bottle. These prices will become effective for the next selling  cycle beginning on 1 June.    As production and consumption are stabilized, measures will  lean toward the free sale of beer and alcoholic beverages at  prices adjustable to market behavior. In restaurants and  recreation centers, prices will be adjusted according to  increases in retail sales.    Fuel for private vehicles will carry the following prices:  Special gasoline will be sold at 1.20 per liter; regular at one  peso per liter; gas-oil or diesel, 75 cents per liter. These  prices will become effective during the next sales cycle which  begins on 1 June.    Fees for electric service to the residential sector will be  as follows: the first 100 kilowatt-hours of monthly consumption,  the current 9 cents per kilowatt-hour; between 100 and 300  kilowatt-hours of monthly consumption, 20 cents per  kilowatt-hour; for over 300 kilowatt-hours, 30 cents per  kilowatt hour. The new tariffs will become effective in  September to be charged in October.    In the case of electric service, the agreement explains that  the application of the new tariffs does not exclude the  interruption of service for those consumers who repeatedly  exceed the assigned monthly consumption plan.    Regarding transportation fees, the agreement establishes,  with the exception of urban and suburban services, a universal  increase of 60.8 percent in train transportation, 80 percent in  airplane transportation, and 116 percent in nonurban bus  transportation. Furthermore, apart from the boarding and [word  indistinct] price, each ticket will have a minimum price. In the  same manner, vouchers will be given to workers and students for  transportation between their residences and work or education  centers. Second-class train tickets for medium distance,  interurban service and local service will be reduced.    Regarding fees for water and sewage service to the  residential sector, the agreement proposes that the current  tariffs for the metered water system be maintained and that a  fixed rate of one peso per person per household be established  for water service when consumption is not monitored by meters.    It has also been decided that fees for national and  international postal and telegraphic services will be adjusted  to the average of international costs and prices.    Furthermore, state entities are authorized, along with labor  unions, to adjust and modify retail prices of meals offered at  workers' cafeterias, a measure that will become effective on 1  July.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Help for small traders launched THE Corporation of London said last night that it had launched an effort to help small businesses affected by the bomb. About 150 shops and other small businesses were affected by the blast. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy committee, said: 'Our small-business unit is helping them find alternative premises or putting them in touch with firms who can repair and fit out their damaged premises. 'The City is the world's leading international financial centre but it could not survive without the support of the many small businesses - sandwich bars, dry-cleaners, heel bars, stationers - which City workers rely on.' The corporation will provide sites for small businesses that need temporary premises. It is asking other agencies for help with temporary cabins.</p>

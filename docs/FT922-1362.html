			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo's problems weigh on bourses Ireland's vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty on Friday lifted European bourses after their recent weakness, but Tokyo remained beset with problems, and bore much of the blame for last week's 2.1 per cent fall in local currency terms in the FT-Actuaries World Index. Investor sentiment in Tokyo was dented by the release of the tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly business survey, which showed a deterioration of business confidence among company managers, as well as indications that the government might have to cut its economic growth forecast for the year to March 1993. Nomura International believes the outlook for Japanese equities remains bleak in the short term. 'Concern about the real estate market following negative rumours on Daikyo, and bad debt at the banks, is putting severe pressure on the asset side of the market - which still appears overvalued to many investors,' the broker says in its weekly report. Mexico was the worst performer, dropping 8.2 per cent on the week in heavy trading, weighed down by foreign selling. Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities says several factors are pulling the market lower: Mr Ross Perot's rising popularity and his anti-free trade stance; worries, considered unfounded by Mr Laffan, that Telmex union members might sell their 3 per cent stake; the government's scaling back of economic growth forecasts; and a rush of new equity issues. He points out that investors are overlooking some positive factors: the government's commitment to low inflation, recent privatisations and debt reduction; and GDP growth still higher than that of developed countries. After the recent downward correction, the market is attractively valued, in his view, while earnings growth remains strong. 'None the less, external factors are likely to keep the market volatile over the next three to five months,' he adds.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change    % change             % change in local currency**          sterling**    in US                                                               Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of     Start of   Start of                                         1992         1992       1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.00   -0.65   -19.49    +7.05        +3.75      +3.11 Belgium      -1.63   -2.91    -2.59    +1.66        -1.19      -1.79 Denmark      -2.88   -5.91   -15.26   -10.78       -12.16     -12.70 Finland      -0.97   -6.07   -25.89    +0.95        -2.04      -2.64 France       -0.95   -5.94    +8.22    +8.97        +7.47      +6.81 Germany      -0.31   -2.06    -0.07   +10.17        +7.11      +6.44 Ireland      +0.61   -3.46    -3.98    -2.59        -4.47      -5.07 Italy        -0.88   -5.46   -20.13    -4.64        -7.25      -7.81 Netherlands  -2.75   -1.37    +4.57    +8.85        +5.84      +5.19 Norway       -4.78   -7.79   -19.43    +1.49        -0.67      -1.28 Spain        +0.47   -4.11    -8.29    +1.65        +0.21      -0.41 Sweden       -1.72   -6.38   -11.43    +8.14        +6.46      +5.81 Switzerland  -0.68   -2.00    +9.74   +12.69        +8.50      +7.82 UK           -0.82   -5.23    +4.25    +4.65        +4.65      +4.01 EUROPE       -0.93   -4.34    +1.17    +5.77        +4.32      +3.68 Australia    -1.23   -3.05    +6.23    -1.72        -1.93      -2.54 Hong Kong    -0.25   +0.00   +61.42   +37.79       +39.44     +38.59 Japan        -4.75   -7.84   -31.39   -26.95       -27.65     -28.10 Malaysia     +0.45   +1.05    -8.82    +3.50       +12.62     +11.93 New Zealand  -0.18   -1.94    +1.63    -1.49        -0.11      -0.70 Singapore    -1.98   +3.02    +2.67    +1.90        +2.37      +1.74 Canada       -2.61   -1.84    -7.53    -5.45        -8.16      -8.73 USA          -1.43   -2.56    +8.37    -3.16        -2.57      -3.16 Mexico       -8.18  -10.42   +48.21    +6.70        +4.59      +3.94 South Africa -0.64   -0.15   +11.02    +7.23        -4.80      -5.39 WORLD INDEX  -2.14   -4.30    -6.16    -7.57        -8.12      -8.12  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on June 19th 1992.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., and County NatWest Securitie  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

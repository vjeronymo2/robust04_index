			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Euro-poll 'will be vote on Major' A majority of British voters will use next month's European election to pass judgment on the government's policies, a survey published by the European Commission shows. The survey found that 56 per cent of voters consider the European poll to be an opportunity to express their verdict on the performance of Mr John Major as prime minister, while 38 per cent will be casting their votes on the basis of European issues. Less than half of those surveyed thought EU membership was a 'good thing' and 23 per cent said it was positively bad.</p>

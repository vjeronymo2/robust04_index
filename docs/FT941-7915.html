			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Bid to build on Sarajevo ceasefire Senior foreign ministry officials from the US, Russia, the European Union, Canada and the United Nations met in Bonn yesterday to try to maintain the momentum of the Sarajevo ceasefire and bind both Moscow and Washington into the peace process. With the US now prepared to play a greater diplomatic role in ending the Bosnian war, military strategists warned against any delay. 'Bosnian Serb and Croat forces could capitalise on the ceasefire in Sarajevo by consolidating territorial gains in other parts of the country,' a senior British military expert said. Yesterday, Serb forces bombarded the Bosnian-held enclave of Bihac, in the northwest. 'If the US is really on board, then European governments must send more peacekeeping troops, and Washington must start doing so as well. This is crucial,' he said. There was already too much foot-dragging on this issue, he added, pointing out that General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, never received the 3,000 extra troops required to demilitarise Sarajevo. At the Bonn meeting, attended by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, and Mr Charles Redman, President Bill Clinton's special envoy, European officials said all participants had 'agreed on a common agenda and a common analysis'. It includes: All possible measures to extend the Sarajevo ceasefire and normalise life in the city. This would include opening access roads, removing all road blocks, enabling access for road traffic, and all possible demilitarisation of the city. Re-establishment of some semblance of city government, although that would immediately raise the question of who gained what ground in the territorial division of Bosnia. Prevention of the heavy weapons withdrawn from Sarajevo being deployed in other battlefields - an absolutely essential measure, according to Mr Jurgen Chrobog, German foreign ministry political director, who chaired the talks. Officials also want to secure a lasting ceasefire in Mostar, besieged by the Croats. But western governments have failed to persuade the Croats to withdraw over 8,000 troops now in western Hercegovina. 'We have exerted no real pressure on the Croats, We cannot even threaten them with sanctions because Germany will block them,' a western diplomat said. Britain and France intend to seek a mandate in New York for UN activities in the region. They also want to try to open Tuzla airport, by March 7 according to UN officials, as well as start gaining access to the Bosnian enclave of Maglaj, where thousands of people are starving because of a Serb siege.</p>

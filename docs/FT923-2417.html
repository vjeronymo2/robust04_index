			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Lufthansa may bid for Continental THE NORTH Atlantic battle between the big European and US carriers was stepped up yesterday with the announcement that Lufthansa, the German national carrier, had filed a proposal to acquire a majority stake in Continental Airlines, the bankrupt US airline. The proposal, which is being made jointly with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier, envisages Lufthansa/Davis investing Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m) cash for a majority stake in Continental as part of the airline's plan to reorganise and move out of bankruptcy. The investors would also arrange for the placement of Dollars 300m of debt securities in the US carrier - giving Continental an overall Dollars 400m capital injection. Continental creditors, meanwhile, would be offered a minority interest in the airline. The Lufthansa plan is the latest in a series of proposed deals designed to forge links between troubled US carriers and European airlines. Northwest Airlines and KLM are seeking to integrate their operations, while British Airways wants to invest Dollars 750m for a 44 per cent stake in USAir - a deal fiercely opposed by the big US carriers. Yesterday, Mr Andrew Card, the US Transportation Secretary, said that approval for British Airways' proposed investment in USAir could be affected by the bilateral aviation arrangements between the two countries. Lufthansa said the Continental move was part of its strategy to strengthen its transatlantic services by forging an alliance with a US partner. Although Lufthansa is restructuring to stem heavy operating losses, it said: 'We must not forget our strategy just because of our financial position.' Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman, expects the airline's operating loss to rise to DM1.2bn (Pounds 430m) this year from a loss of DM800m last year. Texas-based Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, is considering three other bid proposals. Yesterday's submission should allow Lufthansa and Mr Davis access to more information about Continental so they could decide whether to proceed further. BA's global ambitions, Page 24</p>

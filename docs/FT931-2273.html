			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Taxman's silence MY WIFE and I were the sole owners of a small private company. We chose to liquidate it, with the approval of the Inland Revenue, from January 4 1991. We ceased to trade and began to liquidate the assets for distribution. Some of these were transferred into our names, including a freehold property. The inspector of taxes called in the district valuer for his opinion on the property and a figure was agreed in spring last year. Overall, there is a capital gain liability. When we sent in our tax returns in June 1992, we made the following statement: 'We are expecting to receive a capital gains assessment re '90/'91. Will you please look into it?' (We named the company and the approximate gain for each of us). To date, we have heard nothing further. Have we done sufficient to bring this to the inspector's notice? It looks as though you and your wife have done all that is required of you in regard to your personal CGT liabilities. But it is not clear whether the company's corporation tax liabilities have been settled, including the company's chargeable gain on the deemed sale of the property etc at market value. If the liquidator is still trying to get the Revenue to agree the company's final corporation tax position, that could explain why you have heard nothing about your personal CGT bills. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 14 (AFP)--China's most celebrated  dissident Wei Jingsheng is a criminal whose current detention  and investigation should not be confused with the issue of human  rights in China, a foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday [14  April]. "The case of Wei Jingsheng is by no means an issue of  human rights," spokesman Shen Guofang told a weekly press  briefing. "Human rights does not simply mean releasing a  criminal, which is totally irrelevant to human rights," Shen  added.    The spokesman's remarks fuelled speculation that Wei may  face  fresh criminal charges following his arrest April 1. The  Chinese authorities have said Wei, who was released in September  six months shy of a 15-year jail term for  "counter-revolutionary" activities, is currently being  investigated for "suspected new crimes." No official charges  have yet been brought against the 43-year-old dissident.    Shen made similar distinctions concerning the brief  detentions of pro-democracy activists in Beijing and Shanghai  during the recent visit of French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur. "They are not democracy activists. They are  criminals, most of whom are still on parole.    "Therefore, during such parole the Chinese legal authorities  have every right to take action," Shen said, adding that the  detentions "had nothing to do with the visit (of Balladur)."  However, of the four dissidents detained during the French  prime minister's visit -- Xu Wenli, Wang Fucheng, Bao Ge and  Yang Zhou -- only Xu is still currently on parole.    Shen also said the Chinese authorities were having  difficulties handling lists of political prisoners handed over  for their consideration during visits here by foreign  dignitaries such as US Secretary of State Warren Christopher.  "After some investigation, we found a lot of problems with such  lists. Some people simply do not exist and some people have  already been released," Shen said. "We often check the contents  of such lists with those visiting leaders and we found that even  they did not have a clear idea about the source of such lists  and the people named in them," he added.</p>

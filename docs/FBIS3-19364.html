			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasos Vasiliou] </F>   [Excerpt] A large quantity of arms (packed in boxes),  which have not as yet been located by the police, had been sent  to Cyprus with Bosnia as the final destination. However, when  the negotiations "failed," the illegal importers attempted to  channel them in Cyprus to people of the underworld who showed  interest.    According to our sources, this information was conveyed to  the police, who took action, and last Saturday [12 March] they  located not only the arms, as the informers had reported, but  also luxury cars which had been smuggled into Cyprus, and  antiquities.    However, instead of finding arms packed in boxes, the police  found three briefcases containing various weapons as samples, as  they had been packed by the factories with the price tags on.    After this, the police searched various houses hoping to  locate a large quantity of arms, as the initial information  indicated.    According to our information, the arms could be coming from  countries in the Middle East.    The new arms discovered in the three briefcases are  considered to be of high precision and technology. It is also  noteworthy that some of them are a type used only by the U.S.  Armed Forces (such as those using laser devices, and so forth).    The seriousness of the case is precisely the reason the  police will intensify their search today and tomorrow to  establish whether there are actually more arms in addition to  those found and, if so, to confiscate them before they fall into  the hands of criminals.

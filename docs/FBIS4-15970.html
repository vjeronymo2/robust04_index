			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report: "The Inviolables"] </F>   [Text] To all appearances, the brawl started by  Zhirinovskiy on 8 April in the State Duma hall will cause a lot  of trouble for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR)  leader. First, the "Russia's Choice" faction has demanded that  Zhirinovskiy's outrageous escapades be stopped. The matter has  been passed to the State Duma ethics subcommission. But this is  nothing compared with what is to come. Complaints by deputies  and a journalist, who were assaulted by Zhirinovskiy, and also  by witnesses to the scuffle may have more serious consequences.  State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has promised to pass these  documents to the general prosecutor. This entails the quite  realistic possibility that a criminal lawsuit may be filed on  charges of hooliganism.    In Vladimir Lukin's opinion, "any citizen should be brought  to account for hooliganism." If the lawsuit is filed, Lukin  will vote to strip V.V. Zh. [Zhirinovskiy] of his deputy  immunity. Vitaliy Sevastyanov declined to comment on the  incident, however, citing a lack of information. Many  communists do not see any wrongdoing here at all, dismissing the  affair as yet another clash between "Russia's Choice" and the  LDPR. This appears all the stranger because none of "Russia's  Choice" members was involved in the scuffle. Even though they  apparently could have been. For instance, Aleksandr Osovtsov  wished he were in the hall at the time. "I would have knocked  his head off, with pleasure. You cannot get at him otherwise."  Valeriy Borshchev, who participated in the fight, revealed a  curious detail. When he saw that Zhirinovskiy was beating up  Vladimir Borzyuk, he first of all turned to security personnel  who maintain order at the State Duma. But they said that for  them the deputies had inviolability whatever they might be doing.</p>

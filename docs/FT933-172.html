			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Book Review: The soap that won't wash SOAP OPERA. THE INSIDE STORY OF PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE By Alecia Swasy Times Books, Dollars 24, 288 pages Procter &amp; Gamble has a dirty and not so little secret, says Alecia Swasy: the US consumer products giant, which cultivates the image of enlightened employer and housewife's friend, is in reality a paranoid, rather sinister institution, obsessed by secrecy and control, which spies on its employees and bullies anyone who stands in its way. That, at any rate, is the picture painted by this Wall Street Journal reporter in one of the most sensational yet deeply flawed business books published in the US this year. It is the product of interviews Swasy conducted with more than 300 current and former P&amp;G employees - which is in itself no mean achievement, given the company's well-deserved reputation for secrecy. However, Swasy is hardly a detached observer. In 1991, when covering P&amp;G for the Journal, she infuriated Ed Artzt, its chairman, by revealing strategy moves under discussion inside the company. His response was draconian. He enlisted the help of the police in Cincinnati, P&amp;G's midwestern home city, who combed through millions of business and home telephone records in an attempt to track down the P&amp;G employee leaking information to the Journal. The move backfired badly. P&amp;G, accused of abuse of power and invasion of privacy, faced a torrent of bad publicity. Mr Artzt was forced to back down and acknowledge he had made an 'error of judgment'. The incident reveals an ugly side to a company long regarded as a good US corporate citizen, which regularly appears on lists of the 'most admired' companies in the US, or 'best to work for'. Swasy asserts, however, that her brush with P&amp;G is symptomatic of an inbred and increasingly oppressive culture which strips employees of privacy and independent thinking. P&amp;G is 'a cross between the marines and the Mormon church'. She portrays a company so worried about leaks of sensitive trading data that its large security staff - manned by former employees of the FBI, CIA and military police - monitors internal staff phone calls and routinely rides aircraft between Cincinnati, New York and Chicago to prevent employees and advertising agency representatives talking shop in flight. 'People can be fired for leaving a company phone book on their desk.' The atmosphere, she says, has become more oppressive under Artzt, who took over as chairman in 1990 and is known within the company as the 'Prince of Darkness' because of his abrasive manner and impatience with those who disagree with his ideas. To many people, he personifies 'what's wrong with P&amp;G these days: success at any price and too little attention to people'. Swasy goes on to pillory P&amp;G's research and development record (too few new products), its advertising (conservative and sexist) and sales methods (bullying, but with diminishing effect as large retailers such as discount chain Wal-Mart usurp the power of consumer goods manufacturers). She also revisits two controversies from the 1980s which reflect badly on the company: its marketing of the Rely tampon - which was withdrawn amid allegations that it was linked to the potentially fatal toxic shock syndrome  -and the pollution of a Florida river by a P&amp;G pulp mill. P&amp;G's aversion to publicity and market power make it an excellent subject for investigation. Despite its lily-white public persona, questionable deeds have doubtless been committed in the cause of its bottom line. Unfortunately, Swasy has wasted this opportunity by writing an account so one-sided and unfair, so full of vague generalities and argumentative non sequiturs, that she undermines the cred-ibility of her entire book. To take just one example, she dwells at length on the very real competition facing P&amp;G in the US and some third world markets, while brushing aside the fright it gave Unilever with a remarkable push into Europe in the 1980s. There may be considerable truth to her suggestion that Artzt's management style - described as one of 'fear and intimidation' - is undermining company morale and prompting a brain drain among senior managers. The trouble is, her judgment cannot be trusted. And it is equally true - as Swasy grudgingly acknowledges in a throwaway sentence or two - that P&amp;G has a very strong profits record and that its bureaucracy may have needed at least some of the strong medicine delivered by Artzt. Yet despite the persistent grinding of axes, this book does contain a wealth of fascinating detail about the inner workings of P&amp;G. There is, for example, a vivid portrait of the young Artzt, consumed with ambition, conducting his own informal national store check (P&amp;G's first) as he drove his family across the US to his first headquarters job. There is also a valuable account of how P&amp;G improved its long-time adversarial relationship with the increasingly powerful Wal-Mart, locating a dedicated sales team close to the company's Arkansas headquarters and linking the two groups by computer. As Swasy points out, Wal-Mart's annual sales revenues could be Dollars 100bn by the turn of the century, more than double those of P&amp;G. Together with other giant retailers it poses a serious threat to the profit margins of all consumer products manufacturers. Yet despite these insights, the primary impression left by this book is of someone hunting through a family's dirty laundry basket, intent on presenting every grubby garment stain to the world. The search can tell you something about a household's habits, but it hardly gives a balanced portrait.</p>

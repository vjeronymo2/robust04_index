			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US groups voice praise and doubts about Nafta deal WITHIN hours of the White House announcing agreement on Nafta, faxes nationwide began spewing out the praise and doubts of business, labour, farm groups and think-tanks. Commentators' views ranged widely. Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, called the agreement 'a demonstration of Latin America's maturity' as it prepared to meet the challenge of free trade. Mr Jack Valenti, Motion Picture Association president, said the pact would be closely studied but he continued to have 'deep concerns about Canada retaining its 'cultural exemption''. Business was generally swept away by the vision of three thriving North American economies. The National Foreign Trade Council said 'the job loss issue was an obvious concern,' but US export growth to Mexico in the past five years has already created 650,000 new jobs. Mr Kay Whitmore, Eastman Kodak Company chairman, said the pact was 'potentially ..win, win, win'. The liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs said indeed it was 'win, win' for the US, Canadian and Mexican multinationals and financial institutions. The US Farm Bureau praised the pact; the National Association of Wheat Growers saw it as 'lopsided', with the US unable to 'force price transparency' on the Canadian Wheat Board. Textile makers were pleased, but the US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel said Nafta showed the difficulty 'for governments to overcome vested special interests in trade negotiation'. It criticised Nafta's rules of origin for apparel requiring clothing to be made exclusively of North American materials from the yarn forward. These would provide an incentive for US apparel makers to transfer output to Mexico, but provide none for importers to transfer production from Far Eastern suppliers to Mexico. The Council of Americas urged talks with Chile to start now.</p>

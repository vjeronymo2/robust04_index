			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by </F> unidentified reporter in Genoa on 10 May: "Enough of Politics"  -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Genoa -- It certainly cannot be said of Alfredo  Biondi, the new justice minister, that he lacks political  experience. Born 66 years ago in Pisa, but Genoese by adoption,  Biondi has pursued two brilliant parallel careers as a criminal  lawyer and as a politician. A member of the PLI [Italian  Liberal Party], he has been party secretary, environment  minister and then community policy minister, and deputy speaker  of the Chamber of Deputies. At the last elections he left the  Center Union for the Berlusconi wagon. An active member of the  Defense Committee for many years, he was looking to obtain that  ministry, but was obliged to cede it to Previti in order to get  Berlusconi out of a tight corner. He finds himself, therefore,  as justice minister. And he is very circumspect with the first  exchange of remarks.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Minister Biondi, you have always been very  much a man for guaranteeing constitutional rights. Will you  reconfirm this position in your new role as well?    [Biondi] No doubt. If a magistrate does not respect the  guarantees set by law, he will find me opposed to him. The  guarantees must exist for everyone, in all conditions.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You have always denounced so-called easy  incarceration.    [Biondi] The provisions of the penal code are precise. The  judge is responsible for his decisions in the area of  incarceration. I hope that judges will act in good conscience  and that those who control their actions -- civil rights groups,  the various courts -- will do their duty.    [LA REPUBBLICA] There are those who periodically denounce a  certain mingling of the judiciary and politics. What do you  think of this?    [Biondi] One of my main objectives will be to eliminate  political interests as far as possible from the administration  of justice. President Saragat [1964-71] used to say: "Where  politics comes in, justice goes out of the window." We must do  away with judges who speak too much about politics, and also  with those who base their behavior on political requirements.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Some people will read these words as an  attack on Prosecutor Borrelli. Are they intended as such?    [Biondi] No personal attacks, I do not like them. And then,  I do not even know Borrelli.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Are you the also in favor of the separation  of careers on the bench?    [Biondi] This is a very delicate problem. Be that as it may,  the concept that legal careers should also be vocations seems to  me evident. The court system dates back to 1941. The need to  update certain rules seems to me equally evident.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Heseltine backs export drive in US MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday lent his support to the launch of one of Britain's most ambitious export promotion campaigns, in spite of criticism that it is poorly timed. The campaign, North America Now, is aimed at reversing a long decline in Britain's share of the US market and at forging joint ventures for medium-sized companies. But it comes as a new US administration is drawing up potentially protectionist trade policies. Mr Heseltine said the campaign's timing could not be better. Sterling's devaluation had boosted opportunities for exporters, and there was clear evidence that the US and Canada were emerging strongly from recession. The Pounds 1.8m three-year campaign comes after five years in which the European single market has been the main focus of Britain's export promotion strategy. No formal target has been set, but the government hopes the UK share of US visible imports can be lifted from 3.8 per cent to 5 per cent by 1995, boosting exports in money terms by about Pounds 3bn a year from the current Pounds 12.2bn. The campaign has several innovative features including the targeting of 20 US sectors with 50 events planned in north America over six months; nine 'export promoters' seconded to the DTI from the private sector will work with prospective exporters as part of the campaign; there will be an education programme including 10 scholarships a year at the JL Kellogg School of Management in Chicago and workshops on issues such as US sales practices and how to reduce market entry overhead costs; and a 'big companies partnership' will be created involving discussions with leading exporters to the US on where the government can assist in overcoming trade barriers, or in defining how US trade and investment fits into the companies' growth strategy. Regional initiatives will range from backing a partnership between the oil regions around Calgary and Aberdeen to a sectoral initiative between Wales and Ontario, and an 'America Week' in Birmingham this month to coincide with British Airways' inaugural direct flight to New York. Another element in the campaign is the appointment of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy and management consultancy group, to work with 50 medium-sized companies a year with the aim of forging 'strategic partnerships' in the US. The aim is to introduce each company to up to three prospective US partners. It is hoped to set up 10 to 15 partnerships each year over the three years of the campaign, generating earnings towards the UK balance of payments amounting to Pounds 30m. 'These companies will not be beginners,' said Mr Ian Guthrie, partner at Price Waterhouse responsible for the project. 'They should have between 100 and 500 staff, a turnover of Pounds 10m-Pounds 50m, and a good foothold in the US market already. They will be companies that have put serious time into export promotion as part of a clear business plan.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-'Arish, 4 May (MENA)--A delegation from the  Palestinian police's Liaison Committee made up of 19 officers  led by Brigadier General Ghazi 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jibali crossed  the Rafah border point to explore the Palestinian police's areas  of deployment. The delegation members also will coordinate with  the Israeli sides on the takeover of sites in Gaza and Jericho,  in preparation for the deployment of the Palestinian police as  of tomorrow, Thursday.    Approximately 1,000 Palestinian policemen are expected to  enter the self-rule areas in the coming hours to start their  work in keeping law and order in the territories. Eyewitnesses  have affirmed that Israel continues to transfer the Israeli  security and army camps to make room for the coming Palestinian  policemen. The Palestinians have prepared themselves to receive  the self-rule authority with celebrations, marches of support,  and Palestinian flags.    In another development, the occupation troops have imposed a  security siege on the self-rule areas to prevent Israeli  settlers and extremists from entering these areas for fear of  confrontation with the Palestinians.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Video evidence leads to ban for Tassotti For the first time at a World Cup, Fifa, soccer's governing body, has used video replays to punish a player for an action the referee did not see during the game. Fifa's disciplinary committee has imposed an eight-game suspension - twice the previous longest - on Italy's Mauro Tassotti for viciously elbowing Spaniard Luis Enrique during last Saturday's 2-1 win by Italy in the quarter-finals. Enrique's nose was broken. Tassotti misses today's semi-final against Bulgaria. If Italy reach Sunday's final he will sit that out as well, plus six preliminary games in the European championship. Tassotti had apologised for the blow. He was not penalised on the field and said later the elbowing was accidental. After studying videotapes, Fifa rejected his claim. The disciplinary committee judged Tassotti's action as 'intentional serious violent conduct.' The suspension and Dollars 16,000 fine can be appealed. Fifa said referee Sandor Puhl of Hungary was blameless in not penalising Tassotti on the spot because he did not have a clear view of the elbowing, which occurred during a scrap for the ball late in the game. The committee also denied an appeal against a four-game suspension of Brazilian defender Leonardo for an elbowing that fractured the skull of American Tab Ramos. And it: Fined the Dutch team Dollars 8,000 and cautioned coach Dick Advocaat for bad behaviour on the bench during Saturday's 3-2 quarter-final loss to Brazil; Fined Brazilian goalie Taffarel Dollars 8,000 for violating advertising restrictions by wearing oversized logos on his gloves; Suspended Sweden's Stefan Schwarz for today's semi-final against Brazil for collecting two yellow cards in the quarter-final win over Romania, and fined the Swede Dollars 2,400. German coach Berti Vogts, under intense bombardment in Germany for their defeat by Bulgaria, was not on the flight taking most of the team home. Wisely, he is holidaying in Florida. The loss to Bulgaria cost the Germans bonuses of Dollars 80,000 apiece for defending their title. For reaching the quarter-finals, they received a mere Dollars 22,000 per man. Romania's players are to be made Citizens of Honour of Bucharest for their World Cup performance, said mayor Crin Halaicu. The team bowed out after Sweden beat them on penalties in the quarter-finals. The only exception is Ion Vladiou, who became 'a national shame,' said Bucharest, when suspended for earning the team's only red card for a nasty foul. Each Romanian player was given a Mercedes by a local businessman for qualifying for the finals. World Cup semi-finalists Brazil topped the Sprint Soccer Poll for the ninth week running, poll organisers said yesterday. Italy, Bulgaria and Sweden, the other three semi-finalists, held the next three spots in the weekly ranking of top 10 national teams as viewed by an international panel of soccer journalists. Brazil received 474 points, followed by Italy (386). Surprising Bulgaria were third (349), then Sweden (313) - the first time Bulgaria and Sweden had reached the top five. Romania, who lost their quarter-final to Sweden in a penalty shoot-out, were fifth (310) followed by Holland (260), Germany (229), Argentina (146), Mexico (97) and Spain (51) in tenth spot.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, Feb 12 (TANJUG) -- Co-chairman of the  conference on former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg stated on  Saturday that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina was nearer now that  the three warring sides agreed that the action plan of the  European Union (E.U.) would serve as the basis of future  negotiations.    At the close of three-day talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina in  Geneva on Saturday, Stoltenberg told newsmen that this plan  presumes a union of the three (Serb, Croat, Moslem) republics in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Moslem republic would cover 33.56 per  cent of the total territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the  U.N. and E.U. would take up administration over Sarajevo and  Mostar, respectively.    Representatives of the three warring sides agreed to meet  again in Geneva late February or early March.    Bosnian Moslems accepted a two-year U.N. administration of  Sarajevo, but only within an integral peace solution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- not a "separate agreement", Stoltenberg  explained.    Stoltenberg favourably appraised the fact that a debate was  raised about territories as the most delicate question. As was  originally planned, the confidence and security build-up  measures alone should have been discussed, while the opening of  hot-lines amongst the three military commands was agreed.    The delegation heads of the three warring sides have not  resolved the problems of 15 controversial territories. As  Stoloenberg put it, the Moslems and Croats still lacked the  common language about seven towns in central Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and so did the Serbs and Moslems concerning eight localities in  eastern and western Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Stoltenberg said it was significant that the latest round of  talks at least clarified the general concept of a future  Bosnia-Herzegovina so that all the sides had now accepted the  idea of a union of three republics.    It was also accepted that the Serb-Moslem talks at Sarajevo  Airport should resume, while the Croat-Moslem group for Mostar  should meet on February 16 to work out the details concerning  the E.U. administration of this town.    Stoltenberg was confident that the U.S. would favourably act  on the outcome of the peace talks when he recalled that he and  Lord Owen, as co-chairmen of the conference on ex-Yugoslavia,  had long lacked support in their negotiation efforts before the  more active inclusion into this process of the E.U. in November  and December, and, most recently, of the U.S. and the Russian  Federation.    Asked whether he feared the U.S. might come out with a  proposal that should annull the E.U. action plan, Stoltenberg  answered that he only was disturbed by the fact that peace was  not yet achieved.    He said that he was ready to welcome and accept every  solution that might step up this proces, and added that the  American administration's stand clearly revealed that the U.S.  was upholding the basic ideas in the E.U. peace plan.</p>

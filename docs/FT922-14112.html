			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / China attacks Washington for interference JIANG ZEMIN, the Chinese Communist party general secretary, yesterday used a visit to Tokyo as a platform for an attack on the US, which he condemned for its 'interference in the internal affairs' of other countries. Jiang did not name Washington, but his speech was a clear reference to continued US criticism of China's human rights record and arms export policies. He said the international political situation had changed, but 'hegemony and power politics remain a serious problem'. Having berated the US, Jiang told Japanese leaders they had an important role in helping China's economic reform programme, and he invited Emperor Akihito to visit Beijing this year as part of celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Jiang is the first top-level Chinese leader to visit Japan since Premier Li Peng in April 1989. A few months later, China's army crushed the pro-democracy movement in Beijing, and Japan joined the West in freezing high-level exchanges with China. Japan has led the West in gradually restoring contacts, including foreign aid. Last year, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, who was then Japanese prime minister, became the first leader of a major western power to visit Beijing after the crackdown. The Communist party chief and Japanese leaders yesterday implicitly agreed to overlook Beijing's crushing of the pro-democracy movement and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, indicated that his country's two most important partners were Beijing and Washington. But the warmth of the relationship has limits. The Japanese government appears reluctant to approve the emperor's Beijing visit when the two countries are unable to settle a dispute over the ownership of a collection of East China Sea islands, known to Tokyo as the Senkaku islands, and to Beijing as the Diaoyutai group. In Beijing, Jiang's five-day visit to Tokyo is seen as an important step towards domestic and international credibility for the Chinese leadership.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Sun and Fujitsu expand links Sun Microsystems, the world leader in computer workstations, and Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer, are to expand their long-standing microprocessor technology partnership to include a co-ordinated approach to technology development. The companies plan to invest more than Dollars 500m over the next five years in the design and development of new Sparc microprocessors and related technologies. Sparc is Sun Microsystems' reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology, which had until recently enabled the workstation company to produce workstations that outperform those of rivals, including Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and International Business Machines. Recently, however, Sun's competitors have leap-frogged Sparc performance. In an effort to regain leadership, Sun and Fujitsu will now work together to develop more advanced versions of Sparc. Fujitsu and Sun Microsystems also agreed to a broad cross-licensing of patent rights, and to ensure compatibility between the computer products that each company develops based on Sparc technology. Fujitsu has also extended its commitment to resell, distribute and service Sun products in Japan.</p>

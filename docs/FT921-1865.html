			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Yeltsin in plea to breakaway Tatars PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to Tatars to vote 'no' in a referendum on independence from the Russian Federation, saying the poll could unleash violence and threaten the course of reforms in Russia. He warned Tatars to remember that 'every political mistake bears a concrete price'. It was time to draw the lessons of inter-ethnic strife over the last few years in the former Soviet Union, he said on television on the eve of the poll in the autonomous republic west of Moscow. He said a vote for independence would set Tatars and Russians within Tatarstan against one another. The Russian parliament meanwhile resorted to 'divide and rule' tactics to try to tackle rebellion from another semi-independent enclave which is threatening to break away. Meeting in closed session, it approved a resolution splitting up Chechen-Ingushetia, another former autonomous republic whose leaders want independence. The resolution provides for the carving out over the next two years of a new republic called Ingushetia from the territory of Chechen-Ingushetia. The move is likely to provoke a fierce reaction from Chechen-Ingushetia's President Jokhar Dudayev, who has renamed the republic Chechnya to assert the domination of the Chechen nation. Tatarstan meanwhile pressed ahead with its referendum, defying a call by the Russian parliament that Tatarstan make the poll comply with Russia's constitution. The expected pro-independence vote could encourage others among the 20 autonomous republics to rebel. The territories were created by the Bolsheviks to give an illusion of self-determination for various ethnic groups and maintain 'divide and rule'. Although the leaders of 18 of them this month initialled a draft federal treaty keeping them within the Russian Federation, hopes of it being ratified are fading.</p>

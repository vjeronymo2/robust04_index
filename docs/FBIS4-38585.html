			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- A total of 350 guards of a  separate battalion of the Ukrainian national guards were shifted  to Sevastopol between May 17 and 27. The battalion with  motorised equipment is stationed on the grounds of an air  defence unit of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, the public  relations centre of the Sevastopol Militia Department reports on  Tuesday.    The report notes that Lieutenant-Colonel Igor Kurovskyy,  commander of the guards unit stationed in Sevastopol, said that  a decision on deploying such subunits in all the Ukrainian  regional centres was taken by President Leonid Kravchuk in 1993.    He noted that the main tasks of guardsmen are to protect the  Ukrainian constitutional system and to help border troops in  detaining border transgressors.    In the near future, guardsmen intend to participate in  measures to protect law and order, which were planned by the  Sevastopol Militia Department.</p>

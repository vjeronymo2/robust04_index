			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): New Tessa urged Most private businesses would prefer to invest out of retained income rather than with debt or by raising equity. It allows them to retain control and is ultimately cheaper. But many small businesses fail to retain enough of those earnings. Partly because of favourable personal tax incentives, small business owners tend to take more money out of their businesses than is healthy for their financial stability. Barclays Bank believes they need to be encouraged to keep more in their businesses for future investment. It has asked the government to consider introducing a Business Tessa account for all businesses in this year's Budget. The account would function like the personal Tax Exempt Special Savings Account, making interest on retained earnings saved for a minimum period free of tax. 'It is a small, low-cost, targeted tax incentive,' says David Lavarack, head of Barclays Small Business Services. Barclays has discussed the proposal with the DTI and other departments, whose reaction has been 'favourable', Lavarack says. The Tessa would be focused on small businesses which have a chance of surviving and growing over the medium term but which fail to achieve their potential because of low reinvestment Incorporated and unincorporated businesses with sales between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 1m would benefit most from a Business Tessa. But all businesses would be allowed to invest up to Pounds 20,000 a year for five years. At this level, the cost to the Treasury in lost tax on interest would build to about Pounds 200m after five years and would benefit over 350,000 businesses. Barclays says the small-business sector is characterised by high rates of closure and low average growth rates. 'Reducing the level of closures would provide a real boost to the UK economy,' it says.</p>

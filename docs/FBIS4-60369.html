			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lebanon has complained to the Security Council  about Israel's abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani. The complaint  was submitted as Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was meeting UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York. Peres said  Yasir 'Arafat has to make clear his commitment to all elements  of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and express opposition to  the use of violence in relations with Israel. From New York,  Judy Lessing reports:    [Begin Lessing recording] Foreign Minister Peres told Mr.  Butrus Butrus-Ghali about Israel's relations with Lebanon,  Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians, and he said a high priority  is the building of the new Middle East. He said it is Israel  which must make the tangible concessions, and Israelis need to  know there is a new Middle East.    The secretary general assured Mr. Peres the United Nations  has a sincere interest in the peace process in the region, and  he has offered UN help to promote it, though he did not give  many specifics. He did talk about the possibility of setting up  some kind of apparatus to oversee UN agencies, the World Bank,  and the International Monetary Fund, as the funds promised for  the Palestinian self-ruling authority are made available.    Foreign Minister Peres says that Israel is pleased its  relations with the United Nations are improving, but he said he  would like to see more progress, and he told the secretary  general Israel wants to become a normal, full participant in the  United Nations. For example, he said, Israel is willing to  contribute to peacekeeping operations, and though the government  would have to approve any contribution of forces to say, Angola,  this could be a possibility. At a time when the United Nations  is having serious problems getting skilled troops for its  operations, this should have been a welcome suggestion.    It is almost certain the question of where Ron Arad is was  discussed when Mr. Peres and Mr. Butrus-Ghali had a private  meeting before their aides joined them. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    Addressing the Israel Policy Forum, Foreign Minister Peres  said that with peace in the Middle East, the threat of nuclear  weapons will be eradicated.    [Begin Peres recording] We shall have a Middle East free of  the danger of war. We shall also, I hope so, have a Middle East  free of the danger of the nuclear threat. But it must be in  this order. You cannot build a second floor before you have the  first one. When the Egyptians in particular are demanding that  Israel will sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] and  so on, we are asking them privately: Gentlemen, are you going  to guarantee that Iran is okay, Iraq is okay, Libya is okay?  What are you talking about? You cannot have it done partially.  Their nuclearization is invisible. Otherwise it does not  exist. If we shall have a different Middle East, we shall have  a different policy concerning the nonconventional arms. [end  recording]</p>

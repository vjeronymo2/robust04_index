			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / People: Wheelock NatWest chooses chief executive David Miller, 46, former head of Jardine Fleming's Japanese operations, has become chief executive of Wheelock NatWest, the new Asian merchant bank being set up by National Westminster Bank and Wheelock, the 137-year-old Hong Kong trading house. Miller joined merchant bankers Robert Fleming as a graduate trainee in 1972, and was seconded to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority in the late 1970s. After a brief stint as a Fleming pension fund manager, he joined Jardine Fleming, the Hong Kong merchant bank jointly owned with Jardine Matheson. Miller, who was deputy chairman of Fleming Securities when he left in 1991, is coy about the reasons for his departure. He says that when he returned to head office from the Far East it 'did not work out'. He left in 1992 to run the UK arm of State Street Bank Global Advisors, part of the Boston-based fund management group. Jardine Fleming has only been going for 25 years yet is Hong Kong's oldest, most profitable merchant bank. Last year it made net profits of Dollars 210m and contributed a substantial part of the profits of the privately-owned Robert Fleming group. Miller is the second ex-Jardine Fleming man recruited by Wheelock Natwest. Nick Sibley, 56, one of two joint deputy chairmen, ran Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong in the early 1970's. He too found it hard to adjust when recalled to Flemings' London HQ. Sibley moved to BZW, then Wheelock Marden, where he has the job of setting up the new venture, which has an authorised share capital of Dollars 200m.</p>

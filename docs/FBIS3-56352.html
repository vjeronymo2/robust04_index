			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich and Georgy </F> Shmelyov]    [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said on Tuesday [18 January] that it is necessary for  Russia to keep its "military presence" in former Soviet  republics in order to prevent forces hostile to Russia from  filling in the "security vacuum".    The minister told a meeting of Russian ambassadors in the  CIS  and the Baltics that raising the issue of a complete end to  Russian military presence is an "extreme approach".    According to Kozyrev, the solution lies in the middle  between  a complete withdrawal and full military presence. "We should not  withdraw from those regions which have been the sphere of  Russian interests for centuries and we should not fear these  words about the military presence", the minister said.    A "security vacuum" will emerge as soon as the Russian  troops  leave the region which will be "inevitable filled in by forces  which are often not friendly, and in many cases even directly  hostile to Russian interests", Kozyrev said, adding that the CIS  and the Baltics comprise a region of "priority vital interests  for Russia which also poses the major threats to the interests".    The conflicts and problems in the former USSR directly  affect  Russian internal developments and everyday life, according to  the minister who added that at the same time the region opens  vast possibilities for better relations and friendly contacts,  as well as for enhanced Russian influence.    Kozyrev listed the protection of the rights of Russians in  the former Soviet republics as a major strategic foreign policy  task and added that the issue of dual citizenship is the key one  in the policy. "A better mutual understanding has been reached  in this aspect of late", he said.    Other priority tasks include the creation and improvement of  cooperation mechanisms, the drafting of a short-, medium- and  long- term strategy of creating an economic union, according to  Kozyrev.    He said an "individual approach" is necessary in this  aspect,  especially in monetary unification. "An all-round assessment of  the issues is necessary and such mechanisms should be created  which would allow Russia to avoid unjustified expenses while the  republics would not feel themselves pushed aside and would not  look for new partners", the minister said.    The CIS has already reached such a degree of maturity when  it  feels it desirable to "become a member of world processes". "It  is developing from a regional into a global factor", Kozyrev  said.</p>

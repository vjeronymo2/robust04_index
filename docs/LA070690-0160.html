			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WESTINGHOUSE WINS FEDERAL SUIT  </P> <P> Westinghouse Electric Co., which offered to settle an age discrimination  lawsuit two years ago for $35 million, has won the case in federal appeals  court.  </P> <P> The ruling Thursday, prompted by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, ended  the court battle that began in 1983 when the federal Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission challenged Westinghouse for forcing laid-off employees  to retire before age 70 because severance pay was not available.  </P> <P> The settlement offer, which would have given about 4,000 retirees an average  payment of $8,750, was rejected by government lawyers because they believed the  workers would get more in court.  </P></p>

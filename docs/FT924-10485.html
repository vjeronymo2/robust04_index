			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / US upbeat on Mid-East talks AN ELECTED Palestinian self-governing authority could be in place in just six months, according to US officials at the Middle East peace talks. They believe the talks are making progress despite the damage caused by recent violence in Lebanon and Israel. One year on from the Madrid conference which launched the peace process under the sponsorship of the US and Russia, it has sometimes seemed that the only visible progress is that the talks, in separate bilateral tracks bringing Israel together with Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Palestinian negotiators, have not broken up. Arab delegates to the latest round of talks in Washington this week have complained publicly that Israel is stalling. 'Israel has said that the Arabs have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. It seems this time that it is Israel which is missing the opportunity,' said Mr Abdul Salam Majali, head of the Jordanian delegation. But Mr Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, insisted yesterday that there was progress. 'The negotiations are working. In each track there is negotiation and focus on the right issues,' he said. The most visible progress in this round of talks, which will resume on November 9 after the US election, is the agreement between Israeli and Jordanian delegates on an agenda paving the way for concrete negotiations. Mr Djerejian said there was also 'structured, serious engagement' between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators that could lead to the election of a self-govering authority for the occupied territories by next May.</p>

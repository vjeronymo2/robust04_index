			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Major Oldrich Barta, chief of </F> logistics, Czech Republic Ministry of Defense, by Vladimir  Marek; place and date not given: "A Small but High-Quality Army"]    [Text] The Army of the Czech Republic should be small  and mobile and have modern equipment. We asked General Major  Oldrich Barta, engineer, who heads the Main Office for Material  and Technical Support at the Ministry of Defense, what lay  behind this general statement.    [Marek] What kind of equipment will the Army of the Czech  Republic require in the immediate future?    [Barta] The concept of equipping the Army of the Czech  Republic was entrusted to the Department for Development of  Equipment at the Ministry of Defense. It will not be possible to  finalize the concept until all political interrelated questions  are clarified. The equipping of our Army must be in line with  even the latest facts, such as, for example, the Partnership for  Peace.    [Marek] Nevertheless, it is reported that working out of  that  concept should not take longer than the fall of this year.    [Barta] We expect that by fall we could already have some  data collected. I personally feel, however, that we will require  more time to put together the entire concept.    [Marek] Under these conditions, how long will actual  modernization take?    [Barta] It should be realized by the year 2005. Even some  key  programs have been planned with that date in mind.    [Marek] How much money will modernization require?    [Barta] At present, annual expenditures for the Army amount  to 2.5 percent of the national income. We must unequivocally  state that this amount of resources is inadequate.  Modernization, particularly that of the Air Force and other  technical components, is financially very demanding. But the  answer to this highly complicated question must be sought not  only at the specialized level but also at the economic and  particularly the political levels.    [Marek] There are many discussions regarding the purposeful  distribution of the military budget. Which part of it should be  allocated to modernization?    [Barta] Of course, it would be desirable for it to be the  largest percentage. In my view, it would involve about one-third  of the budget.    [Marek] What will be the phases of modernization? What is  considered to be a priority?    [Barta] The priorities have generally been identified. They  involve systems of command and control so we could communicate  with the NATO armies. Then there are the information systems, in  both logistics and command structures. Next are the  reconnaissance systems and, of course, the rapid-deployment  brigade. For me to list those priorities in a more specific  manner, I would have to base my statement on the defense  strategy. And, for the time being, that has not been precisely  outlined.    [Marek] Should that process be primarily shared by Czech  armaments manufacturers, or are express purchases of weapon  systems from abroad even being contemplated?    [Barta] I repeat once more: It is not a question of rearming  but, rather, a question of modernization. For the present, we  are not contemplating any new deliveries of weapon systems. We  intend merely to modernize existing gear and equipment. If some  new project has come to light, it is exclusively based on  domestic production.    [Marek] Does that mean that the RDP Group, which is an  association of Czech armament manufacturers, will have the green  light with our Army?    [Barta] We have created certain principles for ourselves in  terms of acquisitions activities. We are making contact with the  RDP Group just like with every other entity. Of course, we  perceive the RDP Group as a component of a specific Czech  armaments industry. But that is all.    [Marek] I will ask the question more specifically: What hope  for utilization in our Army is there, for example, for the  Skoda-Plzen idea to modernize the T-72 tank?    [Barta] We told the RDP Group that we will not stand in its  way in modernizing any kind of gear. We will be announcing  requests for proposals, and, if the RDP Group comes up with a  project that will be interesting for the Army of the Czech  Republic, it will, of course, be realized.    [Marek] And what about, for example, the modernized  modification of the Albatross? Are you figuring on it for our  Air Force?    [Barta] The Albatross is a subsonic aircraft that is a  training aircraft at present. Although a specific combat version  is being considered, it would have to be augmented by the  addition of at least more high-tech equipment--in other words,  it would have to be made supersonic.    [Marek] Could you at least indicate what type of gear will  have to be purchased from abroad in the immediate future--what  will definitely be beyond the capabilities of our armaments  industry?    [Barta] Because the army of 2005 has not been defined (but  only that of 1995), it is very difficult to answer that  question. But I think we certainly will not be manufacturing  tanks. It is quite possible that we will not even need them. At  present, I am unable to answer that question. We will certainly  be buying some small numbers of materiel and equipment abroad,  items domestic industry will not be producing.    [Marek] It is said that defense capability is not  exclusively  the Army's. It is said that it also involves the armaments  industry. Is there not the threat, in the event of an actual  conflict of some kind, that we would be cut off from possible  service from abroad?    [Barta] Our Army will be small in numbers but will have  high-quality equipment. The armaments industry will be smaller  but of peak quality. It will certainly be made up of  manufacturers of aviation systems and munitions. It will be an  industry that will assure the stability of the Czech Republic  and will exclude precisely what you have just defined. No  country can afford to be dependent on the delivery of decisive  spare parts and munitions from abroad.    [Marek] But our Army is predominantly equipped with former  Soviet equipment. Are we not exposed to a certain risk, given  the current instability in the territory of the CIS?    [Barta] Although our equipment is originally Soviet, it was  manufactured predominantly by license, for the most part in  Slovakia. At the present time, we have certain spare parts,  certain stockpiles. We have nothing to fear in that direction.  Moreover, the fabrication of some spare parts is possible even  on the part of a non-Russian supplier. I have in mind, for  example, Ukraine, Poland.    [Marek] How do you view the possibility of purchasing  secondhand weapon systems from the U.S. Army?    [Barta] I personally believe that, at a time when we are  downsizing the amount of gear and equipment, there is no reason  to purchase used cheaper equipment. Even so, it is expensive for  us, and, moreover, systems would have to be finalized to  accommodate it. For example, the purchase of aircraft alone  solves nothing in and of itself. You have to support the  training system, you have to provide trainers, ground support,  etc.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1555 GMT on 12 January carries a 30-minute  documentary program "Portrait Against a Swastika" reviewing the  rise to prominence of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia,  LDPR, its leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and two other right-wing  groups, Pamyat and Russian National Unity.    The program begins with a claim that it would avoid a direct  comparison of Zhirinovskiy with Adolf Hitler, although film of  Zhirinovskiy reviewing young uniformed volunteers was spliced in  with footage of Hitler reviewing the Hitler Youth. An  unidentified moderator notes that: "We are a long way from  comparing him with Hitler, although, come to think of it, Hitler  also started with a small party of dissatisfaction."    However, at this point, the moderator notes there is a  comparison between Zhirinovskiy and Mussolini, stating that: "If  we are to speak of an external resemblance, we do not recall the  Fuehrer of the Third Reich, but his great Italian friend, Benito  Mussolini."    At this point there are several minutes of spliced film  clips  of Zhirinovskiy and Mussolini speaking. Clips from  Zhirinovskiy's election campaign are shown, with commentary  repeatedly suggesting that his election promises are not  realizable. At one point the moderator states that "He promises  everybody everything...but only one thing is missing from each  promise: an explanation of how exactly he plans to do it all."    Alongside clips of LDPR election campaign material,  Zhirinovskiy is repeatedly shown in an excited and incoherent  state, including two scenes apparently shot in a nightclub. In  one clip Zhirinovskiy states: "Yes, yes, it's a wolf's life."  "Generally my favorite activity is howling like a wolf. People  have different hobbies, like playing the recorder, but my  activity is howling like a wolf." He then states: "I can try to  howl like a wolf if you like, I'd be happy to."    The final sequence of the program shows a campaign clip of  Zhirinovskiy commenting on the overseas involvement of Soviet  forces. He says: "Wherever our soldiers may have been, in the  Soviet-Finnish war, or the troops in Afghanistan, or in any  other area, in Africa or Cuba, they did everything correctly.  All the soldiers and officers who fought, everything they did  was legal and correct." His final comment is: "If all that was  legal and correct, what awaits us tomorrow?"</p>

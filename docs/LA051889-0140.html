			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUJAN DISCLAIMS ROLE IN NARROWING TANKER SEA LANES  </P> <P> Interior Secretary Manuel J. Lujan Jr. said Wednesday that he was unaware that  his department had asked the Coast Guard to trim tanker-traffic safety lanes  off the California coast to accommodate more offshore drilling platforms, but  he promised to look into the situation.  </P> <P> His promise, however, was not enough to appease environmentalists and Rep.  Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who vigorously opposes the 60% smaller sea lanes  because they would, Boxer asserted, "set up the perfect circumstances for a  devastating crash."  </P> <P> The controversy centers on the formal designation of sea lanes off a 180-mile  stretch of California coast from Santa Barbara to Ano Nuevo State Reserve near  San Francisco. The Coast Guard in 1982 proposed making the northbound and  southbound lanes a total of five miles wide.  </P> <P> But the Coast Guard last month said wide lanes are "not acceptable to (the  Mineral Management Service, an agency of the Interior Department) because a  large number of offshore tracts would be totally excluded from oil exploration  and development." Instead, the Coast Guard has proposed one-mile-wide lanes  separated by a two-mile-wide median in which oil platforms would be allowed.  </P> <P> Boxer and environmental groups, including the Oceanic Society, denounced the  narrower, mile-wide lanes on Wednesday, noting that the Exxon Valdez had  strayed 1 1/2 miles outside normal shipping lanes in Alaska before it caused  the worst tanker disaster in the nation's history in March.  </P> <P> "We know there have been 93 such crashes of vessels and oil rigs between 1970  and 1982, so this is a ridiculous proposal," Boxer said. "Once again (the  Mineral Management Service) is pressing its pro-drilling views on (other)  federal agencies and sacrificing the safety of our coastal environment for oil  company profits."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bad Policy'  </P> <P> "In the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster," said Steven Hopcraft of the Oceanic  Society, "it is incredible that we would alter safety procedures and policy  priorities for the convenience of the oil industry. It is bad policy, bad  science and bad government."  </P> <P> Hopcraft delivered his criticism of the Interior Department as Lujan addressed  local employees of the National Park Service. Lujan was in the Bay Area to  inspect the Presidio of San Francisco, a historic military installation that  will be abandoned by the Army as a cost-saving measure and turned over to the  National Park Service for inclusion in the Golden Gate National Recreation  Area.  </P> <P> Lujan, who has been accused of being ignorant on issues facing his department,  plans to visit Yosemite National Park today and the Mojave Desert on Friday. He  came to California to give a commencement address Saturday at St. Mary's  College in Moraga, which he attended as a freshman.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Provisions bring sharp first-half fall at BNP BANQUE Nationale de Paris, one of France's biggest banks which is scheduled for privatisation this autumn, suffered a sharp fall in first-half net profits to FFr522m (Dollars 88.6m) from FFr1.33bn in the same period last year. News of the profits fall, which reflects a steep increase in the group's provisions, comes on the eve of BNP's forthcoming share issue. The French government last month chose BNP and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, as its first targets for privatisation. It is expected to decide by the end of next month which will be the first to be sold. Mr Michel Pebereau, whom the government appointed as chairman of BNP in May to spearhead the privatisation, earlier this summer warned that the group would report a steep fall in interim profits. The scale of the fall was in line with Mr Pebereau's forecast, but BNP fared better than expected in lifting first-half net banking income by 9 per cent to FFr21.23bn, from FFr19.48bn in the same period last year. It had anticipated a rise of 6 per cent. Group costs rose to FFr14.35bn from FFr13.88bn over the same period and operating profits increased to FFr6.88bn from FFr5.61bn. However, the group was forced to raise provisions to FFr5.82bn from FFr4.11bn due to the impact of the French recession on its smaller corporate customers and the need to make writedowns on its sovereign loans. Mr Pebereau is expected next month to present a new group strategy to employees in the approach to the privatisation programme. BNP has started to prepare for its move into the private sector by taking full control of Financiere BNP, a holding company with a 20 per cent stake in Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group. BNP has agreed to buy the remaining 49.9 per cent stake in Financiere BNP from the French government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ambassador to Thailand Le Cong Phung on 21 </F> February to a seminar organized by THE NATION and KRUNGTHEP  THURAKIT]    [Text] As you know, on February 3, 1994, U.S. President  Bill Clinton declared the lifting of the U.S. embargo on Vietnam  and proposed the mutual establishment of liaison offices in the  capitals of the two countries. The U.S. embargo against Vietnam  and the struggle for the lifting of this policy have been an  animated matter, closely followed by the public during the past  years. The declaration this time by President Clinton is a  positive and significant decision which contributes to the  opening of a new page in U.S.-Vietnam relations in the interests  of the two countries. This decision not only meets the desire of  the American and the Vietnamese peoples, but also meets the  desire of many other countries. The lifting of the embargo and  the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam relations will make a  significant contribution to the common endeavour for peace,  friendship and cooperation among nations all over the world,  especially in South East Asia.    I am honoured to inform you that the government and people  of  Vietnam welcome the decision of the U.S. government; the  government and people of Vietnam wish to express their sincere  gratitude to all those in the United States and in other  countries, to the government and people of Thailand,  particularly to H.E. [His Excellency] Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri himself, for their contribution to the lifting of U.S.  embargo and the improvement of relations between Vietnam and the  United States of America.    Ladies and gentlemen, the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam  brings about the appearance of a series of new problems and many  questions have been put forward, such as:    -- Will there be any change in the policy of investment and  trade of Vietnam? or,    -- How does the lifting of the embargo affect the economic  development of Vietnam? or    -- With the coming of U.S. companies into Vietnam, will  Vietnam pay more attention to the relations of cooperation and  investment with its neighbouring countries in the region or not?    And, so on.    It is necessary to reaffirm that the lifting of the embargo  and step by step moves towards the normalization of relations  with Vietnam by the U.S. will not divert the foreign policy and  foreign economic relations of Vietnam. The improvement of  U.S.-Vietnam relations will not obstruct or be detrimental to  the cooperation of Vietnam with other countries, especially with  countries in Southeast Asia. On the contrary, the lifting of  the embargo and improvement of the U.S.-Vietnam relations will  contribute to creating favourable condition for the stability  and economic development of Vietnam; promoting more quickly,  essentially and effectively the political relations, economic  cooperation and trade of Vietnam with countries in the region,  including Thailand.    The Vietnam National Assembly session in December 1993 and  the mid-term Congress of our Party in January 1994 reaffirmed to  continue our foreign policy of befriending all countries in the  world, firstly with neighbouring countries; to continue the  economic renovation, opening for cooperation with all countries;  to overcome shortcomings, modify and amend policies to more  effectively strengthen the investment cooperation with foreign  countries. In other words, politically, we do not want to side  with any country against others but we want to be the friend of  all countries on the basis of mutual respect. We shall continue  to adjust, amend and complete our economic cooperation policies  and investment laws in order to create conditions to encourage  foreign investors and partners.    We should also recognize as a matter of fact that many U.S.  companies will come to Vietnam in the post-embargo period. So  far, more than 30 U.S. companies have already opened  representative offices in Vietnam, some of which have begun to  operate. Dozens of other companies have been applying to come  to do business in Vietnam. With capital and technological  advantage, U.S. companies will be competitive rivals for  businessmen from other countries. It will be possible for  Vietnam to draw capital and expertise of over one million  Vietnamese residents in the U.S. But I myself believe that the  coming of U.S. companies into Vietnam will not bring about an  explosion of economic development of Vietnam. A major effect of  the lifting of the embargo is to relieve psychologically for our  friends to cooperate and invest in Vietnam. In the past,  affected by the embargo, some countries seemed to hesitate to  cooperate or invest in Vietnam; many kinds of goods technology  and equipment which we would like to trade with other countries,  were restricted. At present, the World Bank, the IMF and other  financial institutions, together with the joining of U.S.  companies in the Vietnamese market, there emerges a new  atmosphere in investment, cooperation and trade. Vietnam has  greater demand for economic development; the market of Vietnam  has much potential as a source of labour, natural resources and  consuming power. No individual country in the world, not even  Japan and the United States could meet the development demands  of Vietnam. We believe that the more the economy of Vietnam  develops, the more investment opportunities and commercial  relations will increase.    Regarding the investment area, after six years of  implementing the investment law, we have gained great  achievements, but at the same time there still exist problems  which need to be solved if we want to have rapid development in  the post-embargo period.    Over the past six years, we have granted 836 investment  licences with a total capital of over U.S.$7 billion. The  investment rate grew quickly. In the period of 1988-1991, it  rose with an annual average of 51 per cent. In 1992 it equalled  70 per cent of the previous four years. In the first ten months  of 1993, it surpassed the whole year of 1992, both in number of  projects and total capital. Of the total investment capital of  U.S.$7 billion mentioned above, the investment in 1993 amounted  to U.S.$3 billion.    The scale of investment also increased and there appears  more  big companies and groups. In the period of 1988-1990, the  average amount of capital for one project was U.S.$3.5 million,  but it rose to U.S.$7.6 million and $9.9 million in the  1991-1992 period and in 1993 respectively. Up to now, though  small scale projects account for 73 per cent of the total number  of projects, they occupy only 12 per cent of the total  investment capital. The investment form of 100 per cent  foreign-owned capital only accounted for 6 per cent in the  period of 1988-1992, now increases to 17 per cent with 128  investment licences and promises a rapid growth in the coming  time. During the initial years, most of the investment capital  concentrated on the fields of oil and gas (32 per cent) and  hotels (20.6 per cent), but since 1991, investment capital for  industry has grown. Now, 70 per cent of the total investment  projects is in the field of material production.    Our other significant achievement is that we have increased  the number of Vietnamese counterparts in joint ventures and  cooperation with foreign countries. The mechanism relating to  investment, management and regulations has made obvious  progress. Especially, we have formed a contingent of staff  capable of working with foreign counterparts. This is what we  never had in the past and also it's not easy to achieve within a  short period of time. With the momentum of economic development  in the past years, we have also achieved initial successes in  accounting and mobilizing domestic capital, contributing to the  increased effectiveness of joint ventures with foreigners.    Apart from the above-mentioned achievements, we also made  mistakes and there remain problems which need to be solved soon.  That is to quickly complete the legal system and regulations to  protect and encourage foreign investment; to strengthen the  state machinery, reduce the hurdles and bureaucracy; to urgently  solve the problem of infrastructure; to effectively train  management personnel, reinforce the contingent of staff capable  of working with foreign counterparts. And in the coming time,  priority should be given to investment projects in industry, oil  and gas, and infrastructure. Viet-Thai relations have been  finely developing. After the visit to Thailand last October by  H.E. Secretary General Do Muoi, in the next few weeks H.E. Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai will visit Vietnam to further cement the  relations of friendship and cooperation between our two  countries. Parallel to the development of the political  relations and the mutual confidence and understanding between  our two countries, it is the remarkably encouraging growth in  our economic relations. We are happy to notice that a number of  big companies or groups such as CP, Bangpakok, Saha Union,  Sahanarya, Siam Cement, Padang and so on and so forth, the big  banks like the Bangkok Bank, Thai Military Bank, Thai Farmers  Bank etc have made their presence felt in Vietnam apart from  many small and medium sized companies, and a number of joint  ventures and investment projects executed by Thai businessmen  have started their operations with initial results.    We also understand that some Thai businessmen still hesitate  in doing business in Vietnam. You are worried about the  uncertainty in our laws and regulations, the red tape and  bureaucracies, the unfavourable prices, low level of management  and the poor infrastructures.    Your concerns are correct. In fact, those shortcomings and  difficulties mentioned above are a hundred percent true.  However, I hold that they only constitute our country's  constraints and problems in its initial stage of development.  Vietnam embarked on its new economic policy with the investment  law less than six years ago. A six-year period is too short a  time for us to bring about a dramatic change for a whole  structure and a policy of economic development. I do not know if  there is any country which can progress without stumbling in  their initial steps of development.    The upgrading of infrastructure is our pressing requirement  and priority. Yet, to tackle this problem is not an easy task,  especially in the case of Vietnam which has proceeded from a  war-devastated economy with a low level of development. At the  moment we are concentrating our efforts to develop our  infrastructure through the use of funds provided by the IMF, the  World Bank, the ADB as well as ODA from various countries. We  highly appreciate the high determination of Thai companies like  Bangpakok which has been taking part in projects to develop the  infrastructure in Vietnam. We welcome a number of other Thai  companies which have submitted their applications for their  participation in building airports, seaports and upgrading of  transport and telecommunication systems in Vietnam.    Another concern of yours is whether or not Vietnam shall  continue to cooperate with Thailand after the lifting of the  U.S. trade embargo. I can assure you that we have and continue  to encourage and promote economic cooperation, trade and  investment with Thailand. It is our consistent policy that  conforms with the interests of stability and development of the  two countries as well as of other countries in the region.    I firmly believe that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo  will provide a more favourable condition for our two countries  to work together both in political and economic fields. Thai  investors may join U.S. companies in investing in Vietnam.  Thai-based American firms like Kodak Thai, Unocal Thai etc. may  easily have access to the Vietnamese market. There are  promising chances to realize the idea to turn Thailand into a  financial and technical gateway to Indochina and Vietnam. The  question is that in view of present constraints in the way to  invest in Vietnam, like law and regulations, facilities,  bureaucracies, low infrastructures and so on and so forth,  whether Thai investors should start their joint ventures,  investment or cooperation with Vietnam now or wait until  everything is satisfactorily prepared.    I am afraid that we can let the chances slip out of our  hands  if we hesitate.    Excellencies, Friends,    In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Vietnam will continue  to carry out its process of economic renewal, openness and  development of its economic, trade and investment with foreign  countries. While the lifting of the U.S. embargo and  particularly when the two countries can normalize their  relations, will facilitate the entry of American companies to do  business in Vietnam, we shall attach more importance to trade  and investment cooperation with other countries especially with  our neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand.</p>

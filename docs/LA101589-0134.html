			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEAHAWKS HOBBLING INTO SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> CHARGERS: A TEAM, SO FAR UNABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS' MISFORTUNES, TODAY  FACES SEATTLE -- ANOTHER TEAM IN TRANSITION.  </P> <P> The Chargers can't say timing has not been on their side. But in each of their  first five games, they have failed to take advantage of the wrecks that have  lined up across from them.  </P> <P> Take, for instance, Seattle -- their next opponent. The Seahawks come to San  Diego Jack Murphy Stadium today with an historically powerful running game  mired in a miserable slump.  </P> <P> Worse for Seattle, the Seahawks have lost both their games in the  highly-partisan Kingdome. Plus, they are missing wide receiver Steve Largent  (elbow) and linebacker Brian Bosworth (shoulder). Both are on injured reserve.  </P> <P> "We're not a real good football team at this point," said Seattle Coach Chuck  Knox. For the record, they are 2-3 and tied with Kansas City, the Chargers and  the Raiders for second and last in the AFC West behind Denver (4-1).  </P> <P> In a 20-16 loss to Kansas City at Seattle last week, the Seahawks blew a 16-3  halftime lead. Running back Curt Warner managed only one yard in seven carries.  Fullback John L. Williams wasn't much more effective. He gained 22 yards in  nine rushes. Only the Jets and the pass-oriented Dolphins have gained fewer  yards on the ground in the AFC than Seattle.  </P> <P> Nor were the Seahawks able to stop the run against Kansas City. Christian  Okoye, the Chiefs' 253-pound fullback, rumbled for 156 yards in 30 tries. It  was the most yards gained by a back in an AFC game this year.  </P> <P> The Chargers, it appears, are getting the Seahawks at the right time. But it  looked as if they were getting the Raiders at the right time in their season  opener.  </P> <P> The Raiders had just slogged through the first winless preseason in the history  of the franchise. Late reporting Marcus Allen was disgruntled and out of shape.  And quarterback Jay Schroeder left the game in the first period with a shoulder  injury and never returned.  </P> <P> Final score: Raiders 40, Chargers 14.  </P> <P> The next week Houston arrived in San Diego with one of the worst road records  in football. They were fresh from a 38-7 shellacking in Minnesota where the  Vikings had sacked their quarterback, Warren Moon, seven times.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody could be worse off than we are," said Oiler Coach Jerry  Glanville before the game.  </P> <P> Final score: Houston 34, Chargers 27.  </P> <P> The Chargers won their first game the following Sunday when they did play the  worst road team in football. When the Chargers beat Kansas City, 21-6, it was  the Chiefs' eighth consecutive loss away from home and the 16th defeat in their  past 18 road games.  </P> <P> The Chargers then outlasted Phoenix, 24-13, thanks, in large part, to the  absence of the Cardinals' leading rusher, Stump Mitchell (injury), and their  best pass rusher, Freddie Joe Nunn (suspension).  </P> <P> Last Sunday, the Chargers caught a flat Denver Bronco team that was still  trying to figure out how officials had allowed Cleveland's Matt Bahr to kick a  game-winning field goal downwind when it should have been against the wind.  </P> <P> But the Chargers lost, 16-10, when fourth-quarter mistakes separated them from  a victory that should have been theirs. Now come the struggling Seahawks.  </P> <P> Predictably, Charger Coach Dan Henning prefers to talk about what his team can  do to improve. "We have to be like we were against Phoenix and be up by 11 at  the end," he said. "That's when one critical error doesn't put you out."  </P> <P> Against the Seahawks, the Chargers will be without their best all-around  offensive weapon, Rod Bernstine. Bernstine, the Chargers' leading pass receiver  and third-leading rusher, injured his left knee against the Broncos and won't  play today. Diminutive rookie Dana Brinson (5-9, 167) will try to take his  place.  </P> <P> Defensively, right cornerback Sam Seale will probably return to the starting  lineup. Seale missed the Denver game with a sore shoulder. His replacement,  Elvis Patterson, did not tackle well.  </P> <P> Even though the Seahawks have only one rushing touchdown (tied for last in the  league with Miami), Henning insists it is only a matter of time before they get  untracked.  </P> <P> "The Seahawks are a team that doesn't change," he said. "They aren't trendy.  They have a formula and they believe in what they do. And I don't see a great  deal of change in the scope of what they're doing."  </P> <P> Still, one rushing touchdown in five games?  </P> <P> "Kind of uncharacteristic," said Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn.  </P> <P> "We just haven't played well in the three games we've lost," Knox said. "When  you lose, everything you do looks stupid."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Charger Hank Ilesic's 64-yarder last Sunday was the longest punt in the AFC  this year and tied for the longest in the league with Detroit's Jim Arnold.  After three games with the Chargers, Ilesic has risen to second place in AFC  punting with a gross average of 44.3. Houston's Greg Montgomery is first at  46.0. . . . The Chargers have lost eight of their past nine games to Seattle.  But the series, which started in 1977, is tied 10-10. . . . Veteran Ron Mattes  has replaced Notre Dame rookie Andy Heck at left tackle for Seattle. . . .  Seattle's leading receiver, Brian Blades, has 23 catches for 375 yards. But  their most efficient receiver, perhaps, is Paul Skansi. All three of Skansi's  touchdowns this year have come on third down. And 45 of Skansi's 53 career  receptions on third down have produced a first down. . . . No NFL team has  tried fewer field goals than the Chargers. But Chris Bahr has made good on both  of his attempts. The Chargers are second-to-last in the league in penalty yard  edge. Only winless Dallas is worse. . . . The Chargers rank last in kickoff  return average but first in opponent's net punting average.  </P></p>

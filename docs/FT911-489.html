			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Archaeology: Buried memories THE OTHER day as I climbed the steep hill on the south coast of Crete memories flooded back of my first excavation which followed a discovery on the island 29 years ago. In 1962 Sinclair Hood, Peter Warren and I came on the place when travelling around to look for ancient sites, following old Turkish roads that took us to out-of-the-way places. At Myrtos village on the edge of the fertile valley of the river Myrtos we camped on the beach. Next morning the villagers urged us to go and see the collection of local antiquities in the school. Little did I know that this would lead to uncovering a surprisingly rich Minoan village, with a 1,200 year lifespan, a huge quantity of finds, a communal tomb that was at the heart of the religious life of the village, a tower and cisterns that alter the conventional view that the Minoans were always at peace and a grand country house which, while not a palace like Knossos and Phaistos, was a local centre of the economy, administration and society with architecture to rival the palaces. A short look at the schoolmaster's collection from the hill of Pyrgos across the valley had us climbing it immediately. First, we saw fantastic views along the coast and up the valley to mountains that encircled the horizon. Then we came on the walls of a Minoan settlement. Pot shards on the ground told us at once that it had been inhabited for more than 1,000 years. We found ten stone vases in half an hour and sniffed a big discovery. In 1970 I was given a permit to start a dig. It is hard to believe now, but for the first fortnight we found nothing except a bare paved yard. We were amazed and disappointed. The team grew gloomy. So we had a party, which was an undertaking in the days when there was no electricity and an awful road to town and the village got meat only on Friday when the cafe owner killed a pig. But it did the trick. The next day at five past six, when some celebrants were still stumbling up the hill, we found a clay tablet written in the Minoan Linear A script recording 90 units of wine, probably as a tax return. These tablets are rare, restricted to first and second rank centres. It confirmed that Pyrgos was important. After that finds never stopped. We dug two more seasons and three short sessions and have found enough that is new and of good quality so that, 20 years and thousands of vases later, I am still studying the finds and learning more of the rich life of an early Cretan village. This past month I have been again at Knossos where the finds are stored to study them. The first settlement at Pyrgos belongs to the time before Crete had made the jump to a hierarchical society and the palaces built to enshrine it. It was founded around 2700 BC and burnt down around 2200, probably in war. Our earliest substantial buildings are of the second settlement (2100-1850), the period when the first palaces were built. People returned to Pyrgos and terraced the debris of the earlier fire to make a street along the west side of the hill. One of the oldest roads in Europe, it leads to a yard and two storey building which was a tomb, although it looks like a house. Such a formal approach means it was an important public monument, perhaps a memorial to the dead of that first destruction. For 600 years bodies were put in the tomb in a semi-basement burial chamber and offerings in an upper room at the level of the yard. The third settlement (1850-1650 BC) dates from the heyday of the first palaces. In an anteroom in the tomb a stack of 46 bowls, which may have been for soup for the dead, had slipped off a plaster shelf. In the chamber were male burials. (We do not know where the women went). A layer of white lime and charcoal separated them from the last burials, again male, which belong to the fourth settlement. The charcoal suggests fumigation, and the lime either that the dead were buried in quicklime to hasten decomposition and allow the bones to be taken up after three years and put in the next door ossuary (as happens in Greece today), or that the tomb was, as the Bible says, a whited sepulchre. The village also acquired a plastered cistern 3 metres deep and 5 metres in diameter to hold 90 tonnes of water, and from a tower overlooking it the villagers could have shot arrows when enemies attacked their water supply. On the top of the hill was another cistern, holding 22 tonnes and perhaps belonging to a ruler's mansion. Cisterns and towers, rare in Minoan Crete, point to war; a likely scenario as a fire also wrecked this settlement. Down the slopes were vast amounts of pottery. Putting the pots together was a giant jigsaw puzzle, as we found joins across 200 baskets of shards with 500-750 shards in each. But it has been worthwhile. Their close links with the pottery not of Knossos but of the Mallia palace along the north coast, as we and the French excavators of Mallia both discovered, point to a separate state in first-palace times centred on Mallia and including Pyrgos. Thus the broken pots reveal that Crete was not a political unity at the time. Pyrgos prospered most in its fourth phase, 1650-1450 BC, until fire and havoc struck again. Crete was then united under Knossos and the island was rich. A thousand vases and stone vases, daggers and conch shells covered the last burials in the tomb. A grand country house built of fine masonry and coloured stones ruled the village. It lived off the farming in the valley, keeping the produce in its storerooms and listing it on Linear A tablets, before sending some on to the palaces as tribute. I imagine a master builder was brought from Knossos to build this last and most splendid of the public buildings of Pyrgos, aligning it for the best view up the valley and laying out a courtyard in front of the house, where we found nothing in the first weeks. I should like to have met him and the other craftsmen in the 1,200 years of Pyrgos, to thank them for polished gypsum steps and tomb and cups and cisterns and all we have been fortunate to find 3,500 years later. They deserve all the time it takes to reveal their remarkable village.</p>

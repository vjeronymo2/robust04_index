			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / MP seeks end to payment delays GOVERNMENT action to deter large companies from delaying payments to subcontractors was demanded yesterday by Sir Peter Hordern, Conservative MP for Horsham, including allowing interest to be claimed on debts outstanding after a specified period. Mr Edward Leigh, a junior trade and industry minister, said some small companies feared such a move could damage them because it might encourage larger companies to impose longer payment terms.</p>

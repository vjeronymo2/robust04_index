			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 07, BNS -- The Estonian parliament,  with votes 63 for, nine against and three abstentions, today  passed the law on general elections. The new law stipulates  that members of parliament are elected by ballot in free  elections by universal, equal and direct suffrage.    Estonian citizens who on election day are at least 18 years  old have the right to vote, and citizens of at least 21 years of  age may run for parliament. Legally incompetent citizens are  deprived of the right to vote.    Under the Constitution, both regular and extraordinary  parliamentary elections are declared by the president. Regular  elections must be announced at least three months in advance.  Extraordinary elections are to be announced within three days of  when the need for them arises.    General elections will be financed from the national budget.  The election campaigns of political parties, election  coalitions and single candidates will get no funds from the  state or local budgets.    The national election commission will register the  candidates  elected to the parliament and publish the final election returns  with a complete list of persons elected not later than on the  10th post-election day. Parliament members will assume their  duties on the day the election returns are published.</p>

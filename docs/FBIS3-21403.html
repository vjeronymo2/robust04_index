The elections were held in the city on 28  January. The Palestinian Engineers' bloc, which is pro-Fatah,  and the unified Islamic slate, an alliance of the Hamas Movement  and the Islamic Jihad, won the board's eight seats, with two  candidates from the two sides being equal in number of votes.  Agreement was reached that membership for them would alternate  for a one-year period.    In addition, Fatah candidate Engineer Sa'd Kharma won the  board's chairmanship, by a margin of seven votes over his rival  Hamas candidate.    The Administrative Board is composed of Engineers Sa'd  Kharma  (chairman), Jamal al-Khadri, Rafiq Makki, Hassam al-'Alul, Nasr  al-Mazini, Raf'at Rustam, Salah al-Saqqa, Jamal Abu-Kashif,  Muhammad al-Wazir (first year), and 'Abd-al-Karim Muhsin (second  year).    Voting began in the morning and continued into the evening,  until the evening curfew--imposed by the occupation  authorities--ended the process. Out of the 939 engineers  eligible to vote, 804 participated.    Five electoral blocs competed in these elections, in  addition  to two independent candidates.    In the elections for the Administrative Board of the Arab  Lawyers League in the occupied territories, Fatah and the  independent bloc were victorious, since Lawyers Farid al-Jallad,  Mahmud al-Mallah, 'Awni al-Barbarawi, 'Ali Ghazlan, Nabil  Mashhur, Nasr-al-Din 'Anbatawi, Yasir Jabr, Muhammad Musallam,  Bassam Sahaliyah, Bahij al-Tamimi, and Walid al-'Aridah were  winners.    Thirty-four candidates competed for 11 board seats. The  number of lawyers voting totalled 368 out of 550 eligible to  vote.</p>

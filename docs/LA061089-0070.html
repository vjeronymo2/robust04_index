			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXTBOOK PURCHASING GUIDELINES ADOPTED;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARNED AGAINST TAKING PUBLISHER 'INDUCEMENTS'  </P> <P> A new "professional code of conduct" aimed at preventing abuses in the textbook  selection and purchasing process was adopted Friday by the State Board of  Education.  </P> <P> The new ethical guidelines come in the wake of disclosures that some publishers  have bought expensive meals and have paid for weekend "seminars" at fancy  resorts for local educators who select textbooks.  </P> <P> "Do we have widespread abuses? No. Are there some cases of abuse? Yes," State  Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said during discussion of the proposed  code. "I think this will help."  </P> <P> The code reminds school districts that it is a violation of state law for those  who evaluate and purchase textbooks to accept money, meals, gifts or other  "inducements" that might influence their decisions. The law also prohibits  publishers from making such offers to educators.  </P> <P> The code also asks each of California's 1,013 school districts to adopt  conflict-of-interest disclosure statements so that teachers and school  officials who write textbooks or consult for publishing companies do not also  participate in local selection decisions.  </P> <P> Some districts now require such disclosure but others do not.  </P> <P> Dan Chernow, chairman of the state Curriculum Commission, said the new  guidelines "will raise the consciousness" of both publishers and school  officials about ethical issues that are involved in the selection and purchase  of instructional materials.  </P> <P> Chernow said some recent disclosures of the "wining and dining" of textbook  evaluators were a "smoke screen" for publishers "who haven't been providing  quality materials."  </P> <P> But he also said that "it's become evident that some publishers'  representatives and some (school) district representatives have been violating  the law."  </P> <P> Board member Marion McDowell questioned the need for the conduct code.  </P> <P> "The board already has a code of conduct for professional people . . . and we  already have the state law," McDowell said. "I don't quite understand why we  have to have another code."  </P> <P> But McDowell joined in a unanimous board vote to approve the guidelines.  </P> <P> In another action, the board approved a "model school accountability report  card" that will provide the parents and students at every California public  school with important information on such subjects as test scores, dropout  rates, class size and expenditures per pupil.  </P> <P> Every school in the state must adopt either this model or some other version of  a school "report card" for the next school year.  </P></p>

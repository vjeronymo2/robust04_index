			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kalon shares fall after profits warning Kalon, the decorative paints group, yesterday warned that full-year profits would disappoint City expectations after weak sales in the UK retail market. The shares fell 16 1/4 p to 123 1/2 p yesterday as the company said pre-tax profits for 1994 were expected to be about Pounds 19.5m, compared with forecasts of Pounds 22m. Mr Mike Hennessy, chief executive, said sales and prices in the UK paint industry had deteriorated in the second half, although there was a slight recovery this month. The company also suffered as a result of the UK's unseasonally warm weather, which affected sales of its Vallance heating and insulation products. The group acquired Vallance in February for Pounds 6.2m. Kalon's French subsidiary, Novodec, is reported to have increased its paint volumes, while margins have come under pressure from competition. Novodec was acquired for Pounds 22m in February 1993. After raw material price rises of about 0.2 per cent in the first half, Kalon expects to raise its prices next year. 'Prospects for 1995 will be influenced by the recovery of the UK retail market, the ability to offset the impact of higher raw material prices and the growth in Kalon's paint volumes,' Mr Hennessy said. 'In the UK the Leyland trade centre opening programme will be accelerated and the retail market should be stimulated by the introduction of a new product range in the first half year.' Kalon reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.8m on turnover of Pounds 142.4m last year. In the first half, pre-tax profits rose 15 per cent from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 10m on turnover 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 83m, as trade sales replaced retail sales. Despite the disappointing profits, Mr Hennessy said the company was still looking for an acquisition worth less than Pounds 40m in continental Europe.</p>

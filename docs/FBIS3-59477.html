			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 14 December issue of Belgrade  POLITIKA in Serbo-Croatian reports on page 16 that Armin Pohara,  the "military-political adviser" of Cazin Krajina leader Fikret  Abdic, had stated recently that the ultimate goal of Alija  Izetbegovic's policy is "to create a new Muslim citizen and a  new state founded on militant Islam, regardless of how large  this state might be or where it is situated." Pohara points out  that one can increasingly find local Muslims who dress and  behave like mojahedin and find "their image in religious  fanaticism" and who, in waging war, invoke the name of Allah.  Pohara warns Europe to concern itself seriously with Muslim  fundamentalism and the creation of the first Islamic state in  the heart of Europe.    Viewing the repercussions that the creation of a Muslim  state  would have on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, POLITIKA  cites Predrag Simic, director of the International Institute for  Policy and Trade in Belgrade. Simic judges that the existence of  such a state would result in permanent military tension in the  region and that the borders of the newly founded states would  not be peaceful but increasingly resemble those between Israel  and its Arab neighbors. Simic believes that the Republic of  Srpska would suffer most in this situation through retaliatory  attacks by the Muslim state. He warns that the corridor between  the Serbian states would become a battleground because the  Muslims would attempt to break it to gain access to the Sava  River. It should be expected that an Islamic state, strengthened  by the support of the Islamic world, would establish links to  Sandzak, Kosovo, and Macedonia, Simic states, pointing out that  statistics show that Albanians will become the majority  population in Macedonia by 2005.</p>

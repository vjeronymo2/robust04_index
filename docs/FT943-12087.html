			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Shaw steps down at Premier Only two months ago, Roland Shaw, chairman of Premier Consolidated Oilfields, wrote to the FT pointing out that at 72 he was a mere stripling, compared to Armand Hammer who ran Occidental until he was over 90. But yesterday the US-born Shaw announced he was stepping down on August 3. Expansive in every sense, Shaw has been a large figure in the UK independent oil sector for more than two decades, having nursed Premier through good times and bad. His towering presence was said to be one reason why Premier never got gobbled up like other North Sea minnows. Shaw had already relinquished his executive role at the company 18 months ago. He hands over his remaining role to Richard Cox-Johnson, a non-executive director, until a permanent replacement is found. But this will not mark Shaw's final departure from the oil patch. He will continue to give time to Heritage Oil and Gas, where he is chairman, and to other oil interests.</p>

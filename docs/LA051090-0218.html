			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: CHOICE BETWEEN RIGHT WING AND LAROUCHE WING PIQUES SOME VOTERS  </P> <P> I get a lot of mail from Orange County citizens -- the majority of them  Republicans -- deeply distressed that election after election they feel  themselves disenfranchised because they are not offered local candidates they  can vote for in good conscience. These are people who find themselves  philosophically out of sync with the archconservative Republicans who mostly  represent Orange County in Sacramento and Washington but don't feel the  Democrats are offering enough viable alternatives.  </P> <P> Why, they ask, don't the Democrats give us more electable candidates? And how  can the Democrats screw up so badly that we sometimes find ourselves with a  choice between a Republican with totally unacceptable social views and a  follower of convicted felon Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.?  </P> <P> That scenario happened four years ago, when former Superior Court Judge Bruce  Sumner ran a successful write-in campaign to prevent a LaRouche candidate from  representing the Democratic party against Republican incumbent Robert Badham.  </P> <P> It happened two years ago in GOP incumbent William E. Dannemeyer's 39th  Congressional District, where the voters in the Democratic primary were offered  a choice between two candidates who both supported an AIDS referendum measure  that was rejected resoundingly in Orange County as well as throughout the  state. It is for all practical purposes happening in Robert K. Dornan's 38th  Congressional District this year. And it came within an hour of happening in  the 70th Assembly District now represented by Republican incumbent Gil  Ferguson.  </P> <P> The Democratic circus in Dornan's 38th district got most of the attention  because of Ron Kovic's well-chronicled last-minute defection. His hurried  replacement, abortion rights activist Barbara Jackson, decided after filing  that she was doing a disservice to her employer, Planned Parenthood, by running  and tried to withdraw -- too late. So now we have an official Democratic  candidate who says she won't campaign and "might" accept the Democratic  nomination if she wins it anyway. And standing in the wings, ready to represent  the Democrats once again is -- you guessed it -- LaRouche follower Art Hoffman.  </P> <P> The Kovic retreat tended to obscure what was taking place in the 70th Assembly  District, which is probably more typical of Democratic problems in Orange  County these days. The man who laid his body in the breach there is a highly  successful Newport Beach businessman and longtime Democratic activist -- and  former county chairman -- named Howard Adler. So I dropped by his office to  find out how all this happened -- and why. Along with answers, I also got a  short course in Orange County politics.  </P> <P> According to Adler, he hadn't the slightest intention of running for public  office in 1990. But on filing deadline day -- aware of the perils of rounding  up Democratic candidates in Orange County -- he phoned current party chairman  Michael Balmages to find out if a search for a candidate to run against  Ferguson had been successful. Balmages assured him that it had.  </P> <P> But later that day, only an hour before the filing deadline, Adler says  Balmages tracked him down in Richard O'Neill's Santa Ana office. Instant  crisis. It turned out the Democratic candidate in the 70th Assembly District  didn't qualify because he hadn't been a registered Democrat long enough. Would  Adler help?  </P> <P> "So," Adler told me, "since I'm the ultimate party man and also a little bit  crazy, I filed. I have no illusions about beating Ferguson in that district,  but there are other reasons we should run the best candidates we can find --  even in districts we know we can't win."  </P> <P> He suggested three paramount reasons:  </P> <P> * "If we have any real conviction in the two-party system, we have to give  people a decent Democrat to vote for."  </P> <P> * "Any activity we generate on behalf of our local candidates helps the top of  the ticket. Democratic candidates in Orange County should be running with the  understanding that their performance can have a considerable impact on state  and national candidates."  </P> <P> * "The Lyndon LaRouche dilemma. They'll fill every void they see, and if they  are allowed to do that, it gives them credibility with the public and seats on  the Central Committee. The Republicans, incidentally, have the same problem in  heavily Democratic districts."  </P> <P> Given these three reasons, why is it so difficult for the Democrats to field  viable candidates in so many Orange County contests?  </P> <P> "Because," says Adler, "the numbers make it clear that in most areas of Orange  County, the Democratic candidate doesn't have a chance. That hasn't always been  true, and I think it will change, but it is true right now."  </P> <P> Why is it true when polls consistently show that current Republican incumbents  in Orange County have social views very different from the majority of citizens  here -- especially on such matters as abortion and the environment? Why can't  the Democrats exploit this disparity?  </P> <P> Adler shrugged. "I don't believe those polls," he said. "Either they are  inaccurate -- people say one thing and believe another -- or those people don't  vote in elections. Then, of course, there are the business people who tell me  they are embarrassed by the quality of our representatives in Sacramento and  Washington, especially those who have violated laws and political ethics  because they don't feel they have to account to the voters. But if we give  these business people a good Democrat, they still won't vote for him because in  their social structure, it just isn't the thing to do."  </P> <P> Adler says he's already evolved the theme on which he plans to campaign, "and  I'll try to encourage other Democrats to do the same. If the Soviet Union and  Nicaragua and Eastern Europe can throw off the yoke of the one-party system, so  can Orange County. We need to restore the two-party system here."  </P> <P> He didn't smile when he said it.  </P> <P> He feels that politics tend to be cyclic and that a shift is taking place in  both the country and the state "because the public wants problems handled and  they feel the Democrats can do that better than the Republicans. When that  shift happens, when the state and national Democratic candidates become more  successful, it will be reflected here. There's a swing group of maybe 10% to  15% of Orange County voters who were Democrats in the Kennedy years and shifted  to the Republicans when Reagan ran. By 1994, we'll start seeing that swing  back, and then we'll get more viable local Democratic candidates."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some of us may be looking at a choice between LaRouche and LaRouche.  </P></p>

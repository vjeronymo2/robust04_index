			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke moves into US gaming business Ladbroke Group raised its stake in the global gaming market with the announcement yesterday of a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) deal to build a card club in California. The 60-table club is Ladbroke's first venture into the US gaming business and fits into the group's strategy of establishing itself as a major player in the worldwide casino market. Earlier this month, the company ended a 15-year absence from the UK casino business with the Pounds 50m purchase of three London casinos to add to its international collection of 13. Ladbroke was forced to give up four West End casinos in 1979 after allegations of malpractice over its attempts to win business from rivals. The US venture, in San Pablo in the San Francisco Bay area, is expected to be the first in a series of moves to begin gaming activities across the US. The company said: 'we are looking at a number of gaming opportunities around the world, particularly in the US where the gaming market is going through tremendous growth at the moment.' Another card club is planned in Albany, also in the San Francisco Bay area, where the group already owns and operates a racetrack. Ladbroke Racing Corporation, the group's US division, now hopes to introduce slot machines at its racetrack in Michigan. It owns two further tracks in Pennsylvania and Texas. The company intends to operate non-gaming facilities at the first card club, while leasing gaming operations to SF Casino Management. At present, Californian law prohibits a publicly traded company from holding a licence. Construction of the club is expected to begin this winter, in order to be open for business next autumn. The group's pre-tax profits fell 11 per cent to Pounds 51.3m for the six months to end-June, with turnover rising to Pounds 2.29bn (Pounds 2.21bn).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister said acquisition of F-16 fighter  aircraft by Pakistan will disturb the security environment and  escalate tension in the region. Addressing the Air Force  commanders conference in New Delhi today, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao  expressed concern over Pakistan's relentless efforts to  modernize its armed forces and air power far beyond its  legitimate requirements. He said that while the cold war has  ended at the super power level, the security scenario in  different regions continues to be remain dogged by conflicts and  disputes. Calling upon the Indian Air Force [IAF] to maintain  constant vigil, the prime minister emphasized that the IAF has  to maintain the highest level of operational preparedness.    Speaking on the occasion, the minister of state for defense,  Mr. Mallikarjun, said that India never seeks confrontation and  her quest for peace should not be misunderstood as weakness.  Earlier, the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul,  reviewed the air power prevailing in the region and its impact  on the security environment.</p>

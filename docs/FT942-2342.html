			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: CBI surveys a gremlin Sir, A gremlin seems to have entered Gillian Tett's thoughtful article, 'Business survey fans found mainly in City' (June 15) on the Confederation of British Industry's business surveys. For the record, our distributive trades survey, which was published earlier last week, usually gets about 500 responses from a sample mailing list of 1,500 and not 15,000 companies as stated. However, the companies which participate in our surveys cover 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades.

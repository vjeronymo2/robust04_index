			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A CEXTON SAMPLER  </P> <P> Among the better releases from the growing Cexton catalogue are:  </P> <P> JOHN ANELLO JR.  </P> <P> "For a Dancer"  </P> <P> "Jackson Street Beat"  </P> <P> Light, melodic pop jazz by "Mr. Relentless" himself, who turns out to be a  surprisingly gentle performer. Anello's sprightly melodies dominate both  recordings, along with a few strong passages from John Anello Sr.'s alto  saxophone and flute.  </P> <P> SCOTT KREITZER  </P> <P> "Kick 'N Off"  </P> <P> Tenor saxophonist Kreitzer plays his instrument with a brisk majestic authority  rarely heard in younger players (he is 23). His admiration of Sonny Rollins is  most notably apparent during a tour de force romp through "Airegin." A strong  rhythm section of Dave Samuels on vibes, Marc Cohen on piano, Harvie Swartz on  bass and Bill Stewart on drums provides sturdy support, but the addition of a  string section on several tracks is an unnecessary distraction from the  otherwise strong jazz proceedings.  </P> <P> BIG WORLD  </P> <P> "Devotion"  </P> <P> A fascinating recording from a trio -- pianist Rick Helzer, flutist/saxist Bill  Plake and percussionist Jeanette Wrate -- that ranges from avant-garde to  off-the-wall hard bop. Their performance of Ornette Coleman's "Lonely Woman"  perfectly captures the song's essence of timeworn sadness. The only thing  missing is the resonant undercurrent of a strong bass line (Charlie Haden would  sound terrific with this group).  </P> <P> LOREN PICKFORD  </P> <P> "Song For A Blue Planet"  </P> <P> Despite the New Age-sounding title, alto saxophonist Pickford's album is pure  mainstream jazz. Accompanied by a strong supporting cast that includes George  Roessler on guitar, George Cables on piano, John Heard on bass and Billy  Higgins on drums, Pickford applies his warm-toned instrument to a set of golden  standards ("Skylark"; "Alone Together") and originals.  </P> <P> CHIZ HARRIS  </P> <P> "Confirmation"  </P> <P> A straight-ahead blowing session, recorded "live" in the studio with an  audience. Drummer Harris, a longtime Orange County jazz figure, leads a group  that includes saxophonist Jay Migliori, pianist Joe Lettieri and bassist Isla  Eckinger. Guest trumpeter-fluegelhornist Conte Candoli provides added spice to  steaming, be-bop brew.  </P> <P> Other current Cexton releases include: "Leap of Faith" from Rob Silvan and the  eclectic vocal scat singing of Fine Line; "Spirit of Light," a pop-jazz  collection from a group called Axiom; and "This Was Meant To Be," featuring the  original songs of singer Barbara Reed. Scheduled for release in the next few  months are albums from trombonist Mike Fahn and guitarist Robert Conti. DON  HECKMAN  </P></p>

This is an all-time high in Russian-Chinese trade since  1991.  According to Bely, China holds second place after the FRG in  trade with Russia.    Bely believes that China is a very profitable partner for  Russia. Last year's trade balance between Russia and China was 2  billion dollars in Russia's favour.    True, Bely admitted, there is Moscow's clearing debts to  Beijing and also, as he said, "we owe China one billion  [currency not specified] for goods credit granted to Russia in  1991-1992".    Bely also noted that the problem of quality of Chinese goods  imported in this country remains. "But if we were not keen on  cheap goods, Russia could also purchase high-quality Chinese  commodities supplied to Europe and America," he added.</p>

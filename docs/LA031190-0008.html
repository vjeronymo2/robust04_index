			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARBS BENEATH THE GREECEPAINT;  </P> <P> GOATSONG: A NOVEL OF ANCIENT ATHENS BY TOM HOLT (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.95;  247 PP.)  </P> <P> The hero/narrator of "Goatsong" is Eupolis of Pallene, a "Comic playwright," he  tells us, with a capital C, in ancient Athens, the Athens of Pericles and Cleon  and Alcibiades, of Socrates and Euripides and Aristophanes, who is likewise a  Comic playwright.  </P> <P> Eupolis was a goatherd as a youngster, and he continues to have a warm feeling  for the countryside as opposed to urban, downtown Athens. His accounts of his  early years, of his experiments with play writing, of how the plague struck his  family, of how he met and married Phaedra, of how he was "drafted" into the  military on his wedding day and of how he returned to a career in the theater  are tongue-in-cheek.  </P> <P> The novel is a funny one but not funny ha-ha, except in a few set-pieces, such  as the lack of success of his first play and the misadventures of his wedding  night, which ends with his telling his bride, "And the hell with you too!"  </P> <P> He recalls being advised: "If ever you want to be a Comic poet -- God forbid,  it's a really rotten life, I'm telling you -- find yourself someone to hate,  and hate them as much as you possibly can."  </P> <P> He discovers that "all my family and household had died without letting me  know" and that "bad news takes at least a day to sink in properly." There is  more truth than humor in much of this, to be sure, as there is in his reference  to "the urban industries, like sitting on juries, metalwork and burglary."  </P> <P> At one point, he considers the Athenians' lack of interest in history: "I  suppose this is because we Athenians make all the history in Greece, and just  as you find that a weaver's cloak is threadbare and worn and a potter's house  is full of chipped and unglazed pottery, so we Athenians are most disdainful of  our own principal export and take no great interest in it."  </P> <P> Eupolis offers us an acidly pointed account of the Persian and Peloponnesian  wars and the Athenian imperialism, perpetrated, he says, to solve unemployment  problems. The government of Athens, we are told, was "the most pure and perfect  democracy the world had ever seen, in which every man had a right to be heard,  the law was open to all, and nobody need go hungry if he was not too proud to  play his part in the oppression of his fellow Greeks. . . ."  </P> <P> There is wit here, clever, barbed, irreverent wit. "Any fool," Eupolis says,  "can be a Tragedian. It takes courage to compose Comedy." And much of it has a  20th-Century reader nodding in grimly amused agreement. Even the more or less  lighthearted quarrels of Eupolis and Phaedra have a sour resemblance to today's  domestic disputes.  </P> <P> If you doubt the 20th-Century context, listen to Aristophanes' parting remark  after a chat in the street: "Is that the time? I've got to run." What clock or  watch was he looking at?  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Top Fiat executive faces corruption probe FIAT, Italy's largest private company, was yesterday dragged deeper into the country's spreading corruption scandals when a cautionary warrant was issued by Milan magistrates against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer. The warrant for alleged corruption relates to the activities of Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicle subsidiary, and allegations of kick-backs on a Milan municipal bus contract. Mr Garuzzo, number three in the Fiat hierarchy after Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman, and Mr Cesare Romiti, chief executive officer, said last night that the magistrates' action could be 'very damaging to the Fiat Group in general and in particular Iveco, as our business is world-wide'. Speaking from an undisclosed address in London, Mr Garuzzo said he had been 'most surprised' to hear about the warrant. 'I can only think that, as has happened to a number of people recently, the Italian investigating authorities prefer to hear from persons after they have been arrested,' he said. 'Only last Thursday (April 1), and again the following day, I specifically asked through my lawyer to be interviewed by the Public Prosecutor on aspects I could assist in of their investigation into the affairs of Iveco. 'I was told they were not interested, even though by Tuesday they had my request, in writing, to be heard.' Mr Garuzzo is the fifth Fiat executive to be caught up in the investigations. The legal moves against him mean the two key members of the younger generation of senior Fiat management, promoted in a shake-up to prepare for the departure next year of Mr Agnelli, have been implicated in the corruption scandals. The other executive, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, was arrested in February on charges of corruption. He was released but the charges were not dropped. They relate to L1.8bn (Pounds 745,000) paid by Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's construction subsidiary, during the building of the Milan metro. Mr Garuzzo, 54, has been with Fiat since 1976 and ran Iveco in 1984. He assumed responsibility for Fiat's industrial operations in November. Mr Mattioli looked after the financial side of the business.</p>

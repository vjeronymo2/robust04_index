			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACISM ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> I'm a Chinese-American parent of four college graduates. I'd like to comment on  the editorial.  </P> <P> From the day my children entered kindergarten through university, I implored  that they mix as much as possible with their fellow students. White,  Afro-American, Latino or Asian. I inculcated into their young minds that by  being friendly to all races during their formative years, it would make the  transition to adult life and into the multiethnic American mainstream much  easier.  </P> <P> I told them it was not only the right way, but the American way.  </P> <P> My early advice was well-taken. Today, my four grown kids are successfully  active in their chosen professions and well integrated into the American Dream.  </P> <P> MONROE LEUNG  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HOLY LAND PLAGUED BY FOUL WATER, HALO OF SMOG  </P> <P> In the decades that Israelis were kept busy building and defending their  nation, they had little time for the environment. As a result, the Holy Land  today is not blessed with clean air and water.  </P> <P> The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is a muddy stream with little  natural life left, and sewage is seeping into the biblical Sea of Galilee.  </P> <P> In this modern port city, residents are sometimes trapped indoors by  foul-smelling clouds of sulfur dioxide spewed from refineries and other  industrial plants.  </P> <P> Although some types of pollution are near catastrophic proportions, most  Israelis remain apathetic. Reports of mass fish poisonings are met with  indifference, and Israelis litter their streets and beaches with soda cans,  empty cigarette packs and plastic bags.  </P> <P> "The attitude of most people is that the main purpose is to build the country  and defend it," said Uri Merinov, head of the Environmental Protection Service.  </P> <P> "The environment is not a political issue in Israel. There is no real public  movement that demands environmental protection like in the United States or  Europe."  </P> <P> Israel does not have such severe problems as acid rain and ocean dumping that  have awakened environmental consciousness elsewhere in the world.  </P> <P> It was not until last December that the government formed an Environment  Ministry to gather under one agency enforcement powers that had been scattered  in 10 different ministries.  </P> <P> Environment Minister Roni Milo is still fighting with the agriculture and  health ministers over their refusals to surrender authority.  </P> <P> In the meantime, polluters continue to dump toxic wastes and send dangerous  fumes into the air.  </P> <P> One of the worst-hit areas is Haifa Bay, site of more than 2,000 industrial  plants, including a power plant and oil refineries that spew sulfur dioxide, a  colorless gas blamed for a host of health problems, including respiratory  troubles.  </P> <P> "Our old people are suffering from headaches and breathlessness," said Erika  Frasch, head nurse at the Iben Ezer Nursing Home, which has 30 patients and is  about two miles from Haifa's industrial area. "Myself, I feel like I'm  poisoned. There's smoke all over the city."  </P> <P> On April 30, the sulfur dioxide content in air increased after a refinery  filter broke down. With a dirty gray cloud hovering over the city, the elderly  and those suffering from respiratory or heart problems were told to stay  indoors. Schools canceled outdoor gym classes.  </P> <P> The accident dramatized Haifa's air problems, caused by spotty compliance with  already lax emission standards.  </P> <P> "In April, we measured violations on 10 days," said Zvi Fuhrer of the Haifa  Town Assn. for Environmental Protection.  </P> <P> He noted that the heavy fuel used in Israel's power plants and refineries  contains 3.2% sulfur, in contrast to a maximum of 0.5% permitted in Los Angeles  and 0.3% in New York.  </P> <P> The Environment Ministry wants tougher standards, but the Energy Ministry,  which runs the power plant and the refineries, argues that using low-sulfur oil  and installing scrubbers would make the plants unprofitable.  </P> <P> Although air pollution is a problem mainly in the industrialized coastal strip,  deteriorating water quality affects nearly all 4.2 million Israelis.  </P> <P> Water pollution has been causing dysentery outbreaks in Haifa and the Western  Galilee since 1985. In hot weather, health authorities frequently urge Israelis  to boil drinking water.  </P> <P> In the Sea of Galilee, which provides about 40% of Israel's drinking water,  "there has been a gradual but continuous deterioration in the quality of the  water," State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porat wrote in her 1989 report.  </P> <P> She noted that in Israel, water is not filtered and carries sediments that are  a fertile breeding ground for germs.  </P> <P> A major pollutant is sewage that overflows or is pumped backed into the water  system before it has been treated sufficiently, said Avner Adin, head of the  Department of Environmental Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  </P> <P> "There are no specific regulations on what sewage quality should be before it  goes into a stream or river," he said.  </P> <P> One of the rivers affected is the Jordan.  </P> <P> Adin, describing its condition as "not good," said both Israel and Jordan have  diverted water for irrigation, lowering the river's level and raising the salt  concentration. Sewage and other contaminants also seep into the river in the  north, he said.  </P> <P> Merinov blamed Israel's environmental problems mainly on unchecked industrial  development.  </P> <P> But he said public indifference left over from the ghettos of Europe and North  Africa -- where people had no control over the environment outside their own  homes -- was responsible, too.  </P> <P> "One of our major efforts is to change this attitude, but it's going to be  quite difficult," Merinov said.  </P></p>

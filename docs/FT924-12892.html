			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / W German retail sales fall 5.1% RETAIL sales in western Germany fell by a real 5.1 per cent in August, the German Federal Statistics Office has announced, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The figures, which come shortly after statistics showing that the level of industrial orders fell in August for the sixth consecutive month, provide further evidence of stagnation in the German economy. The retail figures show that the Bundesbank's high interest rates had begun to affect German consumers even before the economy was hit by the sharp appreciation of the D-Mark recently. The appreciation has damaged prospects for export-oriented Germany still further, as underscored by Friday's announcement from MAN - one of the largest engineering groups - that orders had dropped by 22 per cent between July and September, against the same period last year. September's producer prices, by contrast, suggest a slight easing of inflationary pressures. They rose by 0.8 per cent against the same month last year, whereas in July and August prices rose by 1.1 per cent. In the light of the poor data, economists are modifying their estimates for growth in west German GDP; Goldman Sachs, for example, has recently scaled back its 1993 growth prognosis from 2-2.5 to 0.5 per cent. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, has welcomed the offer from the country's most powerful union to hold back pay rises for five years to no more than is required to maintain purchasing power, adds David Goodhart, Labour Editor. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of I G Metall, offered the pay pact under a solidarity accord designed to place financing of German unification on a sounder footing. But he insisted that the burdens of reunification should not just fall on wage earners.</p>

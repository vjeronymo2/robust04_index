			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jean Guzman of the Haitian Revolutionary Party [PRH]  condemns the decision of the Committee of Actions for National  Reconciliation [CARENA]. The resolution is illegal, says Mr.  Guzman, who recognizes only the authority of the head of the  executive for the convening of a national conference:    [Begin recording, in Creole] Only the executive power,  jointly with parliament, has the right to convene a national  conference. I therefore declare that all they have done and all  the resolutions they have adopted are null and void. That is why  we in the PRH call for mobilization of the entire Haitian people  of the nine geographic departments to denounce these people who  know very well that they are only aggravating the situation. The  essential solution to the crisis resides in the agreement signed  on Governors Island between President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and  General Raoul Cedras. [end recording]</p>

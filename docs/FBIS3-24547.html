			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Vasiliy Kalita: ``What Do You Feed </F> an Infant?'']    [Text] We adults have gotten used to  all kinds of deprivations. But what is an infant just born to  the light of day to eat? This is a very urgent question in the  Ukrainian capital.    A young mom inquired at one of the children's polyclinics in  Kiev: ``Doctor, please give me a prescription for some baby  food. I can't find any, and he isn't breast feeding....'' A  joke? Unfortunately, no. Mothers of newborn infants have started  turning to doctors as a last resort.  <H5>  A Kitchen Where They Don't Make Anything </H5>   I went to the nearest children's dairy kitchen which,  according to the idea, was supposed to provide assistance to  mothers and children first. They looked at me like I had just  fallen from the Moon:    ``We don't make anything at all for newborn infants, but we  do make some things for older children starting to eat solid  food.''    What is an unfortunate mom to feed an infant being raised on  formula--that's 70 percent of the infants in the city, by the  way?    As it turns out there are two solutions to our situation.  The  first is to go to the market and buy imported baby food there.  But given an impoverished existence, far from every mother can  allow herself to do this. You have to put out 1,500-2,000  karbovantsy in coupons for a package of formula. For some  mothers this is a month's wages. The second option is left to  them--going to the dairy store. After standing a couple of hours  in line, such a mother would buy milk, dilute it, and give it to  the youngster. If the child is a little older, she would prepare  a gruel of some sort. But this is hardly what a youngster needs  for normal development, just so that its legs would grow strong.    ``Yes, that's the way it is,'' was the confirmation I got to  my conclusions at the Main Territorial Medical Association under  the state administration. ``We are seriously troubled by this  issue, and we've been trying to do something about it for a long  time....''    In our city there are 28,000 youngsters up to 1 year old.  Nutrition support is catastrophic. Given an annual demand for  dry adapted--that is, prepared according to all of the  rules--formulas of 705 tonnes, the trade system hasn't sold  anything for the last year and a half. The absence of such food  products forces parents to feed their youngsters whatever they  can. And this raises morbidity and mortality.    Could it be the older youngsters are in a better position?  If  only that were true: Given a daily demand of 450,000 baby food  portions, five times less is actually prepared for them.    And what can you ask those 13 dairy kitchens (for the entire  population of 3 million) to do? Their output is low, they are  primitive, with manual labor dominating. How can there be any  discussion of quantity and quality of food products? And it is  impossible to reequip them: All of them are set up in  residential buildings, and you're not going to start filling  them with industrial equipment.    So who can you count on? On the city's dairy industry? Yes,  it does produce sterilized milk in 200 gm packages. But this is  only 1.8 tonnes, as compared to a daily demand of 7.    The city is feeling an acute shortage of juices and of  strained fruits and vegetables. The demand for them is 15-20  percent satisfied. The assortment is extremely limited.    With our life today being as difficult as it is, there are  many needs to be met. In the opinion of some officials there are  problems of even greater importance, and so this one--baby  food--is relegated to the back burner. There's also the  psychological set that somehow we'll squeak by with the help of  a kind uncle. Yes, kind foreign uncles organizing humanitarian  aid can be found. The city received a hundred tons of food for  youngsters. It was immediately distributed among the rayons.  However, this is but a drop in the ocean. And the spring is  extremely unreliable--today it's flowing, but tomorrow it may  dry up.    No, we need to resolutely seek and find our own domestic  sources.  <H5>  The Legacy--24 Decrees </H5>   This problem didn't of course come up just today, or even  yesterday. It is a legacy of former times. The former Ukrainian  Communist Party Central Committee and Ukrainian Council of  Ministers adopted 24 decrees on this issue in the last few  years. To what end? The Khorol and Balta baby food plants  existing today in Poltava and Odessa oblasts have stopped  putting out the products children need. It would have been nice  to organize production of the popular baby food Vitalakt in  Kiev, but beginning this year it will no longer be produced.    Ukrainian scientists and specialists in baby food have  created other food products. Samples have been tested, and all  of the requirements on goods of this kind have been  observed--homogeneity, sterilized raw materials, preservation of  nutritional value, modern preparation procedures. And all of  this has been gathering dust on archive shelves for years on  end. Is an enterprise that would accept responsibility for  placing the developments of scientists into production, one  which would work for the good of the children, really not to be  found in a city of 3 million? And what about the farmers? If  they wanted to, of course they could find the needed raw  materials.    Baby food is not a public health problem. Nonetheless, the  Main Territorial Medical Association of the state administration  is energetically trying to get something going. S. Osipenko, a  pediatrician by trade who knows her business well and the  director of the association's department for safeguarding  maternity and childhood, showed me a thick file of  correspondence with higher and other bodies of administration.  Medical workers have done more than just provide warnings of the  disastrous situation--they offered and continue to offer  specific proposals that take the difficulties of the current  economic situation in Ukraine into account.    The first proposal is, let us say, the minimum program:  appropriating the needed amount of hard currency to the city for  the purchase of baby food abroad.    Sima Ivanovna Osipenko showed me samples of such products.  One is made by a Polish company--Bebiko. The mother places a few  spoonsful of the package contents in water, and a minute later  she can feed her infant. Or there's strained corn produced by an  Israeli company--tasty, nourishing, and extremely easy to  manufacture.    It would be good to buy such things. But they are expensive,  and beyond the means of many mothers. Subsidies are necessary.  This is what the Main Territorial Medical Association took to  the city's state administration.    But we also need to think about the maximum program--we  can't  buy food products abroad forever, we need to learn how to  produce them ourselves. To finally surmount the disastrous  situation, medical specialists propose, as a beginning,  accelerating construction of a specialized shop at City Dairy No  4 in Minskiy Rayon, and a baby food factory-kitchen in  Troyeshchina-Vygurovshchina producing 40,000 portions per shift.    But why has the health service been working alone on this  problem all of these years? Why is the trade department, which  could make a certain contribution to eliminating the shortage if  it so desired, sitting on the sidelines?    Interested departments were convened at the offices of the  state administration's department of food, trade and the  consumer market in order to discuss this problem, and to finally  come up with specific ways of solving it. Trade workers from the  state-run company Kiyev were invited to the conference. The  question of purchasing imported baby foods was thoroughly  discussed. The Kiyev firm was directed to implement the  proposal--in particular, to make contact with foreign firms and  make the best deal. And so, what happened? A considerable amount  of time has passed, but things still haven't gotten off the  ground. There remains the maximum program--organizing our own  production. Specialists unanimously agreed that this question  has to be resolved at the state level. If we are unable to do  so, we will be faced by a universal increase in the morbidity  and mortality of young children, including infants up to a year  old, and steady worsening of the demographic situation. Are we  really going to let things slide until even more women decide  not to have any children at all?</p>

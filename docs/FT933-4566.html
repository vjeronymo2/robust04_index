			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Seasonal losses deepen at JW Spear SEASONAL LOSSES at JW Spear &amp; Sons, the toys and games company, deepened from Pounds 315,000 to Pounds 861,000 in the half year to July 2. The company blamed delayed orders and the inclusion of usual losses from two acquisitions. Turnover was static at Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 8.28m). Exports and the addition of purchases in Belgium and the Netherlands made up for lower UK sales. The company said that the seasonal pattern had changed as customers had proceeded cautiously. Fully diluted losses per share were 12.35p (4.8p). The interim dividend is being raised to 3p (2.5p). Mr Francis Spear, chairman, said that orders were now ahead of the previous year. He thought it would be another year of steady growth.</p>

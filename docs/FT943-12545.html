			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Longer rail strikes 'will hit industry' Producers of bulk materials normally carried by rail have warned of losses and potentially serious shortages and delays for industry when the rail strike is stepped up this week. Signal workers are switching their action from 24-hour strikes to a 48-hour stoppage from noon tomorrow to noon on Thursday, hitting train movements over three days. Supplies of crushed rock used for road construction and repairs in south-east England will be particularly badly affected. The region, which has no locally produced hard rock, imports about 250,000 tonnes a week by rail. ARC, a subsidiary of Hanson and one of the country's biggest aggregate producers, said it could lose Pounds 1m a week when the rail strike worsens. It said it was uneconomic to transport crushed rock by road for more than 80 miles to 100 miles. ARC and Foster Yeoman, a large independent aggregate producer, jointly own Mendip Rail, which transports 7m tonnes a year of West Country limestone to more than 20 rail depots in south-east England - accounting for almost 60 per cent of crushed rock brought in to the region. It said that running additional trains on non-strike days would not help, and added: 'Few depots are large enough to accommodate stockpiles.' British Steel, the third-largest railfreight customer, said that if 48-hour strikes continued it would have to consider switching more freight to the roads. The concern of big customers was shared by the railfreight companies. Railfreight Distribution, which handles containerised freight and Channel tunnel freight business, warned that the escalation of the strike would hit customer confidence. Trainload Freight Southeast, one of three regional companies which together carry about 90m tonnes a year of bulk materials, expressed concern about the long-term effects of the strike. So far it had been able to shift freight movements to non-strike days and would be seeking to run more freight trains on strike days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Nuremburg (DDP/ADN) -- During the six months of  its EU presidency, which begins on 1 July, Germany will be  making efforts, in particular, for the inclusion of the Central  and East European countries in the European Union. This was  stressed by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to journalists  in Nuremburg today. Other goals were the enlargement of the EU  with the admission of the Scandinavian countries and Austria by  the deadline on 1 January 1995, and employment policy at  European level.    Kinkel strongly criticized the policy on Europe pursued by  Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber. EU "defeatism" in  Germany was particularly uncalled for in that there was no other  country that was as dependent on Europe as the Federal Republic.  The FDP [Free Democratic Party] would set itself up as a "party  for Europe" in the forthcoming election campaigns.    Kinkel described the outcome of the elections in Italy as  "worrying." However, developments concerning the formation of  the government were still awaited. Germany and France have to  have very great interest in a rapid emergence of a stable  government in Italy.

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Crime doesn't pay: Security problems are exacting an ever-increasing toll on the retail industry The staff at the Marks and Spencer store in St Albans grew suspicious when the pram lingered for an unduly long time behind a pillar - out of sight of the closed-circuit televisions. A store detective was despatched to investigate and watched as a couple systematically picked clothes off the racks and fed them through the false floor of the pram into a large cardboard box beneath. The police were called. The couple were arrested. Almost Pounds 1,500 of goods was found in the pram while a further Pounds 2,000 of clothes had been carefully stashed on racks in the couple's van outside. The police also discovered a long list of clothes in the van with their precise product codes and price points written beside them. Each item had been ticked off as it was stolen. Mr Marc O'Connor, store manager, says four people were involved in this particular ring, which had raided many stores over several months. They went around public houses in a particular area, asking drinkers what goods they would like and then simply went out and stole them. 'They were an organised team who were clearly stealing to order,' he says. This example of organised theft typifies the growing and costly threat posed by crime to UK retailers. Yesterday's firebomb attacks in Milton Keynes reveal one horrifying dimension of the problem. Eight fire bombs were planted in the town's shopping centre, and while only two went off  - in Habitat and BhS - the attack caused considerable disruption. Violence is the most graphic aspect of the crisis facing retailers. But shoplifting, internal fraud, ram-raiding, extortion, kidnapping and wage heists are also preoccupying them more than ever before. The Home Office estimates that about Pounds 2bn a year is lost through shop theft alone - a figure considered very low by many retailers. But to put even that figure into context, it is about the same as the annual turnover of the W H Smith group, which has 1,100 stores. Until recently, retailers were reluctant to discuss crime, fearing that to talk openly about it was somehow an admission of failure to resolve the difficulty. Others believed that publicity of individual cases would fuel copy-cat attacks. But the scale of the problem is now so great that the retail trade associations are increasingly speaking out and pressing the government for solutions. Individual industry leaders are also adding to the pressure. Last month, for example, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, told shareholders that the company had increased its security budget from Pounds 15m to Pounds 21m in the past year. He went on to criticise the lenient sentencing policy of many courts. 'There is not a day that goes by when we have a store that is closed by a bomb threat or a week that goes by without violence in our stores. We have had armed hold-ups at the back of our stores. We have had staff held up with 12-bore shotguns,' he said. Last year, M and S recorded a 23 per cent increase in violent 'incidents' over 1990. The company arrested 15,000 shoplifters - almost 50 for every day its stores opened. Mr Derek Hayes, the divisional director responsible for M and S's store operations, estimates the company's annual loss from theft at Pounds 30m, under 1 per cent of turnover. That figure is lower than for many other retailers, which budget for losses of between 1 per cent and 5 per cent. Electrical goods retailers have arguably suffered the most from crime over the past few years as a result of ram-raiding - where cars are driven at high speed through the windows or doors of stores and occupants make off with looted goods. Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, says: 'Ram-raiding has become part of the local criminal culture. A rite of passage. 'Have you done the Currys or the Dixons this week?' they ask.' One of Dixons' stores in Birkenhead, on Mersyside, has been the subject of 14 criminal attacks over the past year. And although a host of defensive devices - such as metal shutters, bollards and car traps - has largely negated the threat of ram-raiding, alternative methods of forcing entry are now being employed. Security guards, closed-circuit televisions, bullet-proof glass and panic buttons for shop assistants have become part of the fixtures and fittings of a modern retail outlet. Increasingly, high-tech solutions are being sought. Dixons, for example, has spent millions of pounds installing a security system which links 500 of its trading sites into one cental monitoring room based in a secret location in Hertfordshire. From this one room, security guards are able to monitor its sites by way of video cameras. The police argue that counter-measures to combat crime are more likely to deflect rather than deter crime: such measures are more likely to lead to attacks on less well-protected stores or to an escalation of violence. Mr Tony Whitmarsh, chairman of the British Retail Consortium security committee, fears that tackling crime in one sector of the high street will only push it into another. He believes that the big companies which can afford to install counter-measures 'will drive the problem down to the smaller retailers, which are less well equipped financially to deal with the problem. At the end of the day that is going to lead to less consumer choice for high-quality high-price goods,' he says. But one solution the retail trade agrees upon is that sentencing of offenders should be more rigorous and consistent. There is nothing more frustrating, they say, than to apprehend offenders only to see them released the next day with a caution. The British Retail Consortium, the industry's trade association, is attempting to stimulate a debate about how best to deal with criminals. It favours more aggressive prosecutions, some means of obtaining restitution from offenders and rehabilitation courses (which have been successfully tested in the US). It is holding a conference in October to discuss the issue of retail crime with representatives from the Home Office, the Crown Prosecution Service and police forces. The problem for retailers is that they have to deter criminals while not alienating honest customers. It is difficult to design stores that are attractive and also secure. There can be few actions more guaranteed to ensure that customers do not return than to arrest them falsely or subject them to heavy-handed security treatment. There is also a danger that retailers could misinterpret some shoppers' eccentricities. One director of a chemist's chain, who fancied himself as a detective, shamefacedly recalls how he once spent hours following a shifty-looking youth around a store. Just as he was about to challenge him, the shopper plucked up courage, approached a sales counter and whispered: 'A packet of condoms, please.'</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Bank on Debt: Plight of poor countries belies claim that the crisis is ended MORE than two dozen of the world's poorest countries face continuing debt problems and need greater forgiveness of their debt burdens, the World Bank says today. These countries, which have for more than a decade faced problems in servicing debt owed mainly to official creditors, belie the fast-growing conventional wisdom that the debt crisis has come to an end. 'External viability for these countries remains to be established and will require, in many cases, stronger adjustment policies and additional forgiveness of their debt burdens,' says the bank in an assessment of the 10 years of the developing country debt crisis. However, it adds later that 'the debt crisis facing middle income countries worldwide is past'. According to bank definitions, middle-income countries include Latin America's largest debtors, such as Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina. These countries' main concern is now to maintain and strengthen their market access. Preserving market access also remains an important concern for a group of other countries - it cites 14, including China, India, Indonesia, Hungary and Algeria - that have maintained debt servicing throughout the 1980s. However, for the severely-indebted low income countries - most of them in Africa, owing most of their debt to official creditors - the picture remains bleak. Even with the proposed 'Trinidad Terms' treatment of their debts to export credit agencies - which is more favourable than existing treatment - and a total write-off of all their aid debts 'the restoration of external viability may require additional action by official and commercial creditors', the bank argues. The poorest countries, most heavily dependent on concessional foreign aid, are also suffering a decline in development assistance, the bank says, adding that this is due to constrained aid budgets in developing countries. The statement will reinforce concern that the entry of new aid claimants in eastern Europe and elsewhere will diminish the aid available to traditional beneficiaries. The bank also acknowledges that for some smaller countries 'commercial banks have little incentive. . . to incur the administrative costs of regularising the debt in some countries that account for only a small fraction of their balance sheets.' In other countries, conditions in the debtor countries have hampered negotiations. In either case, 'there is no simple solution to the commercial bank debt overhang of these countries.' The bank rejects the idea of an officially-created facility to buy back this debt at a discount. It takes the view that the current case-by-case approach of the debt strategy offers the best hope. Overall debt of developing countries - including the former Soviet Union, added to the figures for the first time - are expected to rise this year to Dollars 1,703bn, from Dollars 1,608bn at the end of last year. The main factor behind this was the depreciating dollar, which swelled the value of non-dollar denominated debt, as well as new debt flows. However, debt ratios are not expected to worsen this year because of improved economic performance and trade conditions. The overall debt-to-exports ratio is expected to stabilise at about 178 per cent, while debt-to-GNP will stick at around 37 per cent. This hides a slight improvement in the overall ratios for those countries defined as highly indebted.</p>

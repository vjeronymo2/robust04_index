			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 7 Jun (AFP-NA) -- Official sources said on  7 June that Chilean President Eduardo Frei will not approve any  "new amnesty law" to liberate military officers accused of  violating human rights under the Augusto Pinochet regime.    More than 500 cases of assassination, kidnapping, and the  disappearance of nearly 1,000 individuals who opposed Pinochet  -- whose regime extended from 1973 to 1990 -- were filed in  court during the four years of Patricio Aylwin's administration,  who was succeeded by Eduardo Frei.    "We support the principle that those found responsible by  the  courts should be punished," Secretary General of Government  Victor Manuel Rebolledo said.    "A new amnesty law has not been contemplated," Rebolledo  added, referring to the amnesty law promulgated by Pinochet in  April 1978 freeing many of his agents from facing trials for  crimes committed before that date.    One of those crimes was the assassination of former Foreign  Minister Orlando Letelier, who was killed by a bomb that  exploded under his car in downtown Washington on 21 September  1976.    On 3 June, the Supreme Court refused to apply the amnesty  law  to absolve two of the main culprits in that crime, former  intelligence chief General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro  Espinoza, who were sentenced by a lower court to seven years in  prison.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SKINNER INFORMS CHECCHI ON STUDY  </P> <P> Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner met today with Los Angeles investor  Alfred Checchi to disclose findings of his review of Checchi's $4-billion  takeover of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines.  </P> <P> But the Transportation Department will not comment on the meeting or on  Skinner's findings, said Hal Paris, a department spokesman. The findings may be  made public next week, Paris added.  </P> <P> Skinner "didn't want Mr. Checchi reading about (the findings) in the paper,"  Paris said.  </P> <P> Checchi could not be reached for comment after the meeting and a Northwest  spokesman did not immediately return a phone call.  </P> <P> Checchi led a group including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines that agreed during the  summer to pay $121 a share for NWA, based in Eagan, Minn.  </P> <P> Skinner has expressed concern about the foreign ownership and safety of  airlines taken over in leveraged buyouts. Northwest, the nation's  fourth-largest airline, was saddled with a $3.1-billion debt after the  takeover.  </P> <P> Skinner has the power to revoke the airline's operating certificate but that is  considered unlikely.  </P></p>

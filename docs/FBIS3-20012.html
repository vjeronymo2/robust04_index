			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ioannis Papadhopoulos] </F>   [Excerpts] This morning President Konstandinos Karamanlis  will attend the official mass at the Athens Cathedral and watch  the Armed Forces parade. In his message, Karamanlis notes that  experience, both old and new, has taught us that social  tranquility and national unity are necessary for security and  progress in a country. He noted that we have been unable to  implement these truths because political life is usually  conducted in a tense climate due to intense political passions.  [passage omitted]    The president said that bringing our economy nearer the  economies of the other European Union member states should be a  national priority. He also stressed that Cyprus' long suffering  is continuing and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM] continues to be provocative. Karamanlis added that if  the international community does not have the courage to make  FYROM comply, then with the careless policy that it is  following, FYROM may cause instability in the wider region.  [passage omitted]    In his message on Greek Independence Day, Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou referred to the current foreign policy  issues. He stressed that the Cyprus issue continues to be the  major national issue -- an issue of invasion and occupation by  the Turkish forces, an issue of violation of the international  law. Papandreou said: With its decisive stance on FYROM, Greek  foreign policy made the entire international community realize  that Greece is the one that has specific proposals on how to  resolve the problem, contrary to the FYROM Government's  continuing intransigence. Papandreou added that a firm and  fundamental goal of our foreign policy is respect for the human  rights of the Greek minority in Albania.    Papandreou concluded by stressing: With its stance, our  country is continuously demonstrating its particular interest in  peace, stability, and security in the broader region. [passage  omitted]</p>

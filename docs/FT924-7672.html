			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / As they say in Europe: Pick your sides; peasant or cop - James Morgan is reminded of a confrontation outside a pub THIS WEEK I was reminded of an incident of some 20 years ago when I emerged from a south London pub with a friend of Irish ancestry at 11pm. He went up to a policeman a few feet away and asked what he was doing. The policeman said he was checking that customers left the pub on time. My friend detected a Belfast accent and replied, 'It's a free country over here you know. We can't have any of your police state customs in London.' I stole off into the night but was later reprimanded by my friend for having left him in the lurch. 'I would have stood by you if you had been in trouble,' he said. Thus the French papers turned on their partners, especially Germany, for having left France in the lurch over the Gatt row. France-Soir had a cartoon showing Germany and Britain, supporting the world's policeman, the US, by stabbing France in the back. In Le Figaro Alain Peyrefitte, a prominent peasant worshipper, criticised his government's weakness: 'Why did we wait so long to show our partners that France attaches an essential importance to the need for the indispensable compromise not to damage our agriculture? Why did the Community give way in advance to American demands without having received anything in exchange?' The view that the French have been excessively diffident in the defence of their interests is not one that finds much of an echo elsewhere. But it is Jacques Delors, and his supposed dedication to the interests of his motherland, who has become the target of an upsurge of anti-French sentiment. Handelsblatt of Dusseldorf wrote, 'It is extraordinary that Delors, one of the leading campaigners for European integration, should bear the main responsibility for the biggest crisis the Community has yet faced.' The Paris correspondent of the Borsen-Zeitung said Delors was among the losers of the present row. Jorg Foshag shared the British view that the EC-President was putting his ambition to become President of France ahead of European interests. Politiken of Copenhagen sounded even more British: 'If, in a kindergarten, one small bullying child is intent on dominating other children, causing trouble with other classes, sabotaging unity and able to see things from only one perspective, the good teacher enters the fray and makes that child behave. But that does not happen in the European Community. No, we are not talking about Denmark, but France . . .' But is it the British, the Danes or the French who are the most unpopular in the Community today? The Dutch business paper NRC- Handelsblad ran two editorials on this disruptive trio in tandem. The first concluded: 'France has done everything it can to torpedo an agricultural agreement with the United States. In France agrarian and anti-American sentiments go hand in hand.' The second consisted of a critical account of how British domestic politics had damaged the process of Maastricht ratification and asked if the majority 'really want - if they wish to save the Union - to pull the Community from the downward spiral into which it has fallen because of the Danes and British.' In southern Europe, there was less fury but what there was was directed at Britain. The delay in ratifying the treaty became the main international headline in the Madrid paper, ABC on Tuesday. The paper's Brussels correspondent, Francisco de Andres said the promise of the British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, that the Edinburgh summit would clear up outstanding questions would no t allay the fears of Britain's partners, 'Nor would the platitude 'better late than never,' which refers implicitly to the delaying agreement reached with the 'Eurosceptic' wing of the party, and which is the only way of assuring that Britain will ratify Maastricht in its present form.' On the other hand the British believe they have made a new friend this week. President Yeltsin's welcome was about as lavish as any such occasion could be. But the Moscow press looked coolly at the event. I make no apology for ending this column yet again with Komsomolskaya Pravda: that one-time organ of the communist youth organisation combines limpid prose with lateral thinking in an unusual manner. 'London streets saw no-one rejoicing at the Russian president's arrival in Britain. And the press reported the visit in quite moderate terms . . . Yeltsin definitely managed to produce a favourable impression on the British MPs even though he overdid his thesis on the collapse of communism. But then the British were putting too much stress on Yeltsin's heroic ascent of the famous August 1991 tank.' The president is not quite the hero in Moscow that he is in London. But that is nothing new. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

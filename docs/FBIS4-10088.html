			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Pyotr Deinekin [name as  published], commander of the Russian Federation Air Force, said  his institution opposes any type of bombing of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Serbs, Croats, Muslims, or "anybody."    Deinekin made these comments on 22 March in an interview  with  EL MERCURIO during which he also referred to the visit of a  large Russian delegation to FIDAE 94 [International Aerospace  Fair] and his country's offer to train a Chilean cosmonaut.    Asked about the recent NATO threat to the Serbs surrounding  Sarajevo (former Yugoslavia) to use airplanes to bomb them if  they do not hand over their weapons to the United Nations,  Deinekin categorically rejected such a possibility.    He explained that he has been saying for a long time that an  air attack on the area is inappropriate, because aviation is not  the way to face the type of civil war taking place in that part  of Europe.    He said: "This is why the Russian Air Force is categorically  against any type of bombing, by Croats, Serbs, Muslims, or  anybody. It is categorically against it."    He added that the soldiers would survive a bombing because  they are trained for it, and only the common people would be  killed.    He said that to start the type of attack threatened by NATO,  certain basic and essential requirements should be fulfilled.    He said: "All civilians -- old people, women, and children  -- would have to be evacuated first before the bombings. Only  then should an attack against military targets be made."    Otherwise, he said, there will be too much bloodshed, and no  one can be forgiven. He added: "There should be no more  bloodshed. I hope peace will prevail in the world."    He also said: "The Russian Air Force is very concerned about  the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and there is also no  doubt that the Russian Air Force is at peace."    Deinekin is carrying out a six-day visit to Chile as part of  FIDAE 94. Gen. Deinekin emphasized the Russian presence at  FIDAE with the participation of the best Russian experts and  advanced fighting weapons.    He said: "This place offers us excellent possibilities to  establish contacts with different groups."    He added that this type of fair shows the progress of  aviation that can really contribute to the progress of people.  He also reiterated the Russian Government's offer to train a  Chilean cosmonaut.    Deinekin indicated that the Russian presence at FIDAE was  not  only aimed at showing its advanced combat systems but at  ratifying its country's intention for real technological  exchange.</p>

In a statement issued by the permanent secretariat of the  Arab People's Congress yesterday, the secretariat condemns this  massacre, which embodies the hostility of the Zionist occupation  and the destruction of the questionable calls for peace that  some Arabs have followed.    The permanent secretariat of the Arab People's Congress  called on the Arab nation to adopt a serious stance that  strengthens the support for the Palestinian Arab people and does  not let it be a helpless prey for the imperialist and Zionist  forces.    The secretariat addressed also a call to the Arab leaders  and  heads of Arab liberation movements to make immediate and  practical moves to support the Palestinian people and express  the pan-Arab will and use it to put pressures on the UN and  international organizations so that they condemn the enemy and  implement international laws to give to the Palestinian people  the right to recover all their rights.</p>

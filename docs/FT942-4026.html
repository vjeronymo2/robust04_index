			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Loans threat Higher-rate taxpayers should beware of mortgage lenders bearing gifts, writes Barbara Ellis. A recent Inland Revenue opinion suggests that fashionable mortgage cashback offers to new borrowers might be subject to capital gains tax. Several building societies have been using lump sum cash payments as an alternative to interest rate discounts to woo new borrowers into signing up for standard variable-rate mortgages and wean them off fixed-rate loans. But borrowers inquiring about the tax implications have had little help from lenders. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, for example, just prints a warning which says: 'We are unable to confirm whether or not a cash gift will be subject to tax. You should contact your tax office . . .' Within the past week, however, C&amp;G has had a letter from officials at West Midlands I tax district. It suggests that, in the Revenue's opinion, the C&amp;G mortgage cash was a capital sum derived from a contractual right and would, therefore, be liable to CGT. But C&amp;G intends to argue that the money should be exempt from tax as a gift. The biggest problem appears to lie with higher-rate taxpayers, since they may do better from cash gifts than low borrowing rates. C&amp;G's figures show that a borrower taking out a Pounds 40,000 mortgage and opting for the gift would pay interest at 7.64 per cent - Pounds 2,598 in the first year, net of Pounds 458 mortgage interest relief. The cash gift of Pounds 1,200 would bring net outgoings on the mortgage loan to Pounds 1,398. By comparison, a borrower choosing the C&amp;G discounted interest rate of 4.64 per cent would pay Pounds 1,578 net of mortgage interest relief. In absolute terms, the difference is just Pounds 180. But this advantage could be wiped out if capital gains tax were charged on the gift.</p>

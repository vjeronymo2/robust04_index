And sales at the markets accounted for 28 percent of the  nation's gross retail business volume in 1993.    The number of free markets in China increased to 83,001 last  year from 78,000 in 1992 with the support of 21.7 billion yuan  ($2.4 billion) in investment.    These statistics were provided by the State Administration  for Industry and Commerce, which oversees the country's market  development.    Business volume at the markets hit 534.3 billion yuan ($61.4  billion), a 50 percent increase over 1992.    Free markets, which first appeared in the 1950s as a place  where farmers could sell their produce to city residents, were  banned in later years for "capitalist" characteristics.    They re-emerged with the rural reform in the late 1970s.    They have since prospered following nationwide market  reform,  becoming the major source of vegetables and handicraft products  for consumers across China.    According to an administration official, free markets are  divided into four categories -- comprehensive markets, ones for  light industrial products, ones for agricultural products and  by-products and special markets for such items as pets or  flowers.    By the end of 1978, China had 33.300 free markets. Their  business transactions that year totalled only 1.25 billion yuan  ($143 million), 5.4 per cent of the country's retail sales.    Although only 16,450 free markets are located in cities,  they  play a major role in supplying vegetables and other daily  necessities to residents.    "The development of free markets, especially in the last  three years, has considerably eased the shortage of vegetables  in some Chinese cities," the official said.    And today free markets are no longer the traditional ones  dominated by farmers but a big market place shared by both State  enterprises, collectively-run businesses and private  businessmen," he added. Such markets sell not only daily  necessities but also industrial materials and products, the  official said.    Vegetable sales at free markets totalled 58.2 billion yuan  ($6.68 billion) last year, a 33 percent rise over 1992. The  sales volume was about eight times that of State-owned vegetable  suppliers.    Last year's grain transactions at free markets also grew a  record 70 percent, with business volume reaching 22.67 billion  yuan ($2.6 billion). Sales of meat, livestock and eggs rose to  110.3 billion yuan ($12.6 bilion), a 28 percent increase over  1992.    More than 474,000 people are engaged in transporting goods  and products to free markets. And it is estimated that 1.06  million motor vehicles and 83,000 ships are used in transporting  goods.    In addition to food and merchandise markets, 4,000 markets  supplying production materials and 1,700 labour markets, real  estate and technical exchange have also emerged: State-owned  enterprises still control the sale of raw materials such as  steel, iron, petroleum and timber.    In eastern Zhejiang Province, which has been leading the  country in free market development in recent years, new progress  was made last year.    It has 107 markets, each of whose annual sales exceed 100  million yuan ($11.5 million). Its Yiwu Small Industrial  Articles Market, the country's biggest free market, did a record  4.5 billion yuan ($517 million) in sales last year.</p>

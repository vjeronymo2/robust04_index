			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Sharp fall at Lasmo as it alters accounting practices LASMO, the independent oil and gas exploration company which acquired fellow oil company Ultramar for Pounds 1.2bn at the end of last year, disappointed the City yesterday when it announced a sharp drop in pre-tax profit from Pounds 48.8m in 1990 to Pounds 28.8m last year. The company has restated its results going back to 1983 after making sweeping changes in its accounting practices which have reduced previous profit levels. Post-tax profits in 1991 were Pounds 59m lower than they would have been under the company's old accounting methods. The drop in profit, combined with the weak oil price outlook, has prompted many analysts to reduce their earnings' forecasts for the company this year to about Pounds 20m. Lasmo's share price suffered from the decline in earnings and in early trading dropped 17p, but it later recovered to close 1p down at 203p. The company increased its debt to Pounds 1.2bn from Pounds 22m in 1990 after acquiring fellow oil company Ultramar for Pounds 1.2bn. This took gearing up to 83 per cent, although Lasmo hoped that it could reduce this by selling off Ultramar's downstream assets by the end of the year. Earnings per share dropped to 3.4p from 9p and the company held its dividend at 8.5p. After-tax profits slipped to Pounds 18m from Pounds 38m. 'Lasmo is trading at a big discount to asset value (of Pounds 2.19 a share), but there are still worries about the dividend and debt level,' said Mr Rob Arnott, analyst at stockbrokers, Hoare Govett. Some analysts said the company could be forced to cut its dividend this year although cashflow remains strong at Pounds 235m. Lasmo will cut its exploration budget this year from about Pounds 200m to Pounds 135m as oil prices remain low. 'In the last five years we've been growing our exploration portfolio dramatically now we're going to rationalise from a very high base,' said Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive. Last year the company achieved a record level of exploration success, finding 78m barrels of oil. Production rose to 85,200 barrels a day (b/d) from 83,100 b/d, but has increased to 206,000 b/d this year after the inclusion of Ultramar's fields. Lex, Page 28</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ikea to invest heavily on stores in China Ikea, the furniture retailer, said yesterday it had decided to launch a heavy investment programme in China. It plans to open up to 10 stores as well as expanding production facilities in the country. Mr Anders Moberg, Ikea's chief executive, said the move was one of the company's biggest investment projects that could total SKr2bn (Dollars 272m) over the next 10 years. Ikea, owned by the Swedish Kamprad family but now based in Denmark and the Netherlands, plans to open the first stores in Beijing, Zhezhen and Guangzhou. Mr Moberg said he hoped the first store would open by the end of 1996, but he said it was not yet decided in which city it would stand. The stores, at a cost of about SKr150m each, will be built and run by Ikea. The group will spend up to SKr500m in expanding production facilities in China through joint ventures with local partners. It operates two joint venture operations in the country, supplying wooden furniture to Ikea outlets elsewhere. Ikea, founded in 1943 by the Kamprads, has expanded rapidly worldwide over the past decade based on its formula of keenly-priced furniture built to low-frills, but stylish, Swedish designs. Annual turnover has more than trebled since 1984 to SKr36.5bn this year as the number of stores doubled to more than 120 in 25 countries.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New Look postpones flotation plans The adverse market conditions for new issues were yesterday blamed for yet another postponement when New Look, the Dorset-based women's wear chain, cancelled its flotation plans. The company, which had been hoping for a market value in excess of Pounds 150m, was due to announce the pricing of its shares today. Schroders, the company's advisers, said: 'In this negative environment, people were looking for any excuse not to invest. They couldn't believe that its rate of success could continue.' Fund managers approached by the company and its advisers in the past couple of days said they had been offered the shares at a 30 per cent discount to the retail sector - a surprising figure even in the current subdued environment for new issues - and had turned them down. One institutional investor said: 'I had reservations about the management, the management structure and the rate of expansion, it's as simple as that.' Another added: 'With such high margin rates, we were concerned over any further room for growth.' Some 35 per cent of the equity was due to come to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer. The flotation was to have raised about Pounds 10m of new money. New Look, which has 224 shops, is aimed at the lower end of the women's fashion market. It has more than tripled operating profits and turnover in the past three years. Profits of Pounds 11m last year were almost matched by the Pounds 9.92m posted for the six months to September 24. Operating margins were 16.9 per cent. The company, founded in 1969, is owned by the Singh family, with Mr Tom Singh, the deputy chairman. Other members of the board included Mr Louis Sherwood, the non-executive chairman, who was appointed in September. Another non-executive was appointed last month, as was the finance director, Mr Peter Phillips, formerly of Hepworth and British Nuclear Fuels.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARSTOW'S FOSSIL-RICH DESERT A GOLD MINE FOR STUDENTS AND SCIENTISTS  </P> <P> Footprints of huge bear dogs -- long-limbed grizzly-like beasts with 11-foot  strides -- as well as three-toed horses and other ancient animals are found on  the outskirts of this desert town 130 miles northeast of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The area is covered with other footprints and fossils of camels, pygmy running  rhinos, saber-toothed cats and elephant-like animals bigger than cows but  smaller than bison.  </P> <P> Here on the bone-dry Mojave Desert lies the world's heaviest concentration of  fossils of birds, beasts and insects that lived between 13 million and 16  million years ago in a long-gone forest along a network of lakes, rivers and  streams.  </P> <P> This area is so important to paleontologists -- scientists who study the  skeletal remains and footprints of organisms of past geological ages -- that  all life forms in North America from that period are designated to be of the  Barstovian Age.  </P> <P> "Not many people outside Southern California know Barstow, but paleontologists  everywhere are familiar with the town's name," said Bob Reynolds, 43, a  paleontologist with the San Bernardino County Museum in Redlands.  </P> <P> "The scientific term Barstovian . . . identifies a whole array of mammals,  birds, rodents and insects. Descriptions of Barstovian life are found in all  paleontology textbooks."  </P> <P> In 1972 the National Park Service set aside the fossil beds 8 miles north of  Barstow to protect the scientific resources of the rugged badlands. They called  it Rainbow Basin National Natural Landmark.  </P> <P> It is administered, patrolled and protected by the U.S. Bureau of Land  Management and listed as a BLM area of critical environmental concern. "No  Access" signs dot the area; not even the scientists are allowed to bring their  vehicles into the fragile zone.  </P> <P> From time to time, erosion bares fossilized bones and footprints on the surface  of the 8,300-acre Rainbow Basin. But for the most part, they are uncovered in  digs conducted by scientific parties dispatched by universities and museums  from all over the world.  </P> <P> Scientists have discovered fossils of at least 17 species of animals at Rainbow  Basin that have never been discovered anywhere else.  </P> <P> "Carnivores ate vertebrae and ribs. What we find for the most part are teeth,  jaws and limb bones. We have no complete skeletons," Reynolds explained.  </P> <P> Major collections from Rainbow Basin are housed in the Los Angeles County  Museum, the San Bernardino County Museum, UCLA, UC Berkeley and the American  Museum of Natural History of New York.  </P> <P> But Reynolds noted that before the area was set aside by the National Park  Service it was known locally as the Barstow Fossil Beds. "For years people from  the Barstow area would collect bones of the ancient animals that surfaced from  erosion," he said.  </P> <P> "It is said one of the best collections of the Barstovian Age could probably be  found in closets, garages and dresser drawers in Barstow homes where many  answers to the age-old puzzle of ancient life might well be found."  </P> <P> Although collecting the ancient material is now prohibited except by bona fide  scientists with permits, amateur collectors still are occasionally caught.  </P> <P> Last year, for instance, a paleontologist from the University of New Mexico  observed an amateur collector digging up a camel fossil. It was discovered the  man had been collecting for years.  </P> <P> He was found guilty, fined $250 and ordered to turn over his fossil collection  to the San Bernardino County Museum.  </P> <P> The scientists, however, don't want to keep the area just to themselves. Tim  Read, 41, of the BLM's Barstow office inaugurated a program last year to  introduce every fifth-grader in town to Rainbow Basin.  </P> <P> John Murray, 45, an archeologist for BLM Barstow Resources Area, showed a  tilted and folded formation with two dozen ancient camel tracks still intact.  "I tell the kids that camels in those days ran upside down," he laughed.  </P> <P> In a more serious vein he pointed out holes in the formation where camel prints  had been cut away. "The footprints are really mud frozen in time and place.  When someone removes the ancient tracks they crumble. Everyone loses," Murray  said.  </P></p>

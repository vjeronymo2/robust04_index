			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Schneider may increase capital SCHNEIDER, the French industrial group, yesterday secured shareholder approval for its proposed takeover of Merlin-Gerin, the electrical equipment manufacturer, and warned it might seek permission for a capital increase. Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman, repeated his earlier warning that Schneider's 1992 profits would be at the lower end of expectations. Originally Schneider had been expected to make FFr400m (Dollars 78.4m) to FFr650m. The final outcome would be closer to FFr400m mainly because of steep losses at Spie-Batignolles, its construction offshoot. The initial profits warning in June triggered an inquiry by the French stock market authorities into Schneider share dealings. Mr Pineau-Valencienne yesterday said Spie's losses, originally expected to be around FFr150m for 1992, could be up to FFr200m. He also anticipated a loss from Square D, the US building business, despite an increase in operating margins. Mr Pineau-Valencienne said Schneider might ask shareholders to authorise a capital increase but it was 'not absolutely indispensable'. Schneider's net debt rose sharply after the Dollars 2.23bn acquisition of Square D last year and is now estimated at around FFr18.7bn.</p>

Reid says he is awaiting a recommendation from  Coach Dean Smith, but several National Basketball Assn. coaches say they expect  Reid to bypass his senior year and make an early entrance into the pros.  </P> <P> "The kid's coming out this year," said an NBA official whose team has a draft  lottery pick told The News and Observer of Raleigh. "If he doesn't, I'll be  very, very surprised."  </P> <P> NBA coaches and officials can be fined by the league for talking about college  underclassmen or assessing their pro potential, and many requested anonymity  when contacted by the newspaper.  </P> <P> Smith said he had conferred with 11 NBA teams about Reid.

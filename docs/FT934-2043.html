			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Pentagon orders 40 transport aircraft The Pentagon announced yesterday it would buy 40 C-17 long-distance transport aircraft but warned McDonnell Douglas, the manufacturer, that unless design flaws and cost overruns already amounting to Dollars 1.5bn were remedied it would not go ahead with a planned order for an additional 80, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Promising 'not to be held hostage' to the C-17, Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, announced a settlement with McDonnell Douglas under which it agreed to drop Dollars 1.2bn in outstanding claims. If the military is still dissatisfied with the C-17, it will consider adapting wide-bodied commercial jets or reviving the C-5 production line.</p>

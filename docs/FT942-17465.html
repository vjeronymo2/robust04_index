			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / S Korean economy to grow by 6.5% South Korea's leading private economic institutes predict that the economy will grow by at least 6.5 per cent this year, up from 5.6 per cent in 1993, writes John Burton from Seoul. The greater growth is attributed mainly to increased industrial investments and higher domestic consumption. Companies are adding production capacity due to a surge in exports caused by the weakness of the Korean won, the currency, against the Japanese yen and by stronger demand in its biggest overseas markets, including the US, Japan and China. The central bank, however, warns that the current account, which posted a slight surplus of Dollars 450m (Pounds 305m) in 1993, may fall into a deficit again this year as imports increased due to stronger domestic demand. The brisk economic activity is also reviving fears of inflation, which reached 5.8 per cent in 1993, the bank said yesterday.</p>

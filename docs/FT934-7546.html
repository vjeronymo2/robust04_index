			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Hurd touts European credentials MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, will today outline the government's 'wholehearted' commitment to the European Union in a move designed to outline the party's pro-European credentials. In a speech to the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce tonight, Mr Hurd will attempt to set a new pro-European agenda and implicitly urge Euro-sceptics to accept that the party's damaging battle over Maastricht is over. A draft of his speech says: 'We have no doubts about our place at the heart of Europe. The United Kingdom decided on its European destiny almost a generation ago. There is no need to fight that battle over again. Nor do we need to re-enact the battle of Maastricht.' Mr Hurd's speech follows remarks by three key economic ministers at this week's Confederation of British Industry conference in Harrogate, at which they attempted to regain ground lost to the right at the party conference. The left of the party were dismayed by speeches by ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, which had drawn applause for attacks on the European Commission. Mr Hurd is determined that the party should unite round a policy that is 'wholeheartedly committed to the European Union' but which is not afraid to argue Britain's interests within the Community. He will tell his audience that the battle to convince Britain's European partners that economic problems will not be solved by increasing regulatory burdens on businesses will continue. But the draft goes on: 'The fact that we argue with our partners in Europe, that we disagree with them on many things, most obviously about the prospects for early movement towards monetary union, does not mean that Europe is irretrievably divided. The days of a divided Europe are over.' The foreign secretary will also argue for an enlarged Europe expanding to the north and east which is in tune with business opinion and public opinion. And he will claim that the government 'is second to none' in its idealism on Europe. Meanwhile, Mr Geoffrey Martin, head of the European Commission's UK offices, has warned of a 'democratic deficit' in Westminster about the UK's future in Europe. He defined the 'deficit' as a 'lack of transparency and accountability' and a gap between what people needed and what was negotiated on their behalf. He said at Hull University that unless MPs recognised their responsibilities, 'the dangerous democratic deficit about Europe will continue to exist'.</p>

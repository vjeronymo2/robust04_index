			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The day after yet another setback at the Geneva  talks on Bosnia, with all camps seeming to favor the logic of  war, the question is being raised more and more openly of the  continuing presence of the Blue Helmets, first by the British --  who nevertheless rule out withdrawing alone -- and also by the  French. Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the  departure of the Blue Helmets is, I quote, an option among  others, while stressing the negative consequences that such a  decision would entail.    Some of the French Blue Helmets have arrived back at their  barracks in Frejus . Sandra Smit and Didier Beaumont report:    [Smit] [passage omitted] The defense minister made a point  of  paying tribute to the men of the 21st Regiment of Marines in  Frejus, but also to the 9,000 French troops still deployed on  the ground. [passage omitted] As Francois Leotard stressed, the  political decisions of the UN take precedence over the demands  of the military authorities.    Since the outbreak of the Bosnian conflict, several generals  have overstepped the rules. In the defense minister's view,  this is no chance coincidence and the United Nations should  reconsider the matter:    [Begin Leotard recording] We believe that if there is a  crisis, it is not a crisis between France and the United  Nations. It is a crisis within the United Nations itself, with  particular reference to its ability to handle situations as  complex as that obtaining in the former Yugoslavia, to the chain  of command, and also to the infirmity of the general staff in  New York, which is obviously not adapted to this type of  situation. [end recording]    [Smit] Francois Leotard will soon be sending a memorandum to  the United Nations, asking for very clear guidelines on the  terms governing the use of the French troops, and above all on  whether they are needed at all.</p>

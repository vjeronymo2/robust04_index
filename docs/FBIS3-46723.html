Yi Yong-ho, "chairman of the joint chiefs of staff", too,  let  out a war hokum that day, saying "the military posture should be  rounded off to counter the North's threat of war" and "a posture  of prompt counteraction" should be established.    Such belligerent remarks of the puppet army brass hats from  the beginning of the year blatantly revealed their scheme of  armed confrontation with the North and they were an intolerable  grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who aspire to peace and  reunification of the country.    As everyone knows, the DPRK has advanced the 10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation which is  acceptable to anyone who wants great national unity and  reunification and a proposal to exchange special envoys in order  to discuss and solve the pending issues between the North and  the South, and has made all sincere efforts to carry them into  effect.    The South Korean puppet clique, however, ignoring them, has  resorted to anti-DPRK intrigues, vociferating about "military  counteraction" on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear  problem" of the North. And this time the puppet clique again  made provocative outbursts.    Facts clearly prove that the South Korean puppets are,  indeed, anti-dialogue, anti-reunification elements who have no  will to work for peace and reunification.    If the South Korean puppets dare provoke the North, it will  control the fire with fire on all accounts and mete out a  deserving punishment to the provocateurs.    The South Korean puppets must stop behaving rashly, clearly  realizing that their acts of pushing the situation on the Korean  peninsula to an acute phase of confrontation will only result in  their own self-destruction.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government in a dilemma over cotton sales DIFFERENCES between farmers and traders and textile mill operators over the size of this year's Indian cotton crop are making it difficult for the federal government to keep to its policy of authorising the export of at least 500,000 bales a year. The differences as to when the government should take a decision on the export of new season staple cotton surfaced at last week's meeting of the Cotton Advisory Board. The farmers, who are expecting a bumper crop of 13m bales, pressed for immediate release of export quotas to avoid domestic prices collapsing under the pressure of market arrivals. The agriculture ministry supports this point of view but the Indian Cotton Mills Federation, whose initial estimate of the current season's crop is 12m bales, believes that in the interest of the textile industry, the government should not make a decision until December, when the exact size of the crop will be known. The textile ministry agrees. According to industry officials, the standing crop is likely to be affected to some extent by the present spell of heavy rain and by pest attacks in some places. In the meantime, the government has released an export quota of 126,000 bales of old season cotton for the Maharashtra State Co-operative Cotton Marketing Federation and Cotton Corporation of India. The decision is being taken as confirmation that the government is expecting an easy supply situation in the present season. Even if the crop is only 12m bales, the total availability for the season will be 15.3m bales, including the carryover stock of 3.3m bales. The industry's requirement is estimated at 1.05m bales while another 800,000 or so bales are generally needed by the non-mill sector.</p>

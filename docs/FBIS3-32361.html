			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Fuentes] </F>   [Text] In addition to explaining that in the next elections  voters have to choose between two platforms, Jose Maria  Figueres, presidential candidate for the National Liberation  Party [PLN], during a rally held last night in a public square  in Parrita de Puntarenas, has promised to support production,  tourism, and housing.    When talking to the crowd, which area residents said was  much  larger than the one that came to hear Oscar Arias Sanchez during  the 1986 campaign, Figueres said: "The PLN platform is much  different than the other party's." The PLN platform, a  platform by which our standard of living has increased, puts us  back on the course of progress and development, but theirs  (Social Christian Unity Party) is the neoliberal platform, a  platform by which the government has concentrated wealth and  increased poverty," he said.    According to the PLN candidate, the Social Christians are  talking of social programs due to the campaign, but the first  thing they did was to dismiss cooks from school lunchrooms,  because saving a few colones is more important to them than  feeding hundreds of thousands of children."    He has told the area residents he would stimulate tourism,  rectify the housing problem, and amend import rates to boost the  productive sector, because "an economy car should not pay higher  taxes than a luxury car." Others to speak at this rally were  Mario Alvarez, Parrita candidate for deputy; Mario Charpentier,  former public security minister; and Luis Paris, former campaign  chief for Jose Miguel Corrales. Paris has referred to the  unity within the PLN, saying differences were a thing of the  past. "Today, our party is united to face the neoliberal  politics that are threatening Costa Ricans, politics that have  lowered our levels of health, education, and raised the cost of  living." Figures has said the current government closed 68  health centers in the last year alone, which led to a strong  decline in health in rural areas. For that reason, old  diseases, such as dengue, measles, and malaria, have reappeared,  and we have new ones, such as cholera, he has said.</p>

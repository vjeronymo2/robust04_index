			<p><!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  DOE invites all interested parties, including affected Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Nations, and the general public to submit comments or suggestions concerning the scope of the issues to be addressed, alternatives to be analyzed, and the environmental impacts to be assessed in the Plutonium Finishing Plant Cleanout EIS by December 12, 1994. To ensure that all relevant environmental issues are considered, the public, agencies, and organizations are also invited to attend public scoping workshops in which oral and written comments will be welcomed on the proposed PFP EIS. Oral and written comments will be given equal weight in the scoping process. Written comments must be postmarked by December 12, 1994 to ensure their consideration. Comments postmarked after that date will be considered to the extent practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public scoping workshops to provide information and discuss and receive comments on the scope of the EIS will be held on the dates and at the locations given below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,xs90,xs150,r25 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Hood River, Oregon <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Date: Thursday, November 10, 1994 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Hood River Inn, Best Western, 1108 E.

Notes will be taken in the sub-workshops to record public concerns for the official workshop record. Each workshop will conclude with a session that will be recorded by a public stenographer and will become part of the official workshop record. This portion of the workshop will be chaired by a presiding officer, but will not be conducted as an evidentiary hearing; speakers will not be cross-examined although the presiding officer and DOE representatives may ask clarifying questions. Individuals requesting to speak on behalf of an organization must identify the organization. In the interest of ensuring that all who wish to speak have an opportunity to do so, each individual speaker will be given a 5-minute limit except that a speaker representing an organization (one per organization) will be given a 10-minute limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agenda will be repeated twice a day at each location, in afternoon and evening sessions.

DOE invites public comment and will conduct a series of public scoping meetings to provide an opportunity for the public and interested agencies to comment on the alternatives and the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except for storage areas), stabilize reactive residual plutonium-bearing materials to a form suitable for long term storage, and store the stabilized material until DOE makes final storage and disposition decisions. The proposed action would minimize safety concerns, reduce the exposure of site workers to radiation, and reduce the risk to the public. Upon completion of the action, the PFP-complex would be deactivated to a state ready for potential decontamination and dismantlement (D&amp;D) and/or potential future uses. Additional NEPA documentation will be prepared by DOE before any decision is made to D&amp;D the PFP and/or to use it for other purposes. At this time, no future missions beyond continued vault storage have been identified for the PFP-complex. Future production of plutonium for defense purposes is not being proposed and is not part of Hanford's current mission. Existing vault storage of nuclear materials would continue pending future NEPA documentation and a DOE decision on the ultimate storage or disposition of the materials; on June 21, 1994, DOE issued a NOI to prepare a programmatic EIS on the storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  DOE invites all interested parties, including affected Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Nations, and the general public to submit comments or suggestions concerning the scope of the issues to be addressed, alternatives to be analyzed, and the environmental impacts to be assessed in the Plutonium Finishing Plant Cleanout EIS by December 12, 1994.

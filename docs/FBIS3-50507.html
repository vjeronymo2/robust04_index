"There is enough time and the North Americans know this. If  circumstances are not favorable to them, they will have the time  to change, and that explains their attitude," the veteran  communist politician, who has occupied important positions in  Fidel Castro's government, observed.    Carlos Rafael Rodriguez noted that Bill Clinton's  administration "has taken a stand based on the notion that Cuba  could collapse in the immediate future. Additionally, it is  under pressure from the most recalcitrant sectors of the  Cuban-American community and its allies, and it is not pressed  to make decisions." He pointed out that it is necessary "to  show firmness and for our economic policies to be successful.  Both concerns guide Cuba's thoughts currently. The U.S. policy  on Cuba has had a weak international response as was  demonstrated with the UN approval of the resolution condemning  the blockade against Cuba."    Rodriguez also revealed that during the U.S. Democrat  President James Carter's administration, Cuba and the United  States had held high level contacts to initiate negotiations.  However, he explained, the possible solution of the U.S.-Cuban  crisis was interrupted at that time due to Carter's decision to  accuse Cuba of being responsible for the internal conflict in  Zaire between armed organizations which had retreated to the  area bordering with Angola.    Rodriguez recalled that on the same day that hostilities  started in the African country, he was to hold a secret meeting  with the then Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in New York. Prior  to the meeting, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez listened to Carter's  speech and his charges against Cuba. Vance was meeting with  former USSR Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko at the time, thus,  when they met "it was I who informed (Vance) of Carter's  statements." This is how the attempt to initiate negotiations  ended. Evidently, Vance did not know that Carter had decided to  make such an announcement and, embarrassed, he ended the  meeting. The controversy ended when the truth emerged: Cuba had  not participated in that adventure. However, the opportunity to  initiate negotiations had passed," he said.    In his opinion, however, it was during the Reagan and Bush  administrations "when we felt -- after the difficult days of the  U.S. aggression during the Kennedy era -- the possible effects  of a direct U.S. aggression against Cuba. We went through 12  years of continuous hostility with badly feigned or direct  threats," he explained. It is said that Republican governments  threaten and Democratic governments act against Cuba. This was  not the case with the Reagan and Bush administrations because  only Cuba's firmness and international solidarity impeded a  direct attack against our country during those 12 years," Carlos  Rafael Rodriguez asserted.</p>

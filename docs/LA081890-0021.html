			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED STATES INVOLVEMENT IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> Present U.S. policy poses no benefit for anyone -- neither for American lives  nor world security. The American presence and military involvement strikes a  very sensitive chord in the political culture of the Middle Eastern states.  </P> <P> Historically the Arab people have been subject to the influence and wishes of  foreign powers. American troops in Saudi Arabia stand consistent with this  legacy.  </P> <P> We want to see indigenous forces handle this conflict, particularly the Arab  League. Indeed, the reason for the existence of the Arab League is to mediate  these regional disputes. At the moment, the beneficiaries from this dilemma are  the American oil companies, who really control every single drop and barrel of  Arab oil. They are manipulating the price of this black gold on the world  market.  </P> <P> That Arabic people are yearning for democracy in their own homeland does not at  all imply an affinity for American government and certainly not the politics of  that government.  </P> <P> How can the United States call for the immediate eradication of Iraqi  occupation of Kuwait while remaining virtually silent about the Israeli  occupation of the Palestinian people and their homeland?  </P> <P> A policy of fairness insures a policy of true strength. We hope that the Bush  Administration will strengthen its position through a policy of fair play. We  hope Bush will avoid any further escalation, thus war.  </P> <P> ADEL A.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 18 -- Speaker of the Sejm Jozef Oleksy  addressing the round table conference on central Europe and NATO  said that the "Partnership for Peace" programme has not fully  met Poland's expectations and aspirations.    The speaker also stressed that the West is too slow in its  integration with the rest of Europe. He expressed hope that  governments of Western states will see their own interests in  integrating with central and eastern Europe.    Chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly Loic Bouvard said  that Poland can be now treated as one of the most important  partners from the East and added that the "Partnership for  Peace" programme is a stage which should lead central and east  Europen states to full integration with NATO.</p>

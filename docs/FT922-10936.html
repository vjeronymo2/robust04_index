			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities poised to test all-time peak A SOLID and determined performance by London's equity market, prompted by a renewed flurry of takeover speculation, took the FT-SE 100 Index to within 21 1/2 points of its all-time closing peak. A highly encouraging first session of the new two-week trading account left the Footsie 15.2 points stronger at 2,658.2, compared with its closing high of 2,679.6, achieved on September 2 last year, and its intraday peak of 2,683.7, which it touched on September 3. It was not all easy going, however. Early in the session the market struggled to keep its head above water, with dealers concerned about the effect on international markets of public sector strikes in Germany, plus the resignation of its foreign minister. Wall Street's weakness on Friday and yesterday, and renewed concern about the impact on the Japanese banking system of the steep decline in Tokyo share prices, were other factors causing unease in London. Opening some two points easier, the Footsie embarked on a sustained advance. Helped by another good showing from sterling, which continued to improve against the dollar and more importantly in terms of the D-Mark, the market moved into positive territory within minutes of the opening and gathered strength as the session progressed. A surge in the Footsie future was said to have been responsible for the initial strong rise in the cash market, although a 50-point premium to the cash index was soon partially whittled away - eventually leaving a 31-point premium - while the future settled at a 13-point premium over fair value as the market closed. Dealers said trade responded to a growing belief that the next few weeks could well see a flurry of takeover bids. They added that the market could easily cope with the worries about Germany and the G7 meeting held over the weekend. 'We never expected G7 to be positive, and the German story has been in the market for some time,' said one. He added that the institutions were happy with the feel of London's recent performance against a background of bearishness on Wall Street. Strategists pointed out that the UK is viewed by international fund managers as probably the safest bet, politically, of all the industrialised countries. 'I would not be surprised to see London shoot through its all-time high and test Footsie 2,700,' said one. Banking remained the focus of attention, with dealers bracing themselves for a counter-bid for Midland Bank from fellow UK clearer Lloyds. Barclays attracted plenty of interest after confirmation that Sir John Quinton is to step down as chief executive of the UK's biggest bank. NatWest's annual meeting is set for today and Bank of Scotland reports full-year figures tomorrow. Oil shares moved back into the limelight, with US institutions chasing BP higher amid suggestions that the US authorities may adopt a tax regime more encouraging to the oil and gas explorers. Turnover was slightly disappointing at 518.4m shares. Stock Exchange figures revealed that the value of business last Friday was Pounds 1.33bn.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN REVS UP FOR GOP STRETCH DRIVE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: IN GARDEN GROVE, THE FORMER PRESIDENT SUPPORTS FRESHMAN ASSEMBLYMAN  CURT PRINGLE.  </P> <P> Like watching a classic old movie where everybody knows the lines by heart,  Orange County Republicans gathered around former President Ronald Reagan on  Friday and basked in the glow of another campaign finale.  </P> <P> "Can I ask one favor of you?" Reagan finally said to a crowd already  anticipating the next sentence. "Let's go out and win this one for the Gipper."  </P> <P> This time Reagan was referring to Garden Grove's freshman Assemblyman Curt  Pringle, who is locked in California's most hotly contested legislative race  against his Democratic challenger, Tom Umberg.  </P> <P> Before joining the audience of about 400 people at the Hyatt Alicante, Reagan  jumped into a Republican phone bank and made three telephone calls to urge  surprised voters to support Pringle in Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> One call was to 71-year-old Minnie Ledesma of Newport Beach, whom Reagan  encouraged to vote for Pringle -- even though she doesn't live in the  assemblyman's 72nd District.  </P> <P> Ledesma said she wasn't quite sure it was really the former President on the  telephone. "At first, I thought it was a tape or something," she said. "His  voice just sounded the same as always, a little slower, maybe. I asked him for  his wife, Nancy, because I wanted to be sure it was President Reagan.  </P> <P> "He said for a couple of days she's had something in her throat, and she  couldn't talk. Then he said, 'I don't like it when she doesn't talk.'  </P> <P> "I said, 'You're the first man I've ever heard who misses his wife talking.' "  </P> <P> Ledesma added that Reagan "wasn't pushy or anything, he was a gentleman."  </P> <P> She said he encouraged her to vote, but never suggested which party to support,  so she never told him she is a Democrat.  </P> <P> In his speech about the downfall of communism and the high-spending Democrats,  Reagan barely referred to Pringle.  </P> <P> But Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) warmed up the audience, saying,  "Curt Pringle is in the fight of his life, and that is why President Reagan is  down here: to help Curt Pringle."  </P> <P> Reagan's visit was the first event of a four-day campaign swing through  Southern California that will include stops today in the Inland Empire, Sunday  in San Diego and a final visit to Orange County on Monday.  </P> <P> The former President's mission is to rally Republican troops. To convey that  message he once again recalled one of his favorite quotes: "Will Rogers once  said the people we send to office are no better than those who send them. But  they're all better than those who don't vote."  </P> <P> Reagan talked about his recent visit to Moscow, where he saw lines outside a  McDonald's outlet. Asking one man why he was standing in line, Reagan said he  was told, "It's the only glimpse we can get of the United States."  </P> <P> "You might be interested to know how much people in Moscow go out of their way  to say how much they want to be like us," said Reagan, wearing a black suit and  tie after appearing Friday morning at the funeral for William French Smith, who  was U.S. attorney general in the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> In addition to Dornan, Reagan was joined on stage by Reps. Christopher Cox  (R-Newport Beach) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach). Other Republican  candidates included State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is  running for lieutenant governor; Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi, and  State Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim).  </P></p>

The Serbian and Croatian bombings are considered to be a  "sort of challenge" to the United Nations, which has declared  the skies over Bosnia a no-fly zone. The bombings may result in  the international community's intervention and the escalation of  the civil war. Everything depends on how NATO and the United  Nations, which have recently warned that they would bomb Serbian  areas, will respond to the bombings.    The skies over Bosnia has been declared a no-fly zone since  last April: On 31 March, the UN Security Council adopted  Resolution No. 816 declaring that no aircraft of the Serbian,  Croatian, and Muslim groups, except for approved aircraft, can  fly into the Bosnian airspace in an effort to prevent the civil  war from spreading.    According to this resolution, NATO daily conducted  reconnaissance in the no-fly zone. There have been  approximately 7,000 flights so far, approximately 20 flights a  day.    UN Security Council Resolution No. 816 says: "All Necessary  measures can be taken against any aircraft illegally flying in  the no-fly zone." This virtually means it is possible to shoot  down such aircraft. The center of this reconnaissance mission  code-named "Deny Flight" is the Vicenza U.S. Air Force base in  northern Italy. Ten NATO member countries, including the United  States, Britain, France, and Germany, have participated in the  reconnaissance mission.    Fighters and reconnaissance planes based in the Vicenza base  and other U.S. military bases and aircraft carriers have  reportedly been flown for this mission, and a total of 4,000  personnel, including pilots and technicians, are participating  in this mission.    There have been approximately 250 violations of the no-fly  zone. Serbs violated the zone most of the time, and this was the  first time fighters violated the zone.    The downing of the Serbian fighters developed into a fierce  exchange of fire between the Serbian army and the Muslim army of  Bosnia, which took place a few hours later. This diminishes the  prospects of a peaceful resolution of the Bosnian situation.</p>

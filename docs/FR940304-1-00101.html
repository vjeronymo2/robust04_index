			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department does not consider the utility of having hot water, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other amenities, during power outages adequate reason to develop separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product classes. Between 90 percent and 93 percent of residential electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers experience no electricity outages longer than four hours per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Currently, central gas furnaces are not divided into product classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the use of electricity as proposed above for gas water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, in this proposal, ranges/ovens are not divided into two product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes based on the use of electricity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A.P. Sanghvi. 1990.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Cost-Benefit Analysis of Power System Reliability: Determination of Interruption Costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Prepared by RCG/Hagler/Bailly Inc. for Electric Power Research Institute EL&hyph;6791, vol 2, p 3&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional product classes be defined for gas-fired storage water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed outside. (Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc., No. 74 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is not aware of any unique water heater design features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that lead to any utility and lower energy efficiency that justifies a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class. Therefore, the Department is not establishing a separate product class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for gas-fired water heaters installed outside.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pacific Power and Edison Electric Institute supported three separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes for electric water heaters (resistance, instantaneous, and heat pump).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pacific Power stated that heat pump water heater efficiency depends upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> climate and use patterns. (Pacific Power, No. 53 at 1, and Edison Electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute, No. 20 at 2). Peoples Natural Gas Company stated that heat pump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters should be promoted over electric resistance water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Peoples Natural Gas Company, No. 28 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments proposed that heat pump water heaters be treated as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design option for electric storage water heaters, and not as a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product class. (DEC International No. 3 at 1; Mr. Wayne Goode, No. 8 at 1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Joe Wilson, No. 10 at 1; American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 6 at 1; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 21; Rocky Mountain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute, No. 15 at 2; Crispaire, No. 19 at 1; Citizens Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coalition Educational Fund, No. 24 at 3; Champaign County Board, No. 36 at 1;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 1; Mr. George Smith, No. 32 at 2;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2; and Mr. Warren Widener, No. 78 at 2). Northwest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Power Planning Council proposed a separate product class for add-on heat pumps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for water heaters. (Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters should not be a separate class. In its comments, the Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council acknowledged some arguments in favor of keeping them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate class, such as the inability to operate at low temperatures, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Natural Resources Defense Council claimed can be overcome with electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance backup; first hour rating, which the Natural Resources Defense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council stated can be overcome with a larger tank; and noise, which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Resources Defense Council suggested can be overcome with more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insulation. The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that these are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic considerations, not product utility considerations. (Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 22). On the other hand, Edison Electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute supported a separate product class for heat pump water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of replacement market considerations, the heat pump compressor may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be located outdoors, the air temperature must be greater than 45 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient air circulation is needed (500 cfm) or surrounding air space must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be of sufficient volume (1000 ft3), and there must be provision for condensate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drainage. (Edison Electric Institute, No. 20 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that DOE should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze heat pump water heaters since their shipments are extremely low,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> totaling less than 0.05 percent of all electric water heater shipments. (Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department considered only one product class for electric storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters. Heat pump water heaters were regarded as design options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric storage water heaters. They provide the same utility as electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance storage water heaters. The Department agreed with the Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council that all of the issues regarding heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters discussed above are economic in nature, and are treated as such in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

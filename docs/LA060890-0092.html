			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLI VANILLI STYLIST GIVES DUO'S STAGE DESIGNS A WORKOUT  </P> <P> Do clothes make the band? In the case of Milli Vanilli, they certainly haven't  hurt.  </P> <P> The pop group, composed of German-born Rob Pilatus, 24, and French-born Fab  Morvan, 23, is known for its highly danceable music (with four No. 1 hits in  the last year, starting with "Girl You Know It's True") and their own nonstop  aerobic workout on stage.  </P> <P> Pilatus and Morvan are also known for their heartthrob good looks -- chiseled  cheekbones and $750 hairdos, in which elaborate hair extensions are braided  with their own long locks.  </P> <P> And certainly not least of all, they're known for wearing tights and tank tops  that show off their well-toned physiques.  </P> <P> Up to this point, Pilatus and Morvan have raided their own closets for the  tights, tunics, cropped jackets, military boots, leather jackets and ripped  jeans they've worn in their videos.  </P> <P> But on their first tour, which stopped at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los  Angeles last weekend, they are being costumed by Jim Lutz, a former assistant  designer for Bob Mackie.  </P> <P> The pairing of the earthy Milli Vanilli and the Mackie-trained designer, who is  used to fitting sheer, sequined, minimal-coverage costumes on Cher, might seem  offbeat, and the matchup did occur by chance.  </P> <P> Morvan and Pilatus were in the same aerobics class with Lutz at the Sports  Connection. Afterward, in the lobby, the duo met their management  representative, Todd Headlee, who was an old friend of Lutz. They were  introduced and struck a deal right there.  </P> <P> Lutz, 29, who now makes his own line of women's separates under the Bankston  label, was thrilled to do clothes for the performers.  </P> <P> "They're easy to work for because they know what they want," he says. "They try  something on and say yes or no. They're not fussy."  </P> <P> Lutz expanded on the Milli Vanilli signature look: a strong-shouldered,  V-shaped silhouette. He kept the duo in tailored jackets and leggings, but  created theme clothes more suitable for the stage.  </P> <P> One set of jackets is inspired by Ninja warriors. Their high-buttoned riding  jackets were fashioned after the exotic lines of Jean Paul Gaultier and the  19th-Century frock coat worn by Daniel Day-Lewis on Oscar night.  </P> <P> The backup musicians wear black mandarin jackets and the Milli Vanilli armband,  which bears a map of Africa.  </P> <P> As the tour moved into warmer Southern states, Lutz added soft rayon and  washable suede in sweat suits, cropped tops and full, floating pants to be  tucked into boots. "Rob calls it a sportive look," Lutz says. The new clothes  have been made in Rastafarian-inspired shades of red, green and yellow.  </P> <P> All the clothes must withstand the jumps, acrobatics and splits the duo is know  for. "They really move from the second the show starts," Lutz says. "I knew  what to watch out for from working with Bob Mackie."  </P> <P> Working with Mackie's performers and stage costumes also gave Lutz experience  in quick changes. Milli Vanilli, he says, makes a lot. "They're on the stage  the whole time, so costume changes had to be done in 10 seconds," explains  Lutz, who solved the dilemma with simple zippers and lots of Velcro.  </P></p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Building sector warned of setback THE CONSTRUCTION industry faces little prospect of recovery before the mid-1990s because of oversupply and depressed rental demand, the Building Employers Confederation warned yesterday. In a gloomy new year message Mr John Smith, the confederation's chairman, said there was also no real prospect of the construction industry emerging this year from recession, whatever the prospects in the wider UK economy. Mr Smith said the confederation's last state-of-trade inquiry pointed to a fall of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent in construction output in 1991. A fall of at least half that amount is likely this year, even with the limited growth expected in some sectors of the industry in the second half of the year. This forecast matches closely the official assessment last month from the National Economic Development Council. Its construction industry sector group said output was likely to have fallen 9.5 per cent in 1991, with a further decline of about half that in 1992. The confederation says the most recent output figures from the Environment Department, for the third quarter of 1991, confirmed its own inquiry. The 10 per cent decline in output, compared with the third quarter of 1990, was 'an important statistic that cannot be ignored,' Mr Smith said. The evidence for Mr Smith's warning about the commercial sector comes from the sharp third-quarter fall in output - private commercial orders were down 25 per cent from a year earlier. This particularly affects big national contractors. Almost two-thirds of people think the economy will not recover until next year or later, according to a Gallup survey. It found that 40 per cent believe the recession will last for at least the whole of this year and a further 22 per cent do not expect an upturn until the end of the year.</p>

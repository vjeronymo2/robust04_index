			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Luxembourg (1): Prosperous little oasis - As parts of Europe plunge into economic and political uncertainty, Luxembourg remains an island of calm, its size and flexibility enabling it to stay a step ahead of its neighbours. Can it maintain this position SMALL WOULD seem to be beautiful for little Luxembourg on the eve of the European single market. The European Community's smallest member is also its most prosperous. And at a time when ethnic tensions and a distrust of foreigners are on the increase in other parts of Europe, Luxembourg is an oasis of calm, even though nearly a third of its residents and half of its workers are from other countries. The Grand Duchy's remarkable process of integration and acceptance has been assisted by the fact that most of the foreigners are fellow west Europeans and fellow Catholics from Italy and Portugal, and that unemployment is negligible at 1.7 per cent. As the EC's only land-locked member it has always been forced to ply trade with the rest of the Twelve: in a single European market of 360m consumers, Luxembourg and its population of 400,000, representing just 0.1 per cent of the total, will benefit even further from the country's location and its multi-lingual skills. But being small is usually not an advantage when it comes to wielding power and Luxembourg remains vulnerable to European and world events beyond its control. Its status as a founding member of the EC in the late 1950s gave it immediate influence out of all proportion to its size - a mere 57km wide and 82km long. In the original Community of the Six, the Grand Duchy had little difficulty in making its voice heard. Nor has it found itself badly outmanoeuvred or outnumbered since the six became 12. But the EC' enlargement to perhaps as many as 18 states threatens to dilute Luxembourg's power. A test case for the future is the siting of the proposed European central bank. Politicians and financiers say the bank belongs by rights to Luxembourg, because of a 1965 agreement that it should become home to the EC's financial and judicial institutions. Mr Pierre Werner, the former prime minister, elder statesman and the man whose Werner Report helped set the EC firmly on the road to monetary union in 1970, says: 'We are duty-bound to claim the bank, because we would otherwise abandon positions which had been clearly established. You can't simply sweep the 1965 agreement aside.' Unfortunately for Luxembourg the decision is clearly a question of politics. Luxembourg's best chance of winning the bank is its emergence as a compromise candidate to break any deadlock between Germany, France and Britain. Luxembourg is keen to have the bank, partly to crown its achievements of the past two decades - the creation of a thriving banking and financial centre, which compensated for the decline of the once all-important steel industry. Since 1992, the number of banks in Luxembourg has increased fivefold to 192, providing thousands of new jobs, generating a sizeable amount of government revenue and making the Grand Duchy a financial centre in its own right, albeit a specialised one focused on niche areas. The collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which was legally domiciled in Luxembourg but which carried out the bulk of its activities elsewhere, has not, it seems, had a lasting effect on the Grand Duchy's reputation. BCCI came to Luxembourg at the start of the banking boom in the early 1970s, and the country's regulatory body, the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois, says a bank of this sort would not be granted a licence today. Officials admit that they cannot claim credit for having foreseen the rise in banking. The reasons for the rapid growth, they say, must be sought in other countries, principally the US, whose tax-rule changes in the 1960s created the Eurocurrency market. Banks flocked to Luxembourg to take advantage of its lack of stamp duty and withholding tax. But Luxembourg is being too modest. The country has repeatedly shown that it is capable of moving quickly to exploit a niche market. One example is the investment fund market. Within a month of the EC Commission's issuing its directive on European-wide investment funds in 1988, Luxembourg's parliament had revised its domestic laws to reflect the change, enabling the country to steal a march on larger financial centres. Today, Luxembourg is home to more than 980 investment funds. A similar case of niche thinking is Luxembourg's commercial satellite and television sector. Another explanation for the country's success is its bank secrecy laws, which make it a magnet for the wealth of Germans, Dutch, French and Belgians, who like to keep their savings in a place which they can reach easily and quickly by car but which is out of bounds to their own countries' tax authorities. Flushed with the success of this type of private banking, Luxembourg has no intention of sacrificing its banking laws on the altar of European unity and harmonisation. Mr Pierfranco de Vita, managing director of Chase Manhattan Bank in Luxembourg, says: 'The government has given clear signals that it would keep Luxembourg's special status alive within the EC.' But Luxembourg can expect to come under further pressure from its EC partners, who would like nothing more than to claw back lost savings. Although Luxembourg will probably manage to fight sweeping changes for years to come, there is a realisation that the niches which it has been able to exploit because of differences in national laws are bound to dwindle if European integration gathers pace. For this reason, the new buzz-word in Luxembourg financial circles is 'training'. The idea is to refine and boost skills and expertise, so that the country remains attractive, whatever the future of European regulations. 'The advantages which Luxembourg has will be reduced over time. What must remain, however, is a high degree of know-how,' says Mr Francois Colling, leader of the Christian Social party in parliament. 'Look at investment funds. Why do we have so many here? It has nothing to do with bank secrecy, but everything to do with specialising in the sector.' Being small, in other words, means being nimble and flexible enough to keep one step ahead of more powerful neighbouring countries. So far, Luxembourg has shown that it is capable of running races with the giants of Europe and beating them over certain distances and in certain categories. The challenge, however, is to repeat the feat not just once, but year after year.</p>

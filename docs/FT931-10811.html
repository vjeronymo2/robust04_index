			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Mexico denial on contract MEXICAN authorities have ruled that there were no irregularities in the awarding of a Dollars 21m (Pounds 13.9m) air traffic control system to Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy. The awarding of the contract infuriated US and Canadian multinationals, Raytheon Canada, IBM International Air Traffic, and Calmaquip (acting for Westinghouse). They believed that their original offers had been disqualified unjustifiably, and that Thomson's technology was not in operation elsewhere, and thus did not comply with the specifications in the second tender. But Mexico's General Comptroller of the Federation has still to release the report by the Canadian company Martin Marietta on the evaluation of the contract, which is being demanded by the US and Canadian companies. They consider the report necessary to assess the Comptroller's ruling. The Comptroller briefed diplomats on where the bidding companies were not compliant with the specifications on the first tender, and said that it was not necessary that a winning bidder have its technology fully operational elsewhere. Mexico's ministry of transport and communication said it would seek damages against IBM over allegations by its agent, Dr Kaveh Moussavi, that he was asked to pay a Dollars 1m bribe to secure the contract. IBM Mexico dissassociated itself on television news from Dr Moussavi's claims. Dr Moussavi says he informed IBM in the US of the incident on November 9 - ten days before the first tender offer was cancelled - and that an internal record exists of his report.</p>

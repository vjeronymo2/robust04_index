			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Moscow masses troops on borders of rebel Chechnya The Russian military's impatience to crack down on the rebel republic of Chechnya was evident last night in the Interior Ministry's border garrison at Mozdok, where armour and troops were massing. '(President Boris) Yeltsin should have done this two years ago,' said Lt-Col Vladimir Mozhaev, commander of the garrison. 'Chechnya is a banana republic, forcing us Russians to run about at its will.' The large-scale preparations appeared to point to an imminent invasion of the rebel republic. Military action aimed at replacing the regime of Gen Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, would be the first serious conflict under Mr Yeltsin's presidency. The crisis has been building since Chechnya declared independence from Russia in 1991, and an attack would have incalculable repercussions throughout the troubled former Soviet republics of the Caucasus region. It would also boost nationalist sentiment within Russia. Mr Yeltsin last night reissued an ultimatum to the warring factions in Chechnya to stop fighting. But he withdrew an earlier threat to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya, leading to hopes that a peaceful solution could still be found to the crisis. A Russian parliamentary delegation, led by Mr Sergei Yushenkov, head of the defence committee, yesterday held talks with senior Chechen government officials in the capital, Grozny. As the Russian military build-up went on, transport aircraft flew in troops and equipment to Mozdok last night. The roads around the base were choked with tanks, armoured personnel carriers, engineering equipment and lorries crammed with soldiers, automatic rifles in their hands. At Vladikavkaz, the nearby North Ossetian capital, a battalion of paratroopers arrived early yesterday with more tanks and armour. Mozdok and Vladikavkaz are only 30 minutes' drive from the Chechen frontier. Aircraft meanwhile carried out a third round of bombing raids on Grozny. According to Russian reports, the raid from Mozdok smashed aircraft and bombed fuel dumps in the military and civilian airfields near Grozny, destroying all of the republic's small and antiquated air force of a dozen or so aircraft. Amid pictures of Soviet military heroes and communist slogans, Col Mozhaev and his staff were frank in their hatred of the nationalist pretensions of Chechnya and confident they could end Gen Dudayev's rule. 'Gen (Pavel) Grachev (Russian defence minister) said we could take Grozny in two hours with a battalion of paratroopers. I think it would be quicker. We need to act like the Americans in Haiti - quickly take it, and that's it.'</p>

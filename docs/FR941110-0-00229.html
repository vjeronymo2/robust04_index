			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, it is not just the inconsistency with the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies which has led us to reexamine our policy on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. In addition, HCFA does not want to discourage new,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable ownership interests from improving the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care that residents receive. Investing in a NATCEP may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhance quality of care; to prohibit a new owner from having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a program would be counterproductive with the larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the programs. Therefore, under this regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are changing our policy on transfer of the prohibition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NATCEP to a new owner to bring it into line with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workings of other remedies. The 2-year restriction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NATCEP will not apply to the new owner of a provider unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that new owner or organization has been the subject of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended (or partial extended) survey, or is otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the terms of &sect;483.151, under its tenure. If all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other requirements for the approval of NATCEP are met,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including substantial compliance with all program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, the new owner may provide NATCEP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have received numerous inquiries from providers as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as their attorneys asking what appeal rights are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available when approval of a facility's NATCEP has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied or withdrawn. While the Act does not provide for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal appeals for denial or withdrawal of a NATCEP, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that providers ought to have some opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge this disapproval. Therefore, we expect providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to appeal their NATCEP disapproval within the timeframes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for dispute resolution, as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.331 of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have reached this result because, notwithstanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact that the Act permits us and the State survey agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conduct extended (or partial extended) surveys for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason, we are nevertheless under this regulation choosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conduct such surveys only when we or a State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency determines that substandard quality of care exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just as we believe a provider ought to have access to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal dispute resolution mechanism to challenge what it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perceives to be inaccurate survey findings, we believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it ought to be able to challenge the correctness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State survey agency's or HCFA's determination that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care existed. If successful in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge, then the factual basis for doing the extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey will have been removed, and, in such cases, it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be inequitable to saddle the provider with the loss of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NATCEP when there was no factual basis for doing so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are limiting the appeals of these matters to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal dispute resolution process because we do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe the loss of a NATCEP is a remedy of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude or type as other statutory remedies for which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more formal appeals mechanism is available. Unlike the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other remedies, a facility losing its NATCEP will not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on that basis alone, face exclusion from the Medicare or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid programs, nor will it face the same kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deprivation that is arguably the case with respect to civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties, denial of payment, or the imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management. We believe the informal dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution process satisfies essential elements of due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process here, since a provider will have notice of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended denial of its NATCEP and the opportunity to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with agency officials to challenge the findings that gave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rise to the denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that every State should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the same penalty system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act permits the States to elect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies if they can demonstrate that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies are as effective as the remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Additional Conforming Changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to change to our regulations identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, it is necessary that we make minor, technical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> editorial or cross reference changes to several other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation sections. We are making conforming changes to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 401 (&sect;&sect;401.130, and 401.133), part 431  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;&sect;431.115, 431.151, 431.152, 431.153, 431.154, 431.221,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 431.610);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 435 (&sect;435.1009);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 440 (&sect;440.40, 440.140, 440.150); we recodified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;440.150 to separate NFs and ICFs/MR to make it clear which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions apply to each. No substantive changes have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made as a result of this new section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 441 (&sect;441.11);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 442 (&sect;&sect;442.1, 442.12, 442.14, 442.15, 442.16,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 442.20, 442.30, 442.40, 442.42, 442.101, 442.105, 442.109,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 442.110, 442.111, 442.117, 442.118, and 442.119);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 488 (&sect;&sect;488.8, 488.11, 488.14, 488.18, 488.20,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 488.24, 488.26, 488.28, and 488.50);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 489 (&sect;&sect;489.3, 489.11, 489.12, 489.15, 489.16,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 489.18, 489.53, 489.60, 489.62, and 489.64); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 498 (&sect;&sect;498.1, 498.2, 498.3, and 498.5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Part 498 (&sect;&sect;498.1, 498.2, 498.3, and 498.5); we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised &sect;498.3(b)(7) to exclude SNF and NF terminations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNFs and NFs may appeal the noncompliance that led to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination under &sect;498.3(b)(13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

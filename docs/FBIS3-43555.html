			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Party [NP] and the ANC [African  National Congress] have indicated in separate statements that  there are limits to the extent that they are prepared to go in  their negotiations with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the  Freedom Alliance. The statements were issued in reaction to the  decision by the IFP Central Committee that the party will not  take part in the April election unless the constitutional  demands by the Alliance are met.    The NP said it was prepared to consider the proposals by the  IFP and the Alliance on merit, but that it would not be  intimidated in the process. The party said it appeared that the  IFP and the Alliance were turning towards blackmail, and there  was a strong likelihood of the two organizations painting  themselves into a corner.    The ANC said its executive committee would discuss the  matter  next Friday if the IFP informed the ANC of its decision  formally. The ANC said although it remained committed to  negotiations with all parties, there was no chance of the  election being postponed. The organization said the reasonable  demands in the joint document signed by the ANC, the government,  and the IFP could end the present deadlock.    The IFP Central Committee said in a statement that if its  demands were not met, it would not take part in the elections,  liaise with the new parliamentary or provincial councils,  participate in the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], nor  accept TEC decisions. The IFP considered the reintroduction of  double ballot papers as nonnegotiable.</p>

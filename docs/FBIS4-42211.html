			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams tonight spelled out  what he insists is necessary for peace and political progress in  Ireland:     -  Any internal Northern Ireland political settlement  was out;    -  Long-term prisoners should be speedily freed;    -  And the  Unionist veto should be kicked out.     He repeated that the clarification of the Downing Street  Declaration recently provided by the British Government would  not be examined until after the European elections. But he gave  a shopping list of requirements at odds with the contents of the  Declaration signed last December by the British and Irish  premiers.    He said Sinn Fein would have to ensure that there was no  return to Unionist domination. "There can never again be an  internal settlement," he added.    The British Government should "write into new legislation"  the right of the Irish people to national self-determination, he  said in west Belfast. At the same time, the Government should  legislate away provisions which provided Unionists with a veto  over political and constitutional change.    And he said that the "speedy release of all long-term  prisoners, pending a full amnesty for all political prisoners,  must be a matter of urgent concern."    The Irish language should be given equality of status,  including funding, he added.    An effort should be made to end job discrimination and  economic inequalities against Catholics -- and what he called  the underlying sectarian bias against Nationalist areas in the  allocation of economic investment must end.    Mr Adams appeared to see no contradiction in calling for the  Nationalist majority in Ireland to be given the right to decide  the future at the same time as saying the Unionist majority in  Northern Ireland should lose the right to say what happened.  And he said: "The British Government must recognise that it  cannot on the one hand assert its neutrality and say it is for  no particular pre-determined outcome, while at the same time  saying it will stand by the Union."    His comments came hours after Democratic Unionist MP for  Belfast East Peter Robinson warned that Unionist people felt so  alieniated, marginalised and estranged by discussions over their  head about their future that support for the use of violence was  increasing.</p>

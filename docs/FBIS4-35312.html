			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>   [Text] Today's meeting will discuss the bylaws that will  organize the work of the Palestinian National Authority. So  far, 19 out of the 24 members of this authority have been  appointed. The bylaws will specifically seek to establish a  democratic course of action and behavior that will allow this  authority to avoid the mistakes and detours that have prevailed  in the PLO Executive Commitee's work for years.    Yesterday's meeting discussed the program of the Palestinian  National Authority and its prerogatives. It allocated 22  portfolios for health, economy, education, and other fields.  However, the names of those who will be responsible for these  portfolios will not be known before the end of the current  meetings in Tunis and, perhaps, not before the authority is  completely formed.    In this respect, informed sources here report that a figure  close to the Hamas Movement and whose identity was not revealed  will arrive in Tunis today for further consultations with the  PLO leaders on the possibility of joining the authority. The  sources added that Abu-Nidal Mussallami, member of the Central  Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,  led by Dr. George Habash, would most probably join the authority.    According to sources from within the new authority, the  apointment of the remaining members of this authority might take  place at the end of the current meetings, but not necessarily  so. Consultations in this respect may continue in the coming  days.</p>

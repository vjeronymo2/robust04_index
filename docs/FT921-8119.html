			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as hopes of interest rate cut recede SHARE PRICES fell on futures-related selling and liquidation of holdings by investment trust funds, and the Nikkei average shed Monday's 2.1 per cent gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 452.95 down at 20,872.03, after a day's high of 21,294.02 and low of 20,807.40. An afternoon fall in futures prices had prompted arbitrage unwinding. Volume was flat at 200m shares. Declines led advances by 608 to 328, with 177 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 19.84 at 1,539.99, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index weakened 15.48 to 1,163.89. Market participants were disappointed that foreign exchanges had ignored Monday's intervention by the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to support the yen against the dollar. The US unit rallied against European currencies, and rose to Y127.17, up from Y126.93, against the yen. The rise dampened hopes of lower interest rates and prompted profit-taking in the equity market. Tokkin, or specified money trusts, and investment trusts, which face redemptions, were seen liquidating holdings. However, some analysts believe the Bank of Japan will ease short-term money rates in the event of a sharp downturn in the Nikkei. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said the bottom range for the index was around 20,000. Financial issues were lower on small-lot corporate selling ahead of the March book closing. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y150 to Y2,680 and Fuji Bank Y100 to Y2,000. Steel issues retreated initially on reports of a further decline in crude steel output for January. Crude steel output fell by a year-on-year 14.8 per cent last month, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. However, bargain hunting later supported NKK, which added Y6 at Y331, and Tokyo Steel, which gained Y20 to Y2,370. High-priced small-capital issues with low pay-out ratios advanced on hopes that the companies will raise dividends, or announce stock splits. Keyence, the measuring equipment maker, climbed Y200 to Y10,700 and Family Mart, the retailer, put on Y130 to Y8,930. After the close, Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), said the exchange had started an investigation into the recent trading of shares in Daito Trust Construction. The company, which made a debut on the TSE's first section on February 5, ran into heavy selling last week amid rumours that it had guaranteed debt for a bankrupt concern. Daito ended Y50 off at Y8,550, compared with Y9,780, the closing price on its first day of trading. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 85.74 to 22,556.78 in volume of 52.1m shares. Window dressing ahead of the March book closing lifted smaller companies. High-technology shares weakened on worries over earnings. Roundup A LOWER Nikkei depressed sentiment in the Pacific Rim, although most bourses were affected by local issues. Thailand was closed. HONG KONG, after starting strongly, lost some ground on afternoon profit-taking. The Hang Seng index finished a net 27.91 up at 4,747.10 in turnover of HKDollars 1.7bn. There were rumours of covered warrant issues from Bank of East Asia and Hopewell: the bank was unchanged at HKDollars 21.40 while the property group rose 2.50 cents to HKDollars 4.00. Jardine Matheson put on HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 44.50 as sentiment towards trading companies turned positive. Citic Pacific, the Chinese-backed investment trust, moved ahead 15 cents or 6.6 per cent to HKDollars 2.40 as the Quok family increased its holding. SEOUL dipped 1.92 to 638.22, with interest in securities shares preventing the market from falling further. The Korea Securities Market Stabilisation Fund said it would pay a 5 per cent dividend to members. JAKARTA retreated, the index closing 4.16 down at 286.75 in volume of 7.6m shares. KUALA LUMPUR firmed on hopes that interest rates might be cut, although Bank Negara, the central bank, has indicated that a reduction might not occur for another three months. The composite index rose 9.89 to 607.67 in volume of 65m shares (41m). Telekom gained 20 cents to MDollars 11.10, with 1.8m shares traded. SINGAPORE retrieved most of Monday's loss. The Straits Times Industrial index improved 6.99 to 1,501.80 in volume of 58m shares. TAIWAN fell further on concern over the central bank's decision to restrict foreign investment. The weighted index lost 92.57 or 1.9 per cent to 4,766.91. MANILA eased afresh, partly on reports that a family trust wanted to liquidate part of its holding in Ayala Corporation. The composite index was 2.53 off at 1,176.57. AUSTRALIA's early gains were trimmed back by the fall in Tokyo. The All Ordinaries index closed 12.5 up at 1,626.7. News Corp rose 58 cents to a record high of ADollars 18.24, while demand for CRA pushed the price up 38 cents to ADollars 13.84. Commonwealth Bank, which reports its interims today, firmed 3 cents to ADollars 7.13. NEW ZEALAND partially recovered after results from Telecom and Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index was down a net 4.32 at 1,473.03 in turnover of some NZDollars 18m.</p>

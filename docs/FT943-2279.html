			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: McDonnell faces tough decision on missiles side McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace company, faces a difficult decision about the future of its missile business following its failure to get the 'winner takes all' contract for up to Dollars 2bn of Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US Navy. The hard realities of consolidation in the US defence business were underlined by Hughes, the winner of the competition, which put its success down to the cost savings it has generated since buying General Dynamics' missile business two years ago. Hughes has rationalised the two companies' operations and moved them all to a single site in Tucson, Arizona. McDonnell Douglas had put its missile operations up for sale 18 months ago but pulled it off the market because it considered offers inadequate. Now it is waiting for a debriefing at the Pentagon which will explain why it lost the Tomahawk competition before deciding what to do next. The company has work on the Tomahawk from previous competitions which will last until mid-1995. McDonnell could also bid for a small contract to supply the UK with 100 Tomahawks, but there is no other potential work pending. As a result, the future of the factory at Titusville, Florida, which employs 1,300 people on Cruise, must now be in doubt. Another 400 are employed on the programme at the company's headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, but they produce ship-based control systems which were unaffected by the missile competition. Elsewhere, McDonnell's ship-launched Harpoon and the stand-off SLAM missile are relatively small contracts and its main development work is on the JDAM smart bomb. That may not be sufficient to maintain a viable missiles business in the rapidly shrinking US defence market. In theory, McDonnell Douglas could add to its missile operations, but it is much more likely that the company will decide to sell to another missile maker. Hughes, which bid for the business last year, may be less interested now that it has become the sole supplier of Tomahawks. Other potential buyers may still be interested.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Retirement change to be staged SOCIAL security ministers are drawing up plans to soften the impact of a planned rise to 65 in the female state retirement age. They intend to delay the increase for a decade - and warn that Britain will lose to economic competitors if the change is blocked. Under proposals being considered by the department, the retirement age for women would remain at the current 60 for 10 years. After that the qualifying age would rise by 12 months each year for five years. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has begun consultations with other cabinet colleagues and is expected to publish before the summer a white paper on pension equalisation. The department is acutely aware of the strong political impact of the planned rise, and the reaction of women employees. But they are preparing to counter that by arguing that no woman currently in her fifties would be affected. Figures prepared by the department will be used to argue that UK companies could be severely disadvantaged if male and female retirement ages are not equalised at 65. Maintaining the status quo would, as the population ages, impose an increasing burden on the Treasury - and on companies who set their retirement ages in line with the state. A review by the social security department shows that in Germany, retirement ages are to be equalised at 65 by 2012 and that over the next two decades Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain, will equalise at 65. Denmark is to equalise at 67 and the US is expected to move to 67 by the year 2027. The exception is Japan, which is to equalise at 60 by 2000 but the social security department believes the country may also move towards 65 by a later date.</p>

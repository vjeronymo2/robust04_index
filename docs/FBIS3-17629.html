			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The outcome of the presidential elections in the  Crimea and the subsequent course of events are acquiring  particular importance on the very eve of the Ukrainian  parliamentary elections. Confrontation with Kiev, be it explicit  or implicit, and gravitation towards Russia are now typical not  only of the Crimea but of other fairly large parts of the  Ukraine as well.    Representatives of totalitarian trends are bound to appear  in  the new parliament, as are their opponents. This is unlikely to  help reduce tension in the top echelons of power or increase the  capability of the supreme bodies of state authority.    Meanwhile, presidential representatives have been  outspokenly  critical of incitement towards separatism, of which they accuse  the leaders of the Crimea. For example, the head of the  Ukrainian president's internal policy service, Mykola  Mykhalchenko, told journalists recently that Kiev is likely to  have to apply the same measures towards the Crimea as India in  the Punjab or Great Britain in Northern Ireland.</p>

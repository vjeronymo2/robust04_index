Negotiators, observers, and  mediators have been observing a pause since yesterday afternoon,  and the talks will only resume tomorrow. It seems that Chief  Blondin Beye wants the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] to change its stand. He wants a more  responsible UNITA to assume a position that meets the highest  aspirations of the Angolan population. Our correspondent Pedro  Manuel reports:    [Begin Manuel recording] Blondin Beye is still trying to  approach the two delegations, which until now maintained distant  positions on the national police issue. It seems that Beye is  still making efforts to persuade UNITA in particular to review  its position, which is not supported by anyone. The fact that  Jonas Savimbi's men remain hardened in their position leads  analysts in Lusaka to reiterate their view that UNITA may break  this negotiating round at any time. The talks resume on 17  January, and the mediators and observers will continue working  on approaching the negotiating teams to begin discussing  specific principles. [end recording]</p>

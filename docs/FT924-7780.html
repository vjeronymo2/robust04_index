			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Japanese corporate bankruptcies still rising CORPORATE bankruptcies in Japan will continue to mount until at least next spring, according to a report published yesterday by Teikoku Data Bank, the credit rating agency, which said there were 1,294 bankruptcies in September, 20 per cent up on the same month last year. Teikoku Data Bank underlined the severity of the downturn in the Japanese economy by predicting that bankruptcies would reach 14,000 for the year as a whole. In the 10 months to the end of October there were 11,385 bankruptcies. This is still well short of the 20,841 bankruptcies reported in 1984, when Japanese export industries were hit by a sharp appreciation of the yen. However the projected rate of growth in bankruptcies, a 30.5 per cent rise from the 10,723 reported in 1991, is far greater than at any time during the 1980s. The report confirms that the economic slowdown has become the main reason for bankruptcies. In 1990 and 1991 the main factor was the collapse in the stock and real estate markets. About 51 per cent of the September bankruptcies were attributed to the gathering downturn. Fewer than 10 per cent were attributed to the burst of Japan's real estate bubble. The 1,294 September bankruptcies had a value of Y760bn (Pounds 4bn), slightly down from the Y784bn in September 1991.</p>

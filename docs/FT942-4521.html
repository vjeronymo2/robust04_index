			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Brussels seeks to phase out state aid for ailing national airlines State aid to national airlines in financial difficulties would be virtually phased out in the European Union in the next three years under guidelines which Brussels is circulating among member states. The European Commission draft plan could determine how Brussels will conduct its two week-old investigation into the French government's request for a further increase of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.33bn) in capital for Air France, its lossmaking flag carrier. The guidelines will come into effect as soon as the Commission finishes consultations within its own departments and with the 12 EU member states. In the more competitive environment created by the EU's 'open skies' legislation, the draft document says: 'State aids are of substantially increased strategic importance since they might severely distort competition.' But although the draft calls for a level playing field, it allows for final cash injections to turn around airlines 'suffering from the burdens of the past', and for short-term 'rescue aid' to carriers attempting to restructure. However, a 'fresh start' for troubled airlines involving government aid must be based on commercial principles and include: A 'comprehensive restructuring programme' including capacity reduction No further state aid thereafter No government interference in management No use of the aid by the airline for acquiring stakes in other EU carriers No attempt to strengthen market position in contravention of EU law opening up European routes to greater competition. The Commission's transport directorate wants to end state aid to airlines by April 1 1997. 'After that date the Commission will very stringently assess the effects of the aid on competition, and, if at all, accept such aid programmes in very exceptional cases only, and only if it includes severe cutbacks in capacity,' the draft guidelines say. The guidelines are broadly in line with the recommendations of the 'Committee of Wise Men' which the Commission asked to report on the airline industry earlier this year. But the aviation 'liberals' among the 12 - principally the UK, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland - could push for tighter screening and a more rapid aid phase-out. The new Air France request is particularly controversial because in 1991 and 1992 the Commission approved a capital top-up for the troubled French carrier worth FFr5.8bn in three tranches. Further aid, critics like British Airways say, conflicts with the Brussels doctrine of 'last chance' restructuring aid. In addition, they say, only under duress has Air France started to abide by its EU obligations to open up routes to competition. Aid barely lifts Andalucia, Page 3</p>

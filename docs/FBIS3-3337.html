During an hourlong meeting with Jiang, Hosokawa called for  China's active participation in the negotiations on an  international treaty designed to impose a comprehensive ban on  nuclear tests.    There was no immediate response from Jiang, however, the  officials said.    Prior to the meeting with Jiang, Hosokawa talked with  Premier  Li Peng and voiced grave concern over recent situations  surrounding North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons.    Also during the meeting with the president, Hosokawa  reiterated his remarks on Japan's wartime responsibilities,  referring to his policy speech made in August which expressed  "deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese  actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused  unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people."    Jiang told Hosokawa Japan and China should look at their  bilateral relations from a long-term perspective.    The president was quoted as saying the two nations have  common points and the two sides are "partners, not rivals,"  despite differences in the social system between Japan's  capitalism and China's socialism.    Hosokawa is currently on a three-day visit to China  beginning  Saturday.    Jiang referred to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to China earlier this month and said he told  Christopher that "fighting is the beginning of becoming friends."    If the two sides engage in patient negotiations and confide  in each other instead of resorting to pressure, the negotiations  would be successful, Jiang was quoted as saying.    The Chinese president also said the U.S. extension of most-  favored-nation (MFN) trade status to China will be mutually  beneficial.    Washington has linked MFN extension to improvement in  China's  human rights record. China refuses any such linkage.    Jiang also told Hosokawa that patience is necessary to solve  the problem of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development.    Jiang said he realizes there are expectations for China in  helping solve the issue but that it is necessary to engage in  "patient and fair" negotiations.    Jiang also brought up defense matters and said China's  military facilities are for defense purposes and will not be  used for aggression.    At the end of the meeting, Hosokawa extended an invitation  for Jiang to visit Japan again, officials said. Jiang visited  Japan in 1992.</p>

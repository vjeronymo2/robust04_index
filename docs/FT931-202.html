			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Jobs: So if you think you've a better claim . . . - How an insufficiently impressionable candidate finally grasped the nettle, and got stung 'HOW about me?' the Jobs column asked Suzanne Lawrence. It certainly stopped her in her tracks - which pleased me, because any less dramatic effect would have been ego-puncturing. After all, in 20 years of being asked by recruiters to pass on offers of jobs to the FT's readers, I'd never before suggested myself as a candidate. The case, however, was not so much an exception as a near-miracle of coincidence. Suzanne edits two magazines: Personnel Management published at the start of each month, and PM Plus which comes out mid-monthly. Having first joined the PM title at the same time as I joined this paper, October 1968, she has been thinking of giving up her editing role to develop new ventures for her company, of which she is part-owner. She has now finally decided to do so, and is seeking a successor as editor. In synchronisation with her again, I've also grasped a nettle. Being only 13 months short of the FT's retirement age of 62, I have broached the matter with my boss. The result is that while the Jobs column will go on, hopefully for ever, its last appearance under the present writer will be in the week ending February 4 at the latest, although accumulated holiday would allow my departure to be brought forward. The experience is a bit like first being seriously shot at. However much you have thought about it in advance, you can't know what your reaction will be until it actually happens. Mine has been to feel even less decisive now a date is set than I felt beforehand. In particular, doubts as to whether I want to stop being a journalist are equalled only by uncertainty as to whether I want to go on being one. In such circumstances, of course, it is tempting to leave things to fate. So while Suzanne was telling me about the job to be done by her successor, I upped and suggested my aged self just to see what transpired. As reported, it took her aback. But after a minute of wild-eyed silence, she recovered beautifully. 'I'd welcome you as a candidate,' she said. 'But I suspect that my co-selectors are thinking of someone a bit more impressionable.' Even so, in case any less unimpressionable readers want to try for the editorship, I'll outline some other things it calls for. Diplomatic skills are among them since, while the magazines are produced at arms-length by the London-based Personnel Publications company, both are published under contract with Britain's Institute of Personnel Management. And as a dozen staff are involved in producing them, it would help to have a bit more team-leadership experience than has come the Jobs column's way - to date, at least. There are, however, a couple of things in which candidates might usefully match me. One is practice at business journalism. Another is a keen interest not only in the various aspects of what is now fashionably known as human resource management, but in communicating their importance to managers outside that particular specialism. The discussion never got as far as salary, but my guess is at least Pounds 35,000. Perks negotiable. Inquiries to Ms Lawrence at 17 Britton St, London EC1M 5NQ; tel (0)71-336 7888, fax -336 7635. N OW to the table below which gives the latest indicators of management pay in Britain as shown by the six-monthly surveys of the Reward consultancy. The most recent covers nearly 21,000 managerial staff employed by about 1,100 varied organisations across the United Kingdom. Anyone wanting the full report, which is priced at Pounds 200, should contact Steve Flather of Reward at Diamond Way, Stone Business Park, Staffordshire ST15 0SD; tel (0)785 813566, fax 817007. Although the study includes six ranks, my table is confined to just one - executives immediately below board level. In all cases, two pay figures are given: basic salary then total money rewards. The lower quartile figures refer to the manager who would be a quarter way up from the foot of a ranking of all doing similar work, the medians to the one ranked half-way, and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down from the top. The table's right-hand column shows the percentages of all the executives in each job category who have company cars. To allow for increases between the collection of data and April 1, Reward says the pay figures should be upped by 0.53 per cent, and by a further 3.5 per cent for each month thereafter. Regional variations from the overall median of Pounds 31,000 were: Higher - London by 17.8 per cent, Scotland by 6.4, Northern Ireland by 4.2, and south-east England by 2.7. Lower - south-west by 3.5 per cent, north-west by 4.0, west midlands by 4.6, and eastern counties and north-east by 9.7. Variances from the median by employer's sales turnover were: Higher - Pounds 500m-plus by 53 per cent, Pounds 200m-Pounds 500m by 16.7, Pounds 100m-Pounds 200m by 9.7, and Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m by 4.0. Lower - Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m by 4 per cent, Pounds 20m-Pounds 50m by 5.2, Pounds 3m-Pounds 10m by 11.4, and up to Pounds 3m by 18.3.</p>

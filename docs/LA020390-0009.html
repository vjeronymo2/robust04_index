			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DAILEY HELPS SEATTLE WIN; CAMPBELL SCORES 44 AGAINST CELTICS  </P> <P> The Seattle SuperSonics were desperate. They had lost 12 consecutive road games  and lost two outstanding guards.  </P> <P> Shortly before Friday night's game at Indianapolis against the Indiana Pacers,  the SuperSonics signed Quintin Dailey, who had blown a chance to play with the  Lakers during training camp.  </P> <P> Dailey , who was out of shape and not too dependable in the week he spent in  Laker training camp, paid an instant dividend.  </P> <P> After grabbing a loose ball with only seven seconds left, Dailey was fouled and  made the first of two free throws to give the SuperSonics an 87-86 victory.  </P> <P> Dailey, who was averaging 15.6 points for Sioux Falls of the Continental  Basketball Assn., played 25 minutes in his Seattle debut and contributed 11  points. He signed a 10-day contract.  </P> <P> The Lakers are paying the bulk of Dailey's $400,000. But they lost interest  when he showed up at camp 25 pounds overweight, then in a week missed a plane  flight, a meeting and a practice.  </P> <P> The Pacers had a chance to win after Dailey missed his second free throw, but  Detlef Schrempf was called for a charge with 1.1 seconds left.  </P> <P> Dailey was signed after Sedale Threatt joined Dale Ellis on the injured list.  Both will be out for a long time.  </P> <P> "Just like Ellis and Threatt," said Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff, "Quintin  is a pro."  </P> <P> Minnesota 116, Boston 105 -- Former Laker Tony Campbell scored 12 of his  career-high 44 points in the last three minutes at Minneapolis to lead the  expansion Timberwolves to their third victory in a row.  </P> <P> Campbell, who was 15 for 28 from the field, sank a jumper with 1:30 left to  give Minnesota a 103-102 lead. Campbell then made six consecutive free throws  as 35,713 fans roared.  </P> <P> Larry Bird was only seven for 17 from the field, but the Celtic veteran was  four for four from the line and has now made 63 consecutive free throws.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 119, Milwaukee 109 -- Charles Barkley has been saying all season  the 76ers are one of the best teams in the NBA. People are finally beginning to  be convinced.  </P> <P> Among the new believers are the Bucks. The 76ers spotted the Bucks a 13-point,  third-quarter lead at Philadelphia, then roared back to win their 10th in a  row.  </P> <P> Barkley had 33 points and 15 rebounds, and the 76ers pulled away in the closing  minutes to move back into a tie with New York for first place in the Atlantic  Division.  </P> <P> San Antonio 118, Charlotte 107 -- It has been a long time since a rookie  dominated games in the NBA the way 7-1 David Robinson of the Spurs does.  </P> <P> In this game at Charlotte, the former Navy star had the kind of triple-double  only a good big man can have. He scored 27 points, had 15 rebounds and blocked  11 shots in an awesome performance.  </P> <P> Because he has developed so quickly, the Spurs are on a pace that would set a  league record for improvement from one season to the next.  </P> <P> The season that Larry Bird joined them (1979-80), the Boston Celtics improved  by 32 victories. The Spurs are 30-13. A 24-15 record the rest of the way would  break the record for the Spurs.  </P> <P> Washington 108, Sacramento 99 -- Jeff Malone scored 40 points at Landover, Md.,  and rookie Ed Horton chipped in with 18 as the Bullets handed the Kings their  fourth defeat in a row.  </P> <P> The Kings, who are 2-19 on the road, pulled to within five points in the fourth  quarter only to have Malone make two baskets in a row.  </P> <P> Utah 105, Dallas 92 -- Karl Malone had five of his 30 points in an 18-4  fourth-quarter run at Salt Lake City that broke open a tough game and ended the  Mavericks' seven-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Golden State 128, New Jersey 109 -- Manute Bol blocked 13 shots at Oakland and  the Warriors coasted to another easy victory, improving their record at home to  18-5.

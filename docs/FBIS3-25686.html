State employees have gone back to work. Pubilc and private  transportation is functioning normally. Markets and shops are  open.    The demonstrations, which had paralyzed all activities in  Kigali, led to a loss of lives and damage to property. Hospital  sources say that Kigali Hospital registered 15 dead and 43  injured, 14 of whom are still hospitalized. Among the injured  is a small girl aged six, who lost her arm. The toll forwarded  by the Belgian Red Cross is much heavier: About 20 are reported  to have died and the number of injured is estimated at 100.    According to the police (?brigade) operating in Kigali,  peace  has returned in almost all areas of the town. However, last  night in Gikondo, a man and a woman were killed at (Gatenga).  Families who fled their homes in the Gikondo area have not yet  returned. This information was reported by our correspondent in  Kigali, Jean-Pierre Nshimirumuremyi.</p>

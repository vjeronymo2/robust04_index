For Wan Guoquan,  who has maintained close cooperation with the CPC for nearly  half a century, this is an event worthy of celebration.    Wan Guoquan frankly revealed his feeling to XINHUA  correspondents after he was elected a CPPCC vice chairman: "As  an honest friend of the CPC, I would like to thank the CPPCC  members for trusting in me. I will devote the rest of my life to  doing my job well."    Wan Guoquan has been a friend who cooperated closely and  shared weal and woe with the CPC. He is also an honest friend  who handles matters impartially. In the early days following  the liberation of China when Wan Guoquan was manager of an  enterprise in Tianjin, he responded to the call of the party and  took the lead in introducing public-private joint management to  the enterprise under his management. Since then, he has been  serving under the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce  [ACFIC] and the CDNCA. Comrades who know him have lauded him as  "a democratic person devoted to his work who handles party work  very well and dares to speak frankly."    "I came from a warlord family in northeast China, and it was  natural I was not spared misfortune during the `Cultural  Revolution.' I was made to work in a cow shed; I was subjected  to criticism and struggle; I was made to work as a construction  worker, a carpenter, and a cook. But this has not shaken my  confidence in the CPC." With deep feeling, Wan Guoquan recalled  events of the past: "After the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, I resumed my work in the Tianjin  branch of the ACFIC and CDNCA. Later, I was transferred to the  post of specialized vice chairman of the CDNCA Central  Committee. My contacts with high- ranking leaders of the CPC  have further convinced me that the CPC is truly concerned about  and cherishes us, treating the democratic parties as its partner  of cooperation."    Wan Guoquan recalled an event which involved him personally.  When Deng Yingchao inspected work in Tianjin in a certain year,  she learned that Wang Guoquan's father had done something for  our party. She intentionally chose "1 July" as the date for  inviting Wan Guoquan and his wife to be her guests. While  holding Wan Guoquan's hands, Deng Yingchao told him: "You are a  good friend of our party." Wan Guoquan was moved to tears after  hearing the remark. After that, Deng Yingchao used to inquire  about his living conditions.    "The democratic parties want to become honest friends of the  CPC precisely because it regards us as friends," said Wan  Guoquan. He added: "Treating each other with full sincerity  and sharing weal and woe, political consultation, and democratic  supervision-- this is a function of the parties participating in  the administration of state affairs and the CPPCC. Personally,  I dare not forget this even for an instant."    It has been learned that Wan Guoquan conducts investigations  and studies at basic-level units every year, and writes motions  and proposals on economic construction. Last year, together  with some experts and scholars of the CDNCA, Wan Guoquan visited  five provinces and autonomous regions in northwest China to  conduct investigations. On behalf of the CDNCA Central  Committee, he submitted to the party Central Committee and the  leadership of the five provinces and autonomous regions a report  on some issues regarding economic development in the five  provinces and autonomous regions. During the three years since  he assumed the post of executive vice chairman of the CDNCA  Central Committee, many of the motions submitted by the CDNCA  have been adopted by the party Central Committee and other  relevant departments. Last year, the central leadership  attached great importance to CDNCA-submitted motions and  proposals on constitutional amendments, to strengthening rural  and agricultural work, to reform of existing banquet systems to  promote the transformation of customs and habits, and to  invigoration of large and medium state-owned enterprises. As  these remarks were being made, Wan Guoquan waved his hand in a  modest gesture, saying: "These tasks were completed by everyone  under the leadership of Chairman Sun Qimeng. I only served as a  link in reporting conditions at grass-roots levels to the top  leadership."    After awhile, Wan Guoquan said what he would do after  becoming a CPPCC vice chairman: "First, with the change of  status, one must not change the style of being hardworking,  honest, and self- disciplined. As the people have given me the  right, I must change the purpose of serving them. Second,  knowing that I have a heavy responsibility to bear, I must set  stricter demands on myself. I will strengthen political and  professional studies, knowing that knowledge is never  sufficient. Third, I will do my best to fulfill my  responsibility of reflecting the opinions and proposals of  60,000 CDNCA members and other members of the democratic parties.    "Through actual deeds, I will forever be an honest friend of  the CPC." Wan Guoquan said these concluding remarks resolutely.</p>

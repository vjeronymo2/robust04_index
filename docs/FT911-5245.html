			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Observer: Top 10,000 While it may be just Observer's age, good investigative financial journalists seem thin on the ground these days. Perhaps one reason is that writing for newspapers is far less lucrative than other things. Charles Raw, who remorselessly pursued Bernie Cornfeld and Slater Walker when he was on the staff of The Sunday Times, is hard at work on a book about Italian financier Roberto Calvi who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge. Meanwhile Christopher Hird, another ex-Sunday Times insight team man, has just completed a 964-page Who's Who in Industry. Hird still regards himself as first and foremost an investigative journalist. These days television is his medium. He has chased David Abell, Cecil Parkinson, Rupert Murdoch and others across British TV screens, and has some 'interesting stuff' on ADT's Michael Ashcroft. But the profits from these one-off TV documentaries can be erratic. Hence his company Fulcrum, jointly owned with Richard Belfield and employing 40 staff, has had to diversify. An index of nominees and beneficial owners, known as the red book, has found a niche, and the current listing of 10,000 top people in British industry also looks promising. Priced at Pounds 125, it's available from 88 Islington High Street, London N1 8EG. Showing that his investigative skills are still finely tuned, Hird notes that under 2 per cent of the entrants are women. The commonest star sign is Taurus.</p>

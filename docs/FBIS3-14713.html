It is easy for any observer  to diagnose, refute, and expose their suspect aims. This  article is a modest attempt in that direction.    After saying that "the strategy and principles of U.S.  policy  in the Gulf are based on establishing a balance of forces in the  region with the aim of protecting U.S.interests," U.S. national  security adviser Lake speaks about an endeavor by the U.S.  Administration and its regional allies to maintain the balance  in the region without Iraq and Iran. He believes several  factors that did not exist before have helped the U.S.  Administration pursue this policy. He then speaks about "the  removal of the strategic consideration" from U.S. calculations  with the end of Cold War and says: "The strategic importance of  both Iraq and Iran has dropped dramatically"!    More than that, the U.S. national security adviser goes on  to  say: "The general trend in the area is positive and Washington  enjoys the support of basic forces in it, such as Egypt,  `Israel,' Turkey, and Saudi Arabia." He adds that progress in  the "peace" process has contributed toward strengthening the  U.S. position in the Arab World!    It is very clear that Anthony Lake is expressing wishes  rather than stating facts and realities. He says things the way  he and his administration like to see them, not as they are in  reality.    The U.S. Administration's endeavor to maintain a balance in  the region with the cooperation of its regional allies without  Iraq is a complete failure. What the region has witnessed over  the past three years has clearly shown it is suffering from a  flaw in the balance of power due to the absence of Iraqi power.  This flaw from which the region is suffering has expressed  itself in more than one occasion and event: Foremost was Iran's  occupation of the UAE island of Abu Musa and Saudi Arabia's  attack on the Qatari post of al-Khufus, in addition to other  tangible manifestations.    The U.S. national security adviser tells his biggest lie  when  he claims that "the general trend in the region is positive."  The fact that neither he nor his master Clinton can ignore is  that the general trend in the region is neither positive nor in  the interest of the United States; in fact, it is hostile to it.    Therefore, when he says that "Washington enjoys the support  of basic forces in the region such as Egypt, 'Israel,' Turkey,  and Saudi Arabia" he is playing with words and not telling the  whole truth. These states enjoy clear and effective U.S.  political, financial, and military support. In fact, some of  them have become a burden to the United States because of their  financial needs and political and security problems!    And when he speaks about "progress in the peace process,"  which has helped strengthen their position in the Arab World, he  is only deceiving himself, and perhaps his administration, by  such talk. For there has been no real progress so far in what he  terms "the peace process." And, in addition to U.S. partiality  toward the Zionist entity, a partiality preventing the  achievement of any progress, an Arab conviction is growing day  after day that the Arab regimes taking part in the "peace  process" have not received anything for their involvement from  "Israel" or the U.S. Administration.    The great fallacy of the U.S. national security adviser is  his statement that "the strategic importance of both Iraq and  Iran has dropped dramatically," because political and strategic  facts cannot be changed or wished away. Nobody can create  political or strategic facts that do not exist. If Iraq's  strategic importance has "dropped," as he claims, has the  strategic importance of any Gulf state, of limited resources and  capabilities, increased even if it is an ally of the United  States?!    And, when Lake says "it is not strange to renew the  sanctions  on Iraq every 60 days without a debate" he is talking about the  past rather than the present or future. What happened during  the periodic review of the blockade on Iraq a few days ago  confirms that what the U.S. national security adviser says is  absolutely not true. There were debates and differences over the  issuance of a statement renewing the blockade. Chinese,  Russian, and French viewpoints conflicted with the viewpoint of  the United States concerning the extension decision. In fact,  it was clear that a split had occurred in the Security Council  over the renewal of the blockade on Iraq.    It remains to be said that the current U.S. Administration  does not define its aims and means in the Gulf in light of the  real U.S. interests, but is defining them under the influence  and pressure of the Zionist lobby on the U.S. decision maker.  What the U.S. national security adviser cannot say is that the  Zionist factor plays a decisive role now in determining the aims  and means of U.S. policy in the region, and that this Zionist  factor stands behind all this U.S. hatred and hostility to Iraq.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter De Ionno] </F>   [Text] Although the mantle of power sits on Joe Modise's  broad shoulders as snugly as his new tailor-made suit, the  atmosphere in the new Defence Minister's office twangs with  tension. Mr Modise's minders are twitchy. Nothing is certain.  Civil servants are walking on eggshells to preserve their jobs.    The process of educating the minister has barely begun.  Although he sat on the Transitional Executive Council's defence  sub- committee, Mr Modise must be schooled before he is quizzed  and tested in public. "Don't question him too deeply," whispers  an aide as we enter the L-shaped office on the fourth floor of  the Armscor building, east of Pretoria.    The advice is as unnecessary as it is unwelcome. Mr Modise  is no stranger to hard questions. He has bitten the bullet many  times. His orders to MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing] risked cadres' lives and wrought  death and destruction in apartheid South Africa. But, like the  thousand of guerrilla footsoldiers, Mr Modise led as commander  of Umkhonto we Sizwe, he is still being integrated into the new  defence force.    Mr Modise, 64, is bright-eyed and ardent. He speaks  carefully. Careers and multi-million-rand empires sit balanced  on his comments and decisions.    His immediate priorities are to establish a civilian  department of defence and scrutinise the defence accounts for  any "prunings" that will enable the SANDF [South African  National Defense Force] to take on new responsibilities for  integration without pushing the current R[Rand]9.3-billion  budget above R10-billion next year.    Mr Modise says details of plans that will effectively draw  the teeth of the generals by putting responsibility for military  policy- making, funding and personnel under civilian control  will be announced "within days". "If we are going to break with  the past, we must make the Ministry of Defence a civilian  apparatus that is accountable to Parliament," he says.    While Mr Modise refuses to discuss names, Lieutenant-General  Pierre Steyn, the SADF [South African Defense Force] second-in-  command "Mr Clean" who took early retirement late last year, is  a favoured candidate for Secretary of State for Defence. He  would have equal status with the Chief of the Defence Force who  will retain operational control.    On the matter of appointments, Mr Modise says he cannot  explain why he has no deputy, a post that was mooted for MK and  SACP [South African Communist Party] firebrand Ronnie Kasrils.    "I have been asking that question myself," says Mr Modise.  "Defence is a huge task. It is too much for one man. I am  seeing it from the inside now.    "I have raised it with the deputy president and he cannot  answer, so I will ask President Mandela why I can't have a  deputy."    As expected, Mr Modise is disbanding the National  Peace-keeping Force [NKF] ending the misery of uncertainty for  the "blue berets", the controversial force integrating SADF, MK,  SAP [South African Police] and homeland troops that he helped  establish. Members are being returned to the units from which  they were seconded.    Refusing to join the chorus crowing over the hastily-trained  and rashly-deployed peacekeepers' failure, Mr Modise blames part  of the fiasco on a "reluctance" by the SADF and SAP to  wholeheartedly support the force.    "Now that the situation is normalising, the police must do  this work of law and order, and the army must go back to  barracks.    "I don't see any reason for the NPKF," says Mr Modise.    The NPKF is estimated to have cost about R240-million. Axing  it now leaves more than R120-million to be recouped from its  budget. Anything that can be saved is a bonus: the cost of  integrating more than 30,000 soldiers from MK and the homeland  armies into the SANDF, followed by the inevitable pay-offs for  retrenchments to rationalise the force below 100,000 is likely  to add more than R1-billion a year to the defence bill.    "Such a sensitive subject," Mr Modise says with a wince. It  is clear that in the next round of cuts, jobs as well as  treasured projects will be lost. It is not a policy of savings  at any cost, however. Mr Modise supports the Navy's  R1.2-billion bid to acquire four corvettes to restore its  blue-water patrol and anti-submarine capability.    He sees the porject fitting into the ANC Reconstruction and  Development Programme (RDP) by creating jobs in the equipping of  "green hulls" bought overseas. The project also ensures the  protection of South Africa's marine resources.    Caught between his ministerial responsibility to champion  the  best interests of the SANDF and Armscor [Armaments Corporation  of South Africa] in cabinet and the ANC's obligations to better  citizens' lives, Mr Modise plays down the conflict inherent in  his new job.    Long dubbed a hawk, Mr Modise sees South Africa's  multi-billion- rand arms industry as an irreplaceable source of  skills, jobs and income for the RDP. "There is no  contradiction. Morally the ANC is bound by the RDP to create  jobs for people and if the defence budget is kept where it is  and the arms embargo is lifted, jobs are going to be created,"  he says.    As far as Mr Modise is concerned, the lifting of the UN  Security Council arms embargo, now openly disregarded, is but a  fomarlity. "We called for the embargo because of apartheid and  if we call for it to be lifted anybody opposing that will have  to come with good reasons. We cannot impose it on ourselves,"  he says.    Another major step towards normality will come with the  imminent return and integration of 2,500 MK cadres who have been  trained in Tanzania.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 KYODO -- Japan plans to call for a  stable movement in the currency market at the Group of Seven  (G-7) industrialized nations' meeting of top finance officials  to be held in Germany on February 26, financial sources said  Saturday [19 February].    Japanese officials want to confirm with their G-7  counterparts an earlier agreement that erratic movements in the  foreign exchange market are undesirable, and will request their  cooperation in intervening to prevent such moves, the sources  said.    The upcoming G-7 meeting brings together finance ministers  and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan and the United States.    The themes of the G-7 talks will be considered when deputy  finance ministers of these countries get together in Washington  on Sunday.    The sources said they expect the G-7 discussions to deal  with, among other things, aid to Russia and policies to  stabilize the currency market.    The Japanese currency rocketed upward against the U.S.  dollar in the wake of the failure last week between Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill  Clinton to reach an agreement on trade talks at their summit  meeting in Washington.    Speculation that the U.S. will strengthen upward pressure on  the yen, after what in effect was a breakdown of the bilateral  "framework" trade talks, spurred frantic buying of the yen in  the currency market.    Although the yen has given up some of its gains due to the  Bank of Japan's dollar-buying, yen-selling market interventions,  the threat of the Japanese currency jumping up again still  exists.    Japanese officials will likely tell the G-7 finance  ministers  that a higher yen has the danger of delaying recovery of Japan's  economy as it could offset the benefits of the government's  recently announced 15.25 trillion yen economic package, the  sources said.    The officials will probably assert that not only will a  strong yen put a brake on the Japanese economy and work against  efforts to reduce the country's trade surplus, but that it would  also run counter to the policy of the G-7 countries to strive  together for a global economic recovery, they said.    Japan's assertions may not be easily accepted, however, amid  the country's rift over trade talks with the U.S.    Although Europe supports Japan's stance of refusing U.S.  demands to set numerical targets to gauge the openness of  Japanese markets, the breakdown in trade talks has already put  the Japan-U.S. relationship in a hostile tone.    On aid to Russia, the G-7 countries will hear from Russian  officials the progress of economic reforms in that country, the  sources said. It will consider whether the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) can offer Russia the second part of their  financial package started in April last year.    In July 1993, Russia received 1.5 billion dollars of the 3  billion dollar package, but the remainder of the IMF aid has  been withheld since conditions such as improvement in the  Russian economic situation have not been met.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tchavdar Arnaoudov: "Claes Asks Sofia To Be </F> Patient -- He Promises Bilateral and Multilateral Aid From  Brussels in the Perspective of Integration"]    [Text] Sofia -- After nearly 10 years of dormant top level  diplomatic contacts between Belgium and Bulgaria, the two  countries have decided to reestablish good relations the roots  of which go back to the period of the liberation from the  Ottoman yoke in 1879. Willy Claes, on an official visit to that  country, encouraged his interlocutors to associate themselves  with Europe. On Tuesday evening [5 April] he directed the Sofia  Philharmonic Orchestra, which had included the Symphony in D  minor by Cesar Franck on the program.    During his visit, the Belgian foreign minister met President  Zhelev, Acting Prime Minister Matinchev, National Assembly  Chairman Yordanov, and his counterpart Stanislav Daskalov. The  declaration signed by the two foreign ministers after their  talks called for "stronger political dialogue, military (...)  and economic cooperation in a better atmosphere." During a news  conference, Claes dealt with the theme of the enlargement of the  European Union [EU] and the Bulgarian authorities' aspirations  to benefit from it. "You have signed an association agreement  with the EU which must be ratified by the member states, in  principle before the end of this year," he said. "This agreement  must be considered as the final step before membership. The EU  does not negotiate integration with other blocs but with  individual countries (...) and makes no distinction between the  countries of Central and East Europe. The process is being  delayed because the 12 member states are not ready to receive  candidate countries. Once agreement has been reached about  Europe's future, which is to lead to a political union and at  the same time to economic and monetary union, once effective  decisionmaking methods have been found, we will be ready to  discuss enlargement with the countries of Central Europe."    So, Claes made an appointment for after 1996. He thinks that  for the time being, no East European country is capable of  joining the EU. A double message filtered through his comments:  He recommended making maximum use of all the cooperation  formulas in the association agreements with the EU, rather than  bearing all the obligations linked to membership. At the same  time, he linked political and economic integration and military  integration.    The Belgian foreign minister also referred to the  difficulties Bulgaria experienced following the UN embargo  against Serbia and Montenegro. "Europe is providing indirect  compensation," he said. "Bulgaria has received some ECU240  million in aid for its balance of payments." In a few weeks new  aid measures should be taken, he added. But in his eyes, it was  of course more important to "obtain as quickly as possible a  peace agreement that could normalize economic cooperation in  this region."    Finally, Claes was very pleased about the success of his  visit. He said he was happy to have met "people who want to  realize a political democracy, but who still have important work  to do in the field of economic reforms." He expressed his  conviction that Belgium could help Bulgaria both from the  bilateral and multilateral point of view so that it could belong  to the "great European society based on the respect of human  rights and democracy."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of the </F> Serbian republic of Krajina, by Dragoslav Kosaric in Zagreb on  30 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Jarcevic] The essence of the agreement is a  cease-fire, the end of hostilities, and a guarantee by the  international community and the two superpowers that hostilities  will not break out again because the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] will step between the two armies in the so-called  buffer zone.    What is the most important thing that perhaps could not be  heard at the news conference is that the police of both sides  will enter these buffer zones, depending on the side to which  settlements belong. The territories held by one and the other  side remain completely intact.    [Kosaric] What about the deadline for the implementation of  this agreement?    [Jarcevic] The deadline for the realization of this  agreement is eight days, including the withdrawal of both sides  and the police remaining in the buffer zone.    [Kosaric] What about UNPROFOR, when will it be deployed?    [Jarcevic] UNPROFOR will be deployed within 10 days. It  will, for example, issue documents to the policemen who will be  in the buffer zone. In this way only those who will obtain  special UNPROFOR badges will be allowed to serve. UNPROFOR will  control both sides, and this is perhaps a novelty of this  agreement, as all earlier plans did not envisage control of the  arms of the Republic of Croatia. Now they will be controlled,  too, and positioned 20 km away from the border. In places where  the Croats do not have a border, like toward the Adriatic Sea,  they will be more tightly concentrated closer, but it will be  also allowed that, in the areas were there is no 20 km distance,  for example in eastern Slavonia, Srem, and Baranja, the Serbian  Army concentrates more tightly.    [Kosaric] This, therefore, means that heavy arms must be at  a distance of 20 km from the front.    [Jarcevic] Yes, with the exception of those emplaced for  which we have agreed that they will remain.    [Kosaric] Is there anything else that is specific in this  agreement?    [Jarcevic] There is nothing specific with the exception of  that we announced the talks about communications, the economy,  trade, and the normalization of all relations. Only after this  phase can we discuss issues of political weight.    [Kosaric] Is the date of this meeting already known?    [Jarcevic] Well, we said, in roughly two weeks.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Taiwan to Offer Aid: Taiwan is to emerge as a creditor nation this year, using  its economic muscle to win friends in the Third World and help ease its  diplomatic isolation.  </P> <P> The first payments from a $1-billion development aid fund will be made in the  first half of this year, Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said. He said  $100 million in low-interest loans would be made to Third World nations before  the end of June. The rest of the fund would be used within three years.  </P> <P> Panama, Costa Rica, Thailand and the Philippines have already applied for loans  totaling $50 million. Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Paraguay  and Guatemala are among a list of countries expected to follow suit, Wang said.  </P> <P> Taiwan has become increasingly isolated since it lost its seat in the United  Nations to Peking in 1971. Only 23 countries now recognize the island's  Nationalist government.  </P></p>

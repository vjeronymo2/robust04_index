			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Independent newspaper seeks funds NEWSPAPER Publishing plans to raise a significant amount of money to develop The Independent and Independent on Sunday to compete in the increasingly competitive national newspaper market. A range of financing options will be considered so that about Pounds 10m can be devoted to improving the titles. They include the use of internal resources, bank borrowing and raising capital from existing shareholders and potential investors. Newspaper Publishing confirmed last night that its two principal shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, have made it clear that they are willing to increase their stakes from their current level of more than 18 per cent each to about 25 per cent each, which would give them effective control. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder, expects no early bid for Newspaper Publishing but it is clear that a bid could easily be triggered under Stock Exchange rules if El Pais and La Repubblica increased their stakes and were seen to be acting in concert. Raising money to improve the titles is seen as a counter-attack by Mr Whittam Smith following the failure to buy The Observer. He is looking for a new trade investor - if one were found that would reduce the extent to which the stakes of El Pais and La Repubblica would increase.</p>

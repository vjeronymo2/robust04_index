			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> "Tom Cruise is alive and well and in Los Angeles -- and doing his regular  stuff, now that he's over the flu," declared his personal publicist on Friday.  Spokeswoman Andrea Jaffe went on to decry recent London newspaper reports that  said the actor had checked into a Paris hospital to undergo tests for AIDS and  other illnesses. "Those London papers started out by claiming Tom had a 'deadly  tropical disease' -- they put it in big headlines. Now it's come to this," said  Jaffe, adding that "Tom is really (angry) about all this and has been talking  with his lawyers." According to Jaffe, Cruise was in London to attend the  British premiere of "Rain Man" and to promote the film when he came down with  the flu. After six days in London, Cruise headed to Paris. When his temperature  reached "around 103 or 104," he decided to check into the American Hospital in  Paris. Said Jaffe: "He was there for several days and they ran a series of  tests -- which were all negative. They told him he just had a bad flu, they got  his temperature down and he came home." Cruise is currently in post-production  on the Oliver Stone-directed "Born on the Fourth of July" and is due to begin  his next film in May. ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow  </P></p>

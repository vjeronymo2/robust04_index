			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / German parties' bickering may stall Poland pact CONTINUED bickering between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat party and its sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), could delay the signing of an important friendship treaty between Germany and Poland. The conservative CSU's routine complaint about lack of influence in the Bonn coalition has reached a new pitch since the Christian Democrat defeat in the Rhineland-Palatinate state election. Despite Mr Kohl's initially disdainful response to CSU attacks, he has now decided to concede to the Bavarians a round of consultation on the Poland treaty, to take place today. The treaty, which was to be initialled today and is due to be signed formally on June 17, spells out the minority rights for ethnic Germans in Poland. Polish President Lech Walesa is expected to visit Germany after it is ratified. Although it has been welcomed by most German politicians, including many in the CSU, the treaty was negotiated almost single-handed by the Free Democrat foreign minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whom conservatives accuse of monopolising German foreign policy. This is particularly irritating for the CSU, which considers itself, along with conservative Christian Democrats, the champion of ethnic Germans throughout eastern Europe. At today's meeting the CSU is likely to call for closer monitoring of the treaty rights for ethnic Germans and clarification over the issue of dual citizenship. The centre-right coalition also faces a further dispute over the need to merge east Germany's liberal abortion laws with the more restrictive laws in west Germany. The Free Democrats support an extension to west Germany of the old east German law allowing abortion on demand in the first three months of pregnancy to be qualified only by compulsory counselling. This has been attacked by the CSU and many Christian Democrats as too liberal. Mr Heinrich Franke, president of Germany's Federal Labour Office, said yesterday that between 10,000 and 20,000 east Germans were still moving to west Germany every month.</p>

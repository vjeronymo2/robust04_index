			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese broker hit by one-off Y32bn loss Tokyo Securities, a medium-sized stockbroker, yesterday announced it had incurred an extraordinary loss of Y32bn (Dollars 326.4m) in unauthorised US bond and currency transactions by one of its senior traders. The company will report the loss across both halves of the current fiscal year which ends next March. The loss is almost as large as the brokerage's entire annual operating revenues, which will reach Y33bn for the current fiscal year. Last month, Tokyo Securities reported a first-half loss after tax of Y2.5bn, on very thin equity trading volumes. That figure will now be revised down to Y16.6bn. For the current full year, the company forecasts after-tax losses of Y32.5bn, compared with last month's forecast profit of Y1.1bn, and 1993's actual profit of Y1.3bn. Tokyo Securities said the trader, who was not named, had acted beyond his authority and taken significant positions in US bonds and currencies, and was personally responsible for the loss. It said he would be punished according to internal company rules. The brokerage had net assets in March this year of Y94bn, and shareholders' capital of Y86bn. It has branches in New York, Hong Kong, London and Zurich. More than a quarter of its shares are owned by companies linked with Nikko Securities, one of Japan's four largest brokerages.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] High-tech security electronic equipment, which will  be used for the first time in our country, will be installed in  Corfu for the EU [European Union] summit. This was agreed on by  Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis and his Israeli  counterpart, Moshe Shahal, during the Greek minister's visit to  Jerusalem. Correspondent's Kostas Tomaras has the following  report.    [Begin Tomaras recording] The beginning of a close  cooperation between Greek and Israeli authorities, especially on  the issue of combating terrorism, was marked by the visit of  Public Order Minister Papathemelis to Israel at the beginning of  this week. During a news conference held today, Papathemelis  announced that this cooperation will begin at the EU Summit in  Corfu, where a team of Israeli specialists will install special  equipment as part of the security measures. The equipment will  include cameras that take pictures at night and from a great  distance. The team of Israelis will arrive in our country next  week and will train Greek officials in the use of that  equipment, which afterwards will remain with the Greek police.  The public order minister said he was impressed with the modern  technical means that the Israelis have and which he did not even  see in the United States. The public order minister also let be  known that the Israelis have information on terrorism, mainly  due to the perfect organization of their police, and hopes that  the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement will result in  the transfer of that information to the Greek authorities. The  cooperation among the authorities of the two countries will be  extended to combating drugs and illegal immigration and the  exchange of information, mainly the supply of high technology  equipment necessary for the modernization of the Greek police.  Asked whether he discussed the issue noted in a recent report  by Italian newspaper CORRIERE DELLA SERA regarding the gathering  of terrorists in Iran, Papathemelis replied: I raised the issue  with persistence but the Israelis were not willing to tell me.  In another question on whether the Israelis have any  information about terrorism in Greece, the public order minister  said that only time will tell. However, he stressed that the  Israeli authorities have the capability to get such information  from sources to which we have no access. Finally, on his visit  to Israeli, the public order minister said that it was  considered a step that supports the peace efforts in the area  and that Israel looks forward to the role of Greece and Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou in that peace.

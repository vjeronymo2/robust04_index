			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tough times for government auctions - Capital &amp; Credit The recent bloodbath in world bond markets has scared away all but the boldest investors, and amid the ongoing 'buyers' strike' governments couldn't be blamed for worrying about who will buy their debt. In recent weeks, European markets slumped as fears of higher US interest rates spilled across the Atlantic. The European sell-off was exacerbated by aggressive speculators offloading large and highly leveraged long positions, creating a sense of panic that sent institutional investors running for cover. Last week, several institutions joined the sellers and opted to hold large cash positions until the storm had blown over. As a result, several recent government bond auctions have yielded dismal results. An auction of Italian five-year notes last week barely scraped through on a bid-to-cover ratio of just over one, with the Bank of Italy placing only L4,343bn of the planned L4,500bn. Spain effectively cancelled last Thursday's auction of three-, five- and 10-year bonds by rejecting all bids. In Japan, a recent auction of four-year bills flopped with a cover of only 1.06 times and a large tail (the difference between the average and the highest accepted yield) of 12.3 basis points; at the 10-year auction last week, only some 60 per cent of the targeted amount was sold, with the rest placed among the syndicate of underwriting banks. In Germany, the Treuhandanstalt's auction of 10-year bonds met with meagre bidding, leaving the Bundesbank a large amount of paper to sell through its market tending operations. Some say all this is just a temporary hiccup, and predict buyers will return once bonds recover on Europe's bond-friendly fundamentals of slow growth accompanied by low inflation. 'Right now there's still a lot of nervousness, but sooner or later investors will focus on the fundamentals and return,' predicts Mr Helmut Kaiser, senior economist at DB Research in Frankfurt. In the meantime, 'governments can wait this out without too much risk - their funding strategies have become quite flexible'. Moreover, he argues, real yields have risen to levels that should start attracting buyers. The German real 10-year yield has risen to 2.83 per cent from 1.82 per cent at the end of 1993; in the UK, it rose to around 4.64 per cent from around 4.18 per cent over the same period. 'The level of real yields is very silly,' says Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets. She expects domestic investors to be lured back by attractive yields, and also expects some of the funds which flowed into US assets in recent months to return as Europe's economies recover and their currencies strengthen. Meanwhile, many expect Europe to get out of the US interest rate cycle once its fundamentals reassert themselves. This decoupling, and the resulting turnround in bond market sentiment, could be spurred by more aggressive rate cuts from the Bundesbank, reminding investors that European short-term rates are still headed lower. Friday's market action sent encouraging signals, with European bonds outperforming US Treasuries after stronger-than-expected US jobs data. Additional help in funding budget deficits may come from higher-than-expected tax receipts as Europe's economies recover. Yet there are some who fear the end-of-cycle-blues may limit sustained investor demand for bonds. 'It will be much more difficult to place stock this year than it was last year,' says Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at IDEA. 'It's always easier to fund in a bull market than in a bear market.' While he expects bonds to recover in the near term, he says investor confidence will be slow to return after the recent rout. Moreover, as the end of the cycle looms, rallies will be increasingly short-lived as investors are quicker to seize opportunities for profit-taking, he says. This means that governments will have to gauge market conditions much more carefully when they plan to issue bonds. 'There will be windows of opportunity, but last year's flexibility is gone,' he says. 'We could get some very messy auctions.'</p>

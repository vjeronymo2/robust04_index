			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses tread warily ahead of FOMC meeting Europe saw some nervousness ahead of today's US meeting of the FOMC, which is expected to signal a further increase in US interest rates. Meanwhile, Lehman Brothers yesterday switched to an underweight position in Italy - previously overweight - in favour of the Netherlands. In explanation, Lehman's strategist Mr Joe Rooney, said the Italian market had discounted most of the economic and political changes. 'Italian equities have only traded at higher levels of valuation once in the past 36 years, and that was in 1986,' he wrote. 'The market is also vulnerable to a deterioration in the liquidity situation that has been so supportive over the past half year.' He said that the Netherlands, showed good value among European bourses, supported by forecasts of good earnings and dividend growth. FRANKFURT's rise to record levels - the DAX index closing at a new record high during the official session - was masked by low turnover. The index finished up 12.36 at 2,271.11. Turnover was a slim DM7.3bn. One of the exceptions to the day's positive tone was Lufthansa, which weakened DM5.50 to DM201.50, as the airline disappointed investors with news that shares issued in its rights issue would be priced at a 20 per cent discount to current prices. The group also forecast a return to profits in 1994. PARIS could find little to get excited about and the CAC-40 index moved ahead just 0.70 to 2,187.70 in thin turnover of FFr2bn. Baring Securities, noting that the CAC-40 has lost some 10 per cent since the start of the year, suggested that in the short-term further weakness could be expected. 'However, we take a more optimistic view for the medium term, on the basis of a stronger than expected economic recovery ..As a result, a fall to the 2,050-2,100 range will be a buy opportunity'. MILAN was under pressure from a combination of profit-taking after last week's firm performance, technical end of month trading and political worries ahead of tomorrow's vote of confidence in the Senate in which Mr Silvio Berlusconi's administration does not have an overall majority. The Comit index fell 19.12 or 2.4 per cent to 789.73. Blue chips, the best performers recently, lost some of their shine. Ferruzzi, launching a L1,340bn capital increase today fell L124 to L2,135, and Cir, raising L1,060bn, was L100 lower at L2,888. Montedison dropped L39 or 2.6 per cent to L1,487: early in the day, the European Commission expressed serious doubts about whether the plastics joint venture with Royal Dutch/Shell should go ahead. Fiat, the market bellwether, lost L188 to L7,039, with strong support seen at the L7,000 level. Italcementi lost L556 to L15,854 following the weekend announcement of a net loss of L126bn in 1993. Alitalia was L40, or 3.5 per cent, lower at L1,100 after the Transport Ministry's announcement that the airline must find some L1,500bn that it needs through a bond issue or an injection of private funds. ZURICH decided that recent losses had been overdone and the SMI index picked up 30.3 or 1.1 per cent to 2,709.0. The recently weak Roche certificates rebounded SFr185 to SFr6,650, while Nestle was marked SFr10 ahead at SFr1,115. UBS featured among a strong financial sector rising SFr21 to SFr1,135. Sandoz's bearer share gained SFr10 to SFr730 following the 5-for-1 stock split, as the company announced that it had reached agreement with the Scripps Research Institute of the US to exchange funding for research in return for the right to develop and market some of the institute's generally funded medical discoveries. BRUSSELS traded higher in moderate trade, benefiting from stronger bonds and hopes of further interest rate cuts. The Bel-20 index rose 4.35 to 1,537.80. Bekaert, the steel cord and wire maker, picked up BFr825 or 3 per cent to BFr28,475 on news that it had won a large contract to armour an offshore gas pipeline in Thailand. Union Miniere rose BFr65 or 2.5 per cent to BFr2,665 following the surge in zinc prices at the end of last week. STOCKHOLM continued higher amid further strong foreign demand for Ericsson and declining domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden index rose 9.6 to 1,544.8 in healthy turnover of SKr2.95bn. Ericsson continued the rally which began in the middle of last week, sparked by analysts' upgrades of company profit forecasts and recommendations following the group's first-quarter earnings report. The B shares closed SKr13 higher at SKr378. MADRID was lifted by some good first quarter results and the General index rose 5.17 to 334.20 in the most active trading seen in recent weeks, with volume of Pta42.5bn. Sevillana put on Pta17 to Pta704 after its announcement of a 17 per cent rise in first quarter profit while Telefonica added Pta25 to Pta1,845 in response to its first quarter figures. Union Y Fenix fell Pta215 or 11.3 per cent to Pta1,690 as it resumed trading after Friday's suspension pending publication of the latest valuation of the insurer which is merging with AGF Seguros.

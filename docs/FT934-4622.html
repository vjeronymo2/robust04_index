			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / People: Sir Bob Reid to chair London Electricity Sir Bob Reid, full-time chairman of British Rail since 1990, has been appointed a non-executive director of London Electricity, and is scheduled to take over as part-time chairman of the company on April 1, when the incumbent, John Wilson, retires. A BR spokesman said that the new appointment did not signify the likelihood of Sir Bob stepping down from his role at BR, where he is on a five-year contract. 'He anticipates that his post with London Electricity, even when he becomes chairman, will not take up more than two days a week.' Nor is there any indication that Sir Bob's current part-time BR job, which, in his words, was to 'make sure the trains run on time', will be scaled back, even though the Railways Bill, coincidentally coming into effect on April 1, will leave him without any train timetables to concentrate upon. Sir Bob has in the past clashed with government ministers over rail privatisation, and his role at BR has to some extent been undermined by the appointment of another former oil executive, Bob Horton, former chairman of BP, as head of Railtrack, the newly-formed body which will initially take charge of railway stations, though the two are understood to have cordial relations. From April 1, Sir Bob's role at BR, according to some commentators, will be merely to supervise the dismantling of the rail network as it is known today; though he gives every indication of seeing his BR contract through to what may ultimately be a rather bitter end. But Sir Bob is pleased to join London Electricity not least because its cash position is - unlike BR's - very healthy. Aged 59, he joined Shell UK in 1956 and spent more than 30 years there, eventually becoming chairman and chief executive in April 1985 until September 1990. He is also a director of the Bank of Scotland, and earlier this year was installed as the first chancellor of the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen.</p>

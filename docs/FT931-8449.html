			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Microchip breakthrough in Cambridge A UK-Japanese research team in Cambridge has made a breakthrough in semi-conductor technology which promises computer memories of vastly greater capacity than the microchips now available. The development is expected to open new frontiers for portable computers including the storage of sound and moving video images. Researchers from the Japanese company Hitachi Europe and Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory yesterday published their preliminary findings. A 'bit' of information - equivalent to a '1' or '0' in computer binary code - can now be stored by a single electron in a microchip. Today's memory chips take about 500,000 electrons to store one bit. A single-electron memory would consume much less power than conventional memory chips. The implications for personal computers, especially portable machines, are immense. One prospect is the first terabit (thousand billion bit) memory chip. This has not been possible until now because even the most advanced semiconductor memories consume about a tenth of a watt in power; a single thousand-billion-bit memory chip using this technology would run as hot as five two-bar electric fires. Using the new Cambridge technology, power consumption would be less than a tenth of a watt, making possible notebook computers with virtually unlimited storage capacity. Dr Kazuo Nakazato, Hitachi's senior researcher, explained that storing data which requires a tennis court's worth of microchips today, could be achieved in a single electron memory the size of a 50p piece. Professor Haroon Ahmed of the Cambridge microelectronics research centre said there were many problems to be solved before commercial single-electron memories would be feasible. The Cambridge experiments work only at temperatures close to absolute zero (minus 273 deg C) and the scientists are now attempting to develop chips which will operate at room temperature.</p>

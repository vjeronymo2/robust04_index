			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Big rise in French shareholders Privatisations have driven up the number of private shareholders in France by more than one quarter in the last two years, an official survey showed yesterday. The number of shareholders rose from 4.5m in 1992 to 5.7m in 1994, of which 4.6m held shares in at least one of three companies sold-off in the most recent wave of state privatisation, Banque Nationale de Paris, Rhone Poulenc and Elf. French privatisations have particularly appealed to the younger generation, and a less elite and male-dominated group, said the survey, which was sponsored by COB, the operator and regulator of the French stock market, and the Bank of France. The survey also found that while a quarter of shareholders come from the Paris region, nearly 18 per cent are from rural areas and more than 13 per cent are farmers.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Staff reject Waterford Crystal rationalisation WATERFORD CRYSTAL, the Irish crystal division of Waterford Wedgwood, suffered a new setback with the rejection by staff of its latest make-or-break rationalisation plan. The workforce at two of the company's three plants voted down the plan, which calls for 500 redundancies among 1,900 employees, across-the-board wage cuts, and an industrial peace agreement for five years. A secret ballot is scheduled for tomorrow at the third plant. The Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, called the cuts 'unbearable, inequitable and unacceptable'. The ATGWU has costed the cuts at IPounds 5.61m (Pounds 6.12m). When Mr Paddy Galvin, the division's chairman and chief executive, announced the rationalisation plan last August he warned that union rejection could mean the end of the company's Irish operations. In the past six years the crystal division has lost IPounds 66m, due to rising costs and declining markets exacerbated by recession in its principle markets - the US and UK. Rationalisation has resulted in 1,400 redundancies since 1987, while short-time working over the past 18 months has allowed further loss trimming. Results for the first half of 1992 showed an increase in losses to IPounds 3.2m despite a 16 per cent increase in sales. The company blamed 'unabsorbed overheads' from increased short-time working. The company said the dispute was likely to go back to the Labour Court if all three plants rejected the plan but it hoped talks would go on.</p>

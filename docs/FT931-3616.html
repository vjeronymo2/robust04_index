			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Observer: Exchanging bosses Not sure what it tells, but turnover in stock exchange bosses is starting to pick up again. Only a day after Peter Rawlins stepped down as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange last week, Rudiger von Rosen, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, announced he was quitting. Perhaps the leaders of the New York Stock Exchange and the Paris Bourse ought to inspect their employment contracts to see what they say about security of employment. The irony is that, while Rawlins left under a cloud, von Rosen leaves after a record of considerable achievement. He joined the Frankfurt stock exchange in 1986 from the Bundesbank where he had been head of communications for Karl Otto Pohl, then president of the German central bank. By most accounts, he did a good job persuading Germany's eight regional bourses to bury their age-old rivalries in the interests of creating a nationwide Deutsche Borse at the beginning of the year. But now he is being replaced by a former Swiss management consultant, Werner Seifert, 44, who is five years younger and works for Swiss Re in Zurich. He is said to be an ally of Deutsche Bank's securities chief, Rolf Breuer, who also doubles up as chairman of the Deutsche Borse. If von Rosen had a fault it seems to have been his independent streak of mind, which has irritated the big German banks. Only last week he said that his ambition was to see Frankfurt dislodging London as Europe's leading stock exchange, citing its technological edge. Breuer has the same objective but feels happier about having a less controversial figure in place. Perhaps London should follow suit when it comes to picking its next stock exchange chieftain?</p>

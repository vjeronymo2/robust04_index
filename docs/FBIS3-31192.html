Hungary has not made any  decision on recalling its diplomatic staff from Belgrade, he  said.    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has been formally informed  that some diplomatic missions in Belgrade have started  preparations for evacuation. Since Belgrade cannot be left by  air, Hungary offers itself as an obvious transit route for the  departing diplomats. On request, the Foreign Ministry will  render every possible assistance to them, Herman said.</p>

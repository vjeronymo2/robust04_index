The Sunkyong Group announced on Tuesday that chairman Choe's  planned visit to China from Feb. 24 to March 1 at the invitation  of a Chinese oil-refining organization had been put off until  the end of March because of problems with his itinerary.    The FKI has changed the dates for two leadership meetings on  selection of the main shareholder of the second mobile  telecommunications firm from Feb. 21 and 25 to Feb. 22 and 23,  due to chairman Choe's plans to visit China.    Business sources said Choe probably postponed his visit  because Pohang Iron and Steel Co. chairman Chong Myong-sik and  Kolon Group chairman Yi Tong-chan had failed to agree on who  should own the second cellular phone firm at a meeting on  Sunday. Chong and Yi are vying for the phone business.    Choe made his decision on Monday.</p>

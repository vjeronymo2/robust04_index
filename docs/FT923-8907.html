			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook EGM defeats rebel shareholder The extraordinary meeting of Etonbrook Properties yesterday defeated attempts by a rebel shareholder to change the board. However, the board's proposals to repay preference shares failed by 2.8 per cent to achieve the 75 per cent required. Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman of the former BES company which came to the market last year, said he would put the proposals to shareholders again. The restructuring would enable the company to make a 25p per share capital repayment and a 2.75p dividend. Mr Andrew Perloff, who through three companies and a personal stake controls 15 per cent of Etonbrook, had urged shareholders to vote against the capital restructuring and remove the chairman and Mr Keith Moss, managing director. He said information from the accounts showed that companies associated to its directors had taken Pounds 1.5m in fees since 1988, compared with payments to ordinary shareholders of Pounds 105,342 over the same period. The company argued that the fees were partly due to the ordinary running of the company, and partly a board incentive set up under the BES. Mr Perloff also failed to secure a seat on the board for himself and Mr Malcolm Bloch.</p>

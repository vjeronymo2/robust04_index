			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial conference of public security organs  on fighting corruption and promoting administrative honesty  ended on 16 April. The conference proposed efforts be made to  implement the principle of taking both radical and stopgap  measures to effect a comprehensive management of public  security, strengthen education on the purpose of the party, the  mass line, the legal system, and on preventing and fighting  corruption among the public security cadres and policemen, and  enable the broad masses of public security cadres and policemen  to ideologically build a strong defense line for resisting  corruption and guarding against evolution.    Since the promulgation of the decision of the party Central  Committee and the State Council on launching anticorruption  struggle last August, public security organs across the province  have solidly and effectively carried out their work and made  noticeable achievements. During this period, they investigated  and handled a total of 59 law-and discipline-breaking cases of  various descriptions, handled 71 persons in line with law as  well as party and administrative discipline, and initially  checked the random levy of fares, fees, and forced donations,  abolished 127 items on unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary  requisition of donations and exaction of fees from enterprises  and 370 items involving random levies from peasants. While  conducting cherish-the-people month activities, public security  organs at all levels have checked some unhealthy trends and  corrupt phenomena which the people showed strong reaction and  maintained closer ties between the party and cadres, between  cadres and the masses, and between the police and the people.    Addressing the conference, Sun Shuyi, member of the standing  committee of the provincial party committee and secretary of the  commission on politics and law of the provincial party  committee, pointed out: Public security organs have held  law-enforcing powers. The corrupt phenomena and unhealthy trends  emerged in the course of law enforcement are the major problems  reflected by the people. This year public security organs at all  levels should adopt effective measures to check the problems on  arbitrarily collecting fees, fines and forced donations, paying  attention to human relationship while handling cases and issuing  certificates or licenses, making things difficult for the  masses, and extorting money or articles from the people that  exist in some units in order to win trust from the people.  Regarding the cases on law and discipline violations involving  cadres and policemen, we should adopt a resolute attitude,  investigate the cases through to the end, and handle them with a  serious and conscientious attitude. It is necessary to further  establish and perfect laws and regulations and fundamentally  check the breeding and development of corrupt phenomena.</p>

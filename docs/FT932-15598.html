			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Anglo-Scottish water pipeline mooted SCOTTISH Enterprise, the development body in Scotland, may study the feasibility of building a privately funded pipeline to carry water from southern Scotland and northern England to the drought-prone south of England. The pipeline, which could take 12 years to construct and would involve a 140-mile tunnel through the Pennines, might cost Pounds 1.5bn. But with water a sensitive subject in Scotland - as the Scottish Office considers the possibility of privatising the country's water industry - the idea has already run into opposition. Scottish Enterprise may contribute Pounds 500,000 to a two-year study of the project. Consulting engineer Mott MacDonald is understood to be interested, as is Bank of America, which is involved in financing other UK infrastructure projects. The scheme would involve taking water from the rivers Nith, Dee and Annan in south-west Scotland, then gathering water from the rivers Eden and Esk in north-west England before going to the Kielder reservoir in Northumbria. The pipeline would then pass through a 140-mile tunnel to Carsington near Derby, where it would link with the water supply system for East Anglia and south-east England. In Scotland the pipeline could be extended to bring in water from the river Tay in the southern Highlands. The Scottish Office is still considering the future of Scottish water and sewerage, currently run by local authorities. Most observers believe that it is not feasible to create water companies and privatise them before the next election.</p>

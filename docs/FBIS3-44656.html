			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F> (6392 6647 1987)]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Addressing the national  conference on agriculture which opened today, Minister of  Agriculture Liu Jiang said that the objectives set for China's  agriculture and rural economy are to steadily increase peasants'  incomes and the effective supply of agricultural goods, and to  deepen rural reform; revitalize agricultural production through  science and technology; and continue to expedite agricultural  and economic development in rural areas through stabilizing the  party's policies for rural areas.    Those attending the conference are directors of departments  (or bureaus) in charge of agriculture, animal husbandry, aquatic  production, agricultural reclamation, township enterprises, and  farm machinery in all provinces, autonomous regions,  municipalities directly under the central government, and cities  authorized to have independent economic plans; as well as  representatives from various sectors. The meeting's main agenda  is to examine the current situation of agricultural production  and rural economy; study ways to implement the guidelines laid  down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, the central conference on rural affairs, and the  national economic conference; and draw up priorities of and  major measures for deepening rural reform and accelerating  agricultural and rural economic development in 1994 and beyond.    The specific targets that Liu Jiang put forward at the  meeting for agricultural production and rural economic projects  this year are: Grain output should exceed 450 million tonnes,  cotton output should reach 4.85 million tonnes, and the output  of oil-bearing crops should exceed 17 million tonnes; the output  of meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables, and  fruit should increase substantially; the gross agricultural  output should increase 4 percent; revenue from township  enterprises' sales and taxes on profits should increase 25 and  19 percent, respectively; and peasants' per capita net income  should increase 5 percent.    Liu Jiang stressed that this year the government will give  priority to these three projects, namely increasing peasants'  incomes, in reforming rural areas' economic structure, and in  promoting rural economic development. Liu Jiang said:  Increasing peasants' incomes constitutes the core of  agriculture and rural economic work today as well as for the  rest of the 1990's. The way to increase peasants' incomes is to  deepen reform and speed up development. While paying attention  to increasing peasants' incomes, we must continue to act firmly  to reduce their burdens and accelerate various developmental  projects meant to help the poor. To deepen the reform of the  rural economic structure, the government will give priority to  developing the market, improving the market system, providing  stronger guidance, support, protection, and regulation for  agriculture; and speeding up the development of economic  operating mechanisms and managerial systems in rural areas  compatible with the development of the socialist market economy.  To ensure their economic development, the rural areas must make  great efforts to develop efficient agriculture that produces  quality goods in large quantities, to increase the output of  nonstaple food, to extensively process agricultural goods and  diversify their use, and to help township enterprises develop in  a highly efficient [gao xiao 7559 2400], sustained, and healthy  manner.    Liu Jiang said that agricultural and rural economic  projects'  emphasis should be placed on the following three areas:    First, steadily increasing grain and cotton output. Liu  Jiang said: To ensure an adequate grain supply, we must  stabilize acreage, improve the production mix, improve quality,  and increase the unit yield this year. The sown acreage must be  at least 1.65 billion mu. Efforts should be made to readjust  the plan in various regions and the types of crops that they  grow so that there will be large acreage for rice, wheat, corn,  soybeans, and miscellaneous crops of good quality. Preferential  measures should be taken so that the principal grain-producing  regions can stabilize their grain production. As for cotton  production, we must be determined to reverse the unfavorable  trend, reinstate the former acreage, draw up rational plans, and  increase the unit yield so that the level of a normal year can  be maintained.    Second, we must make great efforts to develop the  production of nonstaple foods. As for animal husbandry, we must  stabilize pig production and increase the percentage of fowl as  well as the beef and mutton output among the total meat  production. As for fisheries, efforts should be made to develop  aquatic breeding and to increase the output of well-known,  special, and quality products as well as new products. The  comprehensive control of diseases of prawns and other aquatic  products must be properly organized. Efforts should be made to  control prawn disease as quickly as possible. As for vegetable  production, the size of acreage in the outskirts devoted to  vegetables must be maintained, a system for ensuring vegetable  acreage should be established, and efforts should be made so  that vegetable acreage will not be misused.    Third, great efforts must be made to develop township and  town enterprises. The development of these enterprises should  be directed at increasing economic returns; the development  should be compatible with the state's industrial policy; and the  relationships between growth and returns, between quantity and  quality, and between development and improvement must be  properly handled. Township and town enterprises in the east  should be restructured so that they can yield higher returns and  are export-oriented. Their industrial structure and product mix  must be readjusted so that their technology will be higher, the  quality of their goods will be better, their operating size will  be larger, and their returns will be higher. We must speed up  the development of township and town enterprises in central and  western China and speed up the formulation of the "Demonstrative  Projects on Cooperation Between Township and Town Enterprises in  Eastern and Western China." The first group of demonstrative  projects must be finalized early this year.</p>

Although commercialization of the space  development industry is actively pursued in the leading space  development nations, including the United States and some  European countries, the idea behind the survey is that it sees a  need for Japan to more aggressively study the policies on space  commercialization and the issue of how the space industries  should be developed from this point on, identify the obstacles  in the course of that, and then seek ways to overcome those  obstacles. MITI is said to have commissioned the Society of  Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) to investigate the  above-mentioned subjects and to produce a report by March 1995  based on the results of the investigation.    The market size of the Japanese space industry is only about  &yen;300 billion (FY92). Moreover, the bulk of the business  comes from government or public undertakings that are also much  smaller in scale than those in the leading space development  nations. Any space development project inherently involves a  gargantuan financial need, long lead time, and R&amp;D risks, so  that it is often beyond the capabilities of private firms; there  are a great many problems to be dealt with in the nurturing of  the space development industry.    In the spring of 1993, MITI established a private study  group  called Forum for the Institutionalization of Space Industry,  consisting of the selected members of industry, government, and  academic circles, to seek the proper direction to be taken in  nurturing and developing the space industry.    The reason MITI is starting a similar study for the space  industry commercialization at this time is that it sees a need  to respond to the shift occurring in the leading nations in  connection with the end of the Cold War away from the use of  space technology for national or defense interests to commercial  applications. Also, while the majority of the commercial space  business is already captured by overseas vendors, several  international competitions are expected to take place in the  coming years. MITI believes that Japan has to be prepared for  such a future.    The United States has already established a specific policy,  which is already in effect, for commercializations in five  designated areas -- namely, launch services, satellite  communications, satellite remote sensing, in-orbit materials  manufacturing and processes, and infrastructure for in-orbit  businesses. In Europe, various space industries have also been  established, and commercialization is under way in many fields,  led by launch services and remote sensing. Furthermore, as a  result of a severe need to earn hard currencies, Russia is  offering the service of conducting in-orbit experiments on the  Mir space station and Foton recovery capsule, while China has  established a commercialization office to promote its launch  services.    The above-mentioned survey on commercialization will  investigate and study such items as:    (1) trends in space commercialization policies, their  problems, and the industry's responses in each developed nation;    (2) how a commercialization policy is to be established and  how the industry should be structured in Japan -- specifically,  a policy transferring government-owned technologies to the  private sector, risk reduction measures to be taken by private  firms, determination of which space technologies should be  transferred, etc.;    (3) various tasks and problems that will be encountered in  the promotion of commercialization, and proper solutions to them.</p>

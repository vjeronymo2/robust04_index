			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE LINE IN THE SAND;  </P> <P> THE FATE OF KUWAIT AND BEYOND;  </P> <P> AROUND THE WORLD;  </P> <P> TESTING LIMITS OF NEW GLOBAL FEDERALISM;  </P> <P> IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA, THE U.S. AND SOVIET UNION ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER  TO SOLVE REGIONAL CONFLICTS. BUT THAT COOPERATION MAY LESSEN THEIR INFLUENCE ON  OTHER NATIONS.  </P> <P> As Iraqi troops rolled into Kuwait, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III were in Irkutsk,  enjoying a soft Siberian summer and a fishing holiday while they wrapped up yet  another session in their continuing efforts to negotiate an end to the Cold  War.  </P> <P> Downtown, on the streets of Irkutsk, the mood was not so relaxed. The city's  630,000 inhabitants, like those elsewhere in the Soviet Union, were desperate.  Earlier that week, riot police had been called to disperse a crowd of about  1,000 shoppers shoving to get into a store that had managed to come up with a  shipment of imported men's boots. Across Uritsky Street, Siberian consumers  participated in a kind of lottery in hopes of winning prized items such as  razors, cigarettes and toothpaste.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze were nearing the end of their talks when Lt. Gen. Howard  Graves, a representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was in the secretary  of state's delegation, informed Baker of the Iraqi invasion. Baker immediately  told Shevardnadze. The Soviet foreign minister was stunned. The previous day,  he had told the Americans he was convinced that Saddam Hussein would not invade  Kuwait. "This is what 40 years of our policies in the Middle East have come  to," Shevardnadze later would tell an aide.  </P> <P> It was too early to know exactly what was happening. Baker left the Soviet  Union for Mongolia, while Shevardnadze flew back to Moscow. Aboard  Shevardnadze's Aeroflot jet were two of Baker's top aides -- Dennis Ross,  director of policy planning, and State Department counselor Robert Zoellick.  They had intended to sit down with Soviet officials at a dacha outside Moscow  to work out the agenda their two governments should confront in the coming  year.  </P> <P> But as their plane soared across the Urals, talk turned quickly to the Iraqi  invasion. Ross' Soviet counterpart, Sergei Tarasenko, bitingly disparaged the  brutality of Saddam Hussein, a longtime Soviet ally. Ross and Tarasenko began  talking about the possibility of a joint U.S.-Soviet statement condemning the  invasion and embargoing arms sales to Iraq. In Moscow, Ross rushed to the  American Embassy and called Baker in Mongolia. The Soviets might agree to a  joint statement on Iraq, Ross said, if Baker would fly to Moscow and deliver it  alongside Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> Baker liked the idea. A joint statement would show the world that a new era had  arrived, one in which the two superpowers had a new relationship. Such a  statement would make it difficult for the other major nations of the world to  lag behind in condemning Iraq. And it would put the lie to any claim by Saddam  Hussein that he had international support for his invasion.  </P> <P> Still, ever-cautious, Baker instructed Ross: "Make sure the statement is a good  one."  </P> <P> The idea for a quiet weekend at a dacha was abandoned. Tarasenko invited Ross  to an office in an annex of the Soviet Foreign Ministry compound. He told Ross  they should get the latest news from Iraq. The American visitor thought his  Soviet colleague was about to pick up the phone and call some Mideast  specialist in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, or perhaps the KGB. Instead,  Tarasenko moved over to an office television and turned on CNN.  </P> <P> Tarasenko phoned Shevardnadze and got tentative approval for a joint  U.S.-Soviet statement on the invasion. Ross' aide, Andrew Carpendale, was  assigned to begin work on the drafting. All the typewriters in the Soviet  Foreign Ministry offices had the Cyrillic alphabet; finally, after a frantic  search, Soviet officials located an electric typewriter with the Latin  alphabet, and Carpendale went to work.  </P> <P> His draft included an explicit Soviet-U.S. condemnation of Iraq and a demand  that Hussein pull his troops out of Kuwait. But on Aug. 3, as Baker and his  party were already flying from Mongolia to Moscow, this draft came under  attack. Traditionalists in the Soviet Foreign Ministry thought that the  statement was too strong. The Soviet Union had not aligned itself with the  United States in the Mideast for decades. Wasn't this going too far?  </P> <P> The haggling and uncertainty among Soviet officials continued until just before  Baker landed. In the end, Tarasenko, Shevardnadze and, ultimately, Soviet  leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev won out. On Friday night, Aug. 3, soon after  Baker's Boeing 707 touched down at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport, the Soviet foreign  minister and the U.S. secretary of state appeared before television cameras to  read the prepared statement.  </P> <P> The two superpowers made clear that their efforts would extend beyond the mere  rhetoric of condemnation. "The United States and the Soviet Union believe the  international community must not only condemn this action," the two superpowers  said, "but also take practical steps in response to it."  </P> <P> The gulf crisis shows how the superpowers hope, in the future, to work together  to solve conflicts, and why the Soviet Union has become a staunch champion of a  stronger U.N. Security Council -- even one able to deploy multinational forces  against aggressors.  </P> <P> In seeking to restrain Iraq, the United States and the Soviet Union are working  together in an area of the world where Americans and Soviets have been at odds  for more than three decades, virtually since the beginning of the Cold War.  </P> <P> "A major event in the Near East is no longer a subject for confrontation  between the Soviet Union and the United States, whereas before now it had  always been a subject of confrontation," observes former French President  Valery Giscard d'Estaing. A senior Bush Administration official terms the gulf  crisis "the first major military operation or conflict which hasn't almost  immediately taken on East-West overtones."  </P> <P> But the crisis also has underscored one of the paradoxes inherent in what  President Bush and others call the "new world order:" As the two superpowers  cooperate, they may have less influence on the clients they subsidize and  support around the world. "The end of the fear of a global conflict may have  lifted a restraining force on regional disputes," says UC San Diego professor  Lawrence B. Krause.  </P> <P> At the same time, the crisis illustrates how a strengthened Security Council  could serve the interests of Soviet foreign policy.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union has learned firsthand the dangers of military overextension,  particularly because of serious economic crises at home and in Eastern Europe,"  wrote Thomas G. Weiss and Meryl A. Kessler in Foreign Policy magazine last  summer. "As a result, the Kremlin has become perhaps the most active and vocal  advocate for a more dynamic United Nations."  </P> <P> Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders have been motivated by more than a belief in  world federalism, Weiss and Kessler say. By relying on the United Nations, they  argue, "the Soviets are able to extricate themselves abroad and cut the costs  of military assistance elsewhere, while using multilateral diplomacy to prevent  the United States from taking advantage of this retreat."  </P> <P> A stronger United Nations, they conclude, could help give the Soviet Union "an  increased diplomatic role in Central America and the Middle East," two areas  from which the Soviets have long been excluded.  </P> <P> Throughout the gulf crisis, Soviet officials have been reluctant to authorize  the use of force by the U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf. When President  Bush met with Gorbachev in Paris early last week, the Soviet leader balked at  approving a United Nations resolution that would explicitly authorize military  action against Iraq.  </P> <P> Instead, Gorbachev said he felt the solution to the gulf crisis "must be  political."  </P> <P> The need for Mideast oil prompted both the quick American response and the  determined U.S. effort to enlist Soviet backing.  </P> <P> "While we are concerned about aggression or violation of the U.N. charter and  the rest of it, if it were only carrots or wheat that were being produced in  the Middle East, rather than the oil on which the world depends, I'm not sure  that our reaction would have been as immediate, " says James R. Schlesinger, a  former secretary of defense, energy secretary and CIA director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INSIDE CHINA  </P> <P> While Baker and Shevardnadze were reading their joint denunciation of the Iraqi  invasion, Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Richard H. Solomon sat  furtively with U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Jack F. Matlock in a small reception  room at Vnukovo Airport, hidden from the reporters in Baker's traveling party.  </P> <P> Solomon had been aboard the secretary of state's plane from Mongolia; now he  was waiting for a midnight flight that would carry him back across the Urals.  </P> <P> He was about to make a hurried, secretive visit to China.  </P> <P> Only a few minutes before Baker's plane landed in Moscow, the airborne  secretary of state had gotten a call from the White House, giving the  President's approval for Solomon's trip. Its principal aim was to ensure the  Chinese government's cooperation, or at least its tacit acquiescence, in the  diplomatic effort against Iraq.  </P> <P> China had an extremely active policy in the Mideast and had, in recent years,  been one of the most important arms suppliers to Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> More important, China was one of the five permanent members of the U.N.  Security Council, meaning that Beijing would have the power to veto any  resolution imposing an embargo or other collective international action against  Iraq.  </P> <P> International revulsion against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has marked a  significant turning point in China's campaign to restore ties with the West.  Although few could have predicted it, the invasion has offered a possibility  for China's gradual return to a modicum of global respectability.  </P> <P> Ever since its crushing of the democracy demonstrations at Tian An Men Square  in 1989, China had been treated virtually as an outcast.  </P> <P> Sending Solomon to Beijing itself marked a small step forward for the Bush  Administration. After two unsuccessful trips to Beijing by National Security  Adviser Brent Scowcroft the previous year, the Bush Administration had  maintained a ban on official contacts with Beijing at the level of assistant  secretary or higher. Nonetheless, Solomon was not part of the top inner circle  of the Administration's foreign policy team. And the United States kept his  contact with the Chinese government at a relatively low level, requesting a  meeting only with Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei.  </P> <P> In Beijing, following his all-night flight, Solomon rested and showered at the  residence of U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley. Then he went to see Li  Peng. Solomon pointed out that not only the United States and the Soviet Union,  but also other major countries, including Japan, already had condemned Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait. China should not be left out, he argued.  </P> <P> Over the next few days, China joined in the U.N. Security Council resolutions  condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and imposing international sanctions  against Iraq. In September, China also went along with the crucial Security  Council resolution that implicitly authorized the use of force on behalf of the  U.N. embargo.  </P> <P> Thus, China joined in the diplomatic effort. And its cooperation won results.  </P> <P> A few months after the Iraqi invasion, the European Community lifted some of  its economic sanctions against China. The World Bank prepared to clear the way  for some new loans to China. And Secretary of State Baker met twice this fall  with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen -- thus increasing significantly the  frequency of high-level talks between the United States and China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INSIDE JAPAN  </P> <P> If it weren't for the curtain of thick clouds, Japan's famed Mt. Fuji would  have formed a majestic backdrop to a very odd ceremony. On Sept. 8, in the town  of Gotemba, Japan's defense Establishment was celebrating the 40th anniversary  of the founding of its postwar military -- taking time off on a Saturday  morning for target practice with tanks, helicopters, 203-millimeter artillery  and Stinger missiles.  </P> <P> In any other nation, such troops would be called an army. In Japan, which has  the third-largest military budget in the world, they are labeled the  Self-Defense Forces (SDF), a name intended to underscore the passive nature of  their mission. But at these ceremonies in Gotemba, the Japanese troops were  flaunting their destructive abilities before an enthusiastic crowd of more than  20,000 civilian spectators.  </P> <P> The crowd cheered as formations of tanks roared across the foreground, swiveled  their turrets and blasted small targets stuck to the hills some 10 football  fields distant. A narrator with a loudspeaker described the hardware as it  rolled onto the field, and in the background a high-pitched voice screamed  commands to fire.  </P> <P> The shooting went on for nearly two hours. There was a short intermission so  the spectators could buy beer, box lunches and military souvenirs -- SDF key  chains, posters and tractor caps -- from stands behind the bleachers. Soldiers  in green fatigues milled about.  </P> <P> Sgt. Yuka Komiyama, 26, said she enlisted six years ago and wants to make a  career out of the military, even if she marries and rears children. She said it  never occurred to her that she might be sent overseas, but added that many of  her colleagues are disappointed that Japan had all but ruled out any form of  SDF deployment in the Persian Gulf until laws can be revised.  </P> <P> She was ambivalent about the idea herself.  </P> <P> "If I was ordered to go, I'd go. Maybe I should say I'd be glad to," she said.  "A lot of the others would like to go, but we're aware that there are voices in  the public that would be opposed."  </P> <P> The crisis in the Persian Gulf casts new doubt upon the seriousness of Japan's  professed aspirations to be a major power, to exert its own independent  influence in international affairs. And, more than ever, the crisis calls into  question the future stability of Japan's alliance with the United States.  </P> <P> In the process, it has exposed all the underlying contradictions of Japan's  role in the world and in its relations with the United States:  </P> <P> * Japan's economy, now the world's second-largest, obtains 70% of its oil from  the Persian Gulf, yet Japan long has relied on the United States to safeguard  such supplies.  </P> <P> * Japan's pacifist constitution, which says the Japanese people "forever  renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation," had been all but imposed upon  it by the United States. Yet now, 44 years later, the United States was asking  Japan to send its own military forces -- minesweepers, military transports, SDF  logistic personnel -- to help out in a possible war against Iraq.  </P> <P> * Recently, as Japan has grown into one of the wealthiest nations in the world,  the United States has encouraged Tokyo to develop its own, more assertive and  independent foreign policy. Yet in the gulf crisis, U.S. officials scathingly  criticized Japan for not following the American policy line.  </P> <P> During the 1980s, the United States and Japan worked in tandem. The United  States supplied troops, security and diplomatic leadership, while Japan  provided money. The aftermath of Saddam Hussein's invasion shows that in cases  where there is a potential for war and American casualties, the United States  will ask Japan to share a new, different, non-financial burden -- the burden of  risking the loss of life.  </P> <P> From the outset of the gulf crisis, Administration officials had made it plain  that cash would not be enough. The United States wanted Japanese personnel and  equipment -- personnel for support, logistics and other noncombat roles;  equipment to transport troops and supplies. Otherwise, U.S. officials said, the  American forces might be seen as mercenaries, defending Japanese interests in  exchange for payment.  </P> <P> "We're the ones whose asses are on the line, and they're getting 70% of their  oil from the area," said one State Department official.  </P> <P> But in Japan, there was intense resistance.  </P> <P> One nationwide poll by Tokyo Television indicated that 78% of the Japanese  public opposed sending any SDF forces to the Persian Gulf. Ultimately, none  were sent.  </P> <P> The dispute about the use of SDF personnel undermined Japan's position in  Washington. And Japan's standing with the Bush Administration was further  eroded by additional wrangling and delays about the amount of money Japan  should contribute.  </P> <P> When the Bush Administration first asked Tokyo for financial help toward the  effort against Iraq, Japan seemed to act as though it were in the midst of yet  another business negotiation. Tokyo made some initial low bids, tested the  reaction, then came up with a new, higher offer.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu initially offered $10 million toward the relief  effort in Jordan. A day later, Japanese officials volunteered $1 billion toward  the costs of the multinational forces in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Quickly, President Bush dispatched Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to  Japan to ask for more money. But Brady seemed to get nowhere. Kaifu made no  commitments or promises of any kind.  </P> <P> Finally, on Sept. 13, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution  demanding that Tokyo pay more money or risk a pullout of 5,000 U.S. troops a  year from the American bases in Japan.  </P> <P> A day later, Japan found more money. Kaifu's government offered another $1  billion for the multinational forces in the Mideast and $2 billion to help  countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. That brought Japan's total  financial contribution to $4 billion.  </P> <P> The White House said it was satisfied. Others were not. For the first time in  years, biting criticisms of Japan could be heard not only in Congress but also  in the State Department and the Pentagon.  </P> <P> If sufficiently irked by continuing American criticisms and pressure, Japan  could reduce its reliance on the United States and bolster its own independent  military power. Such a development would alarm Japan's neighbors in Asia,  including China, South Korea and the nations of Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INSIDE EUROPE  </P> <P> On Aug. 2, the day of Iraq's invasion, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  happened to be in Aspen, Colo., preparing to give a speech to the Aspen  Institute on the subject of "Shaping a New Global Community." President Bush,  too, flew to Colorado to address the symposium.  </P> <P> Inevitably, as the two leaders stood on the grassy lawn of a ranch owned by  U.S. Ambassador to Britain Henry Catto, reporters asked them about the  unfolding events in Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> Bush temporized. He listed the foreign leaders that he had telephoned. He said  he was "concerned about the situation" and was "hoping that a peaceful solution  will be found."  </P> <P> Thatcher was much more forceful. What Iraq had done, she said, was "totally  unacceptable -- and if it were allowed to endure, then there would be many  other small countries that could never feel safe."  </P> <P> To onlookers, it appeared as though Thatcher knew that the Iraqi invasion would  require a tough response, while Bush still wasn't sure.  </P> <P> Afterward, Bush would say he had been "comforted" by the fact that, in the  first days of the invasion, "the prime minister was there with me, answering  the tough questions and standing shoulder-to-shoulder."  </P> <P> Iraq's invasion has changed relations between the United States and Europe.  </P> <P> Throughout most of the Cold War, Europe had been the prime battleground, and  the United States and its Western European allies had worked primarily on joint  endeavors in Europe itself. Now, in this first post-Cold War crisis, the  battleground is outside Europe -- in the Middle East.  </P> <P> And what counts most is the extent to which Western European countries are  willing to support and join American military initiatives.  </P> <P> The Europeans have lined up alongside the Americans to an extent that would  have been unimaginable during the Vietnam War era. At the same time, the gulf  crisis has spurred efforts by the European powers to develop their own, united  foreign policy in the future.  </P> <P> Britain has led the way among the Europeans in supporting the American military  effort against Iraq, in effect reviving its old special relationship with the  United States. In the first weeks after the invasion, the British sent naval  and air units to the gulf, and by mid-September, it agreed to send ground  forces.  </P> <P> Such efforts put Britain once again in a leadership role within Europe.  Britain's old rival, Germany, had no desire or ability to play a leading role  in the European efforts in the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> No one in Europe wants to spur the remilitarization of Germany. And the Germans  can plausibly argue that they have been preoccupied, both emotionally and  financially, by the changes in Europe over the past year.  </P> <P> Germany -- which eventually donated $2 billion to the gulf effort -- has been  wrapped up in the very first stages of reunification. Moreover, earlier this  year, it pledged to contribute more than $10 billion to get Soviet troops out  of Germany and to build housing for them back home. And Germany has promised  other, smaller amounts to the new governments of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> In the year before the Iraqi invasion, Thatcher and other British officials had  looked on with dismay as the Bush Administration devoted ever-increasing  attention to Germany. The gulf crisis, a British diplomat recently observed,  "has given us a chance to be blue-eyed in Washington once again."  </P> <P> And support has come from other European nations, as well.  </P> <P> Last week, after a meeting with President Bush, French President Francois  Mitterrand announced that he would support a United Nations resolution that  explicitly authorizes the use of military force against Iraq, and he predicted  that such a resolution will be approved by the Security Council by  mid-December. Since August, France has contributed about 15,000 troops to the  Persian Gulf forces, including 5,500 in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> "In Europe, we've seen a level of support for the American activities in the  Mideast that is unprecedented. It's not just the British, but the French, the  Italians, the Dutch," says David P. Calleo, a specialist on Europe at the Johns  Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INSIDE THE THIRD WORLD  </P> <P> On Thursday, Aug. 16, two weeks after the Iraqi invasion, the lights in Ramna  Park in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, went off early in the evening. They  would do so for the foreseeable future. "It looks as though we are at war or in  some kind of emergency," said one unhappy stroller as he headed for the gates.  </P> <P> Hundreds of drivers lined up outside gas stations to fill their cars in advance  of a newly imposed nationwide ban on oil and gas sales each Friday, the Muslim  holiday. That Thursday night, and on succeeding nights, the shops in Dhaka and  other cities in Bangladesh closed their doors at 8.  </P> <P> Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammed Ershad had ordered these new austerity  measures to conserve energy. Ershad and his government were desperate, because  they knew that for countries like Bangladesh, the crisis in the Persian Gulf  was a crushing economic disaster.  </P> <P> Bangladesh had about 85,000 workers in Kuwait and Iraq, from among its 400,000  Bangladeshis employed throughout the Middle East. The earnings these Middle  East workers sent back home was Bangladesh's largest single source of foreign  exchange, about $477 million a year. Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait sent home  $89 million last year, and those in Iraq sent home another $9 million.  </P> <P> As if all of this were not enough, Iraq and Kuwait had served as one of the  principal markets for Bangladesh's two leading exports, jute and tea. Iraq  alone had bought a quarter of the 40,000 tons of tea auctioned in Bangladesh  each year.  </P> <P> Now, this valuable export income was gone. Even if the crisis were short, the  government estimated that Bangladesh would lose $17 million in sales to Iraq  and Kuwait.  </P> <P> The gulf crisis raised other costs as well -- higher rates for shipping and  insurance, loss of income from air flights to Kuwait and Iraq.  </P> <P> When the Bangladesh government added it all up, it figured that even a  short-term crisis, without a war, would cost Bangladesh from $1.5 billion to $2  billion.  </P> <P> The gulf crisis is proving once again the hard lesson that the Third World  learned during the oil crises of the 1970s: When the rich get a little poorer,  the poor get much poorer.  </P> <P> At times of world crisis, the most impoverished nations in the world find  themselves paying higher prices for oil. They are forced to move ever further  into the future their slim hopes for paying off their international debts.  </P> <P> Bangladesh cannot afford the luxurious, tree-lined surroundings of Washington's  Embassy Row. Its embassy in Washington is perched on the third floor of a  functional office and residential complex, just above the Gold Star Cleaners  and the A &amp; A Fine Wine &amp; Spirits. Inside, Ambassador A. H. S. Ataul  Karim and his staff of 15 spend their days trying to find the money and  resources to keep their homeland afloat.  </P> <P> Before the gulf crisis, Karim admits, he and other Bangladeshi officials had  hoped that the end of the Cold War would bring about a series of changes that  might benefit the poorest nations in the world. There might be some sort of  worldwide peace dividend, he thought. "If the world spent less on armaments,  there may be more for development."  </P> <P> In retrospect, that was only a fond hope.  </P> <P> Bangladesh had been working hard to promote an international meeting known as  the United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, the first session  of its kind in nearly a decade. Its purpose would be to draw attention to and,  perhaps, some new financial help for what are called the LDCs -- the least  developed countries in the world, those at the very bottom of the heap.  </P> <P> The U.N. conference began Sept. 3, just a month after the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait. And delegates from the LDCs quickly found that the gulf crisis had  wrecked whatever chance they had of getting more economic help.  </P> <P> A delegate from Saudi Arabia bluntly warned that there would be less Arab aid  available for the poorest nations. The Iraqi invasion had wiped out any  possibility of money from Kuwait, he noted, and Saudi Arabia would be required  to pay billions of dollars toward the cost of multinational troops in the gulf.  </P> <P> Richard McCormack, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, told the  conference that the United States would resist committing itself to a specific  target for aid to the poorest nations. The most important factor, McCormack  said, was not the level of aid but having "democratic, accountable governments  and market-based economies."  </P> <P> At midpoint in the conference, Iraq's Saddam Hussein publicly offered the  poorest nations free oil -- so long as they could collect it themselves.  </P> <P> Hussein apparently intended his offer as little more than a joke and a  political ploy. However, officials from the poorest nations, desperate for  cheap oil, took Hussein's offer literally -- and were outraged by it.  </P> <P> "How do you bring the oil back through a blockade?" asked Thomas Chery, Haiti's  delegate.  </P> <P> "Did Saddam Hussein not know before that we needed oil?" asked Botswana's  representative, F. G. Mogae.

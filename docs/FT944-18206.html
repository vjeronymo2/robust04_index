			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Yeltsin promises to speed up economic reforms President Boris Yeltsin yesterday committed his government to a faster pace of economic reform in Russia and to further measures, including tax changes, aimed at attracting foreign investment. Speaking to the press one year after he quelled an armed rebellion by members of the Supreme Soviet, Mr Yeltsin underlined that Russia now understood that success depended on its own resources. Nothing, he said, would deflect the government, from reform. The president: Promised there would be no changes in 'key' figures in the government, although he left the door open for members of opposition parties, including communists, to join the cabinet, and said there could be changes in his advisers. Declared himself against a postponement of presidential elections, although some of his closest allies have floated the idea in both parliamentary and presidential elections. Claimed the country was stable 'socially, politically and in inter-ethnic relations', and dismissed a presidential bid from Mr Alexander Rutskoi, former vice-president and a possible nationalist/communist opposition candidate. Said the economy had improved strongly since spring, with inflation down to 4 per cent, and savings on the rise. 'We will bring down inflation further. We want to reduce mass unemployment. We have decided to strengthen reforms, not to weaken them.' None of the relatively few, prepared questions drew from the president any concern about the rising inflation rate or the rapid fall of the rouble - which dropped a further 25 points yesterday to stand at 2,668 to the dollar. He stonewalled on a question on inter-enterprise debts, which run into many thousands of billions of roubles and loom as the largest domestic problem, and said nothing about Russia's call for extra loans from the International Monetary Fund. Included in the 40 draft laws Mr Yeltsin said he would put to parliament will be proposals to make investment easier and to lower taxes on investors. 'A favourable investment climate must be created for Russian and foreign businessmen,' he said. 'A modern investment infrastructure must be created. There is a need for tax reform, and tax legislation should be drawn up.' Mr Yeltsin said Russia was a 'great power' and that his recent trip to the US and the UK had established a recognition that it was not acting in a 'neo-imperialist manner' but that it had legitimate concerns about the civil rights of Russians living in the former Soviet states.</p>

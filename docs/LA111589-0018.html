			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO PROTESTS U.S. MILITARY ROLE IN BORDER FIGHT ON DRUGS  </P> <P> Mexico Tuesday protested a Bush Administration plan to use American troops and  warplanes against drug traffickers along the U.S.-Mexican border, complaining  that the move was made without Mexico's consent.  </P> <P> "The government of Mexico . . . neither shares nor supports (the) measures  announced by the U.S. Department of Defense with regard to the use of its armed  forces close to the common border," the Mexican Embassy said.  </P> <P> The statement said the Administration's decision "might have negative  consequences for the bilateral relationship," and added that it was unlikely to  make a major impact on the drug problem.  </P> <P> The Pentagon formally announced the establishment of the new anti-narcotics  task force, to be based at El Paso, Tex., on Monday.  </P> <P> The task force will provide military support -- from aerial reconnaissance to  ground radar surveillance -- to federal, state and local law enforcement  agencies struggling to stop smugglers who bring illegal drugs from Mexico into  the United States.  </P> <P> The State Department said Mexico was "consulted" on the decision, but a Mexican  official said: "We feel that we were not consulted, merely informed."  </P> <P> Historical experience has made Mexico sensitive to any American military  presence on its border.  </P> <P> However, a Mexican official said the issue would only be a temporary irritant  in the two nations' complex relationship. "We will get beyond this," he said.  "This is really not much more than a stone in our shoe."  </P> <P> Both the Pentagon and the State Department tried to play down the impact of the  move.  </P> <P> "U.S. military forces will not conduct searches, seizures or arrests, and they  will serve strictly to support law enforcement agencies in their  counter-narcotics operations," the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to militarize the border," a State Department official said.  "The reality is pretty tame. The military has a lot of logistical capabilities  that can support law enforcement efforts. We're just doing on land what the  Navy is already doing in the Caribbean. It's not as if we were going to use  Marines to shoot down aircraft or something."  </P></p>

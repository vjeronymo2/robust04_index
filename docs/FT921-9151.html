			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions face clash on recruits LEADERS OF the FDA Civil Service union decided yesterday to reject the advice of a Trades Union Congress disputes panel and accept health service managers into membership for the first time. The decision by the union's executive will cause friction with the Nalgo public service union, whose members include some of the 200-plus general managers who have applied for FDA membership. Nalgo had asked the TUC disputes panel to instruct the FDA not to recruit the managers, who are among a group of about 800. The panel last week refused Nalgo's request but advised the FDA against recruiting the managers, saying the introduction of another union into the health service would not be helpful. The dispute is politically sensitive because the government has said it plans to legislate to weaken the TUC's adjudication role in settling union membership disputes by giving individuals greater freedom to join the union of their choice. Ms Liz Symons, FDA general secretary, said yesterday that most of the health service managers who had applied for union membership were not in any union at all. 'They are attracted by our service for people on personal contracts. We believe they should have the opportunity to belong to a trade union. Most are not in one.' The FDA will, however, face strong opposition from Nalgo when it attempts to take into membership those people already in the public service union. Mr Keith Sonnet, Nalgo assistant general secretary, said his union would look at individual cases but 'we would not want to see our members join another union'. Under TUC rules the FDA would have to seek Nalgo's approval before recruiting its members. The disputes panel said that it saw no reason why Nalgo or any other unions should 'facilitate transfers at the insistence of the FDA'. Public rows about the transfers would inevitably attract the attention of Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, who argues that unions should not refuse membership to an individual because of objections from another union.</p>

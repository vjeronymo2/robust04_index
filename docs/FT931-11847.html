			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Give more, get more - Sponsorship The Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, designed to encourage new sponsors for the arts through government-financed matching grants, is to be revamped. From April 1 an arts organisation will be able to receive up to Pounds 50,000 a year (as against the current Pounds 25,000) in BSIS top-ups, and the maximum amount of matching cash for each individual first-time sponsorship has been raised from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 35,000. The government is funding the BSIS in 1993-94 with Pounds 4.5m (no increase on the current year), and the scheme continues to be administered by the Association for Business Sponsorship. In nine years it has generated Pounds 59m in 'new money' for the arts. The change will help organisations such as the Royal Academy, which is very dependent on sponsors and finds them easier to attract if their contribution can unlock extra money from the government. In future an arts organisation will be able to receive four BSIS awards a year rather than two. This makes things easier for small sponsors which were sometimes turned away by larger arts organisations concerned to secure two big BSIS awards. Applications for BSIS money provide a good indicator of enthusiasm among companies towards sponsorship of the arts. There has been an increase in BSIS awards in 1992-93 - but for smaller sums, confirming that it is small and medium-sized companies that are making good the shortfall in sponsorship caused by the withdrawal of some big corporations. Even so, there is still money left in this year's kitty, which should encourage a flow of last minute applications. Raising the size of the individual grants, while keeping the overall budget frozen, suggests that the government, and ABSA, does not expect a great rise in new arts sponsorships in 1993-94. BT is consolidating its position as the leading corporate sponsor of the arts in the UK. This year it will spend Pounds 1.7m of its charity and community budget on the arts, and last month it announced two new initiatives. Over the next three years it will invest Pounds 200,000 in 'Making More of Music', a partnership with the National Federation of Music Societies which will inject professional help, through workshops, training, and public performances, into the activities of the 1,300 amateur music societies that are members of the NFMS. BT already helps amateur dramatic societies through the BT Biennial, which creates a new play by a leading writer for performance in the amateur theatre. This grass roots work is in line with the new thinking. Even the Arts Council is starting to encourage popular participation in the arts. The other initiative is the BT curriculum hotline, a Pounds 20,000 venture with the English Shakespeare Company. With Shakespeare now written into the national curriculum some schools need help in understanding the Bard. A call to the hotline brings advice, and, in 250 cases, the arrival at the school of actors to devise a workshop. Obviously BT regards its arts sponsorship as enabling money as opposed to the concept of a company 'buying' an arts organisation or event for PR or hospitality purposes. BMW is another sponsor that is not cutting back. It has doubled its commitment for 1993, putting a six figure sum behind the Rouault exhibition which opens next month at the Royal Academy. It likes the fact that the pictures are displayed in the smartly modern Sackler Gallery. The late arrival of BMW has cheered up the RA, which a few months ago was short of sponsors for many of its 1993 shows. Harpers &amp; Queens is also coming in, contributing a barrage of coverage of the Rouault exhibition. Like many sponsors these days BMW is linking its support to a brand - the BMW 8 Series - rather than to the corporate name. This has one notable financial advantage: the brand can be designated a first-time sponsor and qualify for a full Pounds 25,000 top-up under the BSIS. Unfortunately the RA had already been helped with Pounds 15,000 this year from other sponsors through the BSIS, which meant that it could only receive another Pounds 10,000 before it reached its limit. Cleverly the RA has been able to receive the full Pounds 25,000 of BMW-linked money by directing the cash towards the RA Schools, which is designated as a separate arts organisation. Wise sponsors know how to work the scheme. For years arts organisations had been trying to interest Hanson, one of the UK's most profitable companies, in sponsorship, invariably with no success. So it was a shock when the National Youth Theatre announced that it was to receive Pounds 1m from the company, albeit spread over five years. There was no surprise how the NYT got the money: through the personal contact between its president, Bryan Forbes, and James Hanson. That is still the way that most arts sponsorships are sealed. What was surprising was that Hanson said its money must go towards operating costs rather than into productions. There was a veiled threat that the money was dependent on the NYT getting matching sponsorship support to underwrite its productions. It has made a good start. British Gas has promised Pounds 75,000 over three years to finance auditions and workshops, and impresario Cameron Mackintosh has given Pounds 25,000 towards a musical production. Price Waterhouse is sponsoring the London production at the Greenwich Theatre with Pounds 15,000, and smaller sums have come from Coca-Cola, the Woolwich and Reed International. However, the main event of the NYT's summer season, a rare performance of the Bernstein Mass, still needs more financial help before it can be confirmed. Foster's Lager is another first-time arts sponsor qualifying for Pounds 25,000 from the BSIS. Its initiation happened last night at an Australia Day Gala concert with Jose Carreras at the Royal Opera House. The evening cost it Pounds 100,000 but Foster's lager flowed for the first time at Covent Garden. Manchester Airport is proving a stalwart backer of the arts. It is putting Pounds 300,000 behind 'Manchester, City of Drama'. This Arts Council backed event does not happen until 1994 but the airport is announcing its commitment early pour encourager les autres.</p>

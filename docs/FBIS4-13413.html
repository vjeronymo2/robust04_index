			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  0705 GMT on 16 April carries a 17-minute recorded report  compiled by Hayim Hecht on the opposition's alternative to the  government's peace process in response to Minister Yosi Sarid's  charges in the Knesset earlier this week that the opposition  intimidates the people but offers no alternatives.    A series of questions was posed to Binyamin Netanyahu,  Zvulun  Hammer, Refa'el Eytan, Rehav'am Ze'evi, and Gonen Segev --  respectively the leaders of Likud, the NRP (National Religious  Party), Tzomet, Moledet, and YI'UD (Independent and Democratic  Israel).    Asked whether they would pursue the withdrawal from the Gaza  Strip if they came to power at this point in time, Netanyahu  says: "It is too early to tell. Obviously, agreements cannot be  honored by one side only, while the other side violates them.  The PLO has actually violated all the commitments it undertook.  Therefore, I will only be able to answer this question when I  assume the job of prime minister."    Hammer's reply: "It is not easy for a government to violate  agreements signed by previous governments, but it can halt  future moves."    Eytan's answer: "I would not pull out of the Gaza Strip and  I would not evacuate settlements. What I would do is give  municipal autonomy to the Palestinians where they live. I would  define the urban jurisdiction of Gaza, Rafah, Khan Yunus, and  other large cities and give them absolute autonomy there;  namely, to be in charge of internal security in the municipal  area."    Ze'evi notes that "the withdrawal from Gaza will lead to a  return to Gaza. Gaza cannot be sidestepped, because there is no  solution for Gaza other than to be annexed to Israel." He goes  on to say that "the only solution for Gaza, as well as for all  other parts of western Eretz Yisra'el, is to become parts of the  State of Israel without annexing its population."    In Segev's opinion, "the IDF's withdrawal must be completed  at this point, if only for one reason: that the Gaza Strip is  one of the few places on which there is enough consensus that it  must be evacuated. The settlement of Netzarim, however, is a  strategic point because the road leading to it separates Gaza  from the southern part of the Gaza Strip and it is very  important that we retain this area so as to keep this  separation."    To the question whether the agreement with the PLO would be  null and void, the Likud leader says: "I said a long time ago  that this agreement became null and void the moment the PLO  started to invalidate it; not because I do not like it -- which  I do not -- but because an agreement that is not binding on the  PLO is definitely not binding on us." Asked whether he thinks  the United States would put up with his reneging on the  agreement with the PLO and on the fact that the PLO would no  longer be a partner to the dialogue, the Likud leader says: "I  would not be withdrawing from any agreement. I am simply not  prepared to honor any agreement unilaterally."    Eytan replies: "I cannot abolish an international agreement  signed by the Israeli Government, but I can definitely reopen  it."    Asked whether 'Arafat and PLO-Tunis would continue to be  their partners in a dialogue, Netanyahu says: "Our partners  would be elected in real and democratic elections held under  meticulous supervision to make sure that people are elected  legally and rivals are not eliminated. Our partners would be  people elected from among the local Palestinian population, not  people imposed by Tunis."    Hammer says: "The dialogue with PLO-Tunis is the root of all  evil. The dialogue with the PLO is a mistake and, consequently,  the PLO would not be a partner." He goes on to say that  "although it would not be simple to renege on an international  agreement, Israel must definitely insist on its demands from the  other side."    Eytan replies: "No, there is nothing to talk about with the  PLO because the PLO is not a state."    Ze'evi retorts: "No way! They are not partners to peace  because they are not headed toward peace."    Segev says: "Being coy does not work any more. Those who  say that this process can be surgically terminated are either  being dishonest or are trying to make cheap marginal profits.  In fact, my plan provides for the application of Israeli  sovereignty on several areas in Judaea and Samaria. First of  all, Israeli sovereignty should have been applied at once on all  the Jewish settlements and the sparsely populated Arab areas  abutting the Green Line because there is no reason not to."    To the question whether IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops  would remain in Jabalyah, Netanyahu says: "I have never  objected to changing the IDF's deployment in Gaza, you never  heard me say such a thing. I believe we can change our  deployment and, in the case of Gaza, we can withdraw our troops  to some other place. However, we cannot have a situation  whereby our troops are not allowed to enter Gaza, as the  government agreed to."    Eytan says: "In my opinion, the IDF should keep out of the  refugee camps. If the local population wants to riot, let them  riot. However, if we get accurate intelligence about a  terrorist nest inside Jabalyah, we should stage an operation to  strike at this particular nest. The autonomy would run its own  affairs in Rafah, for example. It would need us for matters  outside the municipal boundary, such as transportation, jobs,  and water." Eytan goes on to say that he would discuss the  establishment of such a municipal autonomy with "the man or  council elected in Rafah," even if it is made up of Hamas  (Islamic Resistance Movement) members. "They may run Rafah  Hamas-style, but we would not allow terror to get out."    Asked how they envision the permanent agreement in Judaea  and Samaria, Netanyahu says: "The alternative in this case is  simple. We propose Arab autonomy -- of the Palestinian Arabs in  Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza -- under Israel's sovereignty. What  is the difference between the autonomy we propose and the  government's so-called autonomy? The IDF, and the IDF only --  not any army of terrorists -- would guard the borders. The IDF  would be exclusively responsible for security from the Jordan  River westward."    Hammer replies: "The Jewish settlements could remain where  they are, and the autonomy would be such that the Arabs would  rule themselves and we would not rule over another people. I  think this idea is feasible. Consequently, I think we should  create a layout of noncontiguous Arab autonomy and contiguous  blocs of Israeli settlements in whole districts so that they may  live safely and defend themselves." Asked whether he would  impose Israeli sovereignty over those blocs, the NRP leader  says: "I think the arrangement should be such that areas under  Israeli sovereignty would really be Israeli areas for all  intents and purposes, whereas the autonomy areas would be  autonomous areas." Asked how Hebron would fit in such an  arrangement, he says: "There must be a special arrangement in  places where Jews live so that they may live fully under Israeli  sovereignty."    Eytan notes that he would "definitely" consider applying  Israeli sovereignty over Hebron and other areas in Judaea and  Samaria "because such vagueness calls for international  intervention."    Ze'evi states: "In my opinion, the 1.5 million Palestinians  living in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza should go to the 21 Arab  countries whose general territory is 500 times that of Greater  Israel."    Asked how he would go about establishing the strong police  force stipulated in the Camp David accords, the Likud leader  says: "According to the Camp David accords, the strong police  force would not be equipped with machine guns, armored cars, and  helicopters -- incidentally, most police forces in the world do  not own such equipment, certainly not in such numbers -- and  would deal with civilian crimes and infractions. The accords  say nothing about making such a police force subordinate to some  kind of Palestinian government or creating what is for all  intents and purposes a terrorist army." Netanyahu goes on to  say that the police force he envisions, "would carry guns -- the  weapons ordinarily carried by policemen -- and would be  subordinate to Israel. What we are talking about is sovereign  Israeli rule up to the Jordan River, the IDF being exclusively  responsible for the area west of the Jordan River, and autonomy  for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; namely, a  framework in which they run most areas of their lives through  their elected representatives, but not areas over which the  sovereign ruler would be in charge." Asked at which point  Israeli sovereignty would be enforced on Judaea and Samaria,  Netanyahu replies: "That is open to negotiation in the  permanent arrangement period, which we probably would not get  around to discussing in this term in office." Who would you  negotiate with, Hecht asks him, and Netanyahu answers: "I would  negotiate with the aforementioned elected Palestinians, as well  as with other elements. I believe my proposal would enjoy much  larger support in the Arab world than is apparent. I think that  Jordan would favor the solution I am offering -- autonomy rather  than a state -- and that Syria would also follow suit." Do you  not think such a turnabout would lead to a prolonged standstill,  Hecht asks him, and the Likud leader replies: "People say to  me: Say the Syrians and the Jordanians accepted your proposal  -- I would like to add that the Saudis would also favor autonomy  over a Palestinian state, which would be emerging in the heart  of the Middle East and would also threaten them -- but would the  Palestinians? I say that the Arabs would accept the autonomy  arrangement if they realize Israel will not agree to give the  Palestinians an independent state."    Turning to the negotiations with Syria, Hecht asks whether  these would be based on the premise of a possible Israeli  withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Netanyahu replies: "I think  such a question is not at all on the agenda, because the current  promontory line is the line upon which Yitzhaq Rabin insisted in  the 1974 disengagement agreements, and for a good reason: it  provides us with a defensive wall." Asked what he would discuss  with the Syrians, he says: "I would tell Hafiz al-Asad the  following: There are issues we can agree and talk about, other  than the strategic buffer that keeps the peace for me and  prevents you from going to war with me. For example, I can  discuss with you Syria's foremost problem, that of water, which  is going to become a vital issue. I can talk to him about arms  control, stopping the arms race, and the security arrangements  we could make. I can talk to Syria about what it wants most:  to be struck off the list of terror-supporting countries."    Hammer says: "The situation calls for a courageous decision.  The question that everybody must put on the table is: Are you  prepared to step down from the Golan Heights in exchange for an  arrangement with the Syrians? I am not."    Eytan says he "would ask the Syrians: What would you give us  in exchange for peace? What price would you pay for the peace  we would be giving you?" He goes on to note that he would  "under no circumstances whatsoever discuss a withdrawal on the  Golan. If the Syrians want peace, let them give us another bit  of the Golan Heights or of the area under their control." Asked  whether he is aware of the fact that his positions actually mean  he would have nothing to discuss with the Syrians, Eytan says:  "Is our purpose to talk or is it to achieve something? Talking  is a means to achieve a purpose. The national purpose, as I  perceive it, is a Greater Israel with the Golan as an  inseparable part of it in order to safeguard our security."    Ze'evi sarcastically replies: "I do not want to demand from  the Syrians that they withdraw even more."    Segev's position: "As far as I am concerned, the Golan  Heights are taboo. However, seeing that the right wing agreed  to go to a referendum or to elections over this subject, it will  be up to the people to decide."    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 16 April  adds  that "opposition leaders have been discussing the establishment  of a shadow government. Hammer and Eytan say that it is  imperative that Rabin and his government be confronted by a  shadow government, whose ministers would comment on current  affairs and present an alternative policy to the public to  illustrate the option offered by the right-wing camp. Netanyahu  noted that the problem with establishing such a shadow  government is the surplus of good candidates for the job of  ministers, but he believes the proper formula will be found."</p>

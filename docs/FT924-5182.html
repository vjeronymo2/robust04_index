			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (17): Happy hunting grounds - Antiques / Apart from specialist dealers, the flea markets sell authentic, and lots of not-so-authentic, antiques every weekend WHENEVER the home of a prominent Parisian artist, or architect, is featured in a glossy interior design magazine, it is almost always crammed with the very chic antiques that the owner claims to have picked up for a pittance at the Marches aux Puces. The Puces are the flea markets that sell authentic, and not so authentic antiques every weekend on the fringes of central Paris. Like flea markets everywhere else they vary enormously in the quality - and price - of their wares. But the Puces are a Parisian institution. Anyone even remotely interested in antiques, and even serious collectors, scours them from time to time. The biggest and best known of the Puces is the flea market at Saint-Ouen, by Porte de Clignancourt, every Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Saint-Ouen, actually a combination of five different markets, is vast with different areas devoted to antique clothes, African art and furniture as well as a 'modern' section selling everything from t-shirts to mobile telephones. There is lots of junk on sale but it is worth seeking out the really good stalls, many of them owned by dealers with shops elsewhere in the city. Marche de Vanves, to the south of the centre, is smaller and quieter than Saint-Ouen. Its stalls, mainly selling small pieces of furniture and bric-a-brac, spill out on to the streets on Saturday and Sunday. There is also a section where artists sell their paintings, sculpture and jewellery. Vanves is just as crowded as Saint-Ouen and if you want to find a real bargain at either market you have to go early in the morning. And whenever you turn up you must be willing to haggle. Anyone who prefers to go antique searching in more serene surroundings should head for one of the Paris antiques centres. The best of all is undoubtedly Le Louvre des Antiquaires, a treasure trove for any antiques buff with 250 dealers filling three floors of the old Magasins du Louvre department store opposite the Louvre itself. Village Saint-Paul is a smaller, less grand antiques centre in the area between rue Saint-Paul and rue Charlemagne, just south of the Marais. If you want to browse, head also for Saint-Germain des Pres, where the tiny streets running down to the river between rue de Seine and rue du Bac are crammed with antique shops.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans,  has called on Asia Pacific region countries to put pressure on  North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program.    Speaking at the ninth Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference in  Sydney, Senator Evans said the situation in North Korea was  worrying, but not at crisis point. He said a nuclear-armed  North Korea would undermine confidence in the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security  threat to the region.    [Begin Evans recording] For the North Koreans, the choice is  really a pretty straightforward and simple one -- to remain in  the NPT and accept the disciplines of the treaty, including full  IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards, or,  alternatively, it can continue with its nuclear activities in  violation of its treaty obligations and face not only almost  universal international censure, but, in time, a package of  severe and damaging sanctions. [end recording]    The five-day Sydney conference will discuss the latest  developments in nuclear technology and the region's demand for  nuclear energy over the next 50 years.</p>

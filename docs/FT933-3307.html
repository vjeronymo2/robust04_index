			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (15): Taking the lead in Europe - Britain's engineering institutions / John Dunn on the advantages of selling to the profession in its international language FROM the outside, Britain's professional engineering institutions are not the obvious places to seek advice on how to compete in the bright new dawn of the single European market. Yet behind some of their fusty marble and stone facades, there throbs a commercial instinct as thrusting and as sharp as any multinational's. The truth is that many of Britain's engineering institutions have been doing good business in Europe for half a century or more. Some have sizeable numbers of members - and sales - in almost every corner of the globe. For a number of institutions, the advent of the single market has merely served to hasten existing ambitions to take the lead in Europe - and the world - in their discipline. The Institution of Electrical Engineers is perhaps the most internationally minded and commercially successful of all. Of its 132,000 members, 27,000 live overseas, with 3,000 in Europe. Worldwide sales of its books, journals, proceedings and on-line database top Pounds 15m a year. Commercially, it outsells its only real rival, the IEEE of America, which has over  1/4 m members and with which it collaborates closely. The institution organises the two-yearly International Broadcasting Convention, which attracts up to 3,000 delegates, and is the publisher of possibly the world's fastest reference journal, Electronic Letters. In June the IEE opened a regional centre in the Czech capital of Prague and announced plans for a further nine in the former eastern bloc over the coming year. It already has 10 regional centres in western Europe. Next month the IEE will inaugurate its first Chinese centre in Beijing. Dr John Williams, its secretary, says that over the next five years the IEE plans to play a leading role in the development of the electrical engineering societies of Europe. 'The aim is to give the best possible service throughout Europe and to be seen in Brussels as the first place to turn to for advice.' Electronic Letters is published every two weeks, and over 90 per cent of its content consists of overseas contributions. Submitted papers are in print within a record six weeks, says Dr Williams proudly. Later this year it goes on-line - 'It will be our first electronic journal.' Mr Gordon Rawlins, his deputy, believes the IEE 'has a duty' to take the lead in Europe. 'We are much stronger than other electrical engineering societies in Europe. Also, we have an international dimension that European societies don't have. But the idea is to lead, not dominate.' There are good reasons why Britain's engineering institutions should have such a strong international following, says Mr Peter Thomas, who heads the automotive division of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. 'For a start, English is the international language of science and engineering. Also, there is a lot of admiration for our learned society role. People like the fact that institutions such as the IMechE archive all their meetings and publish proceedings. They can always get back issues or copies of papers. Engineers are just like doctors and scientists - success is all about getting your work published]' The leading British institutions, such as the IEE, the IMechE and Institution of Chemical Engineers are much larger and have much more active memberships than their European counterparts. This stems from the unique role that British engineering institutions have as qualifying bodies. It is virtually obligatory to be a member of an institution in Britain in order to qualify as a professional engineer. In the rest of Europe no such restrictions apply. Nevertheless, the role of institutions as qualifying bodies is much in demand at the moment as former eastern bloc countries attempt to re-establish their own national engineering courses. The IEE, for instance, has been asked by the Hungarian government to set up a national electrical engineering accreditation scheme. In the early 1950s, the IChemE, helped along by Unilever and Anglo-Dutch Shell, provided a qualifying route for Dutch chemical engineers who took the IChemE exams. As a result, says Dr Trevor Evans, the secretary, the IChemE has a European branch in the Netherlands. It also accredits chemical engineering courses for the universities of Amsterdam and Keszprem in Hungary and Nancy, Toulouse and Compiegne in France. Those who pass are eligible for membership of the IChemE. At the moment, says Dr Williams, it is an open question whether the institution will expand into Europe by developing individual membership or whether globalisation of the institution is the way forward. 'We have a very high proportion of overseas membership - up to 35 per cent  - and we are seeing a number of other UK institutions gaining significant growth overseas as people prefer to join a single discipline society, especially since English is the lingua franca of engineering. 'We will gather more and more membership in Europe, that is clear. But eventually I believe that we will try to globalise through co-operation with other European chemical engineering societies.'</p>

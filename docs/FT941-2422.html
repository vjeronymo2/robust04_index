			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK mortgages Signs of a life in the UK housing market prompts the question of who will win the extra mortgage business. The banks' share of net new lending has grown to the point where last year it equalled that of building societies for the first time. Despite the jump of more than Pounds 1bn in new lending commitments by building societies in February, the market still looks tilted in favour of the banks. Not only are building societies constrained by limits on wholesale funding. Their regulator has also showed signs of restiveness about the amount of fixed-rate business they do. Taken too far, it could lead to a noticeable reduction in their overall margin without any compensating fall in risk. The trend could be distorted by the fact that Abbey National is likely to give up some of last year's abnormally high 18 per cent share of the new mortgage market. But it looks as though banks will again have a high share of what for them has turned out to be a particularly lucrative source of operating profit. Less certain is whether higher volume will be sufficient to preserve the juicy interest spreads of some 2.5 percentage points which banks have been earning on variable rate mortgages. Such spreads are already tempting back foreign banks and centralised lenders who fund entirely in the wholesale market. If the government's present review leads to building societies being allowed to raise more wholesale money, they too would be scrambling to win back some of the market share they have lost.</p>

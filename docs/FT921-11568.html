			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Resignations in Uruguay PRESIDENT Luis Lacalle of Uruguay has asked his cabinet to tender their resignations, a government statement said, Reuter reports from Montevideo. His conservative administration has been under increasing criticism from left-wing opponents and traditional allies, including factions of his own National (Blanco) Party. The statement said all cabinet members had offered to quit but would temporarily remain in office. An aide said the president would try for a new political pact with the liberal Colorado Party. Mr Lacalle took office in March 1990 with the support of most of the Colorados, but the coalition crumbled as his administration failed to beat triple-digit inflation and carry out planned privatisations.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Europe and Japan win Dollars 1.2bn steel deal from Norway Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday announced that it had placed steel orders worth NKr8bn (Dollars 1.2bn) with producers in Europe and Japan to be used in natural gas pipelines in the North Sea. The steel will be used in five pipeline projects, one of which is under way. These new pipelines will accommodate the country's rapidly expanding gas exports - deliveries to Europe will rise to 60bn cubic metres by the turn of the century from 28bn cubic metres in 1994. When the projects are completed Norway's pipeline network will span more than 5,500km. Statoil said the deal was one of the world's largest steel orders this decade and the biggest ever from the Norwegian offshore sector. The order comprises 1.5m tonnes of steel pipe to be supplied by producers in England, Italy, France, Germany and Japan between 1996 and 2000. European steel producers have won about NKr5bn worth of orders and Japanese producers an estimated NKr3bn worth. Mr John Ove Lindoe, a Statoil executive, said as few as seven steel producers in the world could meet the required specifications for the quality, 40-inch diameter pipe. The first consignment is for the Zeepipe II-B pipeline project comprising 210,000 tonnes of steel pipe worth NKr1bn for which the contracts have been placed with Mitsui/Sumitomo in Japan and Mannesmann Handel of Germany. The pipes will be produced by Nippon Steel, Sumitomo Metal and the Europipe group, made up of Usinor Sacilor of France and Mannesmann. Several other gas transport projects are planned, including a new line to Germany, another to Belgium or France and a possible link between the Halten Bank off the coast of Norway and the North Sea. Saga Petroleum said it has withdrawn from a multi-billion dollar project to build a new oil pipeline and terminal in the Russian Arctic, but Norsk Hydro said it had no plans to pull out. Saga has withdrawn from the so-called Northern Gates project until the Russian government offers stable conditions and sufficient legal protection to foreign investors. Royal/Dutch Shell group also announced its withdrawal from the project.</p>

[Tsygankov] What is your attitude toward the proposal by one  of the Russian Duma legislative factions about the political  unification of Belarus with Russia?    [Hryb] This issue was never discussed -- either at the  meeting of the prime ministers in Moscow or the  Interparliamentary Assembly in Saint Petersburg. We are  interested only in an economic union and a common ruble zone. I  can assure you that no official circles ever considered the  political union.    [Tsygankov] When will the Belarusian prime minister go to  Moscow?    [Hryb] As is known, both prime ministers are ill now. Once  they begin to recover, I think their meeting will actually take  place. I talked with Kebich -- the government heads are  planning to meet in early March. Viktor Chernomyrdin even  called off his foreign visits.</p>

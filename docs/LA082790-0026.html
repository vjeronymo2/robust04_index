			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> LEARNING MORE ABOUT HUMANS FROM SHARKS;  </P> <P> RESEARCH: THE CREATURES HAVE AN UNUSUAL RESISTANCE TO MANY HUMAN DISEASES,  INCLUDING CANCER. SCIENTISTS ARE SEEKING CLUES TO THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM.  </P> <P> Before dense jungles covered the land, long before the Earth's continents moved  apart, and millions of years before the first amphibians crawled out of the  sea, there were sharks. More than 400 million years ago, they were already  stalking prey in the Earth's warm, enormous primordial sea.  </P> <P> Sharks are among the most fabled and feared of the Earth's creatures, and the  subject of both popular lore and considerable misconception. They have survived  several mysterious mass extinctions of ocean life and have outlived most other  fish in the sea, except for a few ancient oddities, like hagfish and lampreys.  From an evolutionary viewpoint they are one of the most successful creatures  the world has ever seen.  </P> <P> Scientists have long regarded the shark as a living link to the marine origins  of vertebrates, and recent studies of the shark immune system have shown it to  be unlike that of any other animal. The discovery is considered a tantalizing  clue to the evolution and workings of the mammalian immune system, a better  understanding of which could ultimately benefit those working to combat various  immune-system disorders in humans.  </P> <P> But the work also promises insights into the evolutionary process in general  and a better explanation of why sharks seem to have unusual resistance to a  number of diseases, including cancer. This latter fact has been known for more  than 25 years and continues to be the subject of a few isolated, long-term  research efforts aimed at developing a treatment for human cancer.  </P> <P> The recent immune-system studies were done at several marine laboratories in  Florida and New York, where researchers are working with sharks, skates and  rays, all of which occupy the same taxonomic subclass, called elasmobranchs.  Compared to the immune systems of mammals and birds, which have received the  most scrutiny so far, the elasmobranch immune system appears primitive but  remarkably effective and highly adapted to its environment, according to  Michael Sigel, who did pioneering work on the shark immune system at the  University of Miami in the 1960s.  </P> <P> "Immunity seems to be much more effective in the shark than in man, horse or  other mammals," said Sigel, now chairman emeritus of the department of  microbiology and immunology at the University of South Carolina Medical School.  </P> <P> A properly working immune system keeps its host alive by combating disease and  infection. It does this by identifying antigens -- potentially harmful foreign  substances, mainly proteins -- in the body and mounting an attack against them.  </P> <P> In humans and other mammals, a two-part system has evolved. One part, called  the cell-mediated response, or T-cell immunity, eliminates cells with antigens  on their surfaces. A virus-infected cell, for example, has viral protein (a  form of antigen) on its surface, which initiates a cell-mediated response.  </P> <P> The other part of the immune system is the humoral antibody response, or B-cell  immunity, which deals directly with antigens by releasing antibodies into the  blood. These antibodies are other kinds of proteins that attach themselves to  the antigen, either destroying it directly or enabling other cells to destroy  it by ingestion. In humans, there are millions of possible antibodies, which  fall within five classes, known as immunoglobulins.  </P> <P> In the mid-1960s, Sigel found that sharks have a peculiar immunoglobulin  molecule called IgM that offers unusually versatile protection. Sigel later  found that a large amount of the IgM is always circulating in sharks and ready  to act. "It always seems ready to attack anything in sight," Sigel said. In  humans, on the other hand, the immune system is normally dormant, turning  itself "on" in response to antigens.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, in the IgM discovery, Sigel established an interesting link  between humans and sharks: human fetuses have mostly IgM immunoglobulin at  first, and begin producing the other forms later on. Sigel interprets this  coincidence as an example of "ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny," or the  development of an individual organism reflecting evolution itself.  </P> <P> Biologists believe that through evolution, the human immune system became  complex and extremely flexible in order to cope with the huge number of  different antigens that it must respond to. Every one of these antigens prompts  a different set of antibodies, so B-cell immunity depends on a fabulous  diversity of antibodies.  </P> <P> In virtually all animals, the very first wave of antibodies that responds to an  antigen is IgM. But during this first response, some antibodies undergo a  mutation that refines and improves the way they bind to that particular  antigen. The next time the immune system encounters the antigen, it mounts a  quicker and more effective attack based on a higher class of antibodies called  IgG or IgA.  </P> <P> But since sharks cannot make these higher antibodies, they never experience an  improved, or memorized, second immune response. Multiple exposures to the same  antigen merely produce essentially the same response over and over again.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, after the role of genetics in the mammalian immune system  was uncovered, Gary W. Litman and Kristin R. Hinds at the Sloan-Kettering  Institute for Cancer Research in Rye, N.Y., began exploring the antibody-gene  system of the horned shark, which is found mainly in the Pacific off Southern  California. The evolutionary line including sharks diverged from the line  extending to mammals as many as 450 million years ago, and Litman and Hinds  were looking for clues to the immune systems that existed at the time of that  divergence.  </P> <P> What they found exceeded expectations. "At every twist and turn of evolution,  we have documented evidence in this laboratory that there were sometimes major  differences in the way that antibody genes were organized and functioned," said  Litman, now at the University of South Florida, in a recent interview. "That  came very much to our surprise."  </P> <P> For example, sharks do not have nearly the variety of gene segments that humans  have, so their immune system is less flexible.  </P> <P> Litman says he and Hinds have found some evidence in sharks of antibody  mutation, but it is not at all like the mammalian process that lays the  foundation for a much-improved secondary response to an antigen.  </P> <P> To Litman, the shark immune system is evidence that "evolution doesn't always  work in a continuous way to improve. At some departure, a type or form may  appear that doesn't have to work anywhere else in evolution."  </P> <P> The shark's system, he notes, is less sophisticated than man's, "but perhaps it  leaves less to chance. Maybe it stayed less complicated because it doesn't need  capabilities like those of a higher, land-bound system."  </P> <P> Litman's theory is supported by past findings that the shark immune system  seems to do an extraordinary job of protecting against cancer and other  diseases.  </P> <P> More recent research in this area has focused on the ability of shark cartilage  to inhibit tumor growth. Tumors need a large blood supply to survive, and it  has been known for years that cartilage of all kinds -- whether from mammals or  fish -- has no blood vessels, and indeed contains substances that prevent the  formation of new blood vessels. For studies of this phenomenon, the shark is  the ideal laboratory animal: It is cartilaginous from head to tail, without a  bone in its body.  </P> <P> Carl A. Luer, a senior scientist at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Fla.,  has been working in this area since 1979. Having shown that a group of proteins  from shark cartilage does in fact inhibit blood-vessel growth, Luer is now  trying to isolate the specific proteins involved and compare their  effectiveness with proteins from mammalian cartilage.  </P> <P> In the last year, he narrowed the group of proteins from eight to three. His  long-term goal is to identify, in these proteins, one or more active molecules  that might lead to a tumor treatment lacking the harmful side effects of  current treatments like radiation.  </P> <P> In related experiments, Luer has been trying to induce tumors in hundreds of  clear-nose skates and nurse sharks (the only ones being kept as laboratory  animals in the United States, Luer says). He has tried two chemicals known to  cause cancer in human beings and other species. But he has not yet been able to  cause a tumor in either a skate or a shark.  </P> <P> This comes as no surprise to Churchill McKinney of the University of Miami  School of Medicine, another expert on shark immunity. "Whatever causes cancer  in human beings probably does not cause cancer in sharks," she said. Although  skeptical of claims of extraordinary immunity in sharks, McKinney hopes that  studies of the elasmobranch immune system may help researchers trying to  understand mammalian immune systems, particularly humans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Human Immunity  </P> <P> When the human immune system senses the arrival of microorganisms -- identified  by surface proteins called antigens -- it produces two types of white blood  cells, or lymphocytes. (1) T-cells orchestrate the immune response, releasing  chemical signals that activate the inflmmatory response. Some also become  killer cells that ingest and destroy the invaders. (2) B-cells secrete  antibodies that bind to the antigens and target them for destruction. (3)  "Memory" B-cells, sensitized to that invader, remain in the circulation to ward  off future attacks, making the patient imune.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shark Immunity  </P> <P> The shark's immune system works differently. It does not produce specific  antibodies against each intruder. Instead, an immunoglobulin molecule called  IgM constantly circulates in the shark's blood, binding to foreign antigens and  marking them for destruction. Because the shark does not make antibodies, they  do not become immune after an infection. Instead, the same immune response  begins afresh with each new infection.  </P></p>

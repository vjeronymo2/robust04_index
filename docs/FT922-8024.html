			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / People: Guru takes on global role David Fairbairn, one of the UK computer industry's small band of internationally known gurus, has been named a vice-president of Texas Instruments' information technology group, a role which gives him worldwide responsibility for some of the company's most innovative pieces of software. Fairbairn was managing director of JMA Information Engineering which became part of Texas Instruments last year. JMA develops software which helps in the writing of computer programs, and was started by James Martin, perhaps the best known of the UK's computer gurus. Fairbairn's background is unusually broad for a computer executive. It includes a spell in New York as marketing director of Guinness Overseas and a period as worldwide marketing director for EMI Medical, overseeing sales of the pioneering brain and body scanners. Immediately before JMA, he was director of the National Computing Centre, a Manchester-based organisation which aims to help companies make better use of their data processing facilities. He is a member of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, a member of the board of the Patent Office and president of the Institute of Data Processing Managers. ***** Tom Hansberger, chief executive of international fund managers Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger, has joined the board of Schroder Korea Fund. Templeton has a 11.5 per cent stake in Schroder Korea, one of a recent batch of closed end funds set up to exploit the liberalisation of the Korean stock market. Hansberger, 58, is chairman of the International Society of Investment Analysts; he sits on the board of the Bangkok and Asia Development Funds and is a member of the advisory board of the India Fund.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> If Steve Beuerlein was good enough to start seven games for the Raiders in  1989, why has he not been good enough to suit up for a game in 1990? . . .  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Raiders' record at Denver, where they play Sunday, is better  than you might think: 3-4. . . .  </P> <P> In San Francisco, people are saying the loss to the Rams was the best thing  that could have happened to the 49ers. Funny, but I thought an unbeaten season  would have been the best thing that could have happened. . . .  </P> <P> Most attractive quarterback matchup since Ty Detmer-Craig Erickson will be  Erickson-Dan McGwire Saturday when Miami plays San Diego State at Jack Murphy  Stadium. . . .  </P> <P> Kevin Rooney, who is training Vinny Pazienza for a shot at Loreto Garza's World  Boxing Assn. junior welterweight title Saturday in Sacramento, is writing his  autobiography. Most likely, Mike Tyson will get a mention or two. . . .  </P> <P> Tyson's current trainer, Richie Giachetti, isn't afraid to yell at the former  heavyweight champion, but is Mike listening? . . .  </P> <P> I don't know if he can beat Evander Holyfield, but George Foreman would have  knocked out Buster Douglas if he had gotten the opportunity Oct. 25. . . .  </P> <P> Foreman, Martina Navratilova and Orel Hershiser will be guests on KABC's  "Sportstalk" show, with Times columnist Mike Downey as host, today at 5 p.m. .  . .  </P> <P> Promoter Don Fraser's sixth season of boxing at the Irvine Marriott concludes  tonight when Ernie Chavez, managed by Jackie McCoy, fights Charles Young for  the vacant California welterweight championship. . . .  </P> <P> State championships used to be a big deal at the Olympic Auditorium and the  Hollywood Legion Stadium, and some of the best title bouts were fought by  middleweight Joltin' Johnny Smith, featherweight Fabela Chavez, heavyweight  Willie Bean, welterweight Charlie (Tombstone) Smith and lightweight George  Latka. . . .  </P> <P> Former junior lightweight champion Cornelius Boza-Edwards is doing an  outstanding job training 1988 Olympian Kelcie Banks. . . .  </P> <P> Recommended reading: "A Neutral Corner," a collection of boxing stories by the  late A.J. Liebling (North Point Press). . . .  </P> <P> Los Alamitos' Lloyd Arnold will ask for harness racing dates at Fairplex Park  during the California Horse Racing Board meeting Friday.  </P> <P> If he doesn't get them, the bottom could fall out of the industry in Southern  California. . . .  </P> <P> During 42 days of racing at Los Alamitos, only two standardbreds went lame. . .  .  </P> <P> Few athletes ever had worse luck on and off the slopes than Tamara McKinney,  who has retired from the U.S. Ski Team. . . .  </P> <P> It went sour quickly at Boston College for Jack Bicknell, who was fired after  once being mentioned as Gerry Faust's successor at Notre Dame. . . .  </P> <P> Most exciting televised sports event over the weekend could be the  U.S.-Australia Davis Cup final on ESPN. . . .  </P> <P> Sacramento, with 12 consecutive home losses, is closing in on Orlando's  hard-earned NBA record of 16. . . .  </P> <P> So much for those who thought Derrick Coleman would be another disappointing  draft pick by the New Jersey Nets. . . .  </P> <P> However, Syracuse may get improved results without Coleman and Stevie Thompson.  Something about chemistry. . . .  </P> <P> Arizona's inside game -- which includes Brian Williams, Sean Hooks and Ed  Stokes -- is being compared to Georgetown's. . . .  </P> <P> Most college basketball play-by-play announcers sound the same. . . .  </P> <P> Watch out for Alabama, whose freshman guard, James Robinson, outplayed Chris  Jackson in high school. . . .  </P> <P> Here's a score Jim Harrick would appreciate: Princeton 45, Lafayette 36. . . .  </P> <P> Oliver Chamberlain, a 6-foot-4 forward at Diamond Bar High School, is the  nephew of Wilt. . . .  </P> <P> The Edmonton Oilers have won five of seven games since the return of Mark  Messier. . . .  </P> <P> It's hard to believe that the Montreal Canadiens, the former Flying Frenchmen,  have a lousy power play. . . .  </P> <P> I guess it was only fitting that Wayne Gretzky got into a fight at Joe Louis  Arena. . . .  </P> <P> Needless to say, Von Hayes is being mentioned in Philadelphia Phillies' trade  talks. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Scioscia will play host to his 11th annual celebrity golf tournament, a  benefit for the Casa Colina wheelchair sports program, Monday at Industry  Hills. . . .  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson would be much better off playing in the American League, as a  designated hitter, than in the National. . . .  </P> <P> The Dodgers got $7,966.64 apiece for finishing second in the National League  West. Not too long ago, that was a World Series share. . .  </P> <P> Until the Lisa Olson incident, who had ever heard of Michael Timpson?  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Vauxhall falls 17% as continental exports suffer: GM arm still most profitable carmaker in UK Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, suffered a 17.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 185.1m (Pounds 223.7m), but remained the most profitable carmaker in Britain. Mr Charles Golden, chairman and managing director, said profits would recover this year helped by higher sales, increased productivity and further cost reductions. Profits were depressed last year by an 18.7 per cent decline in production of cars and car-derived vans to 245,313, the company said. Vehicle output fell after a steep decline in exports, which dropped 58 per cent to 46,964 because of weak demand for new cars in continental Europe. Vauxhall's two vehicle assembly plants at Luton, Bedfordshire, and at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, worked at only 78 per cent capacity last year compared with 96 per cent in 1992, said Mr Golden. Vauxhall captured a record 17.1 per cent share of the UK new car market last year, where it is in second place behind Ford, compared with 16.7 per cent in 1992. Its UK car sales jumped 14.2 per cent to 303,926 in an overall market that rose 11.6 per cent to 1.78m. Operating profits fell 23 per cent to Pounds 191.8m, while turnover rose 3.4 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn. Mr Golden said that the decline in exports - down by 66,000 vehicles - had reduced profits by Pounds 71m, while the cut in production had cost another Pounds 18m. The Luton plant was hit by short-time working and forced to halt production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra for nearly 13 weeks in 1993. These factors had been offset by cost-savings, which improved profitability by Pounds 36m, and by increased domestic sales which contributed an extra Pounds 10m. Mr Golden said Vauxhall had improved its productivity by 88 per cent in the past six years, from 24 to 45 cars per employee. The workforce was reduced by 6.7 per cent during the year to 10,222, and it had been cut to fewer than 10,000 by February this year. Vauxhall was planning to invest more than Pounds 100m to modernise and automate its Luton assembly plant in the next two years in preparation for the launch of the new generation Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra in late 1995. Mr Golden was cautious about the outlook for UK new car sales and forecast a rise of 6-7 per cent for the year to 1.9m. He said Vauxhall expected to increase its market share further, helped by the launch of the new Omega executive car, the Monterey four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle, and the Tigra small coupe in the autumn. The Avis Europe group of car rental companies, in which GM holds a 26.5 per cent interest through Vauxhall, made a net loss of Pounds 74.2m last year.</p>

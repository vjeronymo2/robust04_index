			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Upturn in van and truck sales signalled VAN AND TRUCK makers believe the most severe recession in the commercial vehicle market since the second world war may be over. Registrations rose 14.94 per cent last month on a year-on-year basis - the first monthly rise since January. The decline in new van and truck sales which began in 1989 has slowed since July, and the September figures indicate that a turning point has been reached. This is in spite of a continuing deterioration in the market for light vans and a strong performance in the heavy trucks sector caused by trucks being registered to beat the October 1 introduction of tougher exhaust emission standards. The 17,871 commercial vehicles registered in September compared with 15,549 in the same month last year. They lifted the total for the first three quarters of the year to 153,211 - still 2.82 per cent lower than the same period last year. The effect of the emissions deadline on trucks was dramatic - September's registrations rose 85 per cent to 5,059 compared with the same month a year ago. Heavy truck sales have been rising almost continuously since the beginning of this year and industry observers believe the market would still have risen without the deadline. Registrations of panel vans - the largest sector in the commercial vehicles market - rose 10.39 per cent in September to 7,537 on a year-on-year basis. Those of utility four-wheel-drive vehicles jumped 22.7 per cent, and buses and coaches rose 49 per cent. Light van registrations were 22.2 per cent lower at 3,719. The share of the market taken by imports continues to rise. They accounted for 43.82 per cent of the September market compared with 35.45 per cent a year ago, and for 41.13 per cent in the first three quarters compared with 35.82 per cent last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-SEPTEMBER 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Volume    Volume   Share (%)  Share (%)                                 (Units)   Change  Jan-Sep 93 Jan-Sep 92                                             (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                   153,211    -2.82    100.00    100.00 Imports                          63,017   +11.59     41.13     35.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                            44,942    -9.39    100.00    100.00 Imports                          16,387   +48.27     36.46     22.28 Ford                             19,841   -10.73     44.14     44.81 Vauxhall (GM)                    13,875   -12.47     30.88     31.96 Peugeot (incl.

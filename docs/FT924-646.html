			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Brussels gets a new team FOR ALL the problems dogging European integration, the European Commission seems to be attracting a higher profile category of job applicant. On the evidence of the new line-up unveiled yesterday, the Commission has shrugged off its image as a collection of government cast-offs. The fresh team in Brussels, containing two seasoned foreign ministers, from Portugal and the Netherlands, appears well suited to steering the Community through the next two years. At the helm remains Mr Jacques Delors, whose adept mind will be increasingly turning not only to the future shape of Europe, but also to his possible role as a candidate for the French presidency. The adjustments Mr Delors has produced in Commission portfolios bear the mark of a hand skilled in the art of both compromise and strategic planning. The departure of the UK's Sir Leon Brittan from the competition job - where he has habitually tangled with Paris  - will make the Commission's balance somewhat more favourable to French sensitivities. This is important not just for Mr Delors' prospects. French support for the free competition policies backed by Britain, and personified by Sir Leon, is still, at best, tenuous. The qualms voiced by France over the chances of a Gatt deal may presage further new year squalls between Brussels and Paris - especially if the March elections return a right-wing government. The French will still have to deal with Sir Leon, who takes over Commission responsibility for Gatt in his new external trade portfolio. But, in general, Mr Delors' decision to opt for a Commission in which French interests appear well served is intelligent as well as being predictable. The Commission has to give a lead. But it also must follow member governments' overall policies. The rearrangement of portfolios and personalities reflects the rebalancing of Community interests. Agriculture, social affairs and the environment - areas where deals have either already been done, or where economic downturn has made governments less eager for change - are taking a back seat. Mr Karel van Miert, who takes the competition job, has proved himself no pushover for the forces of corporatism during his time as transport commissioner. He will however act cautiously in curbing national monopoly powers in fields such as energy and postal services - excluded from the 1993 single market. The real heavyweight jobs are in foreign affairs. Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, and Sir Leon will jointly shoulder the challenges of enlargement talks with the states of the European Free Trade Association. They must also forge a strong relationship with the new US administration and ensure that the community does what it can to prevent chaos in the former Soviet bloc, which may yet provoke disruption in Europe on a wider scale. Apart from ending the recession, the EC's main priority next year must be to improve the management of its foreign relations. Given a degree of good fortune, the new Commission should be able to play its part in that task.</p>

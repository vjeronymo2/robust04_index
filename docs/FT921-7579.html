			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / 'Out-of-area' issue seen to threaten Nato NATO'S SURVIVAL may be at risk unless members are prepared to contemplate the use of forces outside allied territory, at least in defence of democracy in the countries of central and eastern Europe, a top alliance official warned yesterday. Mr Michael Legge, who was responsible for drawing up Nato's new strategic doctrine, approved by all 16 members at a summit in Rome in November, said he was disappointed at the lack of commitment on 'out-of-area' operations. Several European members were reluctant to see allied forces employed outside the Nato area 'in any circumstances'. But, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute in London yesterday, he called on allies to extend the boundaries of possible action 'at least throughout Europe'. Failure to do so, he said, would put Nato's credibility at risk in public opinion and undermine support for the alliance in the US. He emphasised that any actions would not necessarily have to be under a Nato flag. Mr Legge, a Briton, has been Nato's assistant secretary-general for defence planning and policy since 1988. He oversaw the work on redefining the alliance's purpose and military guidelines following its reassessment in 1990 of the threat from what was then the Warsaw Pact. The agreed text of the alliance's new Strategic Concept acknowledged the existence of 'risks of a wider nature' than direct threats to allies' own territory. But it made no provision for dealing with them beyond a passing reference to existing arrangements for consultation and co-ordination among allies.</p>

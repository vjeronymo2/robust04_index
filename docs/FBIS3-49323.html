Eight thousand civilians and 7,500 Croat  refugees are encircled in Busovaca. Our correspondent in Vitez  reports that fears are increasing of a tragedy on the scale of  Krizancevo Selo as the lives of 50-60 civilians from Buhine Kuce  are in danger.    We have just received a report from the Vitez operational  zone command that troops of the British UN battalion are  patrolling the Vitez-Busovaca road, extending their protection  to civilians fleeing from Buhine Kuce and transporting them to  Vitez. Six people have been taken care of so far, and a British  liaison officer said that members of their tank units, located  by the road, saw the bodies of two civilians.    By 0800, three people were killed and 15 injured in the  ongoing artillery attack on the center of Vitez. The HVO's  [Croatian Defense Council] 111th Zepce Brigade reported that  Muslims were also launching artillery attacks on Zepce and that  many have been wounded there as well.    According to the latest information, Muslims are attacking  the Kuber area near Vitez from the direction of Zenica, while  the HVO reports that the Muslim breakthrough in the Buhine Kuce  area has been halted.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Council tax bills depend on local spending curbs THE GOVERNMENT'S ability to keep the average council tax bill in England down to Pounds 500, the target announced yesterday, will depend critically on ministers keeping firm control over local spending. To that end, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has notably tightened the rules allowing him to cap local council spending. But their effectiveness will depend on the success of councils in keeping their pay settlements for next year within the government's target range of 0 per cent to 1.5 per cent for the public sector. Applying the government's multiplier to the eight council tax bands, which divide properties by their value in April 1991, gives the average bills in the table, provided councils spend at or below government targets. The government believes that the great majority of councils, if they keep the lid on pay, should have no difficulty in keeping within its estimates of spending needs ('standard spending assessments'). SSAs have been increased by an average of 3.1 per cent on last year's, allowing for the transfer of responsibilities to and from local government. Its rate support grant funding for councils is to increase by 3.7 per cent. However, the local government associations claim that the government's Pounds 41.17bn target for total spending in 1993-94 represents only a 0.4 per cent increase on what councils are actually spending this year. They also point to the fact that pay settlements for part of next year are already agreed at above 3.7 per cent, a funding increase which in any case includes money (like that to cushion the council tax) that cannot be applied to existing services. Most councils are now spending at or above SSA, which is also used as the basis for capping. Of England's 39 county councils, only five are this year spending more than 1 per cent below SSA, while two are more than 1 per cent above. Barely one or two are expected to budget significantly below SSA next year. Much therefore will depend on the ruthlessness with which the government applies its capping rules for next year. The capping rules are more generous than those announced for Scottish authorities earlier in the month, but will still cause severe problems for the large inner-city authorities spending well above SSA. Under the rules, authorities planning to spend less than 1 per cent above SSA will be restricted to a 2.5 per cent increase in total spending. That will have the effect of capping most county councils to a spending increase of about 3 per cent. However, authorities already more than 1 per cent above SSA - including most cities - will be capped at much smaller increases. Those planning to spend more than 10 per cent above will be capped at a 0.5 per cent increase on this year's bud-get. Mr Howard claimed that councils need not raise any more from council tax payers than they are taking from poll tax payers. Most analysts believe the skills of a magician will be needed to achieve that.</p>

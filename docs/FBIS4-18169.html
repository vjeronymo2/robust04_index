			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement after meeting Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou, Romanian President Ion Iliescu supported the Greek  positions on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM].  Iliescu noted that the Greek position on FYROM appears to be  correct, adding that his country is not against the existence of  FYROM. He said he hopes Greek-FYROM differences will be  overcome through a dialogue. Iliescu added that no Balkan  country--including Turkey of course--should participate in the  UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia.    The Greek prime minister and the Romanian president  described  bilateral relations as warm and constructive and stressed the  two countries' willingness to strengthen relations in the  political, economic, and social spheres.    Papandreou referred to the ancient ties of friendship that  link the two countries and added that Greece will do everything  it can to help Romania in approaches to the European Union.    Iliescu and Papandreou also discussed developments in Europe  and the problems in the Balkans. Earlier today Iliescu met  President Konstandinos Karamanlis and discussed the latest  developments in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

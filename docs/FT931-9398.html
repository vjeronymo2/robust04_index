			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Rothschild wins Lottery - Off the Wall THIS HAS been a bad week for Jocelyn Stevens, the rumbustious boss at English Heritage, who has had years of experience at rough riding over opponents. In an unexpected show of muscle his London Advisory Committee, headed by Sir Hugh Cubbitt, squashed Stevens plan to hand over control of Grade Two listed buildings in the capital to the reluctant boroughs, most of whom have neither the money nor the knowledge to replace the respected English Heritage team of experts. Now I can reveal that he has failed to get his hands on that slice of the Lottery money which is to be allocated to shoring up the heritage. Instead the National Heritage Fund, headed by Lord Rothschild, will play the good fairy. The sum involved is reputed to be Pounds 70m a year. (This means the Government anticipates that the revenue from the Lottery, after prizes, tax, and expenses, will be Pounds 350m a year, to be split five ways between heritage, arts, sport, the Millennium Fund, and charities). Perhaps the choice of the NHF was signalled last November when the Heritage Secretary, Peter Brook, announced that its grant, currently Pounds 12m a year, was to be reduced over the next two financial years. He knew it will have its hands full allocating the much larger sum. The National Heritage Fund must somehow distinguish between its two pots of gold. Probably the Lottery money will be earmarked for a dozen or so major good causes in the heritage involving capital projects. It might be good politics for the NHF to hand some over to English Heritage which needs a multi million pound donation to realise its ambitious plans to improve its most public responsibility, Stonehenge. The Royal Albert Hall is on the move: literally. For the first time in its 120 year history it is empire building. The object of its expansion is the South Steps, the rather grand staircase that leads from Prince Consort Road towards the back of the Hall. In themselves the steps are purely a thoroughfare but underneath are wide open spaces currently used to garage cars. If the Albert Hall can acquire the site it can use the space to transform its back stage facilities, allowing better access for stage crews, more storage space, plus dressing rooms and bars. Fortunately the Hall can offer a fair price. Since the arrival of chief executive Patrick Deuchar it has gone on a marketing offensive. It no longer waits for the phone calls from deluded divas, desperate to fritter away a lifetime's savings on hiring the Hall, but sells its attractions world wide to star names. Hence the importance of the Bolshoy season which ends tomorrow. It has played to 80 per cent capacity and proved to the world that the Albert Hall can successfully handle long seasons by the biggest companies. Among the stars set to perform in the Hall for the first time is that indubitably big name, Victoria Wood. But there is one odd consequence of this new success. The Albert Hall is a charity. Its 300 debenture holders cannot receive a dividend. Instead any surplus goes back into making the Hall more comfortable. In 1987 just Pounds 392,000 was spent on improvements: this year Deuchar hopes to invest Pounds 1.78m. At this rate will we will all be sitting on Louis XV chairs and eating lobster from silver salvers by the time the Bolshoy comes back for another dollop of hard currency. The Treasury seems to think that it can solve the nation's financial problems by selling off its art. It has made a grab for the government collection - and been firmly rebuffed by the Department of Heritage - and is now sniffing around the British Rail Pension Fund's collection of art. Its enthusiasm for the government's pictures is bizarre. These are the works of art that decorate government ministries and offices and our embassies abroad. Many of the 16,000 works are rubbish. The valuable works are creamed off by cabinet ministers, from the PM down, and by the top embassies. They would hardly be happy to lose this perk of office. The most interesting part of the collection is the contemporary British art acquired by curator Wendy Barron with a tiny budget of around Pounds 100,000 a year. Much of it is of high quality, but only of interest to British collectors and would fetch little on the market. Disposing of the government collection would be a philistine act, causing a tremendous commotion, and very counter productive. In contrast the British Rail art is among the best in the world. It was acquired by its Pension Fund in the early 1970s when the return from traditional forms of investment looked bleak. The Pounds 40m allocated has proved that rarest of rare things, a good investment in art. Two-thirds of the 2,200 objects acquired have already been sold, including the Impressionists, silver, Japanese prints and Old Master drawings, and they produced a reasonable return of 6 per cent a year after inflation. The Fund still holds its best Old Masters, antiquities, and medieval works of art, including Van Dyck's wonderful portrait of the daughters of Charles I, as well as works by Goya and Tiepolo. But there are still many legal obstacles to be overcome before the Treasury gets its hands on these marvels. It looks as if the British Commonwealth Library has been saved for the nation. An appeal, organised by Sir Patrick Sheehy of BATS, has raised Pounds 2.4m of the Pounds 3m needed, thanks to generous donations from Peter Moores, Garfield Weston, and others. Cambridge University Library has offered a home for the books, and the National Heritage Fund, which was originally asked to stump up the whole Pounds 3m, may now well make a donation to help complete the appeal. This is sad news for Sotheby's which already has in its vaults the Cyprus collection from the Library, the best in the world, and valued at Pounds 500,000. One tiny heave and the books will be on their way to Cambridge.</p>

Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CLAPTON TO TOUR 27 U.S. CITIES  </P> <P> Guitar virtuoso Eric Clapton is planning a six-week U.S. tour that will take  the British rocker to 27 cities in the spring.  </P> <P> It will be Clapton's first U.S. tour since 1987, although he appeared with the  Rolling Stones several times during their just-completed "Steel Wheels" tour.  </P> <P> Clapton's smashing groups of the 1960s and early '70s included Cream, Blind  Faith and Derek and the Dominoes. Unlike other mega-stars on the road in the  last year, he will not have a corporate sponsor for his tour, publicist Mitch  Zamarin said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The tour is to open in Atlanta on March 28, then head up the Eastern Seaboard  before moving west and ending May 5 in San Francisco.  </P></p>

			<p>Aluminum-Based   Quasicrystalline Metals and  CMolecular Solids  [.sub]60[/]  <F P=102> 43070061C Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 28--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061C </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Kaoru Kimura, Department of </F> Materials Science, University of Tokyo]    [Text] Boron-rich semiconductors have unique three centered  covalent bonds and eight kinds of crystalline structures with  icosahedral clusters (B[.sub]12[/]). Though other seven  elemental semiconductors, e.g., Si, P, Se, have rather simple  bonding nature, i.e., sp[.sup]3[/], p[.sup]3[/],  p[.sup]2[/], only boron has such complicated bonds. Aluminum  is an element which belongs to the same third group as boron and  has the same icosahedral cluster (Al[.sub]12[/]) in metallic  quasicrystalline alloys. On the other hand, C[.sub]60[/]  molecular solid is also an elemental semiconductor which has  almost sp[.sup]2[/] bond and C[.sub]60[/] cluster has an  icosahedral symmetry. Bonding nature between C[.sub]60[/] is  van der Waals type, though that between clusters in boron-rich  semiconductors is covalent. It is interesting to investigate the  interrelation between boron-rich semiconductors, aluminum-based  quasicrystalline metals and C[.sub]60[/] molecular solids.  Boron-rich solids are considered to be candidates for a  semiconducting quasicrystal.    Quasicrystals have been found in many kinds of, but only  metallic alloy systems. Boron-rich solids are considered to be  icosahedral approximate crystals which have the same local  structures as an icosahedral quasicrystal. Analyzing the  crystalline structure of _a_- and _b_- rhombohedral boron as  approximates, atomic structures of two unit cells of the  icosahedral quasicrystal are constructed. Based on cohesive  energy calculated by the molecular orbital method, the  _a_-rhombohedral boron type quasicrystal can be realized. Among  the (_a_-rhombohedral type structures, the distortion of  B[.sub]12[/] is the smallest and rhombohedral axis angle is  close to the icosahedral angle for the B-C system. A search for  semiconducting quasicrystal has been experimentally done in the  B-C system. A new type of approximate phase of icosahedral  quasicrystal has been found on the way to crystallization of the  B[.sub]95[/]C[.sub]5[/] amorphous phase.    The crystalline structure of the _b_-rhombohedral boron is  considered to have B[.sub]84[/] soccer-ball clusters at  vertices of the rhombohedral unit cell. The B[.sub]84[/]  cluster is constructed of B[.sub]60[/] outer soccer-ball  shell and B[.sub]24[/] inner double icosahedral. This  crystalline structure is essentially the same as the face  centered cubic structure of C[.sub]60[/]. Though lattice  constants are almost the same (about 1 nm), soccer-balls have  larger diameters and are closer to each other for the _b_-boron  than for C[.sub]60[/]. This corresponds to that bonds between  the C[.sub]60[/] clusters are van der Waals type and those  between B[.sub]84[/] clusters are covalent. In spite of this  different bonding nature, energy band gaps are similar (about  1.5 Ev) for bothmaterials. Though electrical conductivity and  magnetic susceptibility of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/] is  metallic and shows superconducting transition, those of the  _b_-boron remain to be semiconductive up to several percent  metal doping and the conductivity has a variable-range hopping  type temperature dependence. For the _b_-boron, the Fermi level  is pinned at the localized intrinsic acceptor level and a  carrier may form a bipolaron.</p>

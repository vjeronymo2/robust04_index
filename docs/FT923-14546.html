			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / National Savings launches new bond NATIONAL Savings yesterday fulfilled Mr Norman Lamont's Budget promise of a new product by launching a one-year fixed-rate bond. However, Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said the rate was 'a bit strong' and was not helpful in enabling building societies to cut mortgage rates. FIRST (Fixed Interest Rate Savings Tax-Paid) Option Bond goes on sale today with a guaranteed interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to 10.34 per cent gross) on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. Tax is deducted at source and the bond is aimed at the country's 25.1m basic-rate taxpayers. A higher rate of 8.05 per cent is payable on Pounds 20,000 and above. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said it was aimed at funding the government's public sector borrowing requirement this year of Pounds 28bn. He said that in setting the rate, the government had been mindful of protests from banks and building societies that National Savings rates were too high. National Savings has outperformed building societies for several months of this year. In May, National Savings recorded net receipts of Pounds 333m against net receipts of Pounds 179m by building societies. The Building Societies' Association said yesterday that the new bond 'will provide more competition for savings.' National Savings contributed a net Pounds 3.1bn to government funding last year and it has already raised Pounds 1.5bn in the first quarter of the year. Halifax, the UK's largest building society, which launched a similar product in May, the Guaranteed Reserve, said yesterday that it had anticipated public demand for the bond and believed its own product offered 'attractive and realistic rates of interest'.</p>

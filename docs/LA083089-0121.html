			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHARTER PLANE FLIES IN AUSTRALIA CRISIS  </P> <P> A U.S. charter plane started flying freight around Australia Tuesday as part of  a government-approved emergency service replacing 1,600 domestic pilots who  have resigned en masse over a pay dispute.  </P> <P> The Miami-based Arrow Air DC-8 with its own crew was expected to be joined by  passenger-carrying charter flights if no quick solution could be found to the  crisis, airline officials said.  </P> <P> Australia's Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft had been cleared for  freight operations but the authority added that it had not received any  inquiries about licensing charter aircraft for passengers.  </P> <P> The Australian Federation of Air Pilots said its members, who quit their jobs  Thursday, would not waver in their demand for direct talks with the domestic  airlines for a 30% raise.  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Travel in Albania Public order in Albania has improved but the Foreign Office advises that it is best to have a guide outside of Tirana, the capital. Health risks are high and medical facilities are poor. Hepatitis A and B are particular problems. Petrol stations can be few and far between and visitors using private cars are advised to have full jerrycans on long journeys. Spare parts are in short supply or not available.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council  Securities Commission noted at its fourth plenary session that  it has decided to establish a system of coaching [fu dao 6534  1418] listed companies, with the belief that securities markets'  healthy development is based on their good management.  Beginning this year, an enterprise will be coached for six  months before it is allowed to issue stocks. In 1995, to help  businesses replace their operating mechanisms and regulate their  operations, businesses with prospects of selling stocks will be  coached for one year -- six months before and six months after  they sell stocks.    Liu Hongru, vice chairman the State Council Securities  Commission and chairman of the China Securities Supervision and  Administration Committee, chaired and addressed the meeting  about the supervision of the securities market over the past  year and what will be done next. The meeting maintained: Under  the State Council's leadership and the guidance of its  "Tightening Macroeconomic Control Over Securities Markets  Circular," government authorities, securities commission member  units, and securities supervision committees have given priority  to drawing up a law governing the stock market and to  supervising the law's enforcement and the stock market's  performance, thus upholding the principle of "exercising control  and supervision over the securities market according to law." A  new order of the securities market, especially the stock market,  has thus been established. Since 1993, businesses raised 22.6  billion yuan through selling 4.6 billion yuan of A-class stocks  to individual buyers. Markets for B-class stocks have also  developed. While developing the domestic stock market,  calculated steps have been taken to develop stock markets  abroad. Currently, eight businesses are now selling stocks in  Hong Kong and other parts of the world. Of these eight, the  stocks of seven are listed in Hong Kong. Fairly good results  have been achieved in the great deal of work done in supervising  the brokerage businesses' performance.    Analyzing the stock market, the meeting maintained that  China's market is still in an embryonic stage, the nation should  proceed cautiously step by step in developing its stock market,  and it should make positive efforts in exploring a course for  developing its stock market -- a course which is in line with  the nation's socialist market economic system -- through  improving various regulations and rules, strictly enforcing the  law, and regulating the operations.    According to Liu Hongru, because of the coaching system,  most  of the public stocks will not be sold to individual buyers and  corporations until next year -- with the exception of those  stocks that have already been allotted to local authorities or  departments. The meeting pointed out that the way to issue new  stocks will be improved by requiring prospective buyers to open  accounts at the stock market, by controlling price increases,  and by lowering operating costs. To tighten supervision over  the listed companies, certain regulations governing these  companies' replacement of operating mechanisms will be drawn up.  Moreover, to guard against manipulation and under-the-table  deals, trading regulations and supervisory measures will be  improved. Securities organs and brokers violating laws and  regulations will be punished according to the law. To increase  the number of long-term investors, positive efforts will be made  to cultivate institutional investors, and investment funds open  to society will be allowed to be established in China. Pilot  projects for issuing B-class stocks will be expanded, and the  marketing of H-class stocks and their supervision will be made  more efficient. The meeting reiterated that businesses within  China must have State Council Securities Control Committee  approval before they can sell their stocks overseas. The  meeting said that supervision over the stock market must be  tightened, that the stock market must operate ethically, and  that precautionary measures must be taken to guard against  corruption.    The meeting examined and approved the measures drawn up by  the China Securities Supervision and Administration Commission  for regulating and stabilizing the stock market. These measures  will be carried out step by step after full preparations have  been made by the commission as well as by other relevant  departments and committees.</p>

These are some of the most important among the new rules:    As of today, mass media will not be allowed to publish or  broadcast advertising for parties or candidates but will be  allowed to announce, broadcast and report on debates, round  tables, press conferences and speeches, as well as the programs  of parties and candidates.    On Saturday, March 12, (15 days before the polls open), a  ban  on the publication or release of any opinion polls or popularity  ratings will go into effect.    An individual campaign spending ceiling of 92 million lire  (54,700 dollars) has been set for Lower House candidates; the  spending ceiling for Senate candidates is 115 million lire  (68,400 dollars). Candidates found to have spent more than twice  the allotted spending ceiling for their campaigns will face  removal from office.</p>

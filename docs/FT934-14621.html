			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce and ABB end joint venture ASEA BROWN Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Rolls-Royce, the aero-engines and industrial power group, are ending their four-year old partnership which had been created to seek contracts in the UK market for gas-fired power stations. ABB is paying an undisclosed sum for Rolls-Royce's 50 per cent stake in the Newcastle-based joint venture company, NEI ABB Gas Turbines. The venture, which was established in December 1989, was an important step for both companies, which wanted to pursue opportunities created by the privatisation of the electricity industry and the 'dash for gas.' NEI, the power plant company known formerly as Northern Engineering Industries, had been bought by Rolls-Royce earlier in 1989, but lacked a range of heavy-duty gas turbines that would allow it to participate in the fast-growing UK market for combined-cycle power stations. ABB, meanwhile, believed that linking up with a UK supplier with long-established contacts in the domestic power market would help it win business. However, Rolls-Royce's wide-ranging global technology transfer, marketing and co-operation deal last year with Westinghouse of the US - a main rival of ABB in the power plant business - raised questions about the future of the NEI ABB venture, which was limited to the UK. Yesterday, Rolls-Royce said it preferred to concentrate on its relationship with Westinghouse than the link-up with ABB. The work, formerly carried out by the joint venture, which employs 41 people, will be included in ABB Power Plants, a new company ABB is establishing to cover all its UK power plant activities. This will be headed by Mr Alan Dixon, previously managing director of the joint venture, and will continue to be based in Newcastle. The new company will take on the joint venture's main contract to build a 500MW combined cycle station at Deeside, North Wales, for National Power, due for completion next year.</p>

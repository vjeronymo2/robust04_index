			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own information" report: "In Combative Mood. Kurds Will </F> Not Guarantee Safety of Pipeline Construction Workers"]    [Excerpts] Dzhamal Kadyr [name as transliterated], the  Kurdistan National Liberation Front's [ERNK] representative in  the CIS, has issued a statement to the Kurdistan Committee in  connection with the plans to build a new oil pipeline from Baku  to a Turkish port. [passage omitted]    The Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has repeatedly stated  that it will not allow any pipeline to cross the territory of  Kurdistan without the consent of its people. Nor can the PKK  guarantee the safety of persons employed in building the  pipeline. These people will be arrested by the guerrillas of  the Kurdistan Peoples' Liberation Army, D. Kadyr stated.    The committee recalled that during the last month alone  Kurdistan Peoples' Liberation Army guerrillas have on seven  occasions blown up the oil pipeline that crosses the territory  of Kurdistan from Kirkuk in Iraq to the Turkish port of  Iskenderun.    "We will not allow pipelines to be laid across our territory  without our being asked and without the Kurds being taken into  account at all," D. Kadyr later stated at a Moscow news  conference. "And we do not want our natural resources to be  exported from Kurdistan without the consent of the Kurds."</p>

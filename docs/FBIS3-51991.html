According to municipal firemen, an earlier explosion of a  dynamite charge injured three persons and destroyed a tower  northeast of this capital, which has a population of more than 1  million.    Another tower in the town of San Cristobal, south of the  capital, was damaged by a bomb that exploded at approximately  2130 (0330 GMT).    The firemen have said that there is no confirmation of  whether the first reported explosion was produced by a dynamite  attack.    The downing of the power pylons produced blackouts in the  capital and in Solola and Chimaltenango Departments in the west  and in Jutiapa and Santa Rosa Departments in the southeast of  this Central American country, the only country in the area  where guerrilla violence continues.    The attacks are taking place on the eve of a strike by  200,000 state employees; in the absence of Guatemalan President  Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who is staying overnight in Honduras; and  only 48 hours prior to a referendum to reform the Constitution  to advance the legislative elections.</p>

No details were immediately available about how the siege of  the plane ended, but unconfirmed reports said security forces  stormed the plane.    The hijackers seized the Airbus 300 earlier in the day and  forced it to land here, where they freed all 159 passengers,  leaving captive only the captain and co-pilot of the jet.    The airline, called Saudia, said the plane was flying from  Addis Ababa to Jeddah when it was hijacked. But an official at  the control tower of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport said it was  flying from Jeddah to Addis Ababa.    Airport sources said earlier that the plane was hijacked by  three men who were demanding to go to Italy but the airline and  the police would not confirm the report.    A Saudi embassy official had said one of the three hijackers  was a woman and that the trio were demanding the plane be  refuelled to fly to London.</p>

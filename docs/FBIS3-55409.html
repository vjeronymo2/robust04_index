He made this  decision as a result of his meeting today in the House of the  Russian Federation Government with the editors in chief of  Russian publications and the heads of journalists' unions.    At the same meeting, the editors in chief promised not to  hold the protest action -- halting the output of a number of  publications -- planned for 10 January.    The 25 November government decision on reassessing among  other things the value of the basic funds of printing  enterprises could have led to a six-fold rise in the cost of  printing services. The journalists of a number of publications  threatened to strike in protest against this.</p>

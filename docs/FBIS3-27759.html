			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers  on 29 January on the possible deployment of Patriot missiles to  the ROK.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a  800-word editorial entitled "Patriot Is for Defensive Use." The  editorial notes that "the Patriot missile is a defensive  weapon," and that the use of such a weapon is "by no means to  attack North Korea," but to prepare for a possible attack by  offensive weapons, such as the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles,  which North Korea is currently developing. The editorial views  that "if the South side does not take any defensive measures at  a time when North Korea is developing offensive weapons, it  would be relinquishing our security." The editorial reports  China expressed opposition to the plan of deploying the Patriot  missiles by noting: "This is an act threatening security and  peace on the Korean peninsula." The editorial goes on to note  that our opposition party [Democratic Party of South Korea] said  that the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles may provoke North  Korea. The editorial criticizes the opposition party's remark,  noting that the opposition party does not know which side is  committing acts that threaten peace on the Korean peninsula.  The editorial concludes: "If North Korea changes its position  and gives up the development of offensive weapons, then the plan  to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK will lose its  justification."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a  500-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on  the plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to  the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK and to send an aircraft  carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula. The article  reports this is to "prepare for a possible threat by North Korea  if the UN Security Council decides to apply economic sanctions  against North Korea." The article quotes a Washington  diplomatic source as stating that "this is part of a  comprehensive operational plan to prepare for a possible state  of emergency that may occur on the Korean peninsula." The  article reports that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman  confirmed that "the deployment of the Patriot missiles to the  ROK is being promoted" and that "when a final decision is made,  the U.S. Forces in the ROK will possess an improved model of the  Patriot missile." The article notes it has been confirmed there  are plans to deploy Apache helicopters to the ROK as part of the  U.S. plan to modernize its weapons. The article concludes that  the Patriot missiles will be deployed to Air Force bases in  Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan to serve as a strategic defensive base,  rather than for the defense of the metropolitan area.    HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 2 publishes a 1,000-word  article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the true  nature of the new moves by the United States regarding the  security situation of the Korean peninsula. The article notes  that diplomatic circles in Washington are showing interest in  U.S. moves regarding the Korean peninsula. The article explains  that the United States is a "super power" militarily, but it  needs the approval of the people to use its power. adding that  "the situation on the Korean peninsula is no exception." The  article notes "what the United States truly wants is not to be  prepared for a war, but to strengthen deterrent power to prevent  the outbreak of a war." The article notes that such moves by  the United States are a means to put the finishing touches on  the negotiations regarding North Korea's nuclear issue. The  article notes that we cannot overlook the fact that the ROK may  be used as a major weapons market by the U.S. defense industry.  The article reports: "There are rumors that core figures of  the U.S. defense industry in Washington secretly visited the ROK  and met with high-ranking officials to discuss the sale of the  Patriots." The article notes that the recent moves of the U.S.  military are an ultimatum to North Korea regarding the  settlement of its nuclear issue and to confirm to Northeast  Asian countries, including Japan and China, U.S. presence in  this region. The article concludes: "Moves for the increase of  U.S. capability in the ROK cannot by any means be limited to the  Korean peninsula issue."    HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 800-word  editorial entitled: "Unusual Atmosphere on the Korean  Peninsula." The editorial notes "the ROK Government is  remaining silent" about U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles  and Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to the  waters around the Korean peninsula in case of a possible  military provocation on the South by North Korea. The editorial  notes that the people are worried about this matter because "the  United States and North Korea reached an agreement in principle  regarding the nuclear issue late last year and that negotiations  are under way between the International Atomic Energy Agency and  North Korea on the method for inspection of North Korea's  nuclear facilities." The editorial elaborates on the pros and  cons of the United States increasing its capability. The  editorial notes that the people are curious about "the concrete  content of the proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue  as agreed upon between the United States and North Korea, its  progress, the real reason for the United States to increase its  capability in the ROK, and the nature of U.S.-ROK consultations  at this time." The editorial urges the government to be clear  about these matters and explain everything to the people. The  editorial concludes: "How the situation develops and how  rapidly changes are made on the Korean peninsula are directly  related to our security, right to live, and interest."    The liberal TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a  900-word article on the issue of "deployment of ultramodern  weapons for U.S. forces in the ROK." Noting this issue was  revealed by the U.S. side first, the article emphasizes the ROK  Government's "politico-military measures" regarding the issue.  The article then reports the remark by a high-ranking  security-related official on the report on the U.S. plan to  deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to the ROK that  "this plan has been included in the equipment modernization  program of the U.S. Forces in the ROK for three to five years."    Asked if the weapons buildup was an indication of a  "military  provocation" by North Korea, the official stated: "There is no  abnormal situation we should cope with at present," adding, "the  necessity of such pressing measures for nuclear negotiations  with North Korea should be reviewed from a political and  military standpoint."    Referring to remarks of military officials, the article  notes  that "the question of deploying weapons at this time may cause a  lot of controversy." The article quotes a statement by  government authorities that "the recent U.S. report on projected  Patriot missiles deployment, on dispatch of a state intelligence  support team to the ROK, and on introduction of Apache  helicopters, has led to the impression of heightened `tensions'  on the Korean peninsula. Thus, the government expressed its hope  to the United States that the U.S. military authorities will  refrain from leaking intelligence."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 1  a 300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim  Hak-sun. The article reports: "It was learned on 27 January that  the U.S. Government is strongly hoping that the ROK Government  will purchase Patriot missiles, which it is considering  deploying on the Korean peninsula to counter Scud missile  attacks by North Korea." The article noted that a diplomatic  source in Washington observed that "the U.S. Government's plan  to increase military power, including deployment of Apache  helicopters in the ROK and dispatch of aircraft carriers to the  coast of the Korean peninsula, is related to the weapons sale  strategy of U.S. military industries toward the ROK."    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word  editorial entitled "Is the Korean Peninsula Uneasy?" Noting that  the report on the U.S. arms buildup plan on the Korean peninsula  is arousing "a sense of vague uneasiness" instead of "a feeling  of relief" regarding security, the editorial points out that the  report on deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters  and on the dispatch of aircraft carriers will "evoke a sense of  military tension," and refers to the "general observation" that  such measures are "means of diplomatic pressure" on North Korea  to accept nuclear inspections. The editorial reports that while  negotiations are under way, such measures may possibly "irritate  North Korea" and cause a "negative influence" on the  negotiations.    Stressing that "military issues should be advanced in  secret," the editorial expresses misgivings that the disclosure  of such plans might have "diplomatic and military purposes."  Referring to an explanation by government authorities of the  U.S. plan to deploy weapons, the editorial reports that the ROK  Government has failed to "consult sufficiently" with the U.S.  Government on reinforcement of U.S. forces in the ROK and that  our government has been "dragged" into U.S. policy on "the  military situation" on the Korean peninsula, rather than  "positively coping with this situation."    The editorial calls on the government to give "a clear  explanation on the true aspects" to the people and stresses that  "concentration of ultramodern weapons on the Korean peninsula  during an atmosphere of detente is not desirable."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reopening of the administrative record for alcohol drug products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for topical antimicrobial OTC use published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 21, 1982 (47 FR 22324), one comment objected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statement of identity in proposed &sect;333.98(a) which read,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``alcohol for topical antimicrobial use,'' (47 FR 22324 at 22332).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment stated that this term would be confusing to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer and suggested the term ``antiseptic for the skin.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency agrees that OTC topical antimicrobial drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products need not have multiple statements of identity. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing the statements of identity recommended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33103), i.e., health-care personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgical hand scrub, and the statement of identity recommended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 22324), i.e., alcohol for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topical antimicrobial use, the agency has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general term ``antiseptic'' broadly describes all proposed product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories and reflects the basic intended uses of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. The agency believes that the statement of identity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``multiple purpose skin prep'' or ``skin prep'' recommended by one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment would not as clearly and succinctly describe the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products as the statement of identity ``antiseptic.'' As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in section I.B., comment 5, the agency is also proposing an additional term ``antiseptic handwash'' as a statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of identity to describe products for home use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the first aid antiseptic segment of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the term ``skin'' has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted from the previously proposed statement of identity ``skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic.'' Although several comments felt that the word ``skin''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was superfluous, the agency has no objection to the statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``antiseptic for the skin'' or ``skin antiseptic'' appearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elsewhere in the labeling of these products as additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the consumer or health-care professional, provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it does not appear in any portion of the labeling required by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph and does not detract from such required information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See section I.I., comment 19.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the first aid antiseptic segment of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the agency believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term ``antiseptic'' is readily understood by consumers. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also finds this to be true for health professionals. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is therefore proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement of identity for all OTC topical antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients included in this tentative final monograph. Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is also proposing that manufacturers may have an option to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an alternate statement of identity describing only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific intended use(s) of the product. Specifically, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is proposing that the statement of identity for antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug products in &sect;333.450(a) read as follows: ``The labeling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a single-use product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product as an `antiseptic' and/or with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriate statement of identity described in &sect;&sect;333.455(a),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 333.460(a), or 333.465(a). The labeling of a multiple-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may use the single statement of identity `antiseptic' and/or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate statements of identity described in &sect;&sect;333.455(a),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 333.460(a), and 333.465(a). When `antiseptic' is used as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, the intended use(s), such as patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, is to be included under the indications. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple-use products, a statement of the intended use should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also precede the specific directions for each use.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that the proposed labeling for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple-use products is flexible and provides manufacturers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of options. However, the agency recognizes that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers may wish to label their antiseptic drug products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all of the allowable indications for a particular active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient and that this may give rise to difficulties in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating all of the information on a product's various uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the limited space on an OTC label. The agency wishes to point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out that some portions of the proposed indications are optional,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., the examples included in both the antiseptic and health-care personnel handwash indications, and need not be incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the labeling at all. In addition, manufacturers are free to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design ways of incorporating all the information on the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses of their drug product through the use of flap labels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesigned packages, or package inserts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Florian Gerster (Social Democratic Party of  Germany), Rhineland-Palatinate minister for federal affairs, has  accused the Federal Government of pursuing a defense policy that  is characterized by insecurity and aimlessness. At a  security-political forum of the German Bundeswehr Association in  Bonn today, Gerster called for a defense structure law that  would stipulate the basic figures concerning the strength and  deployment of the Bundeswehr. Moreover, "external ideas and  wishes determine the planning of the Bundeswehr." The  government should pursue a policy aimed at limiting the armed  forces to a number that is required for the country's and the  alliance's defense and for the international obligations.    In view of the difficult financial situation of the  Bundeswehr, Inspector General Klaus Naumann appealed to the  politicians to show the soldiers "the light at the end of the  tunnel." The current situation is unbearable. A "critical  point has been reached." The general mentioned big problems in  the sphere of material preservation and ammunition for the  exercises. He emphatically called on all parties to achieve a  consensus on security issues. The credibility of the politicians  must be ensured among the members of the Bundeswehr.    Former Inspector General Dieter Wellershoff, who is the  president of the Federal Academy for Security Policy, warned the  states against a return to nationalism. "This contagious  disease is not only spreading in East Europe," Wellershoff  pointed out. With its new political strategy, NATO is showing  the only possible way out of this dilemma: cooperation. "In  Europe, we all must find the right path between positive  attachment to our country and an indispensable openness to the  world and international solidarity," Wellershoff stressed.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAL STATE REHIRES PROFESSOR FIRED FOR EXPOSING HIMSELF  </P> <P> California higher-education officials have reinstated a Cal State Northridge  geography professor who was fired after he admitted exposing himself to two  female instructors.  </P> <P> Associate Prof. Darrick Danta will resume teaching when classes begin in  September, said Jeff Stetson, a spokesman for the chancellor's office of the  Cal State University system.  </P> <P> Danta, 34, was fired by CSUN President James W. Cleary in November after the  professor admitted that he exposed himself to instructors Carolyn  McGovern-Bowen and Christine Rodrigue. His ouster prompted support from some  faculty members who alleged that Cleary did not follow proper university  procedures in the firing.  </P> <P> Danta said today his behavior toward the two women was "a joke."  </P> <P> Danta appealed his case and was reinstated July 31 after an arbitration hearing  between CSU counsel and the California Faculty Assn., the teachers' union  representing him, Stetson said. University officials refused to comment further  on the case, saying it is a personnel matter.  </P> <P> It was the second time this summer that a CSUN professor has been reinstated  after being fired by campus officials.  </P> <P> Last month, the State Personnel Board ordered CSUN to reinstate Eleazu S.  Obinna, a Pan-African studies professor who was fired last summer for allegedly  offering students "A" grades in exchange for selling raffle tickets to raise  money for his nonprofit foundation. The state board also ordered Obinna  suspended for 90 days.  </P></p>

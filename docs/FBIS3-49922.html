			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Issues concerning ethnic  minorities are guided by pan-European norms which Slovakia  respects but holds a different opinion of the priority of civic  and ethnic rights, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar told  journalists after his talks with a Hungarian delegation tonight.  He said that unlike Hungary, Slovakia considered the  implementation of the ethnic principle in building states to be  overcome.    Meciar said that ethnic conflicts benefited nobody and  expressed the conviction that Slovaks and Hungarians would  succeed in coping with the problem of ethnic minorities. He was  reacting to a question about the role played by the problem of  the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia in the integration  processes within the Visegrad Group.    Meciar said each of the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech  Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) was partly responsible  for the group's stagnation. He stressed that the possible  withdrawal of the Czech Republic from the group would probably  result in its disintegration, not in its transformation into a  "Visegrad Troika." He added that Slovakia would continue to  seek cooperation and coordination of its policies with the  Czechs.    In reference to the fact that Slovakia was often omitted  from  talks about possible admission of new members into NATO, Slovak  President Michal Kovac said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had  assured him that the United States had never excluded Slovakia  and was not going to do so. This problem was in fact solved  today when all the Visegrad countries accepted the Partnership  for Peace project, which gives equal chances to all of them,  Kovac said.    He said it was not surprising that no joint statement was  adopted at the conclusion of the Visegrad leaders' meeting with  Clinton, because its main goal was to inform Clinton about the  Visegrad countries' stands on Partnership for Peace.    Kovac said that Clinton had accepted his invitation to  attend  the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National  Uprising in summer, though he may send somebody else to  represent him if he does not come himself. The anti-Nazi  uprising broke out in Slovakia on August 29, 1944.    The economic issues, too, were discussed by the Slovak  delegation, headed by President Michal Kovac, during the talks  with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Kovac told journalists today.  Slovak leaders appealed to Clinton to bear Slovakia in mind  when investment is considered, which Clinton promised, Kovac  said.    Several countries are striving to become an intermediary in  trade between Europe, the United States, and Russia, noted  Premier Vladimir Meciar. The Western economics will follow the  easiest and most suitable way, he added.    Meciar said that some questions of economic relations with  the Czech Republic were still to be settled. The most delicate  one is reclaiming joint foreign debts, where the two countries  should establish a precise strategy, he said.    Meciar mentioned the Slovak gold allegedly withheld by the  Czech National Bank accumulated by the pro-Nazi Slovak state  during World War Two, and the deficit of the Czechoslovak State  Bank as the unresolved issues.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY CAPITALIZES ON 8 ERRORS  </P> <P> That El Segundo High's talent pool appears to be a little dry this season took  none of the luster off Simi Valley's 7-4 win over the Eagles on Wednesday at  Simi Valley.  </P> <P> That El Segundo made eight errors took nothing away from the Pioneers' 11 hits  and four-run fifth inning that won the game.  </P> <P> Perhaps it even served as a reminder that the best of programs run aground on  occasion, especially given that only one El Segundo letterman returned from  last season's Pioneer League co-champion. But Simi Valley's program seems to be  intact, given its 4-0 start and subsequent berth in the El Segundo tournament  semifinals Friday against Artesia.  </P> <P> "I see good things," said Kenny Hood, whose two-run home run in the fifth  inning gave the Pioneers a 5-4 lead they never relinquished. "I have a lot of  confidence. One through nine (in the batting order) can hit the ball out of the  park.  </P> <P> "To come out with the wins gives us confidence."  </P> <P> Coming out of the El Segundo tournament with confidence is a plan Simi Valley  has employed since 1983, when it first played in the season-opening event. The  Pioneers won the championship in 1985, and, according to Coach Mike Scyphers,  have never lost more than one game in the tournament.  </P> <P> "We put a lot of emphasis on the tournament," Scyphers said. "By playing, you  get more games early and the kids need the competition. It's not the same as  you do in practice."  </P> <P> Maybe not for Simi Valley, but El Segundo Coach John Stevenson, whose program  has nurtured the likes of George and Ken Brett and Tracy and Heath Jones, saw a  game like this one coming.  </P> <P> Only two of Simi Valley's runs were earned and the Eagles committed three  errors in the third inning, two in each of the fourth and fifth innings and  another in the sixth.  </P> <P> El Segundo errors led to two Pioneer runs in the third, one in the fourth and  four in the fifth. It might have been worse had would-be home runs by Terry  Hill and Mike Morano not been ruled foul by the plate umpire. The ball Hill  hit, especially, appeared to clear the fence several feet in fair territory.  </P> <P> Hill still finished with two hits, and Andy Hodgins and Greg Santos each added  two hits in support of Rich Langford's five-hitter. Langford (2-0) struck out  four and walked six.  </P></p>

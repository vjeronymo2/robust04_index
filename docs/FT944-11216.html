			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (18): Cautious policy on debt - The number of bond issuers is set to rise but tight government control on borrowing will be maintained The presence of Chinese borrowers in the international bond markets is set to increase substantially in coming years as the country's massive infrastructure programme raises the need for more foreign investment. But while the number of Chinese borrowing agencies and the volume of supply are likely to rise markedly, observers say China's conservative foreign debt management will ensure that the market will not get swamped with supply. 'The key feature of China's risk profile is its commitment to keeping debt under control,' says Mr Stephen Taran, director for fixed-income research Asia at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. 'There should be an increase in the types of issuers, but changes will take place within a framework where the central government retains tight control over borrowing.' Indeed, a finance ministry official recently said that the government would closely monitor borrowing by state agencies and corporations to ensure that China's debt service ratio did not exceed 15 per cent. Chinese borrowers have something of a stop-and-go track record in the international bond markets. Spearheaded by the Bank of China and the China International Trust &amp; Development Corporation (Citic), the list of borrowers has expanded in recent years to include other banks, regional development corporations and, most importantly, the finance ministry itself which raises funds on behalf of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Chinese entities borrowed a total of Dollars 3.75bn in the year to date, up from Dollars 3bn in 1993, Dollars 1.4bn in 1992 and Dollars 258m in 1991, data compiled by Euromoney Bondware show. After the resounding success of the PRC's debut in the Dragon bond market in September 1993 with an issue of Dollars 300m of 10-year bonds, its fortunes turned with the launch of a Dollars 1bn global bond offering in early February. Priced at 85 basis points over Treasuries - even tighter than the 88-basis-point spread on the Dragon bond - it co-incided with the sharp reversal in the global bull market in bonds, coming only two days before the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in the current cycle. This caused its yield spread to balloon out - some say to as much as 160 basis points over Treasuries - and soured investor sentiment towards Chinese debt, making it more difficult for issuers to tap the markets in ensuing months. 'The pricing on the PRC issue was too tight,' says Mr Michael Roche, head of fixed income at HSBC Asset Management in Hongkong. He says he bought PRC bonds at issue, held them during the sell-off and recently sold his position at a small loss. Some say investment banks' and rating agencies' eagerness to do business with China has led them to compromise on the quality of that business. 'In its quest to become bankers to China, the underwriting community has aimed to please the issuer more than the investors - as reflected in the pricing of the PRC issue,' says HSBC's Mr Roche. As far as Chinese issuers are concerned, he adds, 'the rose is off the bloom, and we're staying away from them.' This, in addition to worries during the first half of the year over the renewal of China's most favoured nation status, economic problems at home and the dire performance of emerging market debt worldwide, pushed yield spreads on Chinese issues out dramatically, causing subsequent fixed-rate issues to be priced at a substantial premium over the underlying market. A fixed-rate Yankee bond for Citic, issued on October 19, was priced at a spread of 140 basis points over Treasuries. The PRC's global bond currently trades at a spread of around 120 basis points over Treasuries. Much of this year's issuance has also been in Japanese yen, where interest rates have been less volatile than in the dollar block, and in floating rate notes, which have made up some 20 per cent of borrowing by Chinese entities this year. Despite this year's difficulties, China is expected to persevere in its efforts to raise international debt. One of the biggest borrowers in the coming years is likely to be the finance ministry, which plans to raise some Dollars 10bn internationally over the next five years. The finance ministry will probably be joined by three new borrowers, the so-called policy banks which China created this year: the State Development Bank, the Agricultural Development Bank and the China Import and Export Bank. They will gradually take over the country's centrally controlled policy lending, allowing other banks to sharpen their commercial focus and concentrate on commercial lending. The commercial banks, too, are expected to gain controlled access to the international bond markets. China's provinces are also expected to become bigger players in the international arena. The trend towards political decentralisation has led to a devolution of responsibility for infrastructure funding from the central government to the provinces. Although their access to overseas markets will remain controlled by the central government, the provinces, through their financing agencies (often referred to as 'Itics,' such as Shanghai-based Sitic and Guangzhou-based Gitic) - are likely to increase their bond market profile. Lastly, corporates who have been raising funds via international equity offerings may also become bond market players. 'Partly privatised corporates who have raised equity abroad will have a higher profile outside China and this may enhance their capacity to borrow internationally,' says one syndicate manager. But will investor demand for Chinese paper rise in line with its supply? Many investors remain daunted by some of the problems overhanging China, including the overheating economy (11 per cent GDP growth expected this year), galloping inflation (well over 20 per cent), massive government subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises and fears over the succession to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. 'The market is definitely worried about run-away inflation, political risk and double deficits,' says HSBC's Mr Roche, adding: 'the economic miracle has turned into an economic mess.' In view of this, he feels that, 'relative to its sovereign peer group, Chinese debt is overpriced.' However, others say fears of economic and political chaos are overdone - 'some people pay too much attention to inflation and not enough to the underlying economic picture,' says Lehman's Mr Taran, pointing to China's dynamic export sector which has caused its current account deficit to shrink sharply and underpins the country's debt servicing capacity. Moreover, its high domestic savings rate (some 35 per cent of GDP) supports a high level of domestic investment and means that China does not depend on foreign funds. On the political front, Mr Taran brushes aside worries over a return to the dark ages of collectivism. 'Neo-Maoism is an absurd notion; after 16 years of reform, it would be very difficult for China to go back,' he says. He is sanguine as regards the eventual leadership succession: 'In my view, the death of Deng Xiaoping will be a non-event from the bond market's perspective; there is broad consensus among the leadership in China, and the cement of that consensus is the drive towards modernisation.'</p>

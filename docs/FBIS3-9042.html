The five  members are: Deputy Prime Minister for Legislative Affairs Ivan  Simko; Minister of Employment, Social Affairs, and the Family  Julius Brocka; Minister of Transport, Communications, and Public  Works Mikulas Dzurinda; Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner; and  Culture Minister Lubo Roman.    Simko emphasized that even though the current cabinet's  mandate is limited in time, he did not intend to merely "sit  out" the term, but rather to foster new type of politics based  on broad cooperation among all political forces, and to  transform and oversee the legal system.    Brocka described himself as "minister of the poor" in charge  of a large group of people who are socially disadvantaged. But  by amending a number of laws he intends to protect others as  well, he said, such as by creating tax breaks for self-employed  people in order to make possible an increase in activity.    Dzurinda said he intended to transform and improve the  country's transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and  to revive certain billion-crown projects dating from the  government of KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky, who was Slovak  premier from the fall of the first Meciar government in March  1991 until the creation of the second one in June 1992.    Pittner said his goal was to improve the work of the police,  do away with the insecurity and passivity which have recently  been a trademark, and introduce modern and effective methods for  fighting both common and organized crime. "We will respond to  violence with violence within the spirit of the law," he said.    Roman said he wanted "to create a model for cooperation in  culture, to convince people that cooperating with me will pay  off, and to carry this model over to all of society." Specific  projects he would like to see include creating sources of  financing for construction of a theater in Kosice, East  Slovakia, and holding a lottery to raise money for a new  building for the Slovak National Theater.</p>

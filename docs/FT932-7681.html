			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Ukraine MPs back prime minister UKRAINIAN legislators yesterday refused to accept Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma's resignation, offered on Thursday. It was a big political setback for President Leonid Kravchuk, who had tried to undermine him. The unexpected surge of support for the reformist Mr Kuchma has resulted in a political stalemate which must be resolved in the coming weeks if Ukraine is to address its mounting economic problems. Although the president lost his bid for extra powers, parliament also failed to give Mr Kuchma the expanded economic authority he requested at the beginning of the week. On Thursday, Mr Kravchuk asked that the president should take the place of the prime minister as the head of the Ukrainian cabinet. On Thursday, parliament appeared inclined to back Mr Kravchuk's proposal. Mr Kuchma has bluntly warned MPs that if he remains in office they can expect price increases and slashed government subsidies. That was a message the industrialists and collective farm chairmen who dominate the legislature appeared reluctant to accept. By contrast, during his 18 months as president Mr Kravchuk has shied away from tough economic decisions and many MPs appeared to expect that with the president at the head of the government they would get a softer ride, at least in the short term. The swing issue appeared to be Mr Kuchma's brief announcement of a telegram sent from Russia late on Thursday demanding world prices for its oil and gas. This would deliver a crushing blow to Ukraine's economy, traditionally dependent on subsidised energy from its northern neighbour. In these circumstances, MPs overwhelming voted to reject Mr Kuchma's resignation. However, the fickle parliament's shift has not resolved the question of who is to steer the economy through what is likely to be a hot summer.</p>

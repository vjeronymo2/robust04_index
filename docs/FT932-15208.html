			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World News In Brief: Tory tensions rise over Bosnia after Thatcher attack A fierce attack by Baroness Thatcher heightened tensions among Tory MPs over the scale of Britain's involvement in Bosnia and forced the government into defending its policy. Defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind strongly rejected the former prime minister's call for the Bosnian Moslems to be allowed to arm themselves. Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, meanwhile, warned that the US was not prepared to wait much longer for Serbia to endorse the peace plan.

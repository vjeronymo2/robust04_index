			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Offer for Vard reduced to NKr1.1bn VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, said yesterday that an offer for its ferry business had been lowered by NKr100m to NKr1.1bn (Dollars 155.2m) and that it was seeking to retain a 20 per cent stake in the unit. The reduction of the offer - made three months ago by Union Bank of Switzerland, on behalf of Mr Trygve Hegnar, a Vard board member, and a group of investors - reflected an adjustment for the level of assets, an assessment of the outlook for 1993 and other factors, Vard said. In Vard's 1992 accounts, the three ferries which make up the fleet of the Scandi and Larvik lines were booked, partly for tax purposes, at a value of NKr455m - a symbolic figure which does not reflect the value of the business as a going concern. Vard is also less optimistic about development of the ferry business. Last year, the addition of a new ferry increased capacity between Norway and Denmark, but volume this year has been below expectations. The group is uncertain about when the disposal can be concluded. It is aiming for mid-August, although the sale would be retroactive from June 1. In addition to approval from the Norwegian authorities, any deal would have to be approved by Vard's creditors.</p>

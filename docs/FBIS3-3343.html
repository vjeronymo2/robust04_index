A correspondent asked: At the dinner hosted by Premier Li  Peng in honor of Prime Minister Hosokawa, did they discuss human  rights?    Wu Jianmin responded: At the dinner, on his own initiative  Premier Li Peng briefed Hosokawa about U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher's visit to China. He quoted Li Peng as saying both  the Chinese and U.S. Governments elaborated their respective  positions concerning the most-favored-nation trade status, human  rights, and other issues. China held that the discussions were  useful in helping to increase mutual understanding. Thanking  Premier Li Peng for the detailed and all-round briefing, Prime  Minister Hosokawa held that it is unwise [bing bu ming zhi 1629  0008 2494 2535] to impose Western concepts of democracy on other  countries.

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Steve Jobs recruits C&amp;W man MR PETER van Cuylenburg, executive director in charge of Cable and Wireless's businesses in OECD countries, is leaving the UK-based telecommunications giant to become president and chief operating officer of Next Computer in California. Next was established in 1988 by Mr Steve Jobs, the co-founder and former chairman of Apple Computer, to revolutionise the personal computer. But so far it has failed to fulfil his hopes; the first version of its computer sold only a few thousand units. Revenues last year were Dollars 127m (Pounds 72m). C&amp;W is expected to announce today a re-organisation of director responsibilities following his departure. It is expected to underline a commitment to its niche monopolies instead of competing with big telecommunication companies. Mr van Cuylenburg led the recently aborted merger talks with American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications giant. His departure was described as a 'loss' by C&amp;W. Formerly head of Texas Instruments' worldwide computer business, Mr van Cuylenburg joined the C&amp;W subsidiary, Mercury Communications, as chief executive in 1989 and was appointed to his present post last year. His hopes of becoming chief executive of C&amp;W were dashed last month when Mr James Ross was appointed to the post but Mr van Cuylenburg, now 44 years old, insists his decision to change jobs is a consequence of opportunity rather than disappointment. He said yesterday: 'I want to make it clear that I am moving because of the attractiveness of the opportunity at Next Computer. It is something that happens once in a lifetime; there is no other reason to leave C&amp;W' Mr van Cuylenburg, British-born and a graduate of Bristol Polytechnic, said he told Lord Young, C&amp;W executive chairman, last year that his goal was to work in the US. Lord Young accepted that his long-term future would not be with C&amp;W but pressed him to stay on to complete plans for corporate reorganisation in which they had both been involved. C&amp;W has been keen to foster a period of management stability. Mr Adam Quinton, telecommunications analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, said: 'C&amp;W is a business where the long-term relationship between the customers and suppliers is important. Stability is needed to enable the group to define its strategy.'</p>

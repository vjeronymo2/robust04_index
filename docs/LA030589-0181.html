			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE;  </P> <P> REVENUES SOARS AS A-M HOMES MARKS FIRM'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> This year marks the 10th anniversary of A-M Homes, a Santa Barbara-based home  builder that has grown from annual revenues of $1 million in 1979 to an  estimated $171 million in revenues for 1988.  </P> <P> With 24 developments under way in both Northern and Southern California and in  Arizona, A-M Homes -- the name comes from the last names of founders James B.  (Bart) Araujo and Michael Muench -- is a major player in one of the most  competitive housing markets in the nation.  </P> <P> It's also a company with plenty of capitalization, especially since last  October, when Jennings Industries Ltd. of Australia provided additional capital  of more than $25 million to A-M.  </P> <P> Muench said the infusion of capital will strengthen A-M's position in home  building, especially in California.  </P> <P> A-M Homes ranked 80th nationally on the "Builder 100" published last year by  Builder magazine, a trade publication. The firm's total 1987 sales volume was  $144.7 million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MISSED CHANCES COST CRESPI AT CAMARILLO, 58-50  </P> <P> Camarillo High staged a clinic on how not to shoot free throws. Crespi learned  the lesson well.  </P> <P> The Scorpions, after making only one of six free throws and scoring seven  points in the first quarter, held on to win a second-round Southern Section  4-AA Division boys' playoff game, 58-50, when Crespi encountered similar  difficulties from the line in the fourth quarter Friday at Camarillo.  </P> <P> Crespi, which had trimmed a 16-point deficit to four points, converted only  five of 11 free throws in the fourth quarter as Camarillo advanced to a  third-round encounter against Glendora, a 109-60 winner over Agoura.  </P> <P> "We made a good run but we didn't help ourselves from the free-throw line,"  Crespi Coach Paul Muff said. "We had a shot to come within a basket . . . we  just didn't hit the free throws."  </P> <P> Crespi trailed, 38-22, midway through the third quarter before staging a 23-11  run to pull to within four with 2:31 remaining. But, while the Celts (11-12  overall) were missing three of their next six free throws, Camarillo (18-6)  converted six of nine to pull away.  </P> <P> Crespi trailed by five with 13 seconds remaining, but Chris McGee missed two  free throws and Camarillo's Jason Hunt made both ends of a one-and-one  opportunity.  </P> <P> For the game, Camarillo converted 18 of 31 free throws; Crespi made 14 of 26.  </P> <P> "I felt we'd pull it out," Camarillo's David Harbour said. "I knew if we kept  playing hard and I made my free throws -- or we made our free throws -- that  we'd win."  </P> <P> Harbour didn't but Camarillo did. The 6-foot-1 sophomore guard scored a  game-high 21 points but made only five of 14 free throws.  </P> <P> "That's David, either make them all or miss them all," said Camarillo Coach  John Harbour, David's father.  </P> <P> Said David Harbour: "This was the first game I've ever played in the playoffs.  I think it was just playoff jitters."  </P> <P> David Harbour was not the only nervous Scorpion.  </P> <P> "We were tight," John Harbour said. "We had this thing in our heads about it  being the playoffs."  </P></p>

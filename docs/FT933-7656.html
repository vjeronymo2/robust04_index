			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Judge points to weakness of Homes Assured books THERE WAS 'a complete management breakdown' at Homes Assured, the mortgage broker that collapsed in 1989, an Old Bailey jury in London heard yesterday. Judge John Rogers QC described weaknesses in its accounting systems in his summing-up at the end of the trial of three directors. Homes Assured went into liquidation with debts of Pounds 10.7m within two years of its creation. He cited witnesses who had described Homes Assured's regional subsidiaries as having 'wildly varying accounting systems'. Only two of the businesses had the ability to provide information to headquarters 'as and when required'. He recalled that Mr Douglas Dunkley, who was appointed head office accountant in April 1988, had told the court that the 1987 accounts were delayed for many months. The judge reminded the jury that none of the defendants had given evidence, but said this should not cause them to draw adverse conclusions. He described Mr Anthony Dobson, who started Homes Assured in late 1987, as 'by all accounts a man who is enthusiastic and perhaps prone to considerable exaggeration'. The judge said the prosecution had suggested that Homes Assured was 'not properly run, under-funded' and badly organised. 'Even after that time when its insolvency should have been obvious to everybody it went on trading,' he said in his summary of the prosecution's arguments. Three directors, Mr Keith Woodward, Mr Anthony Dobson and Mr Michael Robinson, all deny a joint charge of fraudulent trading from November 1988 to August 1989. Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception and Mr Woodward one of furnishing false information. The summing-up is expected to conclude today.</p>

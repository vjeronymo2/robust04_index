			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Fiat seeks state aid to shed 10,300 workers FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday announced plans for 10,300 redundancies this year in a further sign of the competitive pressures now facing the country's big manufacturers, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The company has requested state aid for almost half the job cuts through a government-assisted early retirement scheme, adding its name to a string of big industrial groups currently seeking government help to cushion the blow of redundancy programmes. The company's announcement will come as unwelcome news to Italy's politicians, who are facing a general election on April 5. Last month Olivetti, the loss-making computers group, announced plans for 2,500 lay-offs this year. Tripartite discussions between ministers, unions and company representatives on the proposal have made little progress so far. Last year Fiat asked for state-assisted early retirement for 3,700 workers, but received provision for only 700, a company spokesman said. The latest request includes some early retirement earmarked for last year. Fiat's plan, which involves 3.7 per cent of its Italian workforce, partly reflects the continuing fall in its share of the domestic car market, which tumbled to 46.7 per cent last year from 52.8 per cent in 1990. Yesterday's announcement follows several Fiat car plant closures. However, the latest plan also envisages sizeable job cuts at its Iveco trucks and Geotech earth-moving equipment subsidiaries, as well as of auto components businesses.</p>

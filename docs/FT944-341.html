			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Spanish telecoms licence goes to Airtel Airtel-ASR, a consortium backed by AirTouch of the US, British Telecommunications and the domestic banking groups Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano (BCH), was yesterday awarded a licence to install a second mobile network in competition with Telefonica, the government-controlled telecoms operator. The licence to develop a GSM (global system of mobile communications) system requires heavy investment but holds out the promise of considerable income from a mature telecoms market that has arrived late to the cellular business. Under the terms of the award, Airtel undertakes to offer nationwide GSM digital facilities within five years. The installation of the mobile network represents an initial investment cost of at least Pta100bn (Dollars 750.9m), on top of the consortium's Pta85bn initial cash bid last month when it entered the contest for the licence. The government preferred Airtel's bid to the one entered by Cometa-SRM, a consortium backed by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and by Vodafone, the UK cellular telephones group. Cometa made a higher cash offer, of Pta89bn, but Airtel was understood to have offered better guarantees covering industrial investment, job creation and research and development. Airtel's prize is a licence, as a second operator, to break into a mobile telephony market forecast to have a turnover of Pta210bn and 2m users by 1998. Telefonica, which already operates an analog cellular telephone network, expects to earn Pta40bn from 400,000 subscribers this year. AirTouch has 15.8 per cent of Airtel; BT owns 6.3 per cent and Santander and BCH share 27.4 per cent. Among the other shareholders are five regional savings banks which jointly own a stake of 16.8 per cent.</p>

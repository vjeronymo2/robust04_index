			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / M0 picks up after declining in April THE AMOUNT of money in circulation increased last month, pointing towards continued economic revival. Bank of England figures showed yesterday that M0, the narrow measure of the money supply - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose a seasonally-adjusted 0.3 per cent compared with May after a fall of 1.1 per cent in April. This lifted the year-on-year growth rate to 4.4 per cent, an improvement on May's exceptionally low figure of 3.3 per cent. Analysts said the rebound in M0, which pushed the annual growth rate back above the ceiling of the government's zero to 4 per cent monitoring range, would allay fears that retail activity had dipped. The Bank said the fall in May could have been linked to the two bank holidays in that month which traditionally alter spending patterns. Mr Robert Lind, economist at brokers UBS, said: 'The above-range growth in M0 could presage a further recovery in retail sales in coming months. It should also dampen speculation of an imminent cut in base rates.' The Bank's figures also suggested that broad money growth - M0 plus bank deposits - is on an upward trend from a low point of 3.1 per cent at the start of the year. Seasonally-adjusted M4 rose by 0.5 per cent in May. The year-on-year rate of increase was a seasonally-adjusted 3.8 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in April. Strong M0 growth has been apparent since the start of the year. The 12-monthly growth rate recently peaked at 4.9 per cent in March, reflecting the recovery in retail sales. Although there is no exact monthly relationship between M0 and high street sales, the two follow similar paths. In the latest six months on a year-on-year basis, M0 grew by 3.8 per cent. The Bank revised slightly the figure for sterling lending to individuals and companies by banks and building societies. In May this rose by Pounds 2bn compared with a provisional Pounds 1.9bn.</p>

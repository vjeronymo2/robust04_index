			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as nine records are set in region Arbitrage selling of Nikkei 225 futures depressed the Nikkei average on the first trading day of 1994, but traders still looked for a stronger year for the Tokyo stock market as the Topix index of all first section stocks closed higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished the half-day session down 47.50 at 17,369.74 after a low of 17,242.32 and a high of 17,424.84. The Topix index was finally 6.66 up at 1,445.97 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 0.92 firmer at 1,197.45. Volume totalled 110m shares, against 121m during the half-day session last Thursday. Rises led falls by 529 to 357, with 179 issues unchanged. A decline in Chicago futures on Monday dragged down the Osaka market, prompting arbitrage unwinding. However, a weakening of the yen triggered buying of export-oriented high-technology stocks. The yen closed at Y113.27 against the dollar, deteriorating from the Y113 level for the first time since April 16 on favourable US economic figures. Mr Keith Donaldson, a strategist at Salomon Brothers, said the sharp fall in the yen was good news for companies since it could improve the outlook for earnings. However, for the short term, most analysts expect share prices to remain in a narrow band until the political reform bill is passed through parliament, and details of a new fiscal package are announced at the end of this month. Electronics companies gained ground on the weaker yen. Sony rose Y110 to Y5,620 and NEC advanced Y19 to Y874. Automakers were also stronger, with Toyota Motor up Y30 to Y1,810 and Honda Motor adding Y50 at Y1,570. Reports that Suzuki Motor is planning to share common car parts with Daihatsu Motor pushed the former forward Y60 to Y1,110. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y6,000 to Y750,000. Reports over the weekend that the company may spin off one of its business divisions supported investor interest. KDD, the international telecoms group, put on Y300 at Y11,300. A rise in gold prices supported mining stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y49 to Y919 and Dowa Mining gained Y17 at Y485. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 49.39 to 19,271.11 in volume of 7.1m shares. Roundup The region remained in record breaking form, with new highs set in nine centres, including Bangkok. Taiwan and New Zealand were closed. HONG KONG remained at a peak in heavy turnover, with foreign and local investors encouraged by further strength in the property market, although a sharp early advance stalled in the face of afternoon profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 114.60, or 0.9 per cent, higher at 12,201.09, well below the intra-day high of 12,599.23. SINGAPORE shrugged off strong profit-taking and the Straits Times Industrial index added 30.37 at a new record closing high of 2,471.90, having peaked at 2,482.32. MANILA remained at a peak, taking its lead from the record setting performance of Philippine National Bank. The composite index rose 36.86, or 1.1 per cent, to 3,308.37. A 50-peso rise to 720 pesos by PNB was attributed to a pick-up in demand by foreign investors. AUSTRALIA saw profit-taking among some leading shares balanced by strong support for the resource sector, which left the All Ordinaries index 0.7 firmer at another six-year peak of 2,174.3. JAKARTA closed higher in an upbeat mood, driven mainly by local investors. The official index rose 10.29 to 599.94 as the market awaited the budget for fiscal 1994-95 due tomorrow. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded in the afternoon as investors returned to the market and the composite index climbed 24.50 to a peak 1,313.35. KARACHI registered a record daily advance to close at a new high on heavy institutional buying and opening of fresh accounts by investors. The KSE-100 index rose 75.84, or 3.5 per cent, to 2,253.95. BOMBAY registered sharp gains but blue chips fell below the day's best on profit-taking towards the end. The BSE 30-share index closed 14.06 ahead at a peak 3,479.92, having touched the 3,542 mark at midsession.</p>

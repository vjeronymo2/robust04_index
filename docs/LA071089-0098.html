			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> HALF-CENT SALES TAX HIKE TO GO ON NOV. 7 O.C. BALLOT;  </P> <P> $3.1 BILLION SOUGHT FOR TRAFFIC PLAN  </P> <P> Citing an unprecedented traffic crisis, the Orange County Transportation  Commission voted 6 to 0 today to place a countywide half-cent sales tax for  highway and transit projects on the Nov. 7 ballot.  </P> <P> The tax would raise $3.1 billion for a far-reaching, $11.6-billion plan to  speed traffic with wider freeways, additional car-pool lanes, "super streets"  and commuter rail service. About $8.4 billion for the 20-year plan would come  from existing sources, such as the state and federal governments.  </P> <P> The tax would cost each Orange County consumer an estimated $50 to $75 per  year.  </P> <P> Today's decision came a day after The Times Orange County Poll showed that  public support for the sales tax hike -- from the current 6% to 6 1/2% -- has  slipped to 48% from 54% about 11 months ago, with 46% now against the measure  and the rest undecided. The margin of error was 4%.  </P> <P> Still, commissioners said that they want a Nov. 7 special election to avoid  confusing voters with Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state gasoline tax  increase, scheduled for the June, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> "I don't think the people of Orange County are willing to wait any longer,"  said Commission member Dana W. Reed, referring to the 20-year plan. "The wheels  of government turn too slowly as it is."  </P> <P> Commission Vice Chairman Richard B. Edgar added: "Some may say this is not  perfect. . . . But we've reached a consensus. Let's put our shoulders to the  wheel and get this thing done."  </P> <P> Several members of the audience rose to criticize the 20-year plan's partial  reliance on additional car-pool lanes, prompting Commission Chairman Thomas F.  Riley to respond sarcastically at one point: "Thanks for your vote of  confidence."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frustrated by Complaints  </P> <P> Later, Riley said he is frustrated by various constituencies focusing so much  on specific complaints without seeing the "whole regional picture."  </P> <P> Under state law, the commission must vote again in two weeks to approve the  Nov. 7 election date. The Board of Supervisors has until Aug. 8 to ask  Registrar of Voters Don Tanney to include the sales tax measure in the printing  of the ballots.  </P> <P> The sales tax plan will occupy 23 pages of a voter information booklet,  according to Tanney.  </P> <P> Without the extra $3.1 billion, officials say, there will be sufficient money  for only 80% of the $1.5-billion Santa Ana Freeway widening project, 60% of  planned local street projects and maintenance of existing transit service at  current ridership levels. Construction of three planned tollways in eastern and  southern Orange County would be paid for with developer fees and bond sales.  </P> <P> Tanney estimated that it will cost up to $1.2 million to hold the special sales  tax election. He said that nine school districts and eight special service  districts will have elections the same day, involving 50% to 60% of the  county's eligible voters.  </P> <P> Turnout, said Tanney, probably would be only 12% to 20% in the special  election.  </P> <P> Under state law, the Transportation Commission would pay the cost of a  successful election. County government would pay the cost of a failed election.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Claus Genrich: "Ordered Harmony"] </F>   [Text] Even if the Free Democratic Party [FDP], the party  of individualists, for once painfully demonstrates cohesiveness,  it usually finds a way to avenge itself with a protesting flight  into ambivalence for being forced into unity. Usually, in such  cases party congress delegates are looking for a valve in an  unexpected place, through which the steam can escape from the  kettle of ordered harmony. The leadership is to feel that it  cannot decide everything.    This time a majority demanded the future separation of  office  and mandate. The surprised ministers were told that they will  soon have to choose between Bundestag mandate and government  office. It remains their choice whether they will fulfill the  wish of the congress. If, as it is to be expected, they do not  care or make use of certain ways of interpretation to justify  this, they will, however, become targets of attacks. What the  Greens have just abolished after the experience of years of  chaos, the FDP now wants to introduce.    A part of the ambivalence of not absolutely binding wishes  by  a party congress, which the ministers can make use of, consists  of the justified assumption that, if worse comes to worst, the  FDP will hardly give up its accustomed exercise of being, if  possible, in the government. For this it needs tested deputies  with their parliamentary support. The victorious motion was  made by Kinkel's land association for other reasons: Deputy  Bundestag Group Chairman Weng, who supports Kinkel, was so angry  about secret agreements and dubious maneuvers, for instance in  determining Genscher's successor as foreign minister, that he  wanted to promote clarity via a roundabout route. Now, however,  straightforward Kinkel is facing the problem of being  consistent. After the Bundestag elections -- if the FDP should  be able to participate in government again -- he will probably  confront his party with the choice of accepting him as minister  and as deputy or losing him as chairman. It is not he who  intends to decide -- it is the party that should do it when the  time comes. He runs for the Bundestag, of which he is currently  not a member, and he seems to rely on being able to untie the  knots once again at the end.    Kinkel may derive one reason for hoping that he will be able  to get what he wants, also in the future, from the experience of  the party congress in Rostock. The purpose of the event was  fulfilled: The Bonn coalition with the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] will be continued if the  FDP has its say. Kinkel was moving toward this vote at the  party congress in several steps. He ignored Genscher and  Moellemann's ideas about a schedule with a blow of liberation.  Now, since Kinkel, who is still an apprentice as a tactician,  has brought about this vote, he proudly and with satisfaction  insists on having stepped out of the shadow of cleverer people  without having suffered any harm.    However, here, too, there is ambivalence in the clarity.  Kinkel was able to do without a condition for the coalition  statement, because the condition is self-evident: the election  result. If it is different from what Kohl and Kinkel expect  with increasing self-confidence, the declaration of intent made  in Rostock is moot. Then the never-contested principle that,  basically, all democratic parties are able to form a coalition  will be valid again. It will be shown what figures can bring  about if they become more compelling than preferences.    Whether Scharping's Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  will then, however, still have a glance to spare for the FDP has  become uncertain, to the sorrow of some renowned leading  members, who now feel forced to gather around Kinkel. In  Rostock the party, and particularly its chairman, sharply  outlined the frontline between the CDU/CSU and the FDP on the  one side and the SPD and the Greens on the other. Kinkel  managed to convince his party that making a clear stand is more  of an advantage than a disadvantage. Probably, the calculation  that the FDP will win votes with this in October is correct,  perhaps it will also win -- as in the past -- second votes from  the voters of the CDU/CSU. They might save the FDP from a fall,  but they would not increase the total number of votes for the  coalition.    The FDP wants to attract new voters with its program. But  from where? The Rostock fireworks will vanish or will hardly be  noticed. If they so choose, medium-sized entrepreneurs can feel  as supported as unmarried couples and homosexuals. With its  domestic and legal policy along the old progressive pattern, the  FDP wants to prove independence, but without irritating the  CDU/CSU too much. Solms continues to rely on the compromise  course of the Bundestag group, on practical reason and solidity.  Almost in the same way as the CDU must rely on Kohl, the FDP  will have to rely on Kinkel; Genscher is paling, Lambsdorff only  occasionally lets rhetorical sparks fly, which did not glint  anywhere in the hall in Rostock.    Kinkel has become more authoritarian and self-confident.  This may be a benefit for him if he does not let himself be  deceived: The obedience is forced by the pressure of the  election year and the lack of persons. The valve of displeasure  will probably not have consequences this time. After the  elections -- regardless of the result -- one need not have so  much consideration for the chairman. However, first it is  important what will happen in October: Kinkel is acting with  almost so much determination, attacking the SPD so harshly, that  it seems he has burnt a few bridges behind him because he  believes he does not need them anymore. The FDP may gain  impetus from that.</p>

"The course of the Supreme Soviet will not change,"  announced  Myechyslaw Ivanovich. "It depends on the deputies themselves  rather than the chairman."    Speaking about his first moves in the new office, M. Hryb  said that, first of all, one must examine the work of the  Supreme Soviet which has become ineffective. The new chairman  intends to cooperate with all deputies. At the same time, he  stressed that he had good relations with the parliamentary  opposition and was ready to listen to all of its constructive  proposals.    M. Hryb is an advocate of a professional legislature. In his  opinion, the work of the Supreme Soviet can be based on  professionalism as of today. First of all, it is necessary to  change the current mode of work. Myechyslaw Hryb proposed that  deputies hold sessions for a week, and meet with constituents  and draft laws over the next two weeks. According to his  estimates, such regulations will not reduce the number of days  spent in sessions. At the same time, this will enhance the  deputies' efficiency.    "A statement is not a law," this is how the new chairman  commented on the Supreme Soviet plans to hold early elections.  He also stressed that this act required the adoption of a  relevant law. On the other hand, the parliament speaker supports  the idea of holding these elections this year.    According to M. Hryb, he has been Stanislav Shushkevich's  supporter for a long time. The chairman noted that Stanislav  Stanislavovich had many good traits which he failed to apply in  his activities. His disagreements with Shushkevich were  political. Hryb could not find a common language with him  concerning Belarus' membership in the collective security system  and the execution of adopted decisions.    The adoption of a constitution is a very complicated  process.  Myechyslaw Ivanovich noted that our deputies underrated this  fact, and listed foreign countries as examples where  constitutional processes lasted for decades. The new chairman  spoke out for the introduction of a presidential office in  Belarus.    "One may strive sincerely for sovereignty, but how can one  achieve it if the Army of the neighboring country is present on  our territory," said M. Hryb concerning this pressing issue. He  stressed, however, that Belarus was an independent state which  would seek neutral status. The new Supreme Soviet chairman  emphasized that he had no disagreements with [Prime Minister]  Vyacheslav Kebich. He noted that he was looking forward to the  reorganization of the government capable of conducting  successful reform.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Arts: MacMillan's 'The Judas Tree' - Ballet The Royal Ballet's new triple bill is made up of three masterworks. Balanchine's Apollo and Symphony in C need no further laurels, but it is, I think, important that ballet-goers should experience MacMillan's The Judas Tree as it returns to the repertory. This was Sir Kenneth's last creation for the Royal Ballet, and it shows him working more allusively than ever before. It also shows him making choreographic incident and delineating character with astonishing emotional force. The Judas Tree is densely layered. If we 'read' its text and explore its resonances, if we respond to MacMillan's imagery and follow him into his world, the choreography reverberates with ideas. These have to do with Biblical references - the ballet might then be called Judas - with a dependant political theme about social responsibility, about assent to evil by inanition. This MacMillan identifies in his use of a quotation from Khalil Gibran concerning a tree's silent knowledge when a single leaf turns yellow - whence the Tree of the title. But the choreography is also a commentary on sexual confrontation, about abuser and abused, about woman as sex-object and genetrix, about man as lover and son, about how we view death (and depersonalise it in such procedures as chalking round the outline of a corpse). Biblical references return when the betrayed 'friend' of the Judas foreman is entombed in a derelict car. And, examining Jock MacFadyen's set, we can see that it is Golgotha as well as Canary Wharf. In stressing the complex of images that lie within the dance, I risk minimising the inventive richness of the choreography. MacMillan was here working at the peak of his powers. Movement is breath-taking in its perceptions, and in its sheer richness of dynamic imagination. The role of the foreman finds Irek Mukhamedov tearing into steps, swathes of bravura action that tell everything of the man's rage, his vulnerabilities, his despairs. (And how vividly the image of 'fingering' someone runs through the dance). It is a monumental performance. Michael Nunn and Mark Silver as his friends, are no less boldly challenged, and no less tremendous. Viviana Durante as the woman (and more exactly, as Woman) veers between sexual provocation, grievously abused, and an untouchable, inviolate dignity. These are interpretation of truest authority and beauty, and they are framed by the intense and intensely danced readings from the group of workmen. The Judas Tree demands to be seen - and seen again. I found the company performance on Tuesday night to be stronger than last season. It is a tribute to the Royal Ballet that this should be so. We owe it to posterity that this astonishing work of art be filmed with its present and superlative cast. The opening Apollo of the evening brought Eddie J Shellman, a guest from the Dance Theatre of Harlem, as Apollo. It is a fine reading. Shellman understands both the young god's simplicity ('He's a farm boy', Balanchine once said) and the divine dignity of the role. Dance and gesture alike have a strong, inevitable shape, and in Darcey Bussell we see a Terpsichore of radiant grace. Together they showed us the continuing importance of this masterpiece. The Judas Tree can be seen at Covent Garden in this triple bill on Jan 16 eve, 21, 27, 28.</p>

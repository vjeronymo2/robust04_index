			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Polish bank chief warns The independent powers of Poland's central bank are under threat, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, the bank's president, has warned. Her claims, made in a newspaper interview, come amidst a row with Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, finance minister, who wants the bank to lower its base rates and thus cut both the internal and external debt service burden. The central bank, pointing to an alarming growth in money supply in July, due mainly to the trade surplus and mounting foreign currency reserves, wants to keep rates at their annual 31 per cent level. At the same time, the bank wants to lower the crawling peg mechanism from its monthly 1.6 per cent zloty devaluation to 1.5 per cent, a measure the finance ministry, in turn, is resisting. Yesterday, Ms Waltz questioned the government's 16 per cent inflation projection for next year and said this year's 23 per cent target was unrealistic given current 30 per cent inflation. Mr Kolodko has said that an interest rate cut and the switch to a lower devaluation rate should be linked. He has also suggested that the bank should lose its supervisory powers and a separate agency be established. Ms Gronkiewicz Waltz, nominated by President Lech Walesa, yesterday said the government 'wanted to establish political control over the banking system'.</p>

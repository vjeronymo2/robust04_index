			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Statoil upgrades European capacity STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, is planning to invest an estimated NKr4bn (Dollars 641m) to upgrade and expand European refinery capacity, and is also seeking new capacity outside Europe. Statoil produces about 1m barrels of crude oil a day, but has just 200,000 barrels a day refining capacity. The company is to spend about NKr2bn to boost annual refining capacity in Denmark to 4.8m tonnes from 3.5m tonnes by building a plant - adjacent to its existing refinery at Kalundborg - to refine condensate, a liquid hydrocarbon. Construction of the plant, which will be supplied with condensate from Statoil's North Sea Sleipner field, is to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1994. Statoil, one of the world's leading oil products exporters outside Opec, spent NKr12bn to expand and upgrade its Mongstad refinery on the west coast of Norway which came on stream in 1989. Statoil said the new investments, in the range of NKr1.8bn, were being planned at Mongstad including a desulphurisation plant and a small methyltertiary butyl ether (MTBE) plant. MTBE is used as an additive to boost or improve the octane level of unleaded petrol, which burns cleaner than leaded petrol. The plants will enable higher-quality products to be produced in order to meet stricter environmental requirements in the US and Europe.</p>

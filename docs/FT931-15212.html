			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Under 21s slip behind in pay THE FIRST detailed survey of the effect of removing young people from the protection of wages councils, which set minimum pay rates for about 2.5m workers, has found that their pay fell relative to older workers in two out of three sectors. People under 21 years were removed from the Wages Councils in a reform of the system in 1986. The Employment Bill going through its committee stage in the Commons seeks to abolish the wages councils completely. Department of Employment research on the effects of removing under-21-year-olds concluded that there was no evidence of systematic falls in the pay of young people relative to the pay of employees aged 21 years and over. In the hotel and catering sector, however, the pay of young male workers fell 4.6 per cent between 1986 and 1992 and the pay of young female workers fell 9.7 per cent when compared with workers over 21. In retailing, the pay of young male workers fell 1.1 per during the period while that of young female workers fell 2.2 per relative to pay for older workers. The pay of young male sales assistants rose 4.3 percentage points more than for older workers and that for young female hairdressers rose 2.8 per cent more than for older workers.</p>

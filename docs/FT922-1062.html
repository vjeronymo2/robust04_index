			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Amber Industrial improves to Pounds 2.55m Amber Industrial Holdings, the speciality chemicals company 75 per cent owned by Caledonia Investments, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 2.55m in the year to March 31. However the result last time was after a Pounds 785,000 exceptional debit. Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said the year reflected the first full period of its Ambersil subsidiary's occupation of the new factory at Bridgwater. Higher overheads at the premises, difficult trading conditions in the UK and the failure to find a buyer for the vacated Basingstoke premises had all held back profitability, he said. However, he was confident that in time the benefits of the move would show through. Turnover improved to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 14.9m). Although cash balances had continued to grow lower interest rates had held back net interest received to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 619,000). Mr Buckley added that the company continued to seek opportunities to expand the business. An increased final dividend of 12.5p (12p) is recommended for a 17p (16.5p) total, payable from earnings of 34p (23p) per share. 1992.

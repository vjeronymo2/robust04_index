			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Spirin] </F>   [Text] Beijing March 21 TASS -- Secretary-General of the  Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) Dr. Subroto  appealed to Russia to help OPEC stabilize prices on the world  market.    "If we announce that we are going to cut our oil exports,  and  if Russia demonstrates her desire to participate in that action,  then she should, of course, do the same", Subroto told ITAR-TASS  in an interview.    "Or else there is no sense in cooperation, really, it would  simply be harmful", Subroto continued, commenting on the  information released by the Moscow-based World Energy Market  Analytic and Forecasting Group (WEMAFG), headed by a famous  Russian expert, Professor Yevgeniy Khartukov.    Despite the decline in oil production in Russia, she  continues to annually increase the amount of "black gold"  exported beyond the limits of the former socialist bloc,  declared Khartukov, who also teaches in the Moscow State  Institute of International Relations and holds a senior post in  the American East-West Center (based in Honolulu). While the  Russian Federation daily exported an average of 1.81 million  barrels of oil beyond the Soviet Union in 1991, the  corresponding figure for 1993 was 2.29 [as received] barrels.    The price of oil is hovering around an all-time low since  OPEC was created, about 13 to 15 U.S. dollars per barrel,  compared to 28 dollars a barrel just ten years ago.    According to Subroto, representatives of the OPEC member  countries intend to meet in Geneva on March 25 to discuss a five  per cent lowering of export quotas for their respective  governments. If they agree to take this step, then the same  suggestion will be made to Russia and other large oil producers.    "We alone cannot continually lower our exports" the  secretary- general explained. "This 'cheating', by which some  countries make profits off of OPEC policies but do not support  the organisation on the world market, cannot continue forever",  he declared.    Subroto, who was taking part in an international forum on  attracting foreign investment into the development of China's  oil resources, which was held in the Beijing hotel "China  World", also reported that OPEC countries produce a combined  24.52 million barrels of oil every day. Russia, whose  representatives have repeatedly expressed their desire to  cooperate with OPEC in coordinating their policies on the world  market, produces about 3.5 times less than that.    "If we want to improve the price situation, let's work  together, through the combined efforts of OPEC, Russia, and  other major oil producers, including China", the OPEC  secretary-general said.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Today's Assignment sounds like a vivid example of the hypocrisy involved in negotiations aimed at achieving a more united Europe. Everybody believes in co-operation until their own interests are directly affected. We are told that Europe is currently divided over bananas: Germany wants a free market with low prices, but Britain, supposedly the great champion of free markets, is keen to protect its old colonial suppliers. Julian Pettifer reports from the banana republics on the effects of the world's big economies (7.45 BBC2). In the era of the big battalions it is good to know that, in wildlife programmes at least, some one-man bands still succeed. Secret Nature which tonight investigates the creatures inhabiting the freshwater world of Slapton Ley in Devon, is produced, photographed, and narrated by Andrew Cooper (8.30 BBC2). Without Walls follows Kazuko Hohki and her Tottenham pop cabaret group Frank Chickens back to Japan where Kazuko decides to get married (9.00). Stay up till 12.30 and you can watch the opening race in Nigel Mansell's Indy Car 93 season (ITV).</p>

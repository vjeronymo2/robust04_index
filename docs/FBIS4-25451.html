			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Link theory with  practice in studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    That was the message stressed by Chinese President Jiang  Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, when he had  a discussion with cadets of the National Defence University here  on Wednesday [8 June].    Jiang told the cadets to use the theory in the study of  current issues.    Also taking part in the discussion were vice-chairmen of the  commission Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, and commission members.    Summing up the discussion, Jiang pointed out that the main  tasks for the whole party and the whole nation are to seize the  opportunity to expand the reform, enlarge the opening-up to the  outside world and promote development while maintaining  stability. In studying Deng's theory, one should link it to  these tasks.    Jiang called on senior military leaders to take a leading  role in carrying out the orders of the Party Central Committee,  the State Council and the Military Commission.</p>

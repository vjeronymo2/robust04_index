Residents who live near it have gathered more than 250 signatures  protesting its use.  </P> <P> Remembering when it housed a full-service welfare office in the early 1980s,  Grace Randall, who lives across the street, said, "Last time that thing was  there we had dirty diapers and beer bottles everywhere. Who's going to pick  those up?"  </P></p>

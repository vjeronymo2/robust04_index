			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE September Contract on the FT-SE recovered from early weakness that followed a selling order by a large institution and moved ahead to end strongly, writes Joel Kibazo. The first deal in the FT-SE contract for September delivery was struck at 2,492, leading some dealers to forecast a strong move forward. But that positive mood evaporated when Salomon Brothers sold around 500 contracts, with part of the order said to have been executed through James Capel. With independent traders joining in the selling, the contract fell to 2,485. The completion of the Salomon's order coupled with independent traders caught short led to a turnaround, helped by a rally in the gilts market. In the afternoon, the firmness on Wall Street led to further buying, pushing September higher to reach the session's high point of 2,523 just ahead of the official market close. September closed at 2,521, up 17 on the previous session but around 2 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Traded options saw an improvement in volume, the day's total reaching 31,998 lots. The FT-SE contract accounted for 9,429 of the overall total. Hillsdown was the busiest stock option, trading 2,800 lots, and was followed by Forte.</p>

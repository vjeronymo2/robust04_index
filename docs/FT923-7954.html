			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Japanese exposure hits F&amp;C value AN UNSUCCESSFUL foray into the Japanese market hit net asset performance at Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust in the first half of 1992. Net asset value per share at the UK's largest investment trust fell 1.7 per cent to 181.4p in the six months. Over the same period the FT-A All-Share Index rose 2.4 per cent. In the period Foreign &amp; Colonial withdrew money from equity and fixed interest markets in the UK, US and Europe in order to commit funds to Japan and Latin America. However, the Japanese Topix index dropped by 29.9 per cent over the period. Mr Michael Hart, joint manager, said he was still looking for value in Japan. 'When the tide turns and sentiment improves,' he said, 'the market could race away.' However, he was nervous about the high ratings demanded by US equities and the high dollar earnings content of some European companies. In the UK market he hoped for some recovery with the FT-SE 100 Index perhaps bouncing back to 2,500 by the end of the year. At the end of June, the trust's asset mix was (in percentages): UK 43.9; Europe 16.9; North America 25.1; Japan 8.6; Far East 3.7; and Latin America 1.8. Revenue was boosted by bond profits and the total reached Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 25.8m), with earnings coming out at 2.31p per share (2.19p). The interim dividend is increased to 1.12p (1.07p) and the total is forecast at 3.35p (3.19p). COMMENT It is very much in Foreign &amp; Colonial's nature to under perform in bear markets. Its philosophy is to gear up when share prices are depressed in order to benefit doubly when they rise again. Obviously it was premature in wading into the Japanese market but its bottom-fishing strategy has been so successful in the past - this year should see the 22nd consecutive rise in annual dividends - that it seems more than likely it will work again. With the number of shareholders - now 53,330 - steadily increasing, the discount to net asset value does not look excessive at about 10 per cent. The trust still seems one of the best ways for the private investor to have a stake in world equity markets.</p>

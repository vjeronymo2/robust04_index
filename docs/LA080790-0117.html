			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT BY MRS. BUCKEY DISMISSED  </P> <P> A federal judge Monday dismissed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit that Peggy  McMartin Buckey filed against the county, the city of Manhattan Beach and  others immediately after her acquittal on molestation charges in the McMartin  Pre-School case earlier this year.  </P> <P> The suit alleged a violation of Buckey's civil rights, but U.S. District Judge  Richard A. Gadbois Jr., in dismissing the case, said such a claim was "just not  going to fly."  </P> <P> The suit, which also alleged malicious prosecution, conspiracy and defamation,  sought general damages of $1 million plus additional damages on each count.  </P> <P> "I don't know how you can say these criminal proceedings were without probable  cause when there was an 18-month preliminary hearing," Gadbois said in a  hearing Monday. Buckey was acquitted earlier this year after a lengthy trial.  The judge said he sympathized with Buckey's being upset over her long court  ordeal, but "being very, very upset does not state a cause of action."  </P> <P> After the hearing, assistant county counsel Robert Ambrose, who said he was  pleased with the judge's ruling, added that the U.S. Supreme Court has made it  clear that just because someone is found not guilty does not give her the right  to file suit alleging violation of civil rights. Otherwise, he added, the fear  of liability would impede prosecutors from proceeding.  </P> <P> William Waysman, the attorney representing Peggy McMartin Buckey, admitted that  civil cases like the one she is pressing are "an uphill battle all the way."  But Waysman said that, if any case proved the exception to the rule, it would  be this one. He added that it is "likely" Buckey will appeal Gadbois' decision  on the civil rights issue and will refile in state court a lawsuit based on the  other allegations.  </P> <P> Other defendants named in the lawsuit were former Dist. Atty. Robert  Philibosian, Children's Institute International (the child-abuse study center  where children were interviewed), social worker Kee MacFarlane, former  television reporter Wayne Satz and his employer, Capital Cities/ABC Inc.  </P> <P> Buckey, 63, and her son, Ray Buckey, were acquitted in January of 52  molestation charges involving the McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. After  a retrial that ended last week with a deadlocked jury, eight molestation  charges against Ray Buckey were dismissed. He immediately filed a civil rights  suit in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> Several other McMartin defendants, have filed civil suits in state court. While  these cases have also been dismissed, some have been reinstated by appeals  courts and others are pending appeal.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $1.5-BILLION BOND ISSUE PROPOSED FOR RAILWAY PROJECTS  </P> <P> Likening the United States to a Third World country in its development of rail  transit services, key legislators proposed a $1.5-billion bond issue Tuesday to  finance an array of commuter and intercity rail projects in California.  </P> <P> Led by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), the lawmakers said the state is in  such urgent need of a variety of solutions to its mammoth traffic problems that  they will introduce a bill in the next few weeks that will place the general  obligation bond issue on the June, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> In an effort to attract widespread support for the measure, Costa said it would  specify the projects that would be eligible for funds. Among the projects, he  said, would be an expansion of the Orange County-Los Angeles lines and creation  of new commuter services between San Bernardino and Los Angeles, between San  Bernardino-Riverside and Orange County, and along the congested Ventura-San  Fernando Valley-Los Angeles corridor.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) said he envisions the bond money being used for  expanded commuter service along the Southern Pacific main line from Simi Valley  to Union Station in Los Angeles, with stops in Chatsworth, Panorama City,  Burbank and Glendale. Amtrak already runs intercity trains along the line.  </P> <P> "That will allow commuter service at rush hour between Chatsworth and downtown  Los Angeles in less than 30 minutes and between Van Nuys and downtown Los  Angeles in less than 20 minutes," he said.  </P> <P> Costa said intercity projects would include extensive upgrading of facilities  to provide hourly service between Los Angeles and San Diego and expanded  service between the Bay Area and Sacramento and through the San Joaquin Valley.  </P> <P> The measure, which would be called the Clean Air and Transportation Improvement  Act of 1990, would distribute the $1.5 billion to passenger rail capital  projects throughout the state on a population basis. Before any funds could be  allocated by the state Transportation Commission, local transit agencies would  have to present plans identifying all funding sources for projects and  demonstrating their ability to cover operating expenses.  </P> <P> The bonds and interest would be repaid from state tax dollars over a 20-year  period. Funds could be used for, among other things, the purchase of rail cars  and locomotives, acquisition of rights of way, improvements to track, stations  and grade crossings and construction of stations.  </P></p>

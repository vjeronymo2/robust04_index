			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Tokyo bids farewell to the barriers - The Industrial Bank of Japan celebrating broking reforms Japanese financial institutions were generally unmoved yesterday by the formal start of reforms that will slowly dismantle the barriers between brokers and bankers. At the Industrial Bank of Japan, however, the reaction was altogether much more positive as it prepared to set up a new subsidiary, likely to be known as IBJ Securities. Having underwritten the first batch of Manchurian Railway Bonds in 1907, IBJ has always seen itself as more than a bank, but financial laws were rewritten after the Second World War, strictly limiting its role. IBJ applauds the 1993 reforms partly for what they offer in the future, but also because they restore the identity of the distant past. Mr Susumu Takanohara, IBJ managing director, said that the introduction of the Financial System Reform Act, which became law yesterday, gave the bank 'bright hopes' amid the gloom of financial market turmoil. It also helped the bank to overcome a few embarrassing incidents from the late 1980s, the so-called bubble era, when it cultivated customers, including a famed stock speculator in Osaka, outside its normal range of industrial contacts. 'We have been looking forward to this moment for a long time. We really are very optimistic about our chances,' Mr Takanohara said. He expects IBJ's experience in the Euromarkets and its traditional links to two medium-sized brokers, Wako Securities and New Japan Securities, to give it an advantage in developing its own domestic operations. IBJ has yet to receive formal approval from the finance ministry for its new subsidiary, but the bank is reported to be planning to capitalise IBJ Securities at Y30bn (Dollars 259m) and to provide about 120 staff. The numbers are far larger than the country's two other long-term credit banks, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank, which are also permitted to establish new subsidiaries. LTCB said that the banks wanted access to the stock market, but the ministry had only provided initial permission to underwrite and to deal in bonds. For the indefinite future, they will not be able to handle stocks or to deal in equity-linked bonds, although they will be able to underwrite these issues. 'Our original aim was to have a full menu of services for our customers, and issuing stocks would have been an important service,' LTCB said. The finance ministry has indicated that the restrictions will be reviewed after 'two to three years,' although it has not guaranteed they will be significantly eased. Next year, leading commercial banks are supposed to be granted the same, limited rights to open a securities subsidiary. Tighter than expected restrictions were imposed on the banks at the request of the securities industry, bruised by the collapse of stock prices during the past three years. The Nikkei average, which measures Tokyo stock prices, has recovered during the course of the past three weeks, but most of the 14 largest brokers will report a loss for the fiscal year just ended. Under the new law, brokers are allowed into the trust banking business, and the Big Four houses, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities, have plans for new subsidiaries. Smaller brokers are unlikely to have the resources to expand. Most have recently announced restructuring plans to trim their operations, and trust banking is unlikely to bring quick profits. The Big Four will be limited in their trust banking businesses. They will have access to investment trusts, but not to special large-lot securities trusts, so called tokkin funds, and special loan trusts in which public funds are invested, effectively protecting the territory of the existing trust banks. It is an important principle of reform that a balance be maintained between new opportunities and old players. Nikko, planning a subsidiary capitalised at about Y20bn and with 50 employees, is 'not very optimistic'. It expects the banking industry to gain more from reform: 'The underwriting market will become very tough. We will have to improve product development, and know-how. We can see the market expanding, so there will be more opportunities, but also very severe competition.' The brokers' biggest concern is IBJ, which has links to a majority of companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo exchange. Additional competition will come from Norinchukin, the central agriculture bank, handling funds from farmers and fishermen around the country. It plans to open a securities company with a capital of about Y20bn and 40 employees, increasing to 70 or so after two years. 'We would like to do everything we are allowed to do, such as underwriting, dealing and sales of bonds,' Norinchukin said. The bank too, like IBJ, wants to leave the bubble era behind, as it funded the ailing Nippon Housing Loan, a home loan company turned property speculator. Norinchukin has accepted an interest rate cut from 6 to 4.5 per cent on its estimated exposure of Y157.9bn. Bruises from the bubble era have limited the aspirations of Nippon Credit Bank, the third long-term credit bank. It is overhauling three finance affiliates whose bad loans are running at about 20 per cent of total lending. The bank is entangled in the latest Tokyo political scandal. It has modest plans for a new subsidiary with capital of about Y2bn and about 10 employees.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Iraq arms sales 'did not have high priority' The senior government official responsible for Britain's export controls before the Gulf war admitted yesterday that at the time he was more concerned with the antiques trade than equipment used to build up Iraq's military regime. Asked at the Scott inquiry on arms to Iraq why he had not spent more time on the day-to-day running of the department Mr Eric Beston, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's export control branch from 1985 to 1990, said he had greater priorities than exports to Iraq. Much more of his time was spent on antiques and heritage issues involving 'large expensive things owned by rich and powerful people'. He said: 'Throughout this period there were what, at the time, seemed much bigger issues.' While maintaining that in some cases his view had not changed, he said that if he had had any indication 'that events in Iraq were going to move in the way that they did or that the Warsaw Pact was going to collapse, I might have had a different set of priorities'. Earlier the hearing was told that officials who could have intervened to stop machine-tool exports to Iraq were barred from seeing vital intelligence material because of delays in security vetting. In one case, according to Mr Beston, it took seven months to carry out positive vetting on a senior officer. Asked why he had not seen intelligence documents outlining the munitions use of three proposed machine-tool exports for Iraq, although he had security clearance, Mr Beston said: 'I cannot account for it.' Mr Beston was unable to shed light on a central area of the inquiry - why the DTI did not act on MI6 intelligence sent out in November 1987 identifying the military uses of proposed machine tool exports to Iraq. Just who saw the report and when it arrived at the DTI has been a focus of the inquiry because, at the time the intelligence was compiled, the DTI had not committed itself to approving a series of machine-tool export licence applications for Iraq. The hearing was told at a previous session that a copy sent to the Foreign Office was locked in a cupboard over Christmas. Mr Beston said not all of his officials would have been able to see the report. He said one senior officer, Mr Tony Steadman, would not have had access since his positive vetting was not completed until January 1988 - he joined the department in May 1987.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China hopeful of slump reversal after tariff pact China has expressed hope that a recent tariff pact with six central Asian neighbours will reverse a sharp slump in traffic on the Eurasian Railway, a fledgling rival to Russia's Trans-Siberian route, Reuter reports from Beijing. 'We would like to open up this railroad,' Mr Ying Yue from the Chinese Railways Ministry said. 'It would benefit our foreign trade and economic development as well as that of the other countries. The more railways we can open the better.' China completed the high-potential intercontinental rail link when it opened Alataw Pass into Kazakhstan in 1990, creating a second land link between the Pacific and Atlantic. Promoters hope a second 'Eurasian Land Bridge' mimicking the Silk Road will provide a cheaper, more direct and more efficient alternative to the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Trans-Siberian carries the bulk of transcontinental traffic, but is curtailed by harsh Arctic weather in winter and limited capacity all year-round. Its remote northern route is also of little use for central Asia's economic development.</p>

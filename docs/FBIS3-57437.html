			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin before </F> his departure for Orel by correspondent Natalya Chernyshova at  Moscow Airport on 24 January; from the "Novosti" newscast --  recorded]    [Text] [Chernyshova] [passage indistinct] Yegor Gaydar's  departure and Boris Fedorov's ongoing resignation have caused a  wave of criticism aimed at the prime minister. The majority of  journalists give the most pessimistic forecasts, while  newspapers are full of rhetoric questions to Viktor  Chernomyrdin. Today, a group of correspondents managed to ask  the prime minister these questions personally before he left for  Orel.    Viktor Stepanovich, what is your view of the fact that  virtually all the media are predicting that the new government  you have formed will fail?    [Chernomyrdin] Well, of course I am surprised by this. It  seems to be part of your nature or something. We have not even  started, but we are being buried before we are born. My view of  this attitude is skeptical. Once again I am simply astonished.  This talk is not inspiring, it is not about how work should be  done or what should be done but, instead, it is a call to  destroy everything outright. I do not accept this. It is not a  very constructive start if someone believes that it is a start.  We are starting the new year of 1994, which is quite difficult  and complex. We will discuss the initial difficulties in Orel  now, I believe. We are getting ready for a major meeting of the  Council of Ministers attended by all the regional leaders, which  is a very serious thing. For the first time in our country, a  presidential message is being prepared -- we are preparing the  economic part and I am preparing all the other areas. So I do  not see here...[sentence incomplete as received]    [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, in connection with this,  do  you have differences with the president or do you fully share  each other's positions or programs as before?    [Chernomyrdin] This is the second question. This has been  especially noticeable in the media of late, which, openly or by  hints, imply that we have some kind of differences on many  things, from candidates [for posts], to other matters. This is  not the case! We did not and do not have any differences, and I  believe that we will not have them. I am not shifting my  problems onto the president, this is not my style, I have never  done that and will never do. But I must say that, as always,  the president was aware of the principal guidelines, as he  should be. Regarding fundamental approaches, we agree them, we  discuss, examine, and determine all of them a good deal -- this  was and is the case and, I think, will be for as long as we work  together.    [Chernyshova] Did you see the president today?    [Chernomyrdin] I did, I met him today. Incidentally, today,  that is, yesterday, as a matter of fact, we completed the budget  for the first quarter and today I showed it to the president,  and we discussed all the approaches to the budget for the first  quarter once again.    [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, everybody is trying to  guess the program you are going to use, in addition to the  monetarist program. There have been many assumptions.    [Chernomyrdin, laughing] This, too, is from the realm of  improvization, to say that Chernomyrdin is giving up monetarist  approaches as of the New Year. I have not retreated in  anything. Our policy is truly tough. Incidentally, in no way  will this tough policy be slackened and nobody should count on  this. But today we should produce, today we should say that  there has been enough of spreading things around, today we  should gather things together. We have completely neglected  agreements between the government and trade unions, producers in  relation to fixing prices for production equipment, or fixing  wages for a certain period.    This is very important. This is not a monetarist approach.  There are many methods and ways today that should promote  improvement. Interestingly, about debts, this is very  interesting too, we will pay them back, we will pay them back.  First of all, we should repay what we have taken. Strange  people, indeed! We eat, we have taken bread and butter, but  when it comes to repaying the debts an argument starts suddenly  as to whether we should repay them or not. They must be repaid!  What the government has taken for state orders, for federal  needs from farmers, agrarians, must be repaid. And not only  this, but all this should be done in a sensible way, within  reasonable limits. This mechanism, this correlation should be  maintained but within reasonable limits, since both things are  bad, we are blamed for both things. Injections and subsidies  lead to an explosion. This will not happen. At the same time,  we cannot refrain from giving, for we will bring everything to a  halt, something even worse, and an even greater outburst will  follow.    The program adopted on 6 August was adopted by the  government under the president's leadership, it was approved.  It was adopted at a Council of Ministers meeting with a large  number of participants and attended by all regional leaders. It  was developed collectively. Nobody changed it, and Gaydar's  arrival in September did not signify any alteration to this  program at all. He accepted it because he agreed with it. What  Russia's Choice offered in its election campaign was the  precisely the government's program. So what are we talking  about? Gaydar did not add anything, we all worked as one, I can  say it straight, and he cannot deny this. So why this panic?  What has happened? Why is everybody going mad? Do not worry,  we did not retreat and we will not. We did not indulge and we  will not. Everything will be calculated and geared only toward  the plan and the programs that have been determined. Will there  be alterations? Naturally, there will be, it is impossible  otherwise. Thank God, we do not have such [programs] today that  can be adopted for five years and that is that. We have had  enough of five-year plans!    [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, here is my last question.  Stanislav Shushkevich told me in an interview that he expected  to see you in Belarus late this month. Have your plans changed?    [Chernomyrdin] They have, but only in the sense that there  is  not enough time, and we have not done everything yet in order to  sign documents with Belarus. This visit will take place by all  means. We are preparing for it, and the ballyhoo that has been  raised partly in Belarus around our relations, between Russia  and Belarus, is absolutely out of place. It is harmful, in my  view. Some people wish to divide us even further but this will  not happen. We will do everything possible, both with Belarus,  Kazakhstan, and others. A document on creating an economic  union has been signed. We are not retreating from anything!  What kind of people are we? Why is it that every possibility is  being used to accuse us of doing one thing while forgetting  another? Nothing has been done at the expense of Russia or the  Russians ever, the same way as we do not reckon to live at the  expense of the Belarusians, Kazakhs, Ukrainians. This was never  the case, it is not, and will not be! I care least of all today  about the political coloring. I care about practical deeds and  results today, the way we live and are going to live.    Therefore, I will listen to people, I will consult with  them,  and I will accept proposals from anyone who wishes to do good  for Russia and Russians. And I would like to say again: Some  people just cannot help croaking -- everything will now be  squandered, trouble is coming! No way! We will not get far  with complaining and whining!    [Chernyshova] Thank you.    [Chernomyrdin] Thank you.</p>

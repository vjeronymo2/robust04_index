			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Management: Research round-up on quality and stress The use of counselling in UK companies is more widespread even than in the US, claims a survey published by the TDA Consulting Group of London. Based on face-to-face interviews and 285 responses to a questionnaire sent to human resources directors at the top 1,000 UK public- and private-sector employers, the study suggests that 86 per cent of UK organisations, covering 80 per cent of the workforce, provide some form of counselling. Research in the US between 1984 and 1992 shows that only 80 per cent of organisations with 500 or more employees had employee assistance programmes. Ninety-nine per cent of UK organisations, meanwhile, said that they had recently undergone significant changes in structure which have had an effect on the morale of their employees. More than 50 per cent of human resources directors cited change management and employee stress as the main issues they seek to address through counselling. Very few organisations see counselling as a 'perk', most expecting bottom-line benefits such as reduced absenteeism. The international quality standard ISO 9000 has had a mixed press. But a survey of organisations in the service sector, carried out by BDO Consulting, carries a more positive message. Seventy-five per cent of the near 300 respondents felt that the advantages of ISO 9000 outweigh the costs. Improved consistency and efficiency head the list of internal benefits, with improved quality of service, less waste, better client retention and additional business also mentioned. More than half of the respondents were implementing quality initiatives beyond ISO 9000, such as total quality management. Two thirds of respondents noted improved staff performance, while a little over half had seen an improved attitude to customers. However, only 45 per cent felt that staff motivation had improved.</p>

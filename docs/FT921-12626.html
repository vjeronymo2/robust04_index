			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar hit by intervention fears THE DOLLAR strengthened yesterday on the foreign exchange markets until fears of central bank intervention ahead of this weekend's Group of Seven meeting caused late selling, writes Simon London. It retained a firm tone through Far Eastern and European trading, although fears of central bank intervention capped any potential rise. The dollar closed at Y123.85 and DM1.6065 on Thursday in New York, having rallied from European closing levels. Overnight in Tokyo, the firm tone continued, with the US currency breaking through resistance at Y124.45, which had marked the high point in New York. Analysts said the dollar had been helped against the yen by another bout of weakness on the Tokyo stock market, which dented confidence in the Japanese currency. The Nikkei stock market index closed down 500 points on the day. By the close in Tokyo, the US currency stood at Y124.57. Against the D-Mark it was slightly weaker, closing at DM1.6105, just below the position in New York. From early highs, the US currency drifted off slightly in European trading but maintained a basically firm tone. The dollar peaked at DM1.6140 and Y124.65 early in the session, but drifted sideways for most of the day in the absence of economic data or policy statements to drive trading. However, in late afternoon in London, rumours that the US authorities were preparing to intervene to cap the dollar against the D-Mark caused a rapid sell-off. The dollar fell to DM1.5750, from around DM1.61 before the rumours were circulated, before finding support. As with other recent bouts of dollar volatility, the decline was accelerated as stop-loss trading orders were triggered. Against the yen the decline was less dramatic. The US currency fell to Y123.10 from around Y124. By the close in London there had been no intervention and the US currency had recovered some of the lost ground. At the finish the dollar stood at DM1.5875, from DM1.5950 on Thursday; Y123.30 from Y123.8; and Pounds 1.8055 from Pounds 1.7960. Within the European monetary system, the D-Mark gained ground during the morning, reversing the recent trend. However, the slight rally was not carried through and the German currency fell back in the afternoon. Analysts said concerns over industrial action in several sectors of the German economy , - particularly steel and banking - continued to undermine confidence in the D-Mark. Sterling was slightly softer as the D-Mark gained but remained comfortably within its permitted range. The UK currency closed unchanged at DM2.8650.</p>

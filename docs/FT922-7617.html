			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: Partnership no help to schools Sir, The 'partnership' between business and education that the government is encouraging is well illustrated by the current initiative being promoted by a well-known supermarket. For Pounds 25 spent, you will earn a voucher which can be given to your local school towards free computer equipment, which the supermarket is offering: 300 vouchers will give you one piece of software; 300 vouchers means you have to spend Pounds 7,500. In my inner London primary school, we have collected 121 vouchers. Or, to put it another way, the children and their parents have spent Pounds 3,025 for half a computer programme. To get a whole programme they will have to spend another Pounds 4,475 by the end of next week. The offer was due to close next week; but we are now told that it has been extended until the end of the month, by 'popular demand'. The children's expectations have been raised unrealistically. Family tensions have risen as shopping habits have been changed for the good of the school. And we have no chance of being able to collect another 179 vouchers. The partnership appears to be loaded, not, however, to the benefit of the schools. Next time we need some software, we'll go for a partnership with parents and friends and leave 'business' out of it.

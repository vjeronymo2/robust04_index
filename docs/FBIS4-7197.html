			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed Science  and Technology Agency Chief Mikio Omi is known to have  interpellated 488 times at the Diet, the largest number among  all lawmakers. The record number of interpellators came from  his belief that legislators should be spokespersons for the  people.    Omi, 58, is a House of Representatives legislator of Komeito  [Clean Government Party] backed by the Buddhist group Soka  Gakkai, an influential party in the coalition government. He  succeeded Satsuki Eda of the United Social Democratic Party  (USDP).    Some party members said he is earnest and warmhearted.    Born and brought up in Osaka, Omi has been elected from the  No.3 constituency in Osaka Prefecture nine times since 1967, but  he has not held any conspicuous post in the party.    In 1967, the third Komeito Chairman Yoshikatsu Takeiri, the  forth Chairman Junya Yano and the fifth and current Chairman  Koshiro Ishida were also elected lower house members for the  first time.</p>

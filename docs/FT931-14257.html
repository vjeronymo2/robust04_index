			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (19): Sex equality is not all that it seems - Women will get a growing share of jobs WOMEN are likely to win the bulk of the new jobs expected to be created in the European Community over the next two decades. This may, however, have some double-edged consequences for both national labour markets and for women themselves. It could contribute to the continuing high levels of EC unemployment. One reason EC joblessness has continued at such levels is that about 70 per cent of the new jobs created between the end of 1985 and the end of 1990 went to previously unwaged women, rather than the registered unemployed. This trend appears to be entrenched. The European Commission predicts that previously unwaged women will take up most of the 25m new jobs it expects by 2010. The consequences for women themselves are far from straightforward. Their position in the future EC will depend in large part on whether they are working full or part-time and on the national labour market systems within which they work. Recent research*, as yet unpublished, has found that women's work is polarising, both between different groups of women workers and across the different member states (Data was not available for Italy). The research, which was completed for the European Commission's Network of Experts on the Situation of Women in the Labour Market, says: 'Women's increasing participation in all the labour markets of the EC over the past decade might be expected to indicate increasing convergence in the labour market positions of men and women. Evidence . . . suggests no such expectation is justified.' About 30 per cent of the jobs created between 1985 and 1990 were part-time and EC employers are expected to increase their demand for part-time workers, many of whom are likely to be women, over the next two decades. The research, which is based on an analysis of the most comprehensive labour market data available for EC countries, supports the recent finding by the OECD that 'female part-timers are more restricted to a limited range of low paid, low status jobs than female full-timers'. In all EC countries women part-timers are more likely to work in female-dominated or 'feminised' occupations than full-timers. Part-timers are also more likely to be in lower level jobs than are women full-timers. The researchers warn that overall measures of occupational segregation may, however, mask divergent trends and levels of segregation for full-time women workers, compared with part-timers and between the different EC labour markets. The report says: 'Overall measures of segregation are not necessarily very revealing as the net change reflects the result of two trends pulling in opposite directions: firstly a tendency for women to be increasing their share of professional and higher level jobs, but secondly a tendency for women also to be increasing their concentration of employment in sectors where they were already heavily overrepresented, notably in clerical and some service sectors.' The research reveals that women's status at work varies considerably, even between those member states with similar levels of development and of female participation in the labour market. For example, in the UK female part-timers dominate lower level jobs in catering, whereas in France both full and part-timer of both sexes are more evenly represented in these jobs. Also, in some EC countries and occupations, part-time work is less of a barrier to professional status than in others. In female-dominated professions such as teaching, for example, part-time women workers have a relatively higher share of professional jobs in Germany, Greece and the Netherlands. In contrast, in Denmark, France, Portugal and the UK part-timers generally have a lower share of the professional jobs or have shares only equal to their share of all jobs in the total labour market. The research says: 'This example suggests that within feminised professions, there is considerable scope for variety in the extent to which part-time working is utilised and in some countries part-time work may be just as common in professional areas.' The study appears to undermine the argument that it is necessary for women to work in the lower level part-time jobs to achieve what is sometimes characterised as the main goal - increasing women's participation in the workforce. For example, like Denmark and the UK, the Netherlands has high levels of women working part-time. However, unlike Denmark and the UK, the Netherlands has a relatively low level of total female participation within the paid workforce. The research suggests that this is because the labour market systems of member states will also have an influence on women's occupational segregation into low status jobs within feminised sectors. It says that in some countries the opportunities for part-time working in higher level jobs seem to be greater and therefore the association of part-time work with low skill concentration is reduced. *Occupational Segregation and Part-Time Work: Some Evidence from the European Community.

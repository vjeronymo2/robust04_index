			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Observer: Euro-boyo John Major has tried to make capital of Neil Kinnock's membership of the notoriously long-winded 'boyo' tendency. He claims that the Labour leader's yacking would not go down at all well at European summit meetings. Perhaps he has overlooked that Kinnock has much in common with that successful Euro-politician, Germany's Helmut Kohl. Both are blustering, sentimental, and occasionally impetuous. Neither has a head for detail, and both can be remarkably verbose in a provincial brogue. Each was compared badly to a rival who regularly trounced him in the political arena - Helmut Schmidt and Margaret Thatcher, respec- tively. If Kinnock wins, he will move into 10 Downing Street in his ninth year as party leader. Kohl took over the chancellorship nine years after becoming chairman of the West German Christian Democrats in 1973. The two evidently got on well when they last met in Bonn about 18 months ago. And Kohl and his entourage are moderately impressed by Kinnock's pro-European rhetoric, although the feeling in Bonn is that a change of prime minister would make little difference to Britain's European policies. Admittedly, the German chancellor would prefer his friend John Major to stay in power. But if Kinnock makes it, they could soon be serving leek as well as Kohl's favourite Saumagen (stuffed stomach), at the Bonn chancellery.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 13 Jun -- Mongolia, which advocates a  ban on nuclear weapons testing, condemns the nuclear explosion  conducted by China on the Lobnor test range in the autonomous  province of Xingjiang Uighur on 10 June, an official statement  by a spokesman of the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Relations  says.    This step taken by China, which contradicts international  agreements aimed at reaching a comprehensive ban on nuclear  weapons testing and has a negative effect on this process,  arouses concern and regret, the statement declares.    Mongolia hopes that the PRC will not ignore the peace-loving  efforts of other nuclear powers and will stop its nuclear  testing.</p>

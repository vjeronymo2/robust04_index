			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> WOMAN TAKES STAND AGAINST BULLDOZER  </P> <P> The bright yellow bulldozer was tearing up clumps of bushes and trees in a dry  creek bed as Laguna Canyon resident and activist Marielle Leeds just happened  to pass by.  </P> <P> Angry over the sight, Leeds did not hesitate to move into action. She stood in  front of the earthmover and ordered her mother, Bess, to alert the media.  </P> <P> "I screamed at him (the bulldozer operator) and told him that was enough," said  Leeds, who said she knew there were no permits to grade the 10-acre parcel at  Laguna Canyon and El Toro roads.  </P> <P> "I know what is supposed to go on around here," Leeds said. "He was scooping up  dirt, wrecking the environment. This (site) is a real critical point here. It  is in the middle of the (Laguna) greenbelt."  </P> <P> Although Leeds feared that the bulldozer was a sign that the landowner, the  Laguna Hills-based Rossmoor Liquidating Trust, was planning to build illegally,  City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that was not the case.  </P> <P> Frank said a company representative came to City Hall last month and asked if  the company needed a permit to clear the land of unwanted vegetation.  </P> <P> "I told him that the answer was no," said Frank, who all but forgot about the  conversation until Leeds alerted him Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> In the course of the brush clearing, however, the operator had dug into the  dirt in several places and filled in a portion of a major creek bed that moves  rain water from the canyon to the ocean.  </P> <P> "We assumed that they would use a weed eater or some other method to clear the  site," Frank said. "If you bring in a bulldozer, you are grading the land."  </P> <P> Arriving at the scene, Frank and another city employee surveyed the site and  issued a "stop work order."  </P> <P> Bulldozer operator Leonard Schwendeman was ordered to clear the creek bed of  soil and a city building inspector was stationed at the site to ensure  Schwendeman complied.  </P> <P> Officials from Rossmoor were unavailable for comment. A secretary at the  company's headquarters said that top officials were out of the office for the  day.  </P> <P> Schwendeman said he was shocked that his activities caused such a commotion,  adding that he assumed all permits were in order before he was sent to do the  job.  </P> <P> He said it should have been obvious that he was not grading land in the  environmentally sensitive canyon.  </P> <P> "We were not actually grading," he said. "We would have put in red stakes all  around. We're just taking the brush out."  </P> <P> Schwendeman said he had no idea what Leeds was screaming about as she stood in  front of the wide metal blade and stuck out her arm.  </P> <P> "She scared me," Schwendeman said.

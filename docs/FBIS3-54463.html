			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] News Service: The Islamic Culture, Guidance  and Art Committee of the Majles issued a communique in response  to the hasty response of the Voice and Vision. The text of the  communique is as follows:    Brave and alert people of Iran;    The Islamic Culture, Guidance and Art Committee, with  consideration for the hasty, irrational, and unfair response of  the Voice and Vision to the inquiry and investigation report of  the Majles concerning the Voice and Vision, considers mention of  the following as necessary.    1) After the sacred institution of the leadership of the  regime of the Islamic Republic, the Majles holds the highest  position. The specific interpretations of the late Imam and the  grand leader in expressing the high position of the Majles is  not unknown to anyone. To insult the sacred Majles is to insult  the revered people of Iran and is an unforgivable sin.    2) The Majles is the most important supervisory organization  of the country, and this supervision takes the form of  reminders, questions and inquiry and investigation. Article 76  of the Constitution gives explicit right of inquiry and  investigation in all affairs of the country to the Majles, and  to ignore or discredit it is a clear contradiction of the  explicit text of the Constitution.    3) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee was formed of  committed, concerned, active, and scrutinizing brothers who in  carrying out the duty conferred on them spent a great deal of  time in regular meetings and numerous visits and carried out  this task with utmost care and impartiality, for which the  Islamic Culture, Art and Guidance Committee must express its  appreciation.    4) The statements presented in the report of the Inquiry and  Investigation Committee are based on documents and evidence  obtained from the official sources in the country, including the  Accounting Office and the Voice and Vision itself.    5) Since the Voice and Vision Organization is under the  supervision of the grand leader, as soon as the issue of inquiry  and investigation was raised in the Majles, it was presented to  his honor and this task was carried out with his permission.    6) The original inquiry and investigation report is 500  pages, and in order to be brief and considerate of the Majles'  time, it was summarized in 63 pages. If necessary, the entire  investigation report will be presented.    7) The response of the Voice and Vision contained nonfactual  statements and many problems, with which, if necessary, we will  deal.    8) Unfortunately, the Voice and Vision in its response  questions the honorable members of the Inquiry and Investigation  Committee, especially the revered professor, Mr. Parvaresh,  whose commitment, history of struggle, and distinguished  personality are as bright as the sun. This improper action has  strongly disturbed the scholars, clerics, and various strata of  the Hezbollah nation, especially the martyr-nurturing people of  Esfahan.    9) As the honorable speaker of the Majles stated in his  speech on 23/08/1372 [14 November 1993] in the Majles, it is  necessary to express appreciation for the round-the-clock  activities of the concerned, competent Hezbollah people in the  Voice and Vision and explicitly announce that these dear ones  are by no means addressed by the Inquiry and Investigation  Committee, but the purpose was to show the faces that  essentially are in deep and open conflict with the regime, the  leadership, and the Islamic revolution and who must be  eliminated from the Voice and Vision in order to create the  possibility for the growth and thriving of the committed,  sincere, and concerned forces who believe in the path of the  Imam and the grand leader of the revolution.    10) The broadcast of the next segments of the response of  the  Voice and Vision through this medium was stopped upon the  instruction of the grand leader and this indicates very well his  opinion with regard to the behavior of the Voice and Vision.    11) In conclusion, we sincerely thank the various strata of  the Hezbollah nation who in various forms have expressed their  support for this action by the Majles and have been kind to us  and assure our dear nation that your servants in the sacred  stronghold of the Majles will continue inquiry and investigation  in all cases decisively and with precision and are certain that  preserving and strengthening the supervisory dimension of the  Majles will have a significant effect on reforming and improving  the situation of the executive organizations of the country.

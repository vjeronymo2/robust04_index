			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jerry Robinette, Aerospace Engineer, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, suite 210C, Atlanta, GA 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3810, fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On March 9, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued priority letter airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;06&hyph;09, applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) SC&hyph;20, SC&hyph;200, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, which requires inspection to determine if capacitors that may have an intermittent open circuit condition are installed in magnetos, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable capacitors. That action was prompted by reports that TCM produced and delivered magneto capacitors, Part Number (P/N) 10&hyph;349276, which have the potential for an intermittent open circuit condition that may exist between the internal through-lead and the p-lead stud terminal. The potential open circuit condition was initially discovered during a production engine test run at TCM. Further investigation revealed this problem to be limited to two lot numbers, 93&hyph;40 and 93&hyph;42, approximately 500 capacitors total. To date 241 of the capacitors have been found and taken out of service. These parts were used in magnetos produced at TCM for company use, Textron Lycoming use, after market sales, and for individual capacitors sold as spares to the field after October 27, 1993. These individual replacement parts can be fitted into TCM or Bendix magnetos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A capacitor with the intermittent open circuit condition described can result in a ``hot mag'' (i.e. the magneto is not grounded when the ignition/magneto switch is placed in the off position). The magneto is therefore capable of producing ignition, and if the propeller is moved with some residual fuel left in the cylinders, the engine could start momentarily. This momentary engine start could turn the propeller with enough force to cause injury or death to ground personnel struck by the turning propeller. Capacitors with an intermittent open circuit condition may show no revolutions per minute (RPM) drop-off during the magneto check prior to flight. This condition, if not corrected, could result in possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded magneto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Critical Service Bulletin (CSB) 641, dated February 1, 1994, that describes procedures for determining if magnetos contain capacitors, P/N 10&hyph;349276, that may have an intermittent open circuit condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design, the FAA issued priority letter AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;09 to prevent possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded magneto. The AD requires inspection within 10 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD to determine if affected capacitors are installed in magnetos, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable capacitors. All affected magnetos must be metal stamped with the letter ``E'' to show compliance. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately by individual letters issued on March 9, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of TCM (formerly Bendix) SC&hyph;20, SC&hyph;200, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos installed on but not limited to reciprocating engine powered Beech, Cessna, Maule, Mooney, Piper, and Robinson aircraft. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an amendment to &sect;39.13 of part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to make it effective to all persons. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;12.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

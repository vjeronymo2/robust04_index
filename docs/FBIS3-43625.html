			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The head of state's ultimatum to the Zairian  political class involved in the negotiation process expires  tomorrow at midnight. In response to this message, the  Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] and the coalition of  forces of democratic change -- commonly known as the Allied  Forces of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [FAUSOR] --  met at the People's Palace for the signing of the protocol  agreement. The ceremony was to have taken place this afternoon  at 1600, but it was not until later this evening that the two  parties met at the Banquet Hall and the document has just been  signed. Tumba Matulu, you have just arrived straight from the  People's Palace. Tell us how things went there.    [Matulu] It must be stated, Kabamba Kasongo, that things  went  on smoothly. At 1850, Messrs. Nguz A Karl-I-Bond of the FPC and  (Simba-Wudu Ngwake Duntube) of the FAUSOR signed the protocol  agreement. This document was also initialed by all the  negotiators who were at the People's Palace for the ceremony  which is still going on at the moment. As you know, the first  consequence of the signing of this protocol agreement is the  formation of a national reconciliation government. As was  stated by the head of state, the new government to be formed  will function in line with the spirit and letter of the People's  Palace accords, particularly the special arrangement on the fair  and balanced sharing of power....    [Kasongo, interrupting] Tumba Matulu, without interrupting  you, you are talking of allies who have just signed the protocol  agreement. Now, what has become of Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition [USOR]?    [Matulu] I stress that it was (Simba-Wudu) who signed on  behalf of the FAUSOR. You know we are in a democracy. There  were the FPC and the USOR and Allied Forces. And, while the  USOR did not turn up at the People's Palace the allies on the  other hand were there. You will understand that we are in  democracy. At any rate, since all the reports were also signed  by the two main political groups, it was the majority that  emerged, in spite of USOR's absence this evening. In other  words, this protocol agreement which was laboriously negotiated  by members of the FPC and those of USOR and Allied Forces will  be binding virtually everyone. [passage omitted]    [Kasongo] Apart from the people who normally turned up for  the negotiations, were there some foreign personalities in the  hall today?    [Matulu] I would say no. At any rate, this is how things  will go: As it was stipulated in the protocol agreement that  foreign witnesses -- e.g. the OAU, the UN, Belgium, France, and  the United States, the chairman of the High Council of the  Republic [HCR], and the president of the Republic as he  announced himself -- these personalities will be present at the  second stage. So you understand that a solemn ceremony will now  have to be organized -- this is (?a purely) protocol matter --  for the head of state to also sign the document. [passage  omitted].    [Kasongo] Tumba Matulu, a last question, perhaps. Going by  the president's speech, the idea was that the future prime  minister come from the ranks of the opposition. Now, you have  just said the opposition was absent. I am referring here to  USOR. So does this now mean that the head of government will  come from USOR's allies?    [Matulu] Well, the allies are not in power. They belong to  the opposition. The allies belong to the opposition. It is  good you were with me at the People's Palace. The allies did  not sit on the same side as the FPC. They, indeed, posed a  great deal of problems to the FPC negotiators. Therefore, they  belong to the opposition. They are people fighting against the  government of the day and, to arrive at elections, it was said  that we needed to play down our differences and go through this  transition together, after which we will together take...  [pauses]. The president of the Republic wished that the prime  minister come from the opposition. The allies belong to the  opposition, and they too have a lot of qualified people. If  they agree and put up a highly competent person to the head of  state... [pauses]. First of all, what are the criteria. A  candidate to the post of prime minister must be someone who  brings people together. In other words, he should be a person  on whom there is consensus. Let us assume, for instance, that  this very evening the allies appoint a candidate accepted by the  FPC, you will understand that the head of state will have no  option but to endorse this appointment in line with the spirit  of these accords, and such a man will belong to the opposition.    [Kasongo] And, Tumba Matulu, what do you say is the next  stage?    [Matulu] At the next stage, as I said, this protocol  agreement will have to be signed by the head of state. The HCR  chairman also has to sign it, because that is what the protocol  agreement says. That will be the second stage. So it is a  purely protocol matter and those responsible for organizing it  may provide further information on the matter shortly.</p>

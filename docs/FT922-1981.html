			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / ICI warns that signs of rise in UK demand have petered out IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the British chemicals giant, yesterday warned analysts that signs of an upturn in UK demand during late March and early April had petered out. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer, told analysts during a seminar that the company's caution during the first quarter about prospects for the rest of the year had been justified. ICI's shares closed down 36p at Pounds 12.35. The good few weeks at the end of March and beginning of April had proved to be restocking. There had been no sign of an upturn in April and May, said Mr Hampel. The results of industrial chemical operations were likely to be lower than last year, he warned. Only in the US had there been signs of an upturn and even there it had been weak. 'Any improvements will be the result of self-help,' he said. 'We can only hope rather than expect an economic upturn to help us in the second half of the year.' He said that, by the end of the second quarter, restructuring had led to annualised savings of Pounds 250m. Analysts yesterday downgraded their forecasts explaining that ICI's first half was always stronger than the second. Previous estimates of full-year profits had ranged from about Pounds 900m to Pounds 930m. After downgrading they were between Pounds 830m and Pounds 875m. Some analysts were also preparing downgrades for other bulk chemicals groups. Agrochemicals had also proved disappointing, said Mr Hampel. Wet, cold weather in Europe and the US mid-west had meant second-quarter results would be lower than last year. Concerns in France about the EC's Common Agricultural Policy reforms had led to slower sales. Credit in eastern Europe was also proving a problem. Analysts, who had expected up to 10 per cent growth from agrochemicals, believe the division could make less this year than 1991.</p>

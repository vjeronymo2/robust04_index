			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER &amp; REALITY  </P> <P> "Socially conscious" film maker Michael Moore claims to have had the future and  interests of Flint, Mich., residents in mind when he made "Roger &amp; Me."  However, Moore is nothing greater than a free-wheeling, opportunistic scavenger  who, through clever editing and misleading distortion of facts, holds the  residents and civic leaders of Flint up for derision and humiliation.  </P> <P> Rather than ameliorating the problem or drawing sympathy for his beloved  hometown, Moore's foul sense of humor and highly accessible media profile only  serve to promote and further his own interest in establishing a career as  another Hollywood icon.  </P> <P> KENNETH BANK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

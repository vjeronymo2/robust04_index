			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCA BUYOUT BY JAPANESE  </P> <P> I would not worry about the sale of an American business to Japan.  </P> <P> The U.S. has plenty of foreign ownership all over Europe and elsewhere.  </P> <P> On my recent trip to France, I tried to buy some children's T-shirts with  French writing on them. They were impossible to find but everywhere I found  T-shirts from the U.S. Jeans, grocery products, cosmetics, etc. from America  were available everywhere.  </P> <P> I must admit, they love everything American. Now it is our turn: Can we learn  to love Japanese entertainment?  </P> <P> YVETTE CARR, Glendora  </P></p>

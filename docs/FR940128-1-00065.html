			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that economic adulteration occurs with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient frequency in various seafood products to result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial losses to the consumer. Evidence of such economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulteration usually comes to light indirectly, as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations that are carried out for other purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourteen and one-half percent of the samples of seafoods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported in 1986 as having adverse findings by eight FDA district  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices were so listed because of product misrepresentation (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 123).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, FDA found that in fiscal years 1991 and 1992,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14.8 and 11.7 percent, respectively, of all consumer complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved complaints of economic problems (Ref. 60).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Imported seafood products also are subject to significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of economic misrepresentation. In 1992, approximately 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of all detentions of imported seafood involved some form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of misbranding, such as false or misleading labeling, short fill,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short weight, standard of identity, and omitted labeling (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 124).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific data on species substitution are available from The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL) of NMFS, Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Commerce. Data gathered for the 3-year period of 1990&hyph;1992 by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the laboratory in conducting species verification tests requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by industry show that 59 percent of the samples labeled as cod,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57 percent of the product labeled as haddock, 56 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product labeled as flounder or sole, and 51 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product labeled as red snapper were not the species claimed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the label. While these data cannot be regarded as representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of industry-wide misbranding practices because the testing was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not random, the results indicate a remarkably high incidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species substitution. Moreover, these findings are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with other surveys (Ref. 35, p. 45).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a survey conducted in Florida to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent of retail species substitution in the case of red snapper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found that 64 percent of the fish fillets labeled for retail sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as red snapper were misbranded (Ref. 125). The prevalence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misbranding just this one desirable species is underscored by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observation: ``If all of the red snapper sold in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States were genuine, the seas would long since have been swept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absolutely clean of this species'' (Ref. 126, p. 41).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While most States' regulations follow FDA nomenclature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy and regulations, misbranding practices are exacerbated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the failure of some States to require these common names for some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species sold within the State. Red snapper again provides a case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study in the extent of variation in acceptable nomenclature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed for a species. Although not permitted when sold in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interstate commerce, California regulations allow 12 species of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rockfish to be labeled as ``Pacific red snapper'' within the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, Oregon and Washington regulations also allow rockfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be called ``snapper'' (Ref. 126, p. 305). Moreover, an even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater variety of imported species may be misrepresented as ``red  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snapper.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the ``Hope'' rubric: ``Children </F> Will Hear!'']    [Text] In Russia a brand new unique method for treating  acute deafness in children has been developed. Staff members at  Russia State Medical University have had success with the method  in 67 percent of cases. Throughout the world, the results of  treating this pathology are virtually nil.    Staff members in the Hyperbaric Oxygenation Laboratory (that  is, treatment in baric chambers under elevated or reduced oxygen  pressure) working under the direction of Professor Sergey Baydin  developed their own original method to solve the problem.    In a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Sergey  Baydin emphasized that only acute deafness is cured. In other  words, the treatment is effective only during the first 3 weeks  after the onset of decrease or loss of hearing. To date, in  other cases it has only been possible to halt the process'  development. ``There are many reasons for the development of  deafness in children,'' said Sergey Baydin. ``Included among  them are catarrhal illnesses, nervous stresses after family  rows, and overdoses of drugs (especially antibiotics).''    The treatment is conducted in domestic baric chambers. In  addition to using their new method to treat deafness, the  physicians have learned to use it to manage critical diseases in  neonates. Special chambers have been designed and constructed  for this. In adults, hyperbaric oxygenation has proven effective  against cardiovascular diseases, conditions following myocardial  infarction, stomach and duodenal ulcers, and purulent tissue  lesions. In many cases, treatment in baric chambers makes it  possible to avoid using drugs or keep their use to a minimum.</p>

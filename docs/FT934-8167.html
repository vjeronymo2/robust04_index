			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Disabled to protest at work changes DISABLED PEOPLE will today protest against changes in government programmes that assist them in employment, Lisa Wood writes. They will lobby Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who is at a two-day conference on how Training and Enterprise Councils - which deliver government training programmes in England and Wales - can best assist people with special needs. From next April, the Access to Work scheme will replace the six existing programmes, costing Pounds 14m a year, that help the disabled. The scheme will seek to help more people, but employers will be asked to contribute towards assistance for disabled employees. At present, they receive full government grants to adapt their premises. The government is also proposing to limit the amount of help any individual can receive. The Royal National Institute for the Blind said yesterday it welcomed new flexibilities in Access for Work, but it was concerned that charges being imposed on employers would be a disincentive to the employment of disabled people.</p>

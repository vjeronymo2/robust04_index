			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOBBY MADURO STADIUM: IT'S HOME TO ORIOLES AND NICARAGUAN REFUGEES  </P> <P> Maybe you've seen the pictures of wash hanging from the batting cage at the  ballpark here. There's more wash on the railing that separates the stands from  the field. In fact, most sight lines feature a baseball field framed in wet  clothing. None of which is surprising in this strange city, where nearly  anything is possible, up to and including a combination refugee camp-baseball  stadium.  </P> <P> The sign out front says, "Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, the spring training home  of the Baltimore Orioles." But despite the grounds crew hard at work, none of  the signs inside seems even remotely connected with either the Orioles or  baseball.  </P> <P> Where it says, "No running on ramps," Spanish-speaking youngsters are racing on  skateboards. Where it says, "Grounds crew," you open a door to find the control  center at the heart of a city operation that includes housing and feeding and  care for 400 Nicaraguan refugees and Miami homeless.  </P> <P> That would seem to be job enough, but there is the additional responsibility of  trying to figure out where else to place them.  </P> <P> "This is not the best place for people to be," says Alex Martinez, the  assistant director of Miami's Department of Parks, Recreation and Public  Facilities. "We opened it in December, on a particularly cold night, to the  homeless in the city. And we figured, why not make this a temporary home for  the refugees."  </P> <P> Martinez is a hospitable man, talking to an inquiring reporter when he can and  talking to nearly everyone else, too. At one point, he is speaking into two  phones at once. There is much to do.  </P> <P> "We're going to have everyone out of here by the weekend," he says, before  pausing and adding, with a wry smile, "hopefully."  </P> <P> There is a deadline and, this once, it has nothing to do with the Super Bowl or  with the riots. The refugee problem is business as usual in Miami, except that  now the Orioles need to get the place in shape for spring training, the annual  ritual that begins this season in Miami on March 1, after a few weeks' stay in  Sarasota, Fla.  </P> <P> In the best of times, the stadium would win few awards for aesthetics. And  these are not the best of times.  </P> <P> There's a certain disarray that comes of 400 house guests, beginning with  backed-up plumbing and ending with the makeshift clotheslines. You don't easily  shower where somebody else is keeping his pillow. And somebody's pillow is  likely to be anyplace.  </P> <P> The scene is something like a field hospital might be, except there are no  wounded. Cots are stacked together, with almost no space between them, one for  each man, woman and child. Men are in one section, women and children in  another. And clothing is everywhere. A blue blazer is hanging on a railing. A  young man has stuffed what seem to be all his belongings inside a jacket.  Beside the cots are suitcases and, in some cases, plastic bags stuffed with  clothes. And you don't even want to know about the diapers.  </P> <P> For the Nicaraguans, who are refugees applying for political asylum, the coming  baseball season is a dim reality. And dimmer still is their understanding of  the controversy surrounding their arrival in Miami, where Nicaraguans have come  by the thousands.  </P> <P> Central to the riot that has set parts of their adoptive city ablaze is a  feeling among many blacks that these refugees are the subject of greater  concern and care than the inner-city underclass.  </P> <P> "Why them before us?" asks Fred Lockhart, a student and one of the black  homeless living at the stadium. "Everyone deserves an opportunity, but it  should be an equal opportunity."  </P> <P> Another problem is that Nicaraguans are allowed into the country in large part  because of the Reagan administration's anti-Sandinista stand. Ordinary  refugees, who are turned away from most other countries, seem to become  political refugees when they're from Nicaragua. Because Haitian boat people,  who are mostly black, are routinely turned away, that, too, has sparked  tensions.  </P> <P> Martinez says that people don't realize that the homeless are in the stadium  along with the Nicaraguans. He says he is trying just as hard to place  everyone, but he does admit to a certain responsibility he believes Americans  owe the refugees.  </P> <P> "They can't get jobs because they don't have work permits," he says. "They have  no legal status. Right now, they're in limbo. But if they can't work, how are  they going to survive if someone doesn't take responsibility for them?  </P> <P> "It seems to me, you have two choices: Either send them back where they came  from or allow them to work. Of 400 cases, we have only 50 work permits. People  here are trying to pressure Washington to speed up the process."  </P> <P> And yet, refugees must be a patient lot. The trip here takes weeks and is not  without danger. I talked to one man, Jose Vasquez, who arrived only Wednesday.  He had fled Nicaragua through the mountains to Guatemala, taking his wife and  four children.  </P> <P> In Guatemala, he stopped to work -- "I do anything," he says through a  translator -- to raise money for the rest of the trip, which amounts to a bus  ride through Mexico and an illegal crossing of the Rio Grande. The coyotes, as  those who aid the passage of illegal aliens and refugees are known, led him  across, he and his wife swimming while pulling the children along in inner  tubes.  </P> <P> In Texas, they applied for asylum. And once there, they were wired money for  the one-way bus ticket to Miami. They all want to come to Miami, where there  are Spanish newspapers, Spanish radio stations, Spanish television stations and  a large Latino community. A telethon on the two Spanish stations raised $35,000  to place the new refugees in apartments.  </P> <P> "This is a chance for a new life," Vasquez says, and you are hard-pressed not  to root for him.  </P> <P> "So many people are coming to their assistance," Martinez says. "We are a city  with a big heart."  </P> <P> And a city with big problems. The riots are one, where some in the inner-city  say the big heart is closed to them; the refugees are another. But big problems  are made of small ones. And getting the Nicaraguans out of the baseball park to  make room for the Orioles is one more small headache in the mix.  </P></p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dares launches rights issue to fund expansion Dares Estates has acquired Milelodge, a property company, and various properties for Pounds 23.3m, funded by the issue of 167m new ordinary shares at 4p apiece, the assumption of Pounds 10.7m of debt and Pounds 5.9m cash. To help satisfy the cash element of the acquisition, Dares will raise Pounds 5.54m by way of a rights issue of up to 138.5m new ordinary shares also at 4p, a significant discount to yesterday's close of 9 1/2 p. Shares will be offered to shareholders on a 14-for-5 basis for the ordinary and 28-for-1 for the first convertible preference. The properties being acquired have been professionally valued at Pounds 30.2m. Mr Ervin Landau, chairman, said: 'This scheme revives the company; net asset value will be Pounds 12.4m, gross rental income from the new properties is Pounds 2.8m, and profits will be sheltered by substantial tax losses.' The proposals will enable Dares to benefit from available tax losses of Pounds 19m, capital losses of Pounds 11m, and unrelieved ACT of Pounds 3m. Dares is also to undertake a restructuring involving the hive down of all existing assets and certain of its existing liabilities to Runtrump, a wholly-owned subsidiary, along with the release of Dares from certain guarantees and all floating charges. Upon completion of the acquisitions, Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive of Kwik-Fit Holdings and one of the vendors of Milelodge, will join the Dares board. Dares reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 133,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.62m for the half year to June 30.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Treuhand head administers a painful cure 'NO POLITICIAN in the world could have taken our decisions,' says Mrs Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand agency that three years ago was charged with privatising and restructuring eastern German industry following German unification. The 57-year-old former finance minister of Lower Saxony manages one of the world's largest holding companies, with 13,175 enterprises and 27,000 land and housing titles. The agency has already privatised 8,224 companies, liquidated 2,957, secured job guarantees for 1.48m and got investment commitments exceeding DM181.6bn (Pounds 74bn). But the job has been a messy one. 'We had no tools. No rules. Not even a list of the companies which we were responsible for,' she says. At the same time, with 1.7m or 15.4 per cent of workers unemployed in east Germany, the agency was axing jobs. 'They were so horrified about what happened to them. They thought the Treuhand was res-ponsible for all their grievances in the world,' she said. 'Our bad reputation resulted from our job to reduce their jobs. Whatever we did, whe-ther we privatised, or restructured, or closed down companies, jobs had to be reduced. Nobody in eastern Germany can like us for doing that.' That mission, says Mrs Breuel, in turn allowed the politicians in Bonn to blame, hide behind and use the Treuhand as a scapegoat. 'This was the idea of our job - to have distance between the politicians and the Treuhand enterprises.' The early days did see mistakes, however. 'Maybe it was a mistake that we did not realise earlier that there were too many investors who bought but were only interested in the real estate,' she explains. 'It took us a couple of months to find out. Then we forced them to give some sort of guarantees for jobs and investments. The thinking behind the guarantees - apart from preventing speculators - was to convince east Germans we were working for them, for their enterprises and jobs, and that this was the only chance for the companies to have a future.' The Treuhand is now relying on western German and foreign investors to take up where it has left off to assure that future. 'Our enterprises have really improved their quality. What they need is orders. As soon as they receive orders, they increase their productivity immensely. But the (size of the) orders they receive are linked to the recession. If western German companies do not give orders to eastern German companies, the transfers (which this year will total DM180bn) will have to go on for a long time. They will have to be paid by taxes.' The logic is impeccable. But can orders alone help move eastern Germany towards a self-sustaining economy? 'It depends on how fast the recession ends in western Germany,' she says. But she added that 'mental unification will take longer than economic unification. We have been separated for 40 years. But (the mental unification) is not true for the people living or working here in eastern Germany.' Despite the high levels of unemployment in eastern Germany, it is often surprising that there have been no mass demonstrations, no major strikes, no signs of social unrest. 'What has surprised me most is the people living there,' says Mrs Breuel. 'After all they have been through they are still, to a certain extent, optimistic. They are highly motivated and realistic. They are our greatest asset.'</p>

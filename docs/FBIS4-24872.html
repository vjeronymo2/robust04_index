			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton has pledged to keep more contacts, more business and  more international cooperation with China.    "We must see our relations with China within the broader  context of our interests in the Asian Pacific region, of which  America is an integral part," he said in an article entitled  "Isolating China Wouldn't Improve Human Rights" which was  published on Tuesday's [31 May] "LOS ANGELES TIMES."    Justifying his decision to extend the most-favored-nation  (MFN) trade status to China, Clinton said, "The actions I have  taken on China are in the long-term interests of both the United  States and China."    "Linking human rights to MFN has taken us as far as it can,"  he added.    He also noted that "after ten years of argument and veto, we  no longer had two China policies -- one from the Congress and  one from the President -- but a single American policy."    On future ties with Beijing, the U.S. President said, "We  will have more contacts, more trade, more international  cooperation and more intense and constant dialogue on human  rights issues."    Clinton also praised China's fast developed economy, saying  that a 21st-century economy is taking shape in China, which was  the world's fastest growing economy last year.    China is not only a big market for America-produced goods,  but also a source of more jobs for American people, he added.    China has a veto in the United Nations Security Council and  it is a major factor in Asian and global security, he said in  the article, adding that the U.S. and China share important  interests in some fields.</p>

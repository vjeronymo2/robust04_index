			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Treuhand reprieves potash mine until 1995 THE Treuhand agency for restructuring and privatising eastern German industry has reversed its decision to close a loss-making potash mine, in a move to ensure its radical plan to merge western and eastern Germany's potash sector is implemented, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The decision to reprieve 700 jobs at the Bischofferoder mine in Thuringia follows a two-week hunger strike by 47 employees. The Treuhand and the state government propose that the mine should stay open temporarily to save jobs until 1995. The agency originally envisaged closing Bischofferoder as part of a package to merge Kali + Salz, a BASF subsidiary, with Mitteldeutschen Kali, the east German producer. With the merger, the Treuhand aimed to save the remaining five eastern German mines, and reduce severe overcapacity. As part of its merger plan, the Treuhand has already made two unprecedented moves. First, it proposed the west German sector share the burden in reducing the workforce. The number of jobs at Kali + Salz will be cut by 1,744 to 4,488, and at Mitteldeutschen Kali by 1,884 to 3,012. Second, the Treuhand has taken a 49 per cent stake, worth DM1bn, in the merger, with an option to sell its share after five years.</p>

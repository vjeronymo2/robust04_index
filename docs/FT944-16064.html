			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Clinton facing Bosnia arms ban pressure US senators are stepping up their pressure on the Clinton administration to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia in defiance of the UK, France and Russia, its partners in the 'contact group' that has sought to bring about a peace settlement in Bosnia. The deadline set by the US for the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan proposed by the contact group three months ago will expire today with no sign of a change in their refusal to agree to the proposal, and US officials are working towards a United Nations resolution that responds to this refusal. The UK, along with other countries that have troops at risk inside Bosnia, has let the US know that it would veto any resolution that contained a firm commitment to lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the former Yugoslavia, which they and many senior officials in the US administration believe would only make the war bloodier. But 50 US senators, led by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader, wrote this week to President Bill Clinton to warn him that they still insist on the US proposing an immediate resolution to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia. The Bosnian government last month gave the US some breathing space by asking that implementation of an end to the arms embargo should be delayed for six months, though it still wants the resolution providing for this lifting to be passed immediately. The senators said, 'Some of our allies seem to be deliberately misinterpreting this compromise, describing it as a request to defer any action on the embargo for six months'. 'As supporters of Bosnia's right to self-defence, we believe that any US-sponsored resolution that falls short of the Bosnian government's compromise position - immediate action to lift, but implementation delayed for six months - would not meet your commitment to Congress,' they wrote. If a resolution were too firm and automatic in triggering a lifting of the arms embargo, however, the UK, France and Russia have made it clear to Washington that they would be prepared to use their Security Council vetoes.</p>

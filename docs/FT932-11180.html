			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Espy finds emergency funding for Dollars 700m of food aid for Russia MR MIKE Espy, the US agriculture secretary, juggled his budget over the weekend and found emergency funding that will allow Dollars 700m worth of in food aid to be shipped to Russia. The aid, part of a Dollars 900m food package promised by US President Bill Clinton to Russia at the Vancouver summit meeting, had been stalled by a dispute over freight costs. Mr. Espy, after meeting with a delegation of Russian officials in Washington last week, agreed to pay the freight differential between foreign flag ships and much higher-cost US flag vessels. US law requires that 75 per cent of US food aid be shipped in US registered vessels. The compromise will divert an estimated Dollars 385m from other areas of the US Department of Agriculture's budget and will allow Russia to pay only the world market rates for freight. It will also appease the US maritime unions, which have a strong political base in Washington. As a result, Russia has agreed to take the Dollars 700m in concessionary loans under the Clinton package. Of the total, about Dollars 500m will be used to purchase commodities and the remainder of about Dollars 200m will be used pay for shipping. Russian grain buyers have agreed to purchase Dollars 227.5m worth of US maize, Dollars 105m worth of soyabean meal, Dollars 66.5m worth of butter, Dollars 56m worth of wheat, Dollars 40m worth of vegetable oils, peanuts, poultry, and rice and Dollars 5m worth of sugar. Some Dollars 54.4m worth of the butter and Dollars 12m worth of the wheat requirements will come from donation programmes rather than loans, the USDA said. US commodity traders said yesterday that the amounts of commodities involved in the package had been anticipated in the market and that the news had failed to rally grain prices at the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's biggest agricultural futures market. The traders have already turned their attention to the fields of the Midwest, where new-crop wheat is flourishing and maize plantings, although running behind schedule, are benefitting from a plentiful supply of moisture. Soyabean prices in Chicago were under pressure from rumours of a larger crop in Brazil.</p>

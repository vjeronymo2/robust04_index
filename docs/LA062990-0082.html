			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> EX-SEN. CARPENTER SAYS HE WAS BUGGED  </P> <P> An attorney for Paul Carpenter, who is under indictment from the FBI undercover  investigation of alleged political corruption in the state Capitol, says the  former state senator suspects that his telephone was illegally tapped and that  someone broke into his home in Los Angeles County during the investigation.  Attorney Jerrard Hinckley reported Carpenter's suspicions to U.S. Magistrate  Esther Mix during a federal court hearing on routine pretrial motions.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said they had no knowledge of any such illegalities, but promised  to investigate. Hinckley said Carpenter found his home unlocked and lights on  once about a year ago, and later saw a man working on a telephone pole near his  home. "He was told a neighbor had a phone problem, but he checked . . . and  none had complained of phone problems," Hinckley said. Carpenter, now a member  of the State Board of Equalization, is to go on trial Aug. 13 on felony charges  of extortion, racketeering and conspiracy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> 'DALLAS' TURNS ITS BACK ON DALLAS  </P> <P> For the first time since 1978, the television series "Dallas" will not be  filmed here this summer, a spokesman for Lorimar Productions said today.  </P> <P> "They're not planning to come down at the usual time to shoot the first 12  episodes," David Stapf told reporters. "No decision has been made for the  entire year."  </P> <P> "Dallas," for years one of TV's blockbuster hits, has been sagging in the  ratings the last two years. A Dallas-based film production company estimated  that the city will lose more than $5 million if "Dallas" spurns it for the  entire season.  </P></p>

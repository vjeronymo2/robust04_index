			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the normally required engine certification information and data, the certification application would also be required to include: (1) Rationale for test engine selection, (2) a description of all actions necessary to bring an in-use engine to the configuration being certified, including a description of parts being replaced, (3) a description of any emissions related components not being replaced and rationale as to why their replacement is unnecessary, (4) a copy of all installation instructions and warranty, and (5) a copy of the engine label and useful life renewal certificate to be provided to the engine owner. EPA requests comments on these certification procedures and the items that are being required to be provided for certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Recall testing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to apply the enhanced recall program for the light-duty enhanced vehicles, described in detail in section A.(5) of this appendix, and heavy-duty vehicles as described in more detail below. At the time an engine is restored to a certified configuration, the certifier, for purposes of this program, becomes the engine manufacturer for purposes of determining responsibility for the in-use emissions performance of the engine. The certifier may elect to have outside agents conduct installations. However, EPA proposes to hold the certifier solely liable for any failure of an engine to meet the enhanced HDE in-use standards during the useful life renewal period. EPA would have the authority to enforce in-use standards over the useful life renewal period by performing recall testing on engines within their useful life renewal period in the same manner that EPA would for engines still within the original useful life. EPA requests comments on the above approach for assessing liability for the emissions performance of rebuilt engines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned above, EPA proposes to conduct recall testing throughout the operating life of engines. EPA believes that this is the most appropriate way to ensure that engines are meeting the enhanced HDE in-use standards. For recall testing after the end of the original useful life, EPA will group engines by the certified configuration. Any subsequent recall orders will hold the certifier of that engine configuration responsible for failure to comply with applicable emissions standards. Remedial actions would be solely the responsibility of the certifier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that the high cost of engine testing may present an impediment to enforcement of these rebuild requirements through recall testing alone. EPA requests comments on additional methods of enforcing the above rebuild provisions which may or may not include actual emissions testing. Additionally, EPA requests comments on all aspects of the enhanced recall provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in Section III.D.2.c. of the Preamble, covering the enhanced &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; I/M program, EPA is proposing to include pre-1999 model year heavy-duty vehicles of GVWR 8,500&hyph;19,500 pounds in the enhanced I/M program. Furthermore, as discussed in Section A(4) covering the enhanced vehicle I/M program for new light-duty vehicles, EPA is proposing to include new heavy-duty vehicles of GVWR 8,500&hyph;14,000 pounds in the LDV/LDT enhanced vehicle program for 1999 and later model years, including I/M. EPA also requests comment on the desirability and feasibility of extending the enhanced I/M and enhanced vehicle I/M programs to other heavy-duty vehicles, particularly those in the weight classes up to 26,000 pounds GVWR (or any portion thereof). If this were done, the need to require these vehicles to be evaporative emission free, as discussed in Section B(3), and the need for these vehicles to be rebuilt, as discussed in Section B(4), could be reconsidered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering this issue, commenters should refer to the detailed discussion of enhanced light-duty vehicle inspection and maintenance program requirements which would be applicable to these heavier vehicles as well except as noted below. These requirements address such issues as geographic scope, testing, enhanced I/M threshold, manufacturer liability, tracking of enhanced I/M test results, threshold calculation, data collection, and manufacturer notification of liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, EPA would like to note several issues for which an enhanced &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;I/M program for heavy-duty vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR would differ from the light-duty vehicle and light-duty truck program. First, the regulatory useful life for heavy-duty vehicles is 110,000 miles, 185,000 miles, or 290,000 miles, depending on the vehicle class. Therefore, in a manner similar to that described for the light-duty vehicle I/M program, after the threshold level was exceeded, the engine manufacturer would be responsible for repairing vehicles failing a enhanced vehicle I/M standard during the useful life period, or prior to engine rebuild, whichever came first. After the useful life period or after the engine was rebuilt, the responsibility for I/M repairs would depend on whether these vehicles were included in the enhanced vehicle rebuild program. Second, an &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;I/M program for heavy-duty trucks would require the addition of I/M testing capacity for these heavier vehicles. EPA requests comment on all aspects of this proposal and encourages commenters to suggest options that would facilitate the achievement of the program's objectives as well as implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

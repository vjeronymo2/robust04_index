			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS EASE UP ON BALTIC REPUBLICS  </P> <P> The Soviet Parliament today adopted two resolutions paving the way for the  Baltic republics to have greater control of their economies.  </P> <P> The action by the Supreme Soviet was a major victory for Baltic activists, who  have accused Moscow of sapping the republics' natural resources and failing to  help preserve their native cultures.  </P> <P> One resolution would allow Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to trade independently  with other Soviet republics, Tass said. Under the second resolution, Estonian  and Lithuanian authorities, instead of officials in Moscow, will decide  production matters and control how profits are spent.  </P> <P> The resolutions call on the Council of Ministers to draw up draft laws on the  resolutions and submit them to the Supreme Soviet by Oct. 1 for approval, Tass  said.  </P></p>

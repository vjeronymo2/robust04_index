			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HONOR FOR EVERETT BRINGS RESPONSE FROM THE HEART  </P> <P> Toasted  </P> <P> L.A. Rams quarterback Jim Everett was honored Tuesday at a banquet hosted by  the CHOC Padrinos, a men's support group of Childrens Hospital of Orange  County. The $100-per-person benefit drew 450 men and half a dozen women to the  Irvine Marriott for silent and live auctions, a steak dinner and a few  surprising moments of unchecked emotion when Everett accepted his Sportsman of  the Year award.  </P> <P> Roasted  </P> <P> Master of ceremonies John Robinson -- a.k.a. the Rams' coach -- gave the  business-suited crowd a 15-minute pep talk larded with quarterback quips.  (Everett soaked it in from a front row seat, where he sat with his girlfriend,  Kristina Beatty, his smiling face upturned to his boss).  </P> <P> "I look out at this group and I'm reminded of my team (meetings)," joked  Robinson. "The left side of the room's drunk. The middle of the room's asleep.  The right side is too dumb to know what's going on.  </P> <P> "Jim always sits on the right side of the room," the coach added.  </P> <P> Robinson noted happily that he had not won the centerpiece on his banquet table  -- one of the Everett-signed gym shoes plunked unappetizingly amid salad plates  and wine glasses and coffee cups. "Imagine me going home, 'Honey, look what I  won! Jim Everett's shoe!' " Robinson said. His advice to the winners: "Bury the  damn thing in the yard."  </P> <P> Winning, of course, was Robinson's theme -- why the Rams didn't win their way  to the Super Bowl, how they were going to win seasons yet unplayed. The key to  all that winning and would-be winning, said Robinson, is Jim Everett. "He  epitomizes success."  </P> <P> Prime Time  </P> <P> After guests watched a video montage of Everett's moves on the field and a  recent tour through CHOC, the quarterback stepped up to the podium. He flicked  a few punch lines back at his coach. Then he started to talk about the children  he'd visited in the hospital.  </P> <P> "These kids are fighting for life," Everett said, his voice thickening with  emotion. "Some of these kids might not make it to tomorrow. . . . I'm sorry to  break down like this," he said, wiping his reddened eyes.  </P> <P> For several tear-filled minutes, Everett braved his way through his heartfelt  message of hope, ending to a standing ovation as he presented Padrinos  president Richard Sparrow with a personal check for lifetime membership to the  group.  </P> <P> The Big Check  </P> <P> Earlier in the program, Sparrow made his own check presentation: $200,000 to  Mel Miller, president of the CHOC Foundation, and Howard Jones, chairman of the  board of CHOC. The check -- one of those poster-sized mock-ups -- represented  net proceeds from a year of the Padrinos' fund-raising events. It is the second  of five such checks the group plans to donate annually to help underwrite a new  neonatal intensive care unit.  </P> <P> Other Guys  </P> <P> Glen Allen, chairman of the benefit, led a banquet committee that included Sid  Adler, Jeff Morris, Tim Redmond, Jay Brown, Kelly Munson, Tim Scanlon, Doug  Forde, Ed Slater, Noel Wells and Dave Parsonage.  </P> <P> Attending cocktail hour but gone by dinner: Dr. Ragnar Amlie, of CHOC's  critical care unit, with Aaron Cunningham, 12, of Yorba Linda; Eddie Arrioja,  10, of Orange; and Sonya Paulik, 13, of Anaheim. All three children have cystic  fibrosis and have been patients at CHOC. PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The Sino-British Impasse: Hong Kong - Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten yesterday submitted electoral legislation in the face of furious opposition from China, which says it will scrap the reforms when it takes over in 1997. Hope of reaching the handover in a spirit of co-operation is now in tatters. British and Chinese officials tell the story of the controversial proposals to Simon Holberton The gulf dividing Britain and China over Hong Kong suddenly yawned wider on November 26. Negotiators meeting in Beijing had an exchange which suggested the differences had become so great as to make further talks futile. This was the 17th time that the officials had met in a lavish pavilion in Beijing's Diaoyutai state guest house complex to discuss Britain's desire to broaden democracy in Hong Kong before the colony is handed over to China on July 1 1997. The usual style of Mr Jiang Enzhu, the vice foreign minister leading the Chinese side, was to lay out China's position in painstaking fashion. But on this occasion he was remarkably direct. China, he said, had decided that there would be appointed members on Hong Kong's district boards after 1997. Mr Christopher Hum, the senior British official, replied that under Sino-British agreements, appointments were nothing to do with Beijing. This was a decision for Hong Kong's own post-1997 government. Mr Jiang replied: 'What do you mean? We've got sovereignty after 1997.' To the British, Mr Jiang's aggressive assertion was final proof that China would not entertain political liberalisation in Hong Kong beyond the agreements already reached with Britain - and that even those accords might be in doubt. To the Chinese, it was Britain's attempt to push through democratic reform that had undermined, perhaps fatally, the agreements on which Hong Kong's future was based. In the final days of seven months of talks, China had come close to striking a deal on some of the British proposals, only to pull back at the last moment. Mr Chris Patten, the governor, had failed to demonstrate to Beijing that democratising Hong Kong's political system was in both Hong Kong's and China's interest. Instead of the closer co-operation which he had sought, mutual bitterness and suspicion had increased since his arrival on July 9 1992 as the 28th and probably last British governor. He said in his inaugural address: 'I will do all that I can to remove misunderstandings and to build up trust. Trust is a two-way street. Good co-operation with China is my sincere aim and my profound wish.' The governor was a skilful politician but his task was difficult from the outset. He was to hand over perhaps the world's most successful capitalist economy to a communist government which, believing its imperial forbears had been robbed of the territory in 1841, had long mistrusted the British. He himself set the hurdles even higher by deciding to seek a broadening of the franchise. Hong Kong's economic success, he argued, was inseparable from the rule of law, and the law was intimately linked to fair and open elections. In pursuit of closer links, Mr Patten sought to open a secret channel of communication with Beijing. In London he had met Mr Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese ambassador. According to a Hong Kong official: 'Mr Patten told him among other things that if the Chinese would put someone in Hong Kong who he could talk to then they would find the governor wholly open.' The request was rebuffed. 'The response to his suggestions to ambassador Ma was a stiff-faced note . . . from the Chinese saying it was a very good idea that the governor should talk to someone and that the person he should talk to was Zhou Nan,' the official said. Mr Zhou was the senior Communist party official in Hong Kong, a man known from previous negotiations to be a political hardliner. With the attempt rejected, Mr Patten set out to design reforms which met constraints imposed by Beijing while fulfilling Britain's pledge to enhance democracy. Steps towards democratic rule were set out in the Joint Declaration, the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's future, and the Basic Law, the post-1997 constitution drawn up by Beijing. Mr Patten was responding to demands in Hong Kong for faster reform after the June 1989 massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. 'I think the parameters were pretty clear,' Mr Patten said in one of several interviews with the Financial Times. 'The Chinese had said . . . there could not be any more directly elected seats . . . They said there shouldn't be any liberal legislators on the Executive Council (ExCo).' ExCo, the governor's private advisory council, had traditionally included senior politicians. Mr Patten decided to appoint professionals and business people to ExCo instead of politicians. Rather than seeking an increase in directly-elected seats on the Legislative Council - 20 in the 1995 elections - he would broaden the franchise of the 40 indirectly-elected seats. Voting for 21 existing 'functional constituencies', which represent professional groups, would be by individuals instead of corporate bodies. For nine new seats, Mr Patten wanted to enfranchise the entire working population of 2.7m, divided into nine industry groups. Ten more LegCo members were to be chosen by an election committee. The Basic Law was silent on the committee's composition, though it did spell out provisions for 1999. Mr Patten decided to end appointments to district boards and municipal councils. Elected members of these would constitute the committee. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, briefed Mr Qian Qichen, his counterpart, on September 25 1992 in New York. The following day, Mr Patten sent a message detailing his plans to Mr Lu Ping, director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao affairs office. The governor says: 'At the Qian meeting there was no response; he was just very polite about it all. Nothing happened and then three or four days before the speech Lu Ping summoned our ambassador and told him I should not go ahead with it but wait and discuss it first.' According to China's Outlook magazine, Mr Lu told Sir Robin McLaren, the British ambassador, that political development should proceed step-by-step and in accordance with the Basic Law. The magazine said Mr Patten 'should have listened carefully to opinions from the Chinese side and reached consensus through discussion and revision before making an announcement. Only in that way could his approach be regarded as being responsible, co-operative and 'in good faith'.' Mr Patten, however, pressed ahead. Though he called the plans he announced on October 7 proposals for discussion with Beijing, his approach represented a clear move away from the previous practice of negotiating issues with China in advance of public announcement. 'We thought what we've got to do was sketch our view of what clean electoral arrangements would look like. We thought that unless we did that the whole argument would be conducted on China's ground rather than ours,' Mr Patten says. 'The impulse for doing it was that it would have been politically intolerable only announcing things where we had given way to China and given way quite substantially.' The response in Hong Kong was positive. This was crucial to Mr Patten, who regarded popular support as his trump card. United Democrats party politicians accepted the proposals as the best they could expect. Business initially applauded Mr Patten - though as the confrontation with China deepened, business people either kept quiet or began actively to oppose him. Mr Patten went to Beijing on October 19 for talks. 'The meetings with Lu Ping were pretty good, good in the sense that until right to the end they were serious exchanges of views . . . I thought I'd been immensely accommodating and vigorous,' said Mr Patten. 'I was very open, I was very explicit.' Mr Lu had specific objections to Mr Patten's plans. In an FT interview this year, he explained China's opposition to the new functional constituencies. 'What he envisages is that all the workers will have a vote. For instance, we're going to have a functional constituency for the textile industry. . . According to his proposal it might be quite possible for somebody who is an ordinary worker, maybe a cleaner, to be elected . . . That's what I asked him: 'Do you think a cleaner, an ordinary worker in the textile industry, can represent the interests of the textile industry?' I don't think so.' China's denunciation of Mr Patten began while he was on the flight back to Hong Kong on October 23. Beijing said Mr Patten's proposals violated the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as well as a secret understanding between London and Beijing. They were another example of the British conspiracy to retain an influence in Hong Kong after 1997 and of the UK's inconsistency. Talks could only resume if the proposals were withdrawn. Beijing said it would ignore any elections held without its consent and would hold fresh elections under new arrangements - the so-called 'second kitchen'. China also put in doubt the viability of business contracts after 1997 and raised questions about plans to expand Hong Kong's container port. Mr Patten says: 'We thought that there were various decibel counts of Chinese protest and I have to say it turned out to be at the extremest end of what we anticipated.' Embarrassingly for him, what China saw as a secret agreement in the so-called 'seven letters' had not featured in the planning of his proposals. Mr Hurd had, in February 1990, written to Mr Qian agreeing in principle to China's preferred structure for the election committee - a four-part body consisting of business and professional groups, social services and religious and political figures, and community groups. A senior British official says: 'It is true that (the letters) were not considered when drafting the proposals, but the governor was well aware of them in the days before he went to Beijing.' Though Britain says the letters were inconclusive and related to post-1997 Hong Kong, the British official admits: 'I think the issue of the letters was an oversight on our part, an understandable one but an oversight nevertheless. We should have been a bit more cautious.' A thaw in the Chinese position began in late December when Mr Lu said China did not want a 'diplomatic war' with Britain. As Mr Patten prepared to table legislation, Mr Hurd wrote to Mr Qian regretting that the two sides seemed unable to talk about electoral issues. On February 11 Mr Qian replied that China was prepared to discuss them. After a month of 'talks about talks' - which stalled on the issue of Hong Kong representation - Mr Patten gazetted his bill, but said it would not yet be formally tabled because Britain still wanted talks with Beijing. A further month passed before agreement was reached to hold talks. Mr Patten has been torn throughout between his instinct to push ahead, and Foreign Office advice to strike a deal with Beijing. He anticipated the talks with dread, believing an agreement could only be struck on China's terms. For Mr Patten it would be preferable to have LegCo water down his proposals than for China to do so in secret talks, forcing him to present an amended bill to lawmakers. He says: '(It is) very difficult, very, very difficult, to see how we could have just not talked, but if we'd gone ahead and put the legislation last March/April one way or other it would all be over by now. But we couldn't have not talked.' Talks started on April 22. Four rounds were taken up with Mr Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator, attempting to get the British to agree to a statement of 'principles'. According to Mr Patten, these amounted to 'you won't do anything that we disagree with', and interpretations of previous agreements designed 'to hog-tie us'. Then Mr Jiang slowly laid out the Chinese position. He argued that the system of appointments to district boards and municipal councils should be continued. LegCo's directly-elected seats should be double-member constituencies, with electors having one vote, instead of single-member constituencies as Mr Patten proposed. Britain believes the Chinese proposal is designed to limit the ability of pro-democracy politicians to win seats. For the nine new functional constituencies, Mr Jiang argued for small electorates. Mr Patten says: 'It was all pretty vague and they had nothing to say on the 'through train'' - a set of criteria which would allow those elected in 1995 to serve until the elections of 1999. Mr Hurd told Mr Qian in July that after hearing the Chinese ideas, Britain was prepared to make new suggestions. In July and August, Britain put forward watered-down proposals, reducing the voting pool for functional constituencies by two-thirds and accepting a four-part election committee - though insisting its members should be elected. Mr Patten says: 'They listened to all that and did bugger all.' The gap was underlined on October 23 when Mr Jiang was asked by the FT for his view on Mr Patten's principles that elections should be 'fair, open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong'. Mr Jiang replied: 'I don't know if you've noticed, but Mr Patten's principles are not covered in the (letters) between the two foreign ministers.' However, on October 28, in the 15th round, the Chinese side came up with a new proposal. Mr Jiang suggested Britain accept that Hong Kong delegates to the National People's Congress and other 'people's congresses' could stand in district board, municipal council and LegCo elections. The two sides would agree to lower the voting age to 18 years; the voting method should be single seat, single vote for district boards and municipal councils. Finally, he suggested a formula to the effect that Britain could abolish appointed members for district boards and municipal councils before 1997, but it would be for the Special Administrative Region government to determine the number of members after 1997. Mr Patten says: 'Robin McLaren (UK ambassador to Beijing) at the table said 'Could you repeat that'. They said it twice. He then said a number of times during the meeting: 'We interpret that to mean that you won't object if we abolish appointed members before 1997 and the SAR government will decide what to do afterwards.' They didn't disagree with that.' The Chinese offer was drawn up into a memorandum of understanding (MOU). To this was added a British requirement that the 'first-stage' agreement also provide for settling the voting method for the directly-elected LegCo seats on the basis of one-man, one-vote in single member electorates. Mr Patten says: 'LegCo voted by solid majority for the voting method; the leaders of political parties in LegCo say they believe in single seat, single vote, and it is simply not realistic to put in legislation which does not take account of that. We said that in our proposed MOU. And there were lots of winks and nudges that suggested it was OK.' The cabinet committee on Hong Kong affairs debated the Chinese offer in London on November 8. It decided to allow the British team to seek a 'first-stage' agreement. However, Mr Patten was cleared, subject to Mr Hurd's approval, to press ahead with legislation if a deal were not obtainable. If 'non-controversial' issues were immediately legislated, there would be up to two months to discuss 'controversial' aspects before they too had to be put into law in time for the elections. Hopes of a deal quickly faded. The 16th round was 'the worst on record', according to Mr Patten. Mr Jiang said the LegCo voting method could not be part of an agreement. He said Britain had misunderstood what Beijing had offered on appointments to district boards and municipal councils. He would clarify this misunderstanding only if Britain agreed to drop the LegCo voting method from the package. The round ended acrimoniously with Mr Hum, who had replaced Sir Robin as the UK leader after the ambassador had been taken ill, telling Mr Jiang that the next round would be the last opportunity for talks about the 'straightforward issues'. At the customary banquet at the end of the round, Mr Jiang would not speak to Mr Hum for the first three courses, claiming that he had 'spoiled his meal'. At the 17th round on November 26, the Chinese said they did not want a written MOU, but an oral understanding. It should cover what was offered in the 15th round but not include the voting method for directly-elected LegCo seats. Britain would have to agree to forswear unilateral action if it accepted this offer, Mr Jiang said. The exchange about appointed members followed. The talks had reached impasse. Mr Hum told Mr Jiang legislation of 'straightforward' issues would now begin. He offered a further round of talks on other aspects. But an official Chinese account said: 'Facts show that the British side left the negotiating table in a huff.' Two days after he unveiled his proposals, Mr Patten set out his own definition of failure. 'I think above all being thought not to have recognised our moral as well as political responsibility for the way of life of the people of Hong Kong,' the governor said. 'But it would also be failure if I wasn't able to persuade China that Hong Kong is mature, sophisticated, modest in its political ambitions and capable of doing a lot more to look after its own affairs. I would have failed if I hadn't been able to persuade China that politics in a free society is no threat . . . But I may well fail.'</p>

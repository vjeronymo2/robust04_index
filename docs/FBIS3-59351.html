			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pi Hua (3880 5478): "The Frontier Corps' Bloody </F> Archives--A Study of Dreams of Educated Chinese  Youth"--First paragraph is introduction.]    [Text] An authentic literary work recording the  suffering of educated Chinese youth reveals the little-known  inside story of the cruel history of educated Chinese youth and  their uprising in resistance. The reclamation corps regarded  human life as worthless. The parading of a corpse touched off an  earthshaking storm, awakening educated Chinese youth to rise in  resistance.    In the over four decades since the founding of the PRC, the  CPC has practiced a brutal dictatorship, believing that it could  rely on its powerful state apparatus to force its people into  submission. While conscientious Chinese writers and artists  would have reported this social reality in their works on behalf  of the people, the PRC's literary and arts policy that permits  eulogies but no exposures has long kept many writers afraid to  touch such sensitive topics.  <H3>  A Work Recording, Exposing the Brutal Treatment of Educated  Chinese Youth </H3>   The recent appearance of the long literary record by the  young Sichuan writer Deng Xian [6772 6343]--Dreams of  Educated Chinese Youth (carried in the No 5, 1992 issue of  the literary bimonthly TANG TAI, and published in a separate  edition by the People's Literature Publishing House in April  1993)--has broken this taboo. Dreams of Educated Chinese  Youth recounts the story of Mao Zedong's sending of  educated Chinese youth down to the countryside and border areas  for "reeducation," and their subsequent tide of demanding to  return to the cities. In the words of this book's "synopsis,"  the author "uses full and accurate data and powerful artistic  expression to reveal for the first time the inside story and  whole course of the great [struggle to] return to the cities by  educated Chinese youth, as well as the Frontier Corps' bloody  archives."    This book is also significant in that: 1) It expresses in a  work for the first time, through a record of the facts, the  surging spectacle of the Chinese people's demonstration and  stand for their lives against CPC tyranny. Even more rare is  that the resistance ended in victory, demonstrating the theme  that "tyranny must lose and the people will win." 2) Since the  failure of the 1989 student movement, ultra-leftists have  resurged, doing their utmost to defend past CPC crimes. So this  book is also a forceful attack on such attempts to rewrite  history.  <H3>  The Construction Corps Was More Like a Reform-Through-Labor  Camp </H3>   The policy of forcing large numbers of educated Chinese  youth  to the countryside, to submit to so-called "reeducation," was  set forth by Mao Zedong in an editorial note in RENMIN RIBAO  [PEOPLE'S DAILY] on 21 December 1968: "Educated Chinese youth  going to the countryside, to be reeducated by poor and  lower-middle peasants, is very necessary."    Once Mao's "imperial edict" was issued, it immediately  touched off the campaign of going to work in the countryside and  mountain areas, which affected almost all urban families. The  data show that by the end of 1978, 20 million educated Chinese  youths had been sent down to the countryside or off to border  areas. While Mao's slogan sounded very pleasant, the so-called  "reeducation" was in fact consistent with his hostile actions  against learning and intellectuals. His expelling of educated  Chinese youth to the countryside was in fact consigning them to  purgatory. Dreams of Educated Youth authentically  recounts the many hair-raising crimes committed by Mao Zedong's  cadres in tormenting the educated youth.    At the end of May 1973, XINHUA SHE [NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY]  reporter Li Ming [7812 2494] inadvertently saw in Jinping  County, the encampment of the 18th Regiment of the Yunnan  Production and Construction Corps, many prisoners laboring under  escort by the People's Armed Police [PAP]. These convicts were  very young and unkempt, sweating away at hard labor. When one of  them asked a guard for a drink of water, not to speak of the  excoriation, several militiamen also rushed over and beat this  prisoner to the ground with their rifle butts. Then, his  pitiful cry rang out in the boiling hot air: "PLA uncles, spare  my life! Please spare my life...." Even more shocking were the  female prisoner ranks that this reporter saw, with 17 and 18  year-old educated girls escorted by fiendish militiamen to hard  labor in rock quarries. What he could not understand was: Why  was the air there laden with such a bloody smell? Why was this  construction corps more like a huge reform-through-labor camp?  <H5>  A Uranium Mine With No Safety Measures </H5>   Here are the true facts. In the 18th Regiment, these  soldiers  had long since treated educated youth as prisoners to be  wantonly hung up and beaten, humiliated, and even raped. One  camp boss openly asserted: What have you come to the frontier  for? To be remolded as "disloyal reform-through-labor convicts!"    According to a report (No 241) issued by the New China News  Agency on 4 July 1973, 23 of the 18th Regiment's 31 units saw  the occurrence of varying degrees of tying up, hanging up, and  beating of educated youth. There were over 30 types of  punishments, such as being roasted in the sun in the summer, and  being doused with cold water in the winter. Some were beaten  into cripples, some went mad, and others committed suicide. Many  of the cadres in the Yunnan construction corps were sex fiends  who ravaged educated young girls.    Even worse, Corps cadres acted with utter disregard for the  lives of educated youth. In the late 1960s, a uranium mine was  discovered in a desolate mountain pass of high mountain ridges  in Western Yunnan, which was taken over by the Construction  Corps in 1970. Educated youth from the Corps' Fifth Division,  21st Regiment (Menggang farm) were sent there. While the mine  had over 400 educated youths, whose main jobs were mining,  picking, storing, and shipping, it had absolutely no safety or  protective equipment, leaving many educated youths subject to  long-term radiation that took their lives.  <H5>  Educated Youth Parade a Corpse </H5>   "If the people do not fear death, how can they be cowed by  it." As educated youths had limited patience, their discovery  that their lives were being treated with utter disregard (with  statistics showing that in the first 10 months of 1978 alone,  the Yunnan Reclamation Area experienced as many as 153 unnatural  deaths of educated youths, and other reclamation areas  experienced many suicides as well) finally set off a wave of  strikes and demonstrations.    The book relates in detail three later-publicized  disturbances by educated youths in 1978 and early 1979.    The first was the parading of a corpse on 13 November 1978.  This demonstration occurred in the Yunnan border region on the  Ganlan Plains. The corps authorities' lack of concern for human  life, plus bad doctoring by barefoot doctors, who acted  irresponsibly by actually getting drunk and leaving during a  difficult labor by an educated young woman, resulted in the  pregnant female losing so much blood that both mother and child  died. The unexpected death of this educated young woman left  the other educated youth so in grief that their resentment  quickly grew into resistance over the fate of educated youth in  general.    This time, the CPC's consistently-utilized formula of  pressure tactics did not work. As the camp's public security  body and PAP were going into emergency action in preparation for  forced disposition of the corpse, hundreds of educated youth who  had heard the news rushed up, confronting the armed personnel  with hoes, long knives, and iron clubs. Finally, they lifted up  the corpse on their shoulders and set out for Jinghongzhen (the  capital of the Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture). They  neither chanted radical slogans, presented vehement views, nor  committed any violence. Rather, they simply bowed their heads,  carrying the corpse of their companion who had died such an  unfortunate death, in an attempt to win some basic human rights  for both the living and the dead. Like an endless river, they  flowed along slowly beneath the dark and gloomy November sky,  finally sitting down for several days in front of the  Prefectural Party Committee gates.    Only 24 hours after the occurrence of this incident, the  news  of it appeared through telegraphic dispatch in writing on the  Xidan Democracy Wall in Beijing. Meanwhile, it affected all  reclamation areas in the southwest. In a few short days, all of  the eight large farms in the Banna Reclamation Area were faced  with a serious situation of educated youth being out of control  emotionally. Educated youths from all of the farms went into  action, contacting each other, establishing secret ties, and  responding by the hundreds to a single call.  <H5>  Victory of the Resistance Changes Their Fate </H5>   Who would have thought that the chance incident of an  educated young woman's tragic death would become the fuse to set  off an earthshaking wave of return to the cities by educated  youth, to become the first roll of thunder that would result in  hundreds of thousands of educated youths on Yunnan farms and  even throughout China awakening in bold resistance.    The educated youth won a great and complete victory, in  which  the prefectural party committee met all of their demands: 1) It  dealt severely with the doctors involved in the incident,  investigating and affixing responsibility; 2) It treated the  educated young woman as if she had died in public service,  agreeing to hold a memorial meeting; 3) It better implemented  the educated-youth policy, instructing farms to improve health  care as quickly as possible, and to make overall plans for  solving the existing problems in educated-youth lives.    The victory from this parading of a corpse sharply boosted  the morale of educated youth to demonstrate against tyranny,  paving the way for victory in the two subsequent strikes and  demonstrations that called on the CPC to abolish its reactionary  policy of sending educated urban youth to work in the  countryside and mountain areas. The courage (a hundred laying  down on the train tracks and a thousand going on a hunger  strike) and tactics (absolutely peaceful and rational, to  provide the authorities with no handles) displayed by the  educated youth in these two magnificent actions, showed through  and through the extent to which these young people had matured  by steeling themselves to their miserable lives.  <H5>  Firm Memories of the Ultra-Left Disaster </H5>   On his Spring 1992 southern tour, Deng Xiaoping set forth  the  key issue as guarding against the left. Dreams of Educated  Youth was written in the midst of this anti-left tide,  being in the same category as works such as Anti-Left  Memorandum and China's "Left" Disaster.    Mao Zedong's policy of sending educated urban youth to work  in the countryside and mountain areas has been negated by Deng  Xiaoping. Deng's remarks on this policy were: "We spent 30  billion yuan to buy three discontents -- educated youth,  parents, and peasants." Still, the CPC has ultra-leftists who  just cannot give up on this policy that has wasted our national  wealth, ruined a whole generation of youths, and was such a  disaster; they are still trying by all means to beautify it.    In 1990, Beijing held the "Spirits Tied to the Black  Earth--A  Retrospective on Wild Beijing University Youth," at which time  ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO also said that the policy of sending  educated urban youth to work in the countryside and mountain  areas had "radiated a spirit of development and excellence." In  the early spring of 1991, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of  going to Yunnan in support of the border area, Chengdu held a  large retrospective exhibition, with the general title "Youth  Has No Regrets." Beneath this general title was an explanatory  note borrowed from Selected Poems by Pushkin: "A  Russian once said that all suffering will pass, and what is past  will turn into a happy memory."    However, the author of Dreams of Educated Youth  questions this view. He says in the "Introduction" that: "I  cannot help but have certain instinctual doubts about the words  of this Russian poet: If all past suffering does not turn into  bitterness, then can the attitude of the Jews toward World War  II, the Chinese toward the Nanjing Massacre, and the Japanese  toward the atom bomb be one of turning those nightmares into  happy memories?" He holds that as history is an organic unity,  "While we may forget honors, money, and the many shining laurels  that may someday adorn our heads, we have no rationale for  forgetting suffering, or its indelible historical brand that was  forcibly stamped on us as individuals and as a whole." He asks:  "If those 10 young girls who have already been forgotten and are  forever sleeping in darkness (referring to the 10 educated young  girls from Chengdu averaging only 17 and one-half years of age  who died in a fire in Yunnan in 1971 while there in support of  the border area) could speak out from the grave, what would they  say? If they had the right to choose their lives again, would  they opt to be educated youths? Would they have no regrets?"</p>

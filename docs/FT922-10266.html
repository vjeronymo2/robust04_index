			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / OFT opens inquiry into underwriting fees for share issues THE OFFICE of Fair Trading has begun an inquiry into whether City institutions are operating a cartel by setting standardised fees for underwriting share issues. Companies have told the OFT that they are unhappy about being unable to negotiate costs. 'We are conducting a general inquiry into the fixed costs associated with underwriting,' the OFT said, adding that no formal investigation was under way. 'Our concern is whether there is any price-fixing or other anti-competitive activity going on.' The fact that all companies are charged the same regardless of the risks their securities pose or their choice of underwriter had also prompted the OFT to act. The spokesman said that while the OFT had not received any formal complaints, it had been made aware of 'general comment' from companies about their inability to negotiate fees. It will decide whether to launch a formal investigation after receiving more information. The OFT has previously inquired into possible anti-competitive practices in the sale of securities. Last spring, it opened an informal inquiry into the sale of Eurobonds after a change in that market's underwriting practices designed to restore profitability. However, the OFT decided after a few months that there were no grounds for a formal investigation and dropped the matter. In the case of shares, underwriting fees for initial public offerings or rights issues fall below prescribed levels only in circumstances such as government privatisation issues. Brokers receive 0.25 per cent of the total amount sold, while underwriters earn 0.5 per cent of their portion. Sub-underwriters, typically pension funds, life insurance companies and institutional fund managers, earn 1.25 per cent. The OFT wrote in March to several City trade associations seeking information on how profitable underwriting and sub-underwriting has been for institutions over the past 10 years and the frequency with which issues 'fail', causing losses for underwriters. The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the National Association of Pension Funds and the British Merchant Bankers' Association have received letters asking them to provide information. City institutions defend the process of fixed fees, saying that variations of risk are reflected in the price charged for the shares rather than in the commissions.</p>

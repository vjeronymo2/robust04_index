			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): US stockbrokers in determined mood  -Financial markets IN the mid-1980s, the US securities houses launched an attack on the hitherto protected Tokyo Stock market - and won; in the early 1990s they are attempting to do the same in Hong Kong. Within a six-month period last year, Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Shearson Lehman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch all started the process of expanding luxurious Hong Kong offices, and bidding up the prices of stock exchange seats and, more expensively, experienced local stock brokers. The invasion was far more dramatic than the US retreat in early 1990, when Morgan Stanley and BT Brokerage both shut down offices, and Citicorp Vickers started another round of staff cuts. But the comparison has led to a certain degree of cynicism from existing practitioners. This time, however, there is no doubting their determination. In a recent survey on global stockbroking houses by Greenwich, the first two places in Hong Kong went to Baring Securities and WI Carr. In recent months, the respective managing directors of those houses have been poached by Salomons and Goldman Sachs, for undisclosed (but undoubtedly substantial) amounts. And Goldman Sachs' had to snatch Nick Harbinson from the talons of Merril Lynch. The costs of this adventure will not be small. The colony has the world's second highest office prices, while the enhanced interest in the exchange has already tripled the price of seats to Dollars 1.8m in the past year. Brokers salaries have spiked accordingly. There is a very limited pool of skilled labour available, and with this level of demand, wage claims have reached the outrageous. Even over the border in China, where Hong Kong's industrial sector relocated to reduce its operating costs, US-educated Mainland Chinese have negotiated wages at international rather than Chinese levels. Some are commanding salaries of up to Dollars US150,000 with the big corporate finance houses. Opinions differ over whether they will ever get a pay-back. Mr Raymond Lai, managing director of Smith Barney (Asia), argues: 'If they are prepared to take a four or five-year view, then they will do well.' Few believe that there won't be any fall-out before this perceived break-even point, which will be ironically close to 1997. There is an argument that the Hong Kong stock market has now picked up sufficient size and turnover to make it a worthwhile venue for the big players. Certainly, average daily turnover more than doubled in 1992 to Dollars HK2.8bn. Mr William Phillips, managing director of Salomon Brothers Hong Kong, argues: 'US fund managers need big ponds to swim in. These south east Asian stock markets were little puddles before.' In a 'people business' like broking, it is possible for anybody to break in if they are prepared to pay enough, and Hong Kong, unlike other south east Asian markets, offers few barriers to entry. But with the increasing levels of competition, agency broking profit margins have already become razor thin, since market turnover cannot keep pace with costs. With western economies continuing to slumber, there has been an inevitable focus on the higher growth markets of Asia (excluding Japan), but it is conceivable that this enthusiasm may die down with an economic up-turn. 'There is concern that however much the market expands, there is not going to be enough business to sustain the number of people chasing it,' said a local 'head-hunter.' One positive sign is the fact that the UK's largest independent pension fund manager, Mercury, has just set up a fund management office in Hong Kong, recognising the increased demand for a focus on the high growth Asian markets. The managing director of Warburg Asset Management Hong Kong, Mr Han Ong, said it had become increasingly important to maintain or improve performance, given that Warburg now had close to Dollars US1bn invested in Hong Kong. But Mr Ong is not expecting any flood of new funds to follow brokerage offices into Hong Kong, except through changes in asset allocation; and he argued that the Hong Kong stock market was already over-broked. Recently-arrived brokerages, such as Kleinwort Benson Securities and also UBS Securities, have all focused their attention on traditional agency stockbroking, but the ambitions of the US giants stretch towards higher margin businesses. The Americans are already building up corporate finance and derivatives teams, to make use of their large capital base and technical expertise in other markets. The China concept has loomed large in this respect, because this provides an enormous new market for fund raising. NINE sizable mainland companies are due to be floated in Hong Kong within a year, and there numerous others state companies competing for foreign capital, through 'B' share issues, or bonds. In the 1980s the Americans tried a strategy of importing technically astute representatives from within the group, expecting them to perform in these alien markets. This was not a success in the contacts-driven Asian markets, so they are now trying a more successful formula of buying up local talent, and attaching that to their distribution networks in America. Five of the nine corporate finance mandates for the Hong Kong listings have been handed out; Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs secured roles in arguably the two prime flotations, Shanghai Petrochemical and Qingdao Brewery. Merrill Lynch, without ever having handled a public offer in Hong Kong before, was awarded the global distribution mandate for what will probably be the largest-ever public offer in Hong Kong, Shanghai Petrochemical. This indicates the power of the big US franchises. But this still does not equate to profit, since competition has been so tight for Chinese mandates, that winning bidders are not expecting to make any profit from the deals whatsoever. On the derivatives side, Salomons has already purchased a seat on the Futures Exchange, and is in the process of building up a team. This will be a big focus of resources, and the other US houses are expected to follow suit. Salomon's Phillips argues that it was just a matter of the US houses waiting for the right time to move in. He claims that 'within three to five years, I believe that three out of the top ten brokerages in Hong Kong will be American.' It may prove more difficult to obtain those rankings in terms of profitability.</p>

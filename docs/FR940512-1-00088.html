Newburg, Director, Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention, room B&hyph;133, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC. 20410, telephone (202) 755&hyph;1785 or (202) 708&hyph;9300 (TDD) or 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 (Federal Information Relay Service TDD).

This legislation required the Secretary to ``establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary.'' HUD implemented that requirement by promulgating 24 CFR part 35 in 1976 (41 FR 28878, July 13, 1976). Part 35 includes the general procedures for the testing and abatement of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing and applies to all programs. Section 35.5(c), however, allows each Assistant Secretary to develop regulations pertaining to specific HUD programs. It is the Department's intent that program-specific regulations define the conditions that require action, but reference part 35 for specification of how the action should be conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since part 35 was first written, amendments to it and to the program-specific regulations have been issued from time to time in response to changes in the law and increased knowledge about the hazards and treatment of lead-based paint. The most recent Department-wide regulatory revisions pertaining to lead-based paint were made in 1986, 1987, and 1988. Some additional revisions specific to the public and Indian housing programs were issued in 1991. However, new legislation_specifically the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (title X, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550; approved October 28, 1992) (Title X)_and recent advances in knowledge have again made some of the information in the existing regulations obsolete. Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive revision of its lead-based paint regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes in this proposed rule would represent the first phase in the revision process. In the first phase, HUD would correct certain provisions in the regulations that are clearly out of date and should be corrected as soon as possible. Subsequent revisions will implement Title X, which establishes new requirements effective January 1, 1995. The Department intends to issue proposed regulations implementing the new Act as soon as possible, to allow the maximum amount of time for comment and for preparation by State and local agencies and the private sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD welcomes comments on the regulatory revisions that are described in this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Revising the Definition of an Elevated Blood-Lead Level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations require special procedures if a child has an ``elevated blood-lead level.'' This proposed rule would change the definition of an elevated blood-lead level (EBL) to conform to the new recommendations of the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), regarding blood lead levels that require environmental intervention. Existing regulations define an EBL as equal to or exceeding 25 micrograms per deciliter (&mu;g/dl). The Department's new standard for environmental intervention would be equal to or exceeding 20 &mu;g/dl for a single test or 15&hyph;19 &mu;g/dl in two consecutive tests several months apart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many people are under the impression that the CDC, in its Statement, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October 1991), effectively lowered the definition of an EBL to 10 &mu;g/dl. It is true that the Statement indicates that ``the overall goal is to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 &mu;g/dl. However, the Statement does not recommend medical or environmental intervention at levels of 10&hyph;14 &mu;g/dl. Three reasons are given:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> First, particularly at low blood lead levels, laboratory measurements may have some inaccuracy and imprecision, so a blood lead level in this range (10&hyph;14 &mu;g/dl) may, in fact, be below 10 &mu;g/dl. Second, effective environmental and medical interventions for children with blood lead levels in this range have not yet been identified and evaluated. Finally, the sheer numbers of children in this range would preclude effective case management and would detract from individualized follow-up required by children who have higher blood lead levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (See, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children, A Statement by the Centers for Disease Control_October 1991, page 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition currently used by HUD of an EBL first appears in 24 CFR 200.805. The revised definition would be included in 24 CFR 35.3, because the definition affects all residential HUD programs. Specific program regulations could then reference the definition in part 35 as appropriate, although some program regulations might continue to repeat the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Venezuelan gas project approved - Plan involves first foreign equity investment in sector since 1976 VENEZUELA'S Congress has given final approval to a Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.75bn) natural gas project that involves the first foreign equity investment in the country's oil and gas sectors since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976. The decision is expected to open the door to other big international investments in Venezuela's petroleum sector. The partners in this joint venture, the largest single project ever undertaken by the Venezuelan oil industry, are Lagoven, a subsidiary of the national oil company PDVSA, which will have 33 per cent of the equity; Royal Dutch/Shell (30 per cent); Exxon (29 per cent) and Mitsubishi (8 per cent). The project calls for producing natural gas from offshore fields in the Caribbean, transporting it to land by pipeline, and building a large gas liquefaction plant, port facilities and other infrastructure on the Paria Peninsula in eastern Venezuela. The promoters plan to export the final product, liquefied natural gas or LNG, to meet growing demand for 'clean energy' in markets on the east coast of the US and in Europe. Liquefaction capacity is projected at 6m tonnes a year, and the partners will buy or lease six 50,000 dwt LNG carriers. Under Venezuela's Oil Industry Nationalisation Law of 1975, joint ventures in oil and gas between the national oil company and any private investors can be carried out only when the project represents 'the national interest' and receives approval by both houses of the Venezuelan legislature. This week's congressional approval came with the votes of the country's two largest political parties, Democratic Action and the Christian Democrat Copei party. Political parties on the left mounted a last-minute campaign to block the project, saying it would be contrary to national interests. The project, called Christopher Columbus to honour the explorer's landing on the Paria Peninsula in 1498, has been under discussion by the partners for around four years. It was delayed earlier by questions about future demand for LNG imports and by concerns over the protection of technology to be used, applicable tax rates and whether legal disputes would be settled by Venezuelan or foreign courts. (The latter will have the final word.) The change in attitude towards foreign investment in Venezuela's oil industry was forced on many Venezuelan politicians by economic reality. PDVSA and the Venezuelan government have been seeking foreign capital for big projects in oil and gas for some time. PDVSA executives and government officials including Mr Alirio Parra, minister of energy and mines, have stressed that PDVSA by itself cannot finance some important projects.</p>

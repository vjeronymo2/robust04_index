			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Management: Creative thought stifled Innovative employees are being stifled by modern management practices designed to maximise production and individual work output, according to a report* published yesterday. Fostering Innovation, published by the British Psychological Society, calls on organisations to think about how best to encourage innovative staff who, it suggests, are often overlooked and neglected by employers. The authors, Michael West of Sheffield University, Clive Fletcher of Goldsmith's College at the University of London, and John Toplis at the Post Office training and development group, argue that performance appraisal systems, goal setting and extra work demands can suffocate innovative thinking. They agree that performance monitoring improves effectiveness but say it can create job insecurity and fear of failure, which both hinder innovative thought. 'Where people at work feel that their jobs may be threatened if they make mistakes they are likely to play safe and avoid the risk and experimentation which is fundamental to innovation,' says the report. Traditional career paths tend to stifle innovation, say the authors. They suggest that employees likely to be favoured for promotion at the bottom of an organisation are those who are accurate, pay attention to detail, rules and procedures, accept authority, dress conventionally and conform generally. In contrast, it describes innovators as people who defy convention, question authority and dislike routine work and paying attention to details. 'It would be wrong to give the impression that innovation would be fostered simply by the employment of radicals. However, organisations also have to recognise that the complete exclusion of such people could lead to stagnation,' says the report. *Fostering Innovation. British Psychological Society.

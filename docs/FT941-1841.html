			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price reaches Dollars 14 ahead of Opec meeting Oil prices edged upwards yesterday in advance of the meeting in Geneva on Friday of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for May was hovering just above the Dollars 14 a barrel level in late London trading yesterday. That compares with a closing price of Dollars 13.77 on Monday. Part of the price increase was attributed to storms in the North Sea, which prevented tankers from loading at Norway's Statfjord and Gullfaks fields. Loading operations at Norway's two onshore terminals, Mongstad and Sture, were also affected by bad weather. Mr Peter Gignoux, a trader at the London office of Smith Barney, said evidence of 'a bit more demand from refiners' was also helping to underpin the market. The firmer price coincided with a growing belief in the markets that Opec oil ministers may choose to roll over the present production quota of 24.52m barrels a day, rather than try to engineer a cut in output to boost prices. 'They are waiting for demand to bring the price up,' according to Mr Joseph Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. He said that an extension of the quota for at least the next two quarters could be portrayed in a 'constructive and positive' light. 'The longer they say this is the right quota the better it would be for the markets,' he added. Unlike previous Opec meetings there has been little public evidence of pre-meeting consultations between member states. Nevertheless analysts say the roll-over may emerge as the preferred option because a small cut in quotas of, say, 500,000 b/d would be unlikely to have a lasting impact on prices and would simply give away market share to independent producers. A larger cut of 1m-1.5m b/d could provoke a sharp rise in prices, but it would also raise doubts whether some Opec producers would abide by it.</p>

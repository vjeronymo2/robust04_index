Aleksandr Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Public Relations Center,  would not give any details, pointing out that doing so before an  indictment is handed down would be premature. Ironically, soon  before it caught the BND agent, the Russian counterintelligence  service had exposed a spy who worked for the British MI6  service; at the time it immediately revealed some details about  him -- for instance, that he was an employee of a Russian  military-industrial company. This fact has suggested that the  German spy caught in the FCS net is more important than the  British one.    This theory was also confirmed by report, which was made  public a bit later, about a telephone conversation between Horst  Schmidtbauer, state minister at the FRG federal chancellor's  office, and Anatoliy Safonov, FCS deputy director, to discuss  matters concerning the arrest of the German intelligence  service's agent. According to INTERFAX, the FCS representative  said that the arrest of the German agent does not have any  political bottom-line.    But why has the German side raised the question about the  possible political bottom-line of a basically run-of-the-mill  spy drama? Information received by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA from  competent sources suggests that it was forced to do so.    It turned out that the press reported about the BND agent's  arrest at a time when BND President Konrad Porzner was in  Moscow. Mr. Porzner was invited to the Russian capital by FCS  chiefs to discuss matters regarding the cooperation between the  two countries' special services in areas where their interests  coincide: the struggle against organized crime, international  terrorism, activity in crisis areas.    As soon as the news about the exposed German spy was made  public, Mr. Porzner was forced to suspend the talks and  immediately leave for home -- to clarify the situation. To all  appearances, it is this embarrassing situation that has forced  the Germans to make "additional references."    The incident was not discussed by the chiefs of the FCS and  the BND. Officials at the Russian special service hope,  however, that the emergency will not thwart the already  established and fairly fruitful cooperation of the two special  services, a cooperation that nonetheless does not rule out  classical intelligence activity against each other.    The arrest of a BND agent against the backdrop of the German  special service chief's visit to Moscow may have occurred by  chance. On the other hand, the FCS presumably had information  about the spy long enough to expose him some time earlier. In  this event, the goings-on have reminded us once again that  intelligence and counterintelligence services have always  maintained a special relationship that could scarcely be called  a friendly one.</p>

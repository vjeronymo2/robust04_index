			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS ALREADY TALKING TO BUTLER  </P> <P> Brett Butler, the San Francisco center fielder who became a free agent Friday,  said that his agent has already been contacted by the Dodgers, whom he  considers "my dream team."  </P> <P> "Ever since I was a kid I wanted to play for the Dodgers," Butler said from his  Atlanta home after becoming one of 15 new-look free agents in accordance with  the recent collusion ruling.  </P> <P> "When I was a free agent in 1987, they were my first choice. I love Los  Angeles. It has always been a dream to play there. Hopefully something can  transpire."  </P> <P> Butler said his agent, Dick Moss, was contacted by the Dodgers Friday morning  and that the Dodgers promised to get back to him. Butler batted .309 last year  with 51 stolen bases and could fill the Dodgers' need for a leadoff hitter  while allowing them to trade Kal Daniels for a pitcher.  </P> <P> "Our outfield is a bit crowded right now, but I do expect we will speak to  Butler," Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said.

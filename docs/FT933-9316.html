			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: HK futures exchange to repay 1987 crash loan THE HONG Kong Futures market will on Friday repay the special HKDollars 1.93bn (USDollars 249m) 'lifeboat' loan which rescued it from bankruptcy after the October 1987 stock market crash. Since the crash, the government has imposed a 0.3 per cent levy on all stock exchange transactions, and a HKDollars 30 levy (subsequently reduced to HKDollars 5) on all Hang Seng Index futures contracts, to help repay the loan. These special levies will be suspended after the close of trading on Friday. The Hang Seng Index futures contract had been the second most active in the world in 1987, but after the four-day closure of the stock market from October 19, members of the Futures Exchange defaulted on HKDollars 1.8bn worth of obligations. It is only in the past 12 months that the futures market has seen a recovery in turnover, and the suspension of the levy is expected to encourage greater liquidity. Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said: 'The suspension of the special levy clears up the last outstanding issue left over from the 1987 market crash, which can finally be regarded as a matter of history.'</p>

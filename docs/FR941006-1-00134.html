			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The placement of the warning statement on the principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> display panel of the retail package will make it likely that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning statement will be seen at the time the product is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchased. The statement will inform the purchaser of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product's potential to cause poisoning and of the need to keep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product away from children when it is brought into the house.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA tentatively concludes that placement of the warning statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the principal display panel is necessary to fulfill the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of sections 403(f) and 502(c) of the act, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information required to appear on the label of a food or a drug be placed with conspicuousness (as compared with other printed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter) as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual under customary conditions of use. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement of the warning statement on the principal display panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is consistent with the requirement that FDA established for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein product warning statements discussed previously. In both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the products in question could cause serious, even life-threatening, problems if misused. Thus, FDA tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that the standard of conspicuousness established in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein products case should also be adopted for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency tentatively concludes that placement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning statement on the immediate container is also necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill the requirement of sections 403(f) and 502(c) of the act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because, under customary conditions of use, the retail container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is frequently disposed of, and individuals other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchaser may use the product. Therefore, the warning statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be printed on the immediate container if this statement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to perform its function throughout the life of the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulating the placement of the warning is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other labeling requirements that the agency has imposed. In 21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 201.314(h)(1) and (h)(2), FDA has required that the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of orally or rectally administered aspirin and aspirin-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug products intended for sale without prescription bear a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning that reads: ``WARNING: Children and teenagers should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported to be associated with aspirin.'' The warning must appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the immediate container labeling. In cases where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate container is not the retail package, the retail package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must also bear the warning statement. (see 51 FR 8180, March 7,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

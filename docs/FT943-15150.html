			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Nerves of steel in German metals group: Metallgesellschaft's restructuring Summing up his term of office as chairman of Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and industrial group, Mr Kajo Neukirchen had a two-pronged message last week. The first element was that Metallgesellschaft's problems had turned out to be bigger than he expected when he took over as chairman in the week before Christmas last year. The second, and marginally more optimistic point contained in a letter to shareholders, was that more had been done to bring the Frankfurt-based conglomerate back to financial health than he had thought possible when he was brought in to the crisis-struck group. Still, the negative part of the message outweighed the positive last week. The group's losses for the year to September would be about the same level as last year's DM1.9bn (Pounds 785m), Mr Neukirchen warned at a briefing on Thursday night. In the first half, losses were DM1.54bn, against a pre-tax profit of DM98.3m in the same period last year. Mr Neukirchen also revealed that the company would have to book a new DM1bn provision to cover further losses generated by MG Corp, the group's New York-based US trading subsidiary. These come on top of the DM2.3bn losses already run up by MG Corp as a result of speculative trading in the oil futures market, bringing Metallgesellschaft, one of Germany's biggest industrial groups, to the brink of bankruptcy in January. The new provision arises from the entanglement of MG Corp with Castle Energy Corporation, a north American oil refinery. MG Corp's previous management agreed to buy refined oil from Castle at higher than market prices for the next five years. The situation is complicated by the fact that MG Corp owns 40.1 per cent of Castle, and former MG Corp directors sat on the Castle board. The relationship between MG Corp and Castle, set out in 76 contracts from which MG Corp has unsuccessfully tried to escape, were known about when bankers and shareholders agreed to a DM3.4bn rescue and refinancing package earlier this year. It only became clear that a large provision would be needed in late May and the scale of the risk was not quantified until Friday. Conveniently, the new losses will be covered by the extraordinary profits made on the disposal of Buderus, a heating equipment and engineering subsidiary sold for DM1.2bn last month. Mr Neukirchen said last week that Buderus, which was highly profitable, was sold because it did not fit the group's newly defined core strategy. But the circumstances of the disposal suggest more of an amputation: earlier this year Mr Neukirchen was adamant that Buderus would not be sold. Buderus is not the only part of the sprawling Metallgesellschaft empire to be sold. Mr Neukirchen's drastic restructuring plans will cut the number of the group's subsidiaries by half, from 655 at present. The new Metallgesellschaft will be much smaller than the old. The medium-term aim is a group with turnover of DM14bn a year, compared with DM26bn last year, employing 20,000 people, a third of the near 60,000 on the payroll in March last year. Business will be focused on four main areas - trade, plant construction, financial services and chemicals. These core businesses imply an eventual withdrawal from the group's traditional mining activities - concentrated in the Canada-based Metall Mining, a 50.1 per cent owned subsidiary - and from its loss-making base-metals smelting activities. The most important measures in the first seven months include job cuts - the plan is to shed 7,500 jobs with annual savings of DM550m - and the introduction of a new holding structure for the group. Announced last week, the new structure goes hand in hand with a much reduced head office staff and a slimmer main board of five rather than seven directors. The group has also halved its DM1.1bn investment plans, cut working capital and stocks, and taken the axe to its base-metals operations, closing a tin plant and a zinc alloy works and halving zinc production at its Ruhr-Zink smelter in Datteln. In addition Mr Neukirchen has to date raised DM2bn from disinvestments - DM1.2bn from Buderus and the balance from smaller disposals - and is holding talks on further sales. Among the assets up for sale are the group's 28,000 sq m head office site in Frankfurt city centre, which could fetch DM750m. The impact of the cost cuts would show through in the results for the fourth quarter of the current financial year, Mr Neukirchen said last week. The group's immense debts should be down to DM5bn by the end of September next year, from DM9.4bn at the end of 1993. 'Bankers' nerves are excellent,' Mr Neukirchen quipped. However pleased with progress in the first seven months, Mr Neukirchen was quite candid about how long it would take for Metallgesellschaft to get back on its feet. 'The problems will take as long to clear up as they took to develop,' he said. The full rationalisation would take five years, Mr Neukirchen indicated, the length of his contract as chairman.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- METALLGESELLSCHAFT: CHRONICLE OF EVENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993 Dec 17: Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, former German Manager of the Year,         ousted from chairmanship with boardroom colleagues; Mr Kajo         Neukirchen takes his place. MG Corp, the group's US trading         subsidiary, has run up DM2.3bn losses in oil futures trading,         and Metallgesellschaft made operating losses of DM500m in         1991-92.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994 Jan 15: Bankers agree to DM3.4bn rescue plan without which         Metallgesellschaft would have gone bankrupt. Feb 24: Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, of Deutsche Bank, defends his role as         chairman of Metallgesellscaft's supervisory board at a special         shareholders' meeting. Shareholders approve rescue and         restructuring plans. May 24: Mr Neukirchen unveils new strategy to supervisory board,         involving concentration of activities on four key areas. Jun 16: Buderus, a profitable engineering subsidiary, sold for DM1.2bn. July 8: Mr Neukirchen reveals that MG Corp's involvement with Castle         Energy will require a provision of a further DM1bn to cover         anticipated losses. The group reports a loss of DM1.54bn for         the six months to the end of March.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

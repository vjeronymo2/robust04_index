			<p>BFN     [Text] Krusevac, Yugoslavia, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 60 billion dollars as a direct or  indirect result of sanctions in the past two years, Serbian  Vice-Premier Slobodan Unkovic said on Thursday.    In order fully to grasp the enormity of the losses, it  should  be said that Yugoslavia's projected national product for 1994  stands at 13 billion dollars, Unkovic, who is also Serbia's  minister of science and technology, told reporters of  influential Bulgarian newspapers who arrived on a three-day  visit to Krusevac, central Serbia, on Thursday.    The United Nations voted the sanctions in place in May 1992  because of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war in  neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Serbian Information Minister Ratomir Vico, who also attended  the talk, said that the only thing Serbian authorities insisted  on in their contacts with foreign media reporters was truthful  reporting.    Vico said that this kind of reporting would give a much more  objective picture of Serbia and Yugoslavia and the situation in  the lands of former Yugoslavia.</p>

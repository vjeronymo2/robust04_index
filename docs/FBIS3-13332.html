The daily AL-QABAS said in its Sunday edition that Muhammad  al-Rumi would return to Doha after celebrations for the end of  Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting.    The paper said, quoting the Kuwaiti foreign ministry, that  al-Rumi had been recalled for talks after television reports in  Doha on the situation in Iraq and the impact of a UN-imposed  embargo.    Kuwait recalled al-Rumi in mid-February and protested to the  Qatar government for allowing the official television to give  airtime to Iraqi leaders.    Apart from Oman, which never broke off links with Iraq,  Qatar  is the only member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to have  renewed ties with Baghdad since its invasion of Kuwait in August  1990 which sparked the Gulf war.</p>

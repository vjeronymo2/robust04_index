Early in the morning several persons, led by City  Administrator V. Gildenberg, showed up in the office of T.  Vadilyeva, the acting head of Sovetskiy Rayon administration.  Two of them wore militia uniforms and were armed. After an  "entertaining" conversation, T. Vadilyeva learned that she had  been removed from the job, and the new appointee was N.  Beletskiy, a former head of the city education department and a  former candidate for a mayor. Our readers may recall that during  the election campaign he stepped down as a candidate in favor of  the current head of administration, V. Cherepkov.    After that, V. Gildenberg, again with an escort, visited  Pervomayskiy Rayon, where the head of administration, V.  Pletnev, was relieved of his duties. His place was taken by V.  Kalenik, a former deputy chairman of Sovetskiy Rayon Soviet.    The same fate befell the head of Leninskiy Rayon  administration S. Zhurmilov, whose chair will now be occupied by  D. Ilyinskiy. One can only tell about him that he is 50 and is a  retired Captain 1st Rank. By the way, S. Zhurmilov did not  accept his dismissal and filed a court complaint.    A strange personnel "reshuffling...." Especially keeping in  mind that not too long ago the head of the Frunzenskiy Rayon  administration was replaced--by a militia officer.</p>

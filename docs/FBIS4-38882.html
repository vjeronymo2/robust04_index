All Avenues to Readers and Listeners Have Been  Cut Off to Opposition Belorussian Journalists"]    [Text] The management of a number of opposition mass media  of Belorussia [Belarus] have been advised about the  impossibility of their further functioning. The Belorussian  Press House, for instance, told Igor Germenchuk, editor of  SVOBODA weekly, that it will not publish his paper while the  Ministry of Communications will not disseminate it through its  channels. Germenchuk received no official explanation, but he  is sure that corresponding orders to the Press House and the  Ministry of Communications have come from the Belorussian  Council of Ministers. According to the editor, such  ill-considered action by government structures has been prompted  by the publication in SVOBODA's latest issue of a letter from a  soldier who told about his participation in servicing a hunting  spree by republic Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich and his  retinue.    Under the pretext of reorganizing the Belorussian National  TV  and Radio Company, two radio stations broadcasting on the state  radio wire network -- Belorusskaya Molodezhnaya and Krinitsa --  have been closed. These facts are not an exception but the  regular attitude by Belorussian official authorities to  independent mass media. It should be recalled that independent  TV companies were not granted the right to broadcast on Channel  8 only until their leadership undertook not to "air any  politics." Attempts were made to close Belorussian private news  agency BELAPAN. After the agency reported a statement by  people's deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko about contacts between top  state officials and representatives of the mafia, a ban was  imposed on using BelaPAN information on the radio. A little  more than a month ago the Information Ministry annulled the  registration certificate of newspaper NOVOSTI BELORUSSKOGO  NARODNOGO FRONTA.</p>

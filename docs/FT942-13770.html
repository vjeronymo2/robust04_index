			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Bid for C&amp;G sharpens banks' interest in building societies Britain's big high street banks said yesterday said that Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society had sharpened their interest in taking over societies in order to win more of the mortgages market. Both Abbey National and TSB Group said they would like to acquire societies. Other banks are watching to see if the High Court allows Lloyds to pay cash to C&amp;G savers and borrowers. Lloyds' agreed bid for C&amp;G, the sixth largest UK society with assets of Pounds 17.7bn, was announced on Thursday and could lead to intensified competition in the mortgage market as well as a restructuring of financial services. BAT Industries, which owns insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, is understood to have been the most serious contender for C&amp;G, apart from Lloyds. Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB chief executive, said his bank, which advanced Pounds 1bn in mortgage lending last year, would be interested in acquiring a building society provided it fitted properly with the bank's branch structure. Mr Ellwood said he believed that Lloyds' bid, under which C&amp;G's 1.4m members would receive payments of between Pounds 500 and Pounds 10,000 each, would 'trigger more changes in the industry' which would improve products sold to UK mortgage customers. Mr Charles Toner, managing director of Abbey National's retail division, said the bank had made clear for some time that it was interested in buying a society if the potential barriers to an acquisition were cleared. 'We would be interested in watching how it develops. There is more than a year to go, and it could face a few hiccups on the way,' said Mr Toner. The legality of Lloyds' offer will be tested in the High Court next month. If the offer is cleared, C&amp;G members will be able to decide in November if they want to accept. Cash payments would be made in the second quarter of 1995. The declarations came as figures were published showing further evidence of recovery in the housing market. Net loans to customers by building societies returned to the levels of last summer at Pounds 960m for the month of March. Societies' net new commitments to lend reached Pounds 3.7bn in March, the highest level since October 1991. But for the fifth month running, societies suffered a net outflow of personal savings as investors withdrew deposits. The increasing difficulty societies have faced in attracting retail funds from savers is one reason why they have lobbied for an increase in the legal limit on the amounts they can raise in wholesale funds. As part of the resulting government review, Treasury ministers and senior officials are supporting proposals to transfer supervision of big building societies to the Bank of England.

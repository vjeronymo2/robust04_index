			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (17): Favoured status for relocation - Bristol Region / There is almost uninhibited development north of the city - posing a challenge to central Bristol After some years in the doldrums, the property market in the Bristol region is beginning to detect a fair wind, fanned by its favoured status for relocation. Mr Edward Cussen, partner in charge at the Bristol surveyors King Sturge, speaks of 'some outstanding development opportunities and signs that demand is increasing.' The most obvious example of relocation is the construction, north of the city, of more than 1m sq ft for the procurement headquarters of the Ministry of Defence. Costing Pounds 254m at 1993 prices, it is designed for 5,700 staff. Another big project nearby, on the Parkway business park, is a 600,000 sq ft headquarters for Sun Life which will house 2,400 staff. Pearce Developments has started infrastructure work for a second Parkway business park on 40 acres. North-east of Bristol, a first phase of 80 acres of commercial development could start soon at Emersons Green. Already well-established in north Bristol is Arlington's 157-acre Aztec West business park, where there are 86 companies. Manager Philip Carter says that in recent months there has been a little more activity in inquiries and commitment. Rents of about Pounds 14 to Pounds 18 a square foot did not fall during the recession, although more flexibility was given on terms. A further example of the almost uninhibited development north of Bristol is Cribbs Causeway, a regional shopping centre planned by Prudential Assurance and JT Baylis. Marks and Spencer and John Lewis, which is moving out of the city centre, will be anchors, accounting for 230,000 sq ft of its 650,000 sq ft. Due to open in 1997 and dependent upon the shopper with a car, Cribbs Causeway would be unlikely to win planning consent today. Together with the surrounding development, it poses a serious challenge to central Bristol, where the main retail centre, Broadmead, is outdated and office demand has been handicapped by limitations on car space. Developers have not hastened to replace outmoded stock and there is now a severe shortage of quality offices in the city. The most recent big relocation was by Direct Line into the 65,000 sq ft Cathedral Square, which leaves little available modern space. One active plan is for Stonecutter Court, where Chesterton is seeking an occupier for a proposed 113,000 sq ft office building. Eaglebrook Properties has consent for Marlborough Gate, with 47,000 sq ft. One speculative but smaller scheme is by Helical Bar at Venturers House, funded by Norwich Union. King Sturge reports rents have held below Pounds 20 per sq ft, but says incentives to tenants are disappearing and it expects that level to be breached with the next wave of development. An important piece of city infrastructure was the opening this year of Bristol Development Corporation's spine road. This gives direct access to a 26-acre retail and leisure complex which is near completion by Wilson Connolly. The BDC's flagship site is Quay Point, a proposed retail, leisure and office scheme of 2m sq ft next to Temple Meads station. Mr Miles Collinge, the corporation's chief executive, envisages the area becoming the business heart of Bristol. Bristol city council, fearful about the impact upon Broadmead of Quay Point, as well as Cribbs Causeway, is making belated plans for its improvement. But King Sturge says there is strong demand for prime sites with rents at Pounds 130 per sq ft. The council is also concerned about the effect of Quay Point on the proposed Harbourside, a long-needed redevelopment of vacant land at Canon's Marsh, on the waterfront. A framework for mixed use has been agreed among the land owners. In south Bristol, redevelopment of the 56-acre redundant Hanson site at Hartcliffe has yet to proceed. To the west, the successful Bristol port and the construction of the second Severn bridge are stimulating large-scale industrial and commercial development at Avonmouth and Severnside. ICI intends to develop 1,500 acres of its landholding there, starting with a distribution park. A 60-acre Severn Gate scheme is proceeding for AMEC Developments and RTZ Estates with Chesterton quoting typical rents at less than Pounds 5 per sq ft with incentives. Close to the port, infrastructure work is finishing on a 30-acre Portbury West business park.</p>

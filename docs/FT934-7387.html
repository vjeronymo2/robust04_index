			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norske Shell says storage tank leak has stopped Norske Shell, the Norwegian unit of the Royal/Dutch Shell group, said yesterday that oil leaking from a storage tank on its NKr2bn Draugen platform had ceased and that traces of oil seen at a joint on another tank had disappeared, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The leak was discovered late on Sunday and production was halted for 36 hours. Norske Shell estimated the volume of oil leaked at less than 10 cu m and said none had been seen on the surface. The tanks are being examined by a camera on an remotely-operated vehicle. 'The authorities are being continuously updated on the results of the investigations. These results are also sent to NC for investigation and use in the efforts to determine the causes, effects and methods of sealing the leakage source,' Shell said.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Flexible friend - Annuities Falling annuity rates have put flexible annuities under the spotlight. These are a radical departure from the conventional annuity where the rate and benefits are fixed at the start. So far, the only providers of flexible annuities are Provident Life and Equitable Life. A flexible annuity allows control over payments and, to some degree, over the underlying investment. There is the option to take tax-free cash, with the balance of the fund invested either in investment-linked or with-profits pension funds. The annuitant receives his payments direct from the fund. This contrasts with a conventional annuity where the life company invests the capital on the annuitant's behalf and, in return, pays a guaranteed income for life. Benefits One of the main disadvantages of a conventional annuity is that the benefits have to be bought at outset. With the flexible version, there is normally no need for guarantees and increases can be funded from investment growth, which should offset the effect of inflation. Conventionally, a spouse's benefits are bought at the start but there are three options with the flexible annuity: The surviving spouse can continue receiving income from the fund. The remaining fund can be paid into an annuity. The balance of the fund can be paid as a lump sum into the annuitant's estate. Since the surviving spouse probably will need an ongoing income, the ability to continue taking the pension from the flexible annuity is an attractive option. Flexibility Unlike conventional annuities, the flexible version allows the annuitant to choose what level of income is paid each year. The only conditions are that the minimum payout is 5 per cent and maximum is 15 per cent of the pension fund. Low annuity rates deter pensioners from buying one because the starting annuity is fixed for life, but flexible annuities allow holders to start drawing a pension without committing themselves to a low-yielding return. The flexible annuity can be converted into a conventional annuity at any time so, if rates rise, the annuitant can take advantage of the more favourable levels. Risk There is no investment problem with conventional annuities, except for with-profits and unit-linked annuities, but flexible annuities will be exposed to considerable investment risk. The fund value will fall if the income taken out exceeds fund growth. This is not a major concern if the difference is small because an annuity is, after all, a sinking fund. But if the annuitant lives for a long time, there will be the risk of triggering an automatic conversion  - if the fund is not sufficent to provide the minimum annuity allowed, then it will be used to buy a conventional one.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, May 24 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. sanctions  have almost completely destroyed the merchant fleet of  Montenegro which accounted for about 20 percent of the  republic's annual foreign currency revenue and five percent of  its entire earnings. Estimates are that the two-year isolation  has caused damages exceeding 200 million dollars to two major  maritime companies: `Prekookeanska Plovidba' of the Adriatic  part of Bar and `Jugooceanija' of Kotor. A total of 37  Montenegrin ships, totalling 977,000 dwt, have been stranded in  various ports throughout the world.    Cargo transport, port reloading and shipbuilding activities  have ground to a complete halt, said Radomir Mugosa, the  secretary of the Association of Maritime Economy in the  Montenegrin Chamber of Economy. He added that the 1993  maintenance costs of ships belonging to `Prekookeanska Plovidba'  and `Jugooceania' and which are stranded in foreign ports  exceeded 50 million dollars. In order to preserve the bulk of  their fleets, the two companies were in 1993 forced to sell two  ships with a dwt of over 80,000.    The port of Bar, which is capable of reloading five million  tonnes of goods, has not had any earnings because no ships have  entered it over the past two years, Mugosa said. He added that  the shipbuilding yard `Veljko Vlahovic,' in Bijela, has also  suspended its activities although it used to overhaul between  80-100 ships before the sanctions.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Observer: Much ado Such are the troubles of Tansu Ciller, Turkey's prime minister, that even a seemingly innocuous family event, such as this week's visit to the US to attend her son's graduation day, is recast as a major crisis. Entirely omitting the real reason for her visit, the country's leading newspaper has made out that it was her husband Ozer, under the heat of scandal allegations, who was fleeing the country to live in America. There have indeed been periodic allusions to business wrongdoing when Ozer was general manager of the collapsed Istanbul Bank, but we are hardly talking Whitewater here. Again, Ozer may use his wife's position to push a few of his business cronies, but he does not appear to have much interest in broader policy questions. She so demonstrably wears the trousers - indeed, she started off by forcing him to take her maiden name, a feisty move, even by western standards. Much more likely is that Ozer means to brush up his American contacts. He was after all franchise-holder in Turkey for the 7-Eleven convenience store chain before he very publicly resigned when his wife took on the Turkish leadership last June.</p>

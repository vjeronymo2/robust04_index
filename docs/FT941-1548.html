			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Money supply speculation sends bunds into tail-spin Wild rumours that German M3 numbers for February would show an annualised increase of 30 per cent sent government bonds there into a tail-spin yesterday, dragging other European markets with them. The figures are due to be published today or tomorrow. The bund market got off to a shaky start following articles in two German newspapers suggesting that market expectations of an annualised rate of around 15 per cent for German M3 were too optimistic. They said the figure was more likely to be between 17 and 20 per cent. Bunds then drew some temporary comfort from the Bundesbank's widely-expected decision to reduce the repo rate by eight basis points to 5.8 per cent, and from the publication of reasonable inflation data for the month to mid-March from North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg. However, towards the late afternoon market fears of another poor M3 number weighed heavily on prices. The June bund future on Liffe fell from the day's best level of 97.05 to trade at 96.26, down 0.24 points on the day but off the day's low of 96.18. Analysts say they would prefer to see an outlandish figure, because this would make a laughing stock of the Bundesbank's policy of targeting medium-term money supply. 'In a way, 30 per cent would be less severe than 18 per cent . . . because it would hail the death of M3 as a target,' said Mr Klaus Baader, senior international economist at Lehman Brothers in London. However, he said a number above 16 per cent would damage the market, since it would cast serious doubt on the Bundesbank's assertions of tax-related special factors to explain the poor numbers in January. Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said a number higher than last month's 21.2 per cent would also damage the market's fragile confidence. The publication of disappointing inflation data for February depressed UK government bonds yesterday morning. The larger than expected rise dampened hopes of an early cut in interest rates, dealers said. The June long gilt future on Liffe fell on the day to 109 3/16 after an intra-day high of 110 15/16 and a low of 108 29/32 . Gilt prices then fell further in the afternoon as anxiety spilled over from continental Europe. However, activity was fairly limited. French government bonds performed slightly better than their European neighbours', buoyed by hopes of a cut in the intervention rate by the Bank of France today. Some analysts were forecasting a cut of between 10 and 15 basis points in the rate, which currently stands at 6.10 per cent. However, others said a widening in yields and a weakening in the French currency, which reflected investor fears on industrial action, gave the Bank of France little scope to cut rates. The June contract on the French 10-year notional bond on the Matif eased 0.2 points to 123.92, in the middle of the day's trading range of 124.14 to 123.84. Uncertainty over the outcome of this weekend's general election kept Italian government bonds on tenterhooks. Traders reported that a private poll suggested the two big groups on the left and the right were likely to catch an equal amount of votes, which would effectively create a stalemate. The June Italian government bond future on Liffe traded slightly higher in the late afternoon, standing 0.10 points up at 110.39, but off the day's best level of 111.14. US Treasury bonds slipped yesterday as the market gave up some of the gains it registered on the heels of the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at 92 1/16 , with the yield rising to 6.877 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 5.025 per cent. The implications of the Fed's new policy dominated activity. Trading was subdued in the aftermath of Tuesday's move to nudge up the key Fed Funds rate - at which banks make overnight loans to one another - by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent. The central bank's decision to lift the Fed Funds target was confirmed in the morning, when it allowed the market's prevailing rate to stand at 3.50 per cent. The day's economic news, though appearing to be favourable, elicited little response. The Commerce Department said orders of durable goods last month slumped 2.5 per cent, against expectations of a half-point decline. Most of the big drop, however, was attributed to flagging orders of aircraft, limiting the impression of a significant slowdown in economic growth. Earlier, prices across the yield curve improved modestly. By late afternoon, however, bonds reversed course and drifted lower despite a fairly good reception for the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in new five-year notes. The issue was awarded at a yield of 5.91 per cent, as expected. On a when-issued basis, the five-year security was trading at a yield of 5.943 per cent soon afterwards.</p>

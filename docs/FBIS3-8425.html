The briefing provided exhaustive information on  yesterday's events and the condition of their patient, Prime  Minister Berov.    According to Col. Milan Petrov's statement and to our great  joy, things are proceeding normally. Col. Petrov said that there  has been an improvement in the patient's state of health as  compared with yesterday, and the doctors hoped that his  situation would continue to improve more quickly during the next  few days.    Dr. Gerasimov was the first doctor who saw Professor Berov  when he was admitted yesterday. After a medical consultation in  which eminent cardiologists took part, the necessary  investigations were carried out, and only then was a diagnosis  made. Dr. Gerasimov agreed that the expression "cardiac crisis"  that was used yesterday did not constitute a diagnosis, but  merely described the state of the patient at the time of  admission. The diagnosis that was announced a short time ago  was a crisis of unstable stenocardia, whose effects the doctors  have succeeded in bringing under control -- that is, a period of  so-called cardiac ischemia. So far, the doctors declared, there  is no sign that Prof. Berov has a developed infarct. The  doctors said they had succeeded in controlling the stenocardia,  but they made the proviso, which we understand, that every  problem follows its own peculiar development.    In answer to a question as to how long their patient would  undergo treatment, the doctors said he would be treated for  15-30 days, depending on whether the heart attack caused any  damage and how the patient's body reacts.    A further question tried unsuccessfully to commit the  medical  team to say whether, following his recovery, Prof. Berov would  be able to return to active political life, Dr. Gerasimov  somewhat jokingly said: I might be able to say if the case was  one of a psychic illness, which is not the case. However, as  far as a heart illness is concerned, following his recovery  every individual can return to the active life he was following  previously. How much of a load he can put on himself is another  question. However, in recent history we have examples of  presidents who have had bypass operations and had other cardiac  complaints.    An explanation was given on another matter that had caused  annoyance to the team of doctors and the Council of Ministers  Press Center -- namely, the headline in a medical journal:  Prime Minister Struck Down by Third Infarct. The medical team  from the Government Hospital declared that, to date, Prof. Berov  had suffered only one infarct, and that was in 1972. In the  present case, the attack had not developed so far as to cause an  infarct.    The briefing continues, and we hope to have more information  later.</p>

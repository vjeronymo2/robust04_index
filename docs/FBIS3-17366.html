Only the battalion's training company still has Chinese-made  Kalashnikov rifles. The battalion's weapon stock also includes  Chinese-made grenade launchers. It uses Soviet-made armored  personnel carriers as combat vehicles.    The 400-strong Kalevi detached infantry battalion comprises  three combat companies, a training company and a service  company, plus mortar, anti-aircraft and anti-tank batteries.    The anti-tank battery is armed with 106-millimeter anti-tank  guns. Also the mortar unit is adequately armed. But the anti-  aircraft battery still has no anti-aircraft machine guns despite  that the battery's commander and soldiers have received the  necessary training, Laaneman told reporters.    The commander of the battalion pointed out shortage of  officers as one of the causes why the unit still is unable to  show proper combat readiness, for instance, in gathering by  alarm. Three military advisers from Finland currently stay with  the battalion to assist in training the force.    The Kalevi battalion was set up on March 18, 1992. On May 22  the same year the battalion took over from the Soviet forces a  military college complex at Jagala, some 40 km to the east of  Tallinn, where it is stationed now. A separate unit, the  Northern detached infantry company, was set up with the Kalevi  battalion in the fall of 1993. The company at present is  stationed in the former Soviet military base town of Paldiski.</p>

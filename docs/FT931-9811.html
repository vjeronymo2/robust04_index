			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / People: Analyst-go-round The move of John Aitken, the City's top-rated banking analyst, from NatWest Securities to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew should mean that the merry-go-round in City banking analysts has probably come to a stop for the moment. It started a year ago when Nick Collier, Hoare Govett's banking analyst, moved to Morgan Stanley. His move left Hoare vulnerable since it was broker to Lloyds Bank. It then recruited Peter Toeman and Steven Thorn, the City's number two banking team, from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Shortly afterwards, David Poutney, the other member of the UBS team, left along with Terry Smith, who was head of research and a well-known bank-watcher. They have joined Collins Stewart, a small firm of brokers. Aitken's move to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - he used to work for P&amp;D some years ago - plugs an obvious gap in its research team. Meanwhile, Aitken's deputy, Mark Eady, will continue to research the banks for NatWest Securities. ***** Adam Murza, a former editor of the Estates Times and veteran City property analyst, has quit stockbroking and joined Guardacre Group, an unquoted property investment company.</p>

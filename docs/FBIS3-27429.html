Since 1992, China has promulgated and implemented the  "Patent  Law," the "Trademark Law," the "Copyright Law," the "Law Against  Unfair Competition," and other laws and statutes; and has joined  the world IPR organization, the Paris Convention for protecting  industrial property rights, the World Copyright Convention, and  the Patent Cooperation Agreement; thereby establishing a  world-class system for protecting IPR. At the seminar,  officials from the U.S. Justice Department and Customs explained  the enforcement of U.S. legislation to protect IPR, and offered  suggestions on how China could protect IPR. The seminar was  attended by representatives from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, the State Science and Technology  Commission, and other ministries and commissions concerned.  Officials from the State Copyright Bureau and Trademark Bureau  gave briefings on the protection of copyright and the  implementation of the trademark law in China, as well as  measures being taken in these areas.</p>

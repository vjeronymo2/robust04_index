			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Enron thwarted in North Sea gas move Enron, one of the largest US gas companies, has been thwarted in its attempt to buy a block of North Sea gas production from Chevron. The co-venturers - British Gas, Phillips Petroleum and Agip - have exercised their pre-emption rights. The operating agreement allows them to pre-empt for the same cash value as any offer received by Chevron. British Gas said that the purchase was not intended to keep a competitor out of the market but was made to secure further gas supplies. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcement by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) High </F> Command to members of the Rwandan Government Armed Forces;  issued in Mulindi on 18 April]    [Excerpts] Members of the Armed Forces of Rwanda, members  of the national Gendarmerie, fellow countrymen, sons and  daughters of our common motherland. Following the death of the  head of state, President Juvenal Habyarimana at the hands of the  clique opposed to the Arusha peace agreement and determined to  maintain the grip of dictatorship on our country, that clique,  using members of the Presidential Guard, Interahamwe and  Impuzamigambi, the militias of CDR [Coalition for the Defense of  the Republic] and MRND [Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development] parties, and some members of the  regular army and gendarmerie, turned against sections of the  civilian population, considered by MRND and CDR as opponents,  and tried to completely exterminate them instigating the  violence with ethnic sectarianism. [passage omitted]    We call upon you once again to take very urgent steps to  preserve yourselves from the imminent destruction towards which  the clique of murderers is pushing you. Let us join hands,  instead, in shoving that clique from power.    We repeat our assurances that we shall not attack any member  of the government Armed Forces who do not fight us.    We also call upon you members of the Armed Forces of Rwanda  to stop discarding your uniforms and disguising yourselves in  civilian population. Come out confidently and rest assured that  you will be treated honorably as appropriate instructions have  already been communicated to all the authorities concerned,  regarding the manner of the reception. Our desire is that we  shall in due course cooperate in forming a new national army  responsible for maintaining public security.    In order to avoid the recurrent [word indistinct] bloodshed  in our country, let he who has ears hear, let he who has eyes  see. We have no doubt whatsoever that the majority amongst you  have the wisdom and foresight to take the correct decision now.  Thank you.    Signed, Major General Paul Kagame, Chairman, Rwandan  Patriotic Army High Command.    [Dated] 18 April, Mulindi</p>

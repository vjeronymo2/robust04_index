			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashok Mitra: "A Banana Republic Takes Shape; </F> Where is India Heading?"; all quotation marks as published]    [Text] The banana republic connotes a set of ground  realities. But it also mirrors a certain frame of mind: notions  are turned upside down, irrationality becomes rationality,  insult is taken to be accolade. This is the state we, it would  seem, have finally managed to reach.    The American administration chose to downgrade our Prime  Minister's week-long sojourn to God's Own Country. Unlike on all  previous occasions, this time it was not reckoned as a State  visit; our Head of Government was given the treatment reserved  for minor foreign dignitaries who are entitled to only some  minimal courtesies.  <H5>  Propitiation </H5>   We lumped that, in order to propitiate the US administration  we chose to suspend, even if, as our Government claims, only  temporarily -- our missile test firing programme. We also rushed  through a new telecommunications policy which will gladden the  heart of US transnational corporations. Our spokesman and our  media were under instructions to make great play of the fact  that the Prime Minister was invited to address a joint session  of the US Congress.    Between the Senate and the House of Representatives, the  Congress consists of 535 members. Of them, not even 40 bothered  to be present and listen to the Indian Prime Minister's address;  the empty seats of the chamber, had to be filled by minions from  the Indian Embassy and their family members and by some of the  officials from new Delhi who constituted the Prime Minister's  entourage.    Even the press gallery was principally occupied by the  plane-load of journalists the Prime Minister had taken along  with him. The visit of the Indian Prime Minister and his  perorations at New York, Houston, Boston and Washington, D.C.  were blacked out by the American media. This was not deliberate,  but matter of course. A banana republic is taken for granted.    India was no longer the ogre leading the great non-aligned  movement. There was no Krishna Menon around to incense,  Time magazine by his forked tongue, and this puny  visitor from a diminished country was no Jawaharlal Nehru or  Indira Gandhi.    At the joint press conference following his session in the  Oval Room with the US President, our Prime Minister was cut to  size; he was simply ignored by the media. Only one American  journalist chose to ask him a question; that was on the human  rights situation in Kashmir, and the answer he gave was received  with unconcealed disbelief.    The rest of the time, the Prime Minister of the world's  largest democracy was a mute onlooker, even as correspondent  after correspondent kept targeting a barrage of questions at the  US President, not on US-Indian relations, but on his domestic  health programme, on Haiti, on China's MFN (Most Favoured  Nation) status, on the domestic interest rate structure, and so  on.    But Clinton spoke a few polite words about our country;  these  were obligatory for the occasion. He was, however, in no  generous mood; he left none in doubt that the American  administration would continue to harass New Delhi on the issues  of nuclear non-proliferation, regional disarmament, Kashmir and  human rights; there was going to be no switching off of the heat  following the visit.    His promise to send two special emissaries -- the Secretary  of Commerce and the Energy Secretary -- in the course of the  year is not bereft of significance either; one Secretary will  press India to allow further market access to US goods and  services; the other one is to ensure that the Indian authorities  do not renege at the last moment their pledge to buy dozens and  dozens of obsolete power plants from the United States and  additionally guarantee American investors a minimum rate of  return of 16 per cent.    This is precisely where the state of the mind becomes  relevant. All sensitivities are spent. The banana republic does  not even realise that it is at the receiving end of the banana  republic treatment. Every insult is regarded as a benediction.  <H5>  A Dream World </H5>   The Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy misses  the import of the adage that dignity is as dignity does; as he  emerges from his tete-a-tete with the US President, he  gloatingly informs the world press that, look, there has been no  twisting of his arm. No Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi could  have imagined that an Indian Prime Minister was capable of  sinking to such a grovelling level.    But a banana republic has its own code. It lives in its own  illusory world. The block of press people who accompanied the  Prime Minister would, for the next month and thereabouts, write  dutiful columns on what a thundering success the Prime  Minister's American safari was, on the umpteen points he  succeeded in scoring off Pakistan, on how well his speeches went  down with the US audiences, on how American industrialists and  businessmen were totally bowled over when our Prime Minister  described to them the limitless possibilities of the market  India offered, on how our Prime Minister's quote from Abraham  Lincoln completely befuddled a nondescript US State Department  official named Raphel.    Such is the banana republic state of the mind or, if one  were  to use that state-of-the-art expression, mind-set. A banana  republic assumes itself to be the centre of the universe. The  reality is that it is nobody. It gets accustomed to the role of  a vassal State, but imagines the serfdom to be sovereignty. Its  press becomes excruciatingly conformist. We are currently  witnessing the unfolding of this phenomenon.  <H5>  Act of Accommodation </H5>   Our Government, if we have to go by our media, can do no  wrong, and the Americans, thanks to the Prime Minister's visit,  have shed all their reservations about our country; even on  Kashmir and the nuclear business, the Americans, it will be  asserted, have been most understanding. A surrender to foreign  pressure, don't you know, is not really surrender, but an act of  accommodation. The lingo itself undergoes a transformation. We  no longer talk of a suspension of our missile development  programme, we merely `cap' it.    The banana republic has arrived, and it has brought along  with it a new manual of manners and norms. The poor have dropped  out of the nation's conscience. The nation itself is now defined  in terms of the foibles and predilections of the top 10 or 15  per cent of the social stratum. The latter dream American and  think America. Their priorities determine official policy.  Thanks to the spate of economic reforms since 1991; this upper  crust had never had it so good; the consumerist arcadia they  have attained has, therefore, to be protected at all cost.    The high living of the upper classes has been made possible  by interminable borrowings from foreign parties; such borrowings  have been contingent upon letting go, in substantial measure,  bits and pieces of the nation's economic sovereignty. The  surrender of economic prerogatives cannot but endanger political  sovereignty as well, as we are increasingly likely to learn in  the course of the next few months; President Clinton has  promised as much. But the upper crust mind-set is not disturbed.    This mind-set expresses itself only in cliches:  globalisation  is good; we must integrate with the world; the market must be  free; there is no substitute for efficiency; privatisation  promotes efficiency.    What good globalisation has till now done to the country is  a  query this mind-set feels no need to respond to; the fact that  such data as are available suggest that efficiency in the Indian  public sector units as a whole, measured by the rate of return,  has in recent years been much higher than in the private sector  does not impress them. Nor do they like to be detained by such  abstractions as loss of national sovereignty.    Since they never had it so good, why should they worry  whether their country has been reduced to the state of a banana  republic and, anyway, what is wrong with being a banana republic?    The Prime Minister and his entourage perhaps know better.  But  they have their private concerns. The model they have opted for,  they know, is unsustainable without a continuous, and rising  inflow of foreign funds. In past decades, such funds were  arranged on a government-to-government basis, with some  master-of ceremonies role on the part of the World Bank. The  cessation of the Cold War has ended the chapter of  government-to-government munificence. Private capital inflows  now offer the only possibility of escape.    The wretched foreigners are, however, not coming in droves,  and they are not investing in growth. American business and  industry are playing hard. India is an eleventh-rate country  which does not hold their interest. They will come only if their  charter of demands is fully granted, and perhaps not even then.  There is no evidence that the Americans ever helped any banana  republic to develop into an economically strong nation. It is  the fate of a banana republic to continue to be a dependent  territory.  <H5>  The Suffering Many </H5>   The upper crust will not mind that state of being, but will  they be able to hold down the nation's overwhelming majority who  will get nothing; absolutely nothing, out of the emerging social  end economic arrangements? The Prime Minister may keep visiting  the United States oftener, US officials may increase the  frequency of their visits to our shores, the answer to the  riddle however lies within the country itself.</p>

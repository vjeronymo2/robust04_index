			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Land Securities edges ahead to Pounds 118.9m - Pounds 2.9m boost from sale of investment properties LAND SECURITIES, the UK's biggest property company, yesterday lifted its interim dividend as pre-tax profits edged ahead to Pounds 118.9m for the six months to the end of September. The outcome compared with a previous Pounds 116.5m. Earnings per share were ahead from 16.58p to 17.22p; the dividend is lifted by 4.8 per cent from 6.3p to 6.6p. Excluding the Pounds 2.9m proceeds on the sale of investment properties, pre-tax profit was almost unchanged at Pounds 116m (Pounds 116.2m). Net rental income improved from Pounds 187.6m to Pounds 192m. Mr Peter Hunt, chairman and managing director, said the results confirmed his view that, until rental growth fed through into higher rents, net revenue from the group's existing portfolio was likely to remain flat. He described the recovery as slow and fragile. Rents were continuing to fall in central London, but increased enquiries and a falling level of high quality space suggested that 'rental levels for the best property may be close to reaching a floor.' The group, which in May raised Pounds 140m for new property investment through a convertible bond issue, spent or committed Pounds 70m on purchases during the six months. The biggest purchase was the Bridges Shopping Centre in Sunderland. At the end of September it had just over Pounds 295m of funds available for future acquisitions, developments and refurbishments. Net interest payable rose from Pounds 59m to Pounds 65.1m. Mr Hunt said the group had made considerable progress in reducing voids from about 4 per cent of the rent roll to 3 per cent, excluding vacant buildings held for future development. The group would continue its policy of cutting the level of voids and overheads, rebalancing its portfolio with retail and industrial/warehouse acquisitions, and keeping its property in the best possible condition.</p>

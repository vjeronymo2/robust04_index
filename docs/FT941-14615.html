			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Metal prices edge lower - Market report London Metal Exchange base metal markets mostly edged lower yesterday following the recent bull run. ALUMINIUM prices marked time for much of the session as investors awaited news from the multilateral talks in Brussels on stemming the present oversupply. The talks are continuing today and may be extended if no conclusion is reached. At the LME the three months aluminium price ended kerb trading at Dollars 1,208.50 a tonne, down Dollars 7.50 on the day. ZINC kept its rise going, the three months position putting on Dollars 5 to close at Dollars 1,039.50 a tonne, as the market continued to ignore the inexorable rise in LME warehouse stocks. Traders explained that speculative interest was being sucked into the market by the perception that smelter cutbacks would happen soon. At the London precious metals market spot SILVER lost 6 cents of Monday's 13-cent rise to close at 525.5 cents a troy ounce and gold fell Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 391.25 an ounce after recoiling from stiff resistance at Dollars 393. Chartists said there was support for silver at Dollars 5.25 an ounce and although the market was becoming overbought. London COCOA futures closed lower, erasing some of the gains made over the previous few days, while COFFEE recouped early losses.

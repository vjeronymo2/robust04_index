			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Oregon state corrections director Michael Francke was found stabbed to death  near his office in what was "definitely a homicide," the state medical examiner  said. State Police Supt. Emil Brandaw said there were no suspects in the  slaying and his department offered unprecedented police protection to other  state officials until more was known about the case. Francke, 42, who as head  of corrections was charged with overseeing the largest prison expansion in  state history in response to severe overcrowding, was found dead near his  office on the grounds of the Oregon State Hospital in Salem.  </P></p>

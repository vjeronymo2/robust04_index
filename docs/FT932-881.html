			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Call for UN rights post THE United Nations world human rights conference ended in Vienna yesterday evening with the adoption of a grand declaration designed to give a new impetus to the protection and promotion of international human rights. The declaration approved by the conference, reaffirmed the principle that human rights were 'universal, indivisible, and interdependent'. However, they failed to agree on a controversial call for the appointment of a UN Human Rights Commissioner to monitor and promote human rights. As weary delegates from over 160 countries raced to reach a consensus on a final declaration, debates continued to reflect deep differences of opinion on what constitutes human rights and the best way to promote them. The differences were most marked between the developed north and developing south. On Thursday, Islamic and African states separately and sucessfully demanded that the meeting adopt strongly-worded declarations on Bosnia and Angola. This broke a tacit agreement that specific countries should not be mentioned. The moves threw the conference, which opened two weeks ago, into confusion and delayed proceedings on a final declaration. The conference also adopted a declaration calling for the immediate sending of aid to Angola and an end to the country's civil war. Developing countries were concerned that the appointment of a commissioner would strengthen what they see as western bias and lead to intrusion in their domestic affairs. To meet their criticisms the declaration also recognised the right to development as a basic human right. But a joint statement from some of the 1,500 non-governmental organisations at the meeting said the declaration failed to commit governments to measures to protect and promote human rights.</p>

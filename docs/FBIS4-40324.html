			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- A session of the  coordinating Council of the "Pro Moldova" republican movement  was held today in Chisinau. Vasile Stati, doctor of history,  was elected president of the movement. Arcadi Dziubinschi [name  as received], one of the movement's leaders, declared to BASA  that after the first year of activity "Pro Moldova" has about  500 followers. "We fight for the consolidation of Moldova's  sovereignty, recognition of the notions of `Moldovan people' and  `Moldovan language'," stressed Dziubinschi. He declared that  "Pro Moldova" is not a party-like movement and is opened to the  representatives of any political formation. "We are ready to  accept into our organizations even the representatives of the  People's Front -- of course all those who would reject the  ideals of unification," declared Dziubinschi. In his opinion,  "Pro Moldova" is unique because it is the first time a political  movement has given priority to the idea of "Moldovanism."</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Troubled German group to meet banks next week Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based conglomerate, has brought forward a planned meeting with its bankers to discuss the full extent of its liquidity problems. Frankfurt bankers said yesterday that preliminary talks between the company and leading bankers had taken place in New York this week. Following these talks Mr Kajo Neukirchen, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, decided to invite all its bank creditors to a meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week, bringing the date forward from January 10. The fact that the meeting will take place earlier than expected indicates the group's problems are more serious than expected, bankers said. But Metallgesellschaft refused to comment yesterday on an advance report from the next issue of the Spiegel news magazine that Mr Neukirchen would seek a full-scale moratorium on group debt estimated at a gross DM8bn (Dollars 4.6bn) in order to stave off insolvency. Metallgesellschaft, a conglomerate with activities ranging from mining and metals to engineering and raw materials trading, said management was working intensively on 'damage control and possibilities for a solution' to problems which had arisen through the oil trading activities of MG Corp, its US trading subsidiary. Details would be presented to bankers next week, the company added. Commenting on the report in the Spiegel, Metallgesellschaft said the DM8bn level of indebtedness applied to the group as a whole, was offset by considerable liquid resources, and was not unusual for a group which derived around half its annual turnover of DM27bn from trading activities. Full details of Metallgesellschaft's indebtedness have not been disclosed - the group has not published a balance sheet for the financial year to September 1993. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch said in November, before he was ousted as chief executive, that the ratio of equity to debt was 20 per cent. Metallgesellschaft's liquidity problems, which led earlier this month to the forced departure of Mr Schimmelbusch and five further board directors, stem from the oil futures trading activities of MG Corp on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex). No details have been released but it seems likely that MG Corp contracted forward to buy up to 160m barrels of oil in anticipation of rising oil prices. But sharply falling oil prices have triggered steep margin calls - cash payouts - with Nymex which are not necessarily covered by hedging arrangements. The cash payouts forced Mr Schimmelbusch to turn to bankers to solve what were then described as temporary liquidity problems. Lex, Page 12</p>

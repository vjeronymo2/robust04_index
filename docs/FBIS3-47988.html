			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today North Korea proposed in a telephone message  that it would send a condolence team of the National Alliance  for the Country's Reunification [Pomminnyon] to the bier of the  late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, but the government has decided not to  accept it.    National Unification Board spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said in a  commentary issued this afternoon that because Pomminnyon is  defined as an organization benefiting the enemy in accordance  with a final ruling made by the Supreme Court in 1992, and  because of the aggravated situation between North and South  Korea caused by the North Korean nuclear issue, North Korea's  proposal would not be helpful to improving North-South relations  at all. According to this judgment, the government has decided  to refuse the proposal.</p>

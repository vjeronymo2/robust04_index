			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swedish paper groups stage rally STORA and MoDo, two of Sweden's top three forest products companies, yesterday reported improved first-half results despite what they described as persistent weak demand and prices in their European markets. Stora, the leading pulp and paper group in Europe, returned to the black, showing a profit after financial items of SKr30m (Dollars 3.7m) compared with a loss in the same 1992 period of SKr163m. Sales totalled SKr25.3bn, compared with SKr24.3bn. MoDo cut its loss after financial items to SKr353m from SKr518m last year, on sales of SKr8.4bn (SKr8.2bn), and announced plans for a one-for-two rights issue in the autumn to raise about SKr1.7bn. This, it said, would help the company to take advantage of any upturn in the industry. The turnround at Stora came despite a sharp fall in operating income to SKr440m from SKr707m. It was attributed to a sharp cut in net financial expenses, to SKr410m from SKr870m, caused by falling interest rates and a rise in contributions from the group's financial services unit. Stora said it had pushed ahead with a heavy rationalisation programme in the first half, achieving cost reductions of SKr1.3bn as employee numbers fell to 34,600 compared with 39,800 a year ago. In addition, there were savings of SKr700m from divestments and volume declines. But it said the effects of these were disguised in the half-year results by exchange rate losses of SKr2.8bn, incurred when the costs of foreign units were translated into the weaker Swedish krona. Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said: 'We do not expect any substantial changes in the market that will effect our result for all of 1993. What we have achieved so far was because of internal actions and lower interest rates.' Mr Bernt Lofs, head of MoDo, agreed that the industry continued to suffer from weak demand, low prices and overcapacity in western Europe. He warned that MoDo, which pushed up operating profits in the first half to SKr346m from SKr59m, would incur a further loss in the second half of the year. But he added that there were signs that the worst of the recession was over. The planned rights issue, to be priced at SKr120 per share, would give MoDo the financial strength to take advantage of an upturn. The issue will apply to existing holders of ordinary shares and convertible participating notes.</p>

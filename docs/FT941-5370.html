			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Ukraine rejects Black Sea fleet deal in gas row The commander of Ukraine's navy has repudiated last September's accord which transferred the Black Sea Fleet from joint Russian-Ukrainian jurisdiction to exclusively Russian control. The move comes as relations between the two Slav neighbours deteriorate because of heavy cuts in Russian gas supplies to Ukraine and tension over the status of the Russian-dominated Crimean region of Ukraine. Russia has used Ukraine's Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn) energy debt as leverage to gain Ukraine's share of the 350-vessel fleet based in Ukraine. But Russia, which is in deep economic difficulties, is now calling in the energy debt, leaving Ukraine with little to lose by refusing to hand over the fleet. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, is also threatening to renege on a deal to give up his country's nuclear arsenal. As Russia's gas giant Gazprom announced further deep gas cuts to Ukraine over the weekend, Mr Kravchuk said in Washington that 'fulfilment of all agreements, including agreements on nuclear commitments, is possible only if the economy works. If tomorrow factories come to a halt in Ukraine, and this is a reality if there is no gas, what carrying out of commitments can be spoken of?' However, the official news agency Itar Tass said yesterday that the first 60 of the 1,600 warheads due to be shipped out of Ukraine arrived on a train in Russia on Saturday. On Friday, Russia's nuclear energy ministry said that it had begun to supply low-enriched uranium to Ukraine, thus honouring its part of the agreement reached in Moscow in January between Ukraine, Russia and the US. Meanwhile, in the naval port of Sevastopol, Vice-Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainyi, who took part in last September's talks on the Black Sea Fleet, said the Ukrainian side was now demanding a reversion to a 1992 agreement, under which the fleet would be divided by the end of 1995. Ukraine is building up a separate fleet, just five ships so far. It claims most of those serving in the fleet are Ukrainian, though most officers are Russian. Ukraine trade pact, Page 3</p>

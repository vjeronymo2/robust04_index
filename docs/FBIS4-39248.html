			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korneyeva: "Formal Minimum Wage and Real </F> Earnings Are Different Things..."]    [Text] A lively discussion ensued at yesterday's  meeting of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet's Planning and Budget  Commission upon presentation of the Republic of Tatarstan  Government draft "On the Minimum Wage," which envisages,  beginning 1 July, setting the minimum wage at R50,000 instead of  the current R30,000.    The arguments in favor of the draft law submitted by the  Tatarstan Government, which were incorporated in the report of  Deputy Prime Minister Ravil Muratov, boiled down to the  following: It is necessary to raise the minimum wage in order to  avoid a sharp decline in the republic population's standard of  living because of a sharp jump in prices. However, the presenter  noted, we cannot allow the Unified Pay Scale level I salary to  be set at R50,000, since it will cause leveling in labor  remuneration of the workers in the budget and production spheres  and may lead to social tensions.    Planning and Budget Commission Chairman Geliy Kobelev and  the  Tatarstan people's deputies did have strong objections, which  they voiced to the presenter. As one of the opponents justly  noted, one can issue a directive to set the minimum wage at  R100,000 or even R1 million, but what will it change in  principle if enterprises do not have money and back pay is owed  for months? So what is the point of adopting another law that  will not work? It is already clear that setting the minimum wage  at R30,000 did not result in raising the average wage in  February-May.    Meanwhile, questions arise when these categories are  compared  in Russia and Tatarstan. With the minimum wage in the Russian  Federation being R14,600, in March the average wage rose to over  R170,000, while in our republic, where the minimum is set much  higher, average earnings amount to only R140,000.    The commission came to the conclusion that the materials  attached to the draft law do not contain sufficient analysis of  the consequences and do not identify the sources to cover the  attendant additional budget expenditures.    If we are to accept such a draft law, it needs clear  justification that will take into account the interests of  industrial enterprises, first and foremost the defense industry.    The preliminary analysis as to what raising the minimum wage  will produce is already taking shape. And it is far from  optimistic. If the law is adopted, the taxable base will  inevitably shrink, which means losses for the revenue part of  the budget, which are estimated to exceed R200 billion. Overall,  additional expenditures and loss of income are estimated at R350  billion, or R50 million a month with the actual budget revenue  being an average of R80 billion monthly. This means that the  government will have to take some steps to increase the budget  revenue.    The deputies were unanimous in the opinion that this draft  law once again will not affect the pay of the budget sphere  workers, since the proposal is to adopt it without taking into  account the Unified Pay Scale. It will, however, necessitate  changes in the Tatarstan law "On the Republic of Tatarstan  Budget System for 1994," since the 2.5-fold wage raise for  budget organizations, which is built into the budget, is pegged  on a minimum wage of no more than R30,000 until the end of the  year.    It was also quite reasonably pointed out that our entire  legislative base is pegged on the minimum wage, and in the event  this law passes, fines calculated on a factor of R50,000 will  become astronomical, which actually will lead to a result  directly opposite that intended -- decline in the population's  income. To this Ravil Muratov offered a compromise solution:  Since Russian Federation laws are in effect on the Tatarstan  territory, fines may be applied on the basis of the Russian  minimum wage, that is, R14,600. The presenter's reasoning was  not accepted, however.    As one of the deputies remarked, with this draft law we once  again attempt to cure the symptoms rather than the disease. And  the disease is the republic's extremely difficult economic  situation. The program of anticrisis measures, which the  deputies had instructed the government to develop before 25 May,  was supposed to help. Instead, they offered to discuss only the  draft of "Priority Measures for Stabilization of Republic of  Tatarstan Economy." But this document -- the substance of which  was presented at the commission meeting by Filza Khamidullin, a  deputy prime minister and the chairman of the State Committee  for Economics and Forecasting -- also raised serious questions  among the deputies.    In Geliy Kobelev's opinion, the draft of "Priority  Measures..." lacks clarity and specifics in such critically  important matters as overcoming the insolvency crisis, bringing  down the rate of production decline, providing guarantees for  the timely payment of wages, and the operation of the bills of  exchange system. The commission returned the draft law "On the  Minimum Wage" for modifications and recommended to consider it  simultaneously with the draft law on the adjusted budget.</p>

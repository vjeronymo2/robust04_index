			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pascon in Pounds 28m buy-out from BTR The management of Pascon has paid Pounds 28m to buy the scaffolding and plant hire business from BTR, its former parent. The buy-out team raised a total of Pounds 33.5m, including a Pounds 5m loan for future capital investment. 3i, the venture capital group, provided Pounds 12.5m, a further Pounds 11m was provided by National Westminster Bank while Lombard Business Finance invested Pounds 10m. The business, established in 1880, claims to be the country's oldest scaffolding concern still operating. Management, led by Mr Keith Bright, managing director, is thought to have acquired a stake of more than 50 per cent in the company. Pascon also manufactures pumps as well as hiring scaffolding and other equipment to the construction and allied industries from a national network of 30 branches. The buy-out was negotiated by Price Waterhouse which said that Pascon's main markets were showing steady signs of recovery which had led to a rise in orders and customer inquiries. Pascon, which is thought last year to have earned pre-tax profits approaching Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 38m, is forecasting higher profits in the current year. Mr Bright said the forecast was underpinned by scaffolding contract work worth Pounds 8m already in hand. Plant hire revenues also were running at record levels, while orders at the company's pump manufacturing subsidiary were the best for four years.</p>

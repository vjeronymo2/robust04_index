			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Unions at Swans claim EU victory Unions representing former Swan Hunter employees claimed a significant legal victory yesterday when a Newcastle industrial tribunal decided that it could consider claims that the British government had failed to implement European directives. The shipyard unions had brought a case at the tribunal against the employment secretary alleging that the government had not paid in full 'protective awards' won on behalf of 420 redundant Swan Hunter employees at a tribunal last September. The awards, made under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, were made in compensation for the receivers' failure to give 90 days' consultation before making job cuts after they were called in, in May 1993. After the tribunal's decision Mr Christopher Vajda, counsel for the employment secretary, said an appeal would be lodged. The European Court of Justice ruled in June that the government had failed to implement properly the collective redundancies directive which requires that there be a proper sanction against employers who fail adequately to consult on redundancies. A ruling by the court in 1990 held that when a member state is in breach of its obligations, citizens who have suffered losses as a result can pursue claims for damages against their government. The government maintains that these cases - called Francovich awards - should be heard only in the High Court. Yesterday's tribunal decision means that the way is now open for UK claimants to pursue a much less costly route for claiming damages, said Mr Stefan Cross of Brian Thompson &amp; Partners, representing four of the five unions involved . Mr Cross said this tribunal decision, unless overturned, would also provide a potential alternative redress for employees aggrieved by changes to their contracts under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981. The Newcastle tribunal is now hearing the unions' claim, itself a test case on insolvency, that the department should not have based its calculations on eight weeks' deducted money, instead of 12, paid in lieu of notice. Most of the 420 workers received little or nothing, but if the unions win, some could gain Pounds 5,000. The employment department is involved because, on receivership, it assumes many responsibilities to employees. Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, sole prospective bidder for Swan Hunter as a going concern, said yesterday its latest offer to the receivers included payment of the design team until the end of this year. Swans' order book ends in November and receivers Price Waterhouse must decide soon whether to make redundant the 100-strong design team, needed for future tenders.</p>

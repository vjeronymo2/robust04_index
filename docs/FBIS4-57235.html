			<p>BFN     [Text] The Carabineros building was again the center of  attention in view of [Carabineros Director] General Stange's  return. For the second consecutive day, Gen. Stange, who is  still on leave, went to his office where he met with members of  the Carabineros Superior Advisory Council.    Gen. Carlos Pecchi, the Carabineros Legal Department chief,  stated later that there is no legal reason why Gen. Stange  should not return to duty on 17 May, adding that this is what he  will do.    The Chilean Communist Party mouthpiece EL SIGLO has reported  that Stange's return would prompt a cabinet crisis that will  culminate in the resignation of Interior Minister German Correa.    [Begin recording] [Correa] That is not true. I will not  answer reports published in EL SIGLO which is completely  misinformed and has no idea of what is happening in this country.    [First unidentified reporter] Do you believe there is a  campaign against you or your administration?    [Correa] No, but obviously there are some who dislike my  presence at the Interior Ministry.    [Second unidentified reporter] What is the government's  reaction to statements by [Stange's] Lawyer Pablo Rodriguez who  insists that Gen. Stange will resume his post on 17 May.    [Correa] I have carefully not commented on this to avoid  making it a household issue. It is a delicate issue that the  government is handling with the required prudence. [end  recording]    Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister secretary general of the  government, held an unscheduled meeting with Defense Minister  Edmundo Perez Yoma.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] It seems Gen. Stange's return  is  imminent. What is the government's stance regarding his return.    [Rebolledo] I decline to comment on future developments. We  are obviously discussing the issue. [end recording]    Some hours later, Minister Rebolledo again discussed the  issue in Temuco.    [Begin Rebolledo recording] Gen. Stange should stay away  from  the Carabineros headquarters while the case is under  investigation and remain on leave. [end recording]    The issue continued to be discussed at the Presidential  Resort in Cerro Castillo in Vina del Mar where Interior Minister  German Correa held meetings with Coalition of Parties for  Democracy leaders and legislators. During this meeting, Correa  stated that the Carabineros had officially informed him that  Gen. Stange will resume his duties on 17 May.</p>

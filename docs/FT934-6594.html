			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: A mafiosi 'Boccanegra' - Opera in Frankfurt For the first time since the war, Germany's orchestras and opera companies are having to justify their existence - no more so than in Frankfurt. The era of limitless state subsidy has come to an abrupt end. Recession is biting hard, cutbacks are under way. The Frankfurt Opera faces a reduction in subsidy over the next four years from DM66m (Pounds 26m) to DM48m (Pounds 19m). The number of salaried staff is to be reduced by 22 per cent, and new productions will probably drop from six to three per season. This is a tough prescription for a city that counts itself one of Germany's major musical centres. The only consolation is that Frankfurt is not alone, and no company is being forced to close. According to the Frankfurt Opera's managing director, Martin Steinhoff, the cuts will fall wherever possible on the administrative rather than artistic side. He says the company is being as pragmatic as possible, but criticises the city government for slashing services for taxpayers, while keeping its own 26,000-strong bureaucracy virtually intact. None of this affected Simon Boccanegra, the first home-grown production since the arrival of Sylvain Cambreling as music director at the start of the season. Musical standards were high, the staging looked expensive. It was a good choice of opera, because Simon Boccanegra is little known in Germany. That did not prevent Matthias Langhoff - a well-established drama producer in Berlin and Paris - from trying to rewrite the story. Verdi's patricians and plebeians became the mafiosi of modern Italy; Renaissance intrigue became today's corruption. The prologue took place on the harbour-front of postwar Genoa, complete with cranes, ships' prows, dockers and prostitutes. Act one opened on a seaside terrace, Amelia making her entrance in a red swimsuit. The Doge's council chamber was transformed into a champagne reception for Boccanegra's business associates. The final act was set in front of a dockside pizzeria. Some of this made interesting theatre, if only because of the alienating devices incorporated into Jean-Marc Stehle's semi-realistic stage pictures. But Langhoff's approach never rang true. Verdi's humane Doge emerged as a godfather, devoid of moral authority and corrupted by power. Instead of probing the inner psychology of the characters, Langhoff trivialised them, overloading the stage with cheap and irritating detail, contradicting the music and confusing an already complex plot. But thanks to Cambreling, the music was never swamped. The shifting moods were precisely characterised, the instrumental colours vividly brought to life. It was good to hear orchestra and chorus in such good shape. John Brocheler made a tall, handsome Boccanegra; there was nothing particularly Italianate about his singing, except its conviction. Harald Stamm gave a commanding performance as Fiesco, using his big bold voice to tremendous effect. Keith Olsen was the lusty Adorno, Ivan Kusnjer a credibly shifty Paolo. Amelia, portrayed as a spoilt rich kid, was sung by Gunnel Bohman.</p>

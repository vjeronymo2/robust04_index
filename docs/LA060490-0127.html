			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH PUBLISHER MAXWELL HAS EYES ON MAJOR U.S. NEWSPAPER  </P> <P> Robert Maxwell, a leading publisher in Britain who has gone on a buying spree  in the U.S. publishing industry in recent years, said today he is in talks to  buy a major American newspaper.  </P> <P> Maxwell, speaking at the annual meeting of one of his companies, Berlitz  International Inc., declined to identify his target but said the property is  valued "obviously in the mid-hundreds of millions."  </P> <P> Speculation centered on the Tribune Co.'s high-circulation but marginally  profitable New York Daily News. Its owner, the diversified publisher of the  Chicago Tribune newspaper, said it has no comment. Tribune put the Daily News  up for sale several years ago but then took it off the market.  </P> <P> A quick sale of the Daily News would be difficult because of strained labor  relations at the newspaper, where employees have been working for weeks without  a contract, industry sources said.  </P></p>

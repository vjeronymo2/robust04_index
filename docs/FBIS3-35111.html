			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri affirmed  last night that the resistance is Lebanon's peace card. He  noted that Lebanon is facing an attempt to undermine it  economically and cut it down to size geographically. He said  that ending the resistance would be a surrender to Israel.  Speaking at a Ramadan dinner banquet held by al-Mabarrat  Charitable Society, Birri warned that ending the Arab boycott of  Israel without the implementation of UN Security Council  Resolution 425 would be a stab in the back for Lebanon's  steadfastness and sacrifices.</p>

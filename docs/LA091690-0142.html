			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ANGELS' LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS  </P> <P> In a pilot program launched last Feb., 25, experienced gardeners became  "Gardening Angels" and made gardening adventures a reality for about 1,500  children in 20 schools who ordinarily would not have had the opportunity to  plant, nurture and harvest their own vegetables and flowers.  </P> <P> Volunteer orientation will be held starting Sept. 18 and continuing Sept. 25  from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at The Common Ground office, 2615 S. Grand Ave., Suite  400, Los Angeles, Calif. 90007.  </P> <P> To register, call Rachel Mabie at (213) 744-4349.  </P> <P> The newly revised "Children's Gardens, A Guide for Parents, Teachers and  Volunteers" will be given to each volunteer as well as to schools whose  requests cannot be accommodated. The book, which is based on gardening  activities in Southern California, is available to the public for $10 plus  $2.50 handling and postage. The $10 price is tax-deductible, and the proceeds  will benefit the children's gardens in the inner city. Checks for the book and  for those who wish to make a donation should be made out to Los Angeles Urban  Agriculture Corp. and sent to the Common Ground address above.  </P> <P> Needed: Old seed catalogues for schoolchildren to cut up and use in their  scrapbooks and reports. Mail them to "Gardening Angels," care of Common Ground,  Suite 400, 2615 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles, Calif. 90007. Teddy Colbert  </P></p>

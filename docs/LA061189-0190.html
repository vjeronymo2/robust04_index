			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LESSONS IN LAUGHTER THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A DEAF ACTOR BY  BERNARD BRAGG AS SIGNED TO EUGENE BERGMAN (GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY PRESS: $17.95;  340 PP.)  </P> <P> Sign language is deaf actor Bernard Bragg's art form. In his autobiography he  eloquently argues that deaf culture exits separate from the attempts of the  deaf to function as "normal" hearing people. The child of deaf parents (his  father was an amateur actor), Bragg recalls his shock when he discovered that  he differed from the hearing. Upon entering the New York School for the Deaf,  he further discovered that not all his classmates were equally versed in sign  language. Some spoke expressively, using gestural vocabulary new to Bragg,  while others could only communicate with crude finger-spelling.  </P> <P> Language and the discussion of language in "Lessons in Laughter" are its most  interesting feature. There is a great discrepancy between the vividness of  Bragg's stories, which he signed, and the woodenness of the printed  translation; it is a tribute to his superb storytelling that the reader can  almost see the actor. The most memorable images from the stories demonstrate  how complex, nuanced and passionate communication is conducted without spoken  words. Bragg recalls the deaf people he has met whose signing increased his  appreciation for the richness of the deaf language. And in a scene that takes  place in the shower room of the New York School for the Deaf, a classmate  threatens Bragg's life with aggressive gestures: "I rubbed my eyes. The message  he had signed to me looked all wrong. Had he really signed that he was going to  kill me? I had never seen such a savage snarl on him. I asked him to repeat.  Chopping the air violently with his hands, he signed, 'You saw me all right.' "  </P> <P> The title refers not only to Bragg's coming to terms with his own art and the  hearing world, but also to the dreadful classroom experience, which in Bragg's  memory represents the hearing world's awful imposition of hearing values on  deaf children. A hearing teacher who apparently loathed the unfettered sounds  of his deaf pupils decided one day that his students must learn to laugh in a  seemly fashion. He made them hold their sides and perform exhalation exercises,  correcting them when they did not emit the proper sounds.  </P></p>

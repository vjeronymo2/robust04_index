			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Wall Street fall-out gives little cause for thanks: The falling dow Investment Cassandras have been proclaiming that the US stock market has been overvalued for two years or more, but Wall Street has stubbornly refused to pay attention. This week may have seen the turning point. On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 90 points, its biggest fall since the Federal Reserve first raised interest rates and sparked a stock market decline in early February. The frenzied selling in Tuesday's final hour of trading, coming after a similar sharp decline late on Monday, indicated that something was seriously wrong with the US market. Just how wrong remains to be seen, but Wall Sreet's hopes for a traditional December rally in share prices are fading. European and Asian equity markets have been almost powerless to resist in the face of the US declines. In some cases, such as Hong Kong, there is a direct interest rate and currency link with the US, which often turns the local stock market into a more volatile version of Wall Street. In Europe, the health of the US economy has a direct impact on corporate profits. If the Fed's increases in interest rates do slow the US economy, 'the result will be a net negative for the rest of the world both in terms of lost exports to the US and lower corporate profits earned by US subsidiaries', said Mr Peter Lyon, chief strategist at securities house Smith New Court. With US investors also playing an important part in world capital flows, it is hard to see how European and Asian markets can escape from Wall Street's influence. So the immediate prospects for world markets depend on events in the US. This week's losses, while well short of Crash proportions, have left traders, investors and analysts rattled. The Dow lost 3.6 per cent of its value on Monday and Tuesday, the largest two-day decline since March. The selling was so intense that the New York Stock Exchange's 'circuit breakers', which limit computerised program trading during volatile markets, proved totally ineffective. Yesterday, the market's mood remained grim, and analysts were speculating whether the Dow would soon test its year low of just above 3,600. Until this week, the Dow had outperformed the rest of the market by some margin. At the start of the week, it was up 1.6 per cent on the year, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 - a much broader measure of the market - was down 1 per cent. The main indices of financial, transportation, and utilities stocks were down 10 per cent, 17 per cent, and 24 per cent respectively. The Dow held up so well this year because investors had been buying cyclical stocks - which make up a large part of the Dow average - in the hope of riding the coat-tails of strong economic recovery. However, late on Monday, investors - their confidence in the economic outlook undermined by last week's interest rate rise - began to sell cyclicals. The Fed's move on November 15 was the sixth (and possibly not the last) tightening of monetary policy in 1994, and the largest rate increase in more than a decade. This, says Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus fund group in New York, scared investors. 'The Dow has a lot of cyclical stocks in it, and the cyclicals were outperforming on the basis of a strong economic recovery. But then the Fed tightened aggressively, to the point where the fear of weaker earnings and recession in 1995 spread.' On top of the concern about further rate increases and a weakening in economic and earnings growth, there was a growing realisation on Wall Street that investors may be ready to switch their money out of shares and into bonds because of the more attractive yields available on the latter. As one fund manager said on Tuesday: 'People are finally understanding that it's better to get 7.5 per cent guaranteed by the government than a 3 per cent dividend from a stock.' US dividend yields are still low in historical terms, and indeed are little better than those prevailing at the time of the 1987 crash. This week Morgan Stanley cut its recommended allocation of stocks in its model portfolio from 97 per cent to 85 per cent, and Dean Witter Reynolds raised the bond portion of its model from 35 per cent to 50 per cent. By yesterday, it was clear the bond market was already benefiting from the switch out of stocks. For the second consecutive day, bond prices rose as share prices dropped. After one of its worst declines ever, the bond market now appears poised to capitalise on the stock market's woes. The US stock market has also been unsettled by the uncertain political situation in Washington, where the Republicans who recently took control of Congress are talking of cutting taxes and increasing defence spending. To investors, this sounds like a recipe for higher budget deficits and initial Republican threats to delay a vote on the Gatt trade agreement also upset the market. Today's Thanksgiving holiday may be a welcome break for investors and traders on both sides of the Atlantic. But those bulls who were counting on a Dow rally through 4,000 by Christmas may feel queasy as they tuck into their turkey.

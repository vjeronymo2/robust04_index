			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTING COLLEGE PRESIDENT GETS POST FOR REAL  </P> <P> Warren A. Washington, who since September has been acting president of Compton  Community College, has been named president by the college's Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> Washington succeeds Edison O. Jackson, who resigned Sept. 1 to become president  of Medgar Evers College in New York City. The Compton board, which did not  solicit any applications for the presidency, reached its decision Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> A 14-year veteran at the college, Washington was dean of continuing education  and college development before being named acting president. Trustee Legrand  Clegg called the new president an "indefatigable worker."  </P> <P> "What I really like about him," Clegg said, "is that . . . he's very sensitive  to the concerns of the entire college family -- the students, the faculty, the  administration, our patrons, as well as the board. That's why I think he had  such widespread and enthusiastic support."  </P> <P> The trustees, Clegg said, were happy with Washington's performance so far and  saw no reason to take the time to conduct a search for other candidates. "I  felt, and I think the others did too," Clegg said, "that it would be beneficial  to give him the full authority of his office as opposed to having him serving  in an acting capacity."  </P> <P> Washington's contract will run until June, 1992.  </P> <P> Washington, who started at the college as a psychology instructor, holds a  Ph.D. from U.S. International University in San Diego and a master's degree  from the University of LaVerne.  </P></p>

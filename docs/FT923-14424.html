			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Investors flexing greener muscles While investment has long been used to wield clout in the human rights arena, City of London investors are at last beginning to flex their muscles on environmental issues. London fund managers last month received their second formal briefing from environmental groups and say they want to hear more. The first came in April, when a pressure group based in Cornwall, called Surfers Against Sewage, presented its case against some of the sewage disposal methods used by South West Water, a listed company. Then last month Greenpeace argued against the business of incinerating toxic waste. The meetings were organised by Roger Hardman, the environment analyst at stockbrokers James Capel. 'It is a very forward thinking move on the part of James Capel,' says Steve Warshal, editor of Greenpeace Business. Hardman, impressed with the turnout, wants to organise more meetings. 'These late afternoon briefings are usually used by many fund managers as an excuse to catch an early train home. They're usually out the door by five. But at the Greenpeace meeting, the last person did not leave until 6.45pm.' Environmentalists have acknowledged, but seldom exploited, the power of the investment community to create change in industry's environmental performance. But the success of green investment funds - where fund managers screen their investment decisions according to environmental criteria - has shown that pressure can be exerted on industry via the investor. Given that some of the mystery surrounding the investment community is being lifted and the public is beginning to know more about the way investment works, it is possible that environmental pressure groups could target specific well-known companies, such as insurers. These household names could be put under pressure - by the threat of consumer resistance - to include environmental criteria when building their investment portfolios. Furthermore, the City is slowly becoming aware of the possible impact of tough new environmental laws, many led by the EC, which could affect profits of dirty companies. There is also a fear that companies, and possibly their lenders and insurers, will be made liable for the cost of cleaning up pollution. Meanwhile, both the pressure groups and the fund managers are learning to talk to each other. 'I don't think Greenpeace could have presented their case any better without diluting their message,' says Hardman. Warshal of Greenpeace says he was surprised at the audience's lack of knowledge and understanding of incinerators. 'But they seemed quite receptive to our argument that toxic waste incineration is an industry that will not grow.' Marion Carter, an environmental consultant to most of the UK's waste managers, says there is a role for pressure groups in pushing for change in industry. 'But I think it is very dangerous to say to fund mangers that they should not invest in the waste management industry, because you would then have a problem of what to do with the waste.' Kate Medd, a fund manager at Henderson Administration, was impressed by the quality of the Greenpeace presentation. 'They have a legitimate point of view and they can back it up.' Edward Bonham-Carter, fund manager of the Electra Investment Trust, is less impressed. 'The whole tone of the Greenpeace presentation was too much like a biology class for 16-year-olds. They would do much better if they gave a far more detailed analysis of practices and companies.' He says issues about the quality of life are set to increase in importance over the next 10 years, which will have an effect on investments. He would like a debate between industry and pressure groups on issues such as incineration. 'But I will certainly go to another one of these meetings,' he says. Mark Campanale, a researcher for the Merlin Ecology Fund, says most City analysts have no experience of the environment. 'The City is virtually illiterate when considering environmental concerns. It's just not part of the traditional investment equation. 'James Capel should be applauded for getting people thinking about wider issues. But if Greenpeace is going to succeed in getting its message across, it should switch on to the fact that it is companies that both create and solve problems. They've got to present their case on specific companies and in great detail.'</p>

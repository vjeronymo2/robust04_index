			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Ambassador Toshio  Goto told Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu Saturday morning that  the Hata cabinet's view of history mirrors that of the previous  Hosokawa cabinet.    Conveying the Japanese response to Seoul's official protest  against remarks made by Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano in  defense of Tokyo's role in World War II, Ambassador Goto said he  had been instructed to clarify that the Hata cabinet attaches  importance to promoting a future-oriented bilateral relationship  and an honest view of history, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang  Ki-ho said.    Goto told Han he had conveyed Seoul's concern to his home  government, adding that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata would take  appropriate action on Nagano's remarks upon returning from  Europe Sunday. Tokyo will notify Seoul of any action, he added.    Minister Han told the ambassador that the justice minister's  remarks had hurt and angered Koreans and that the Japanese  Government should move to heal this hurt and prevent the  recurrence of such remarks, Chang said.</p>

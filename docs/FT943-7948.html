			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region mixed, analysts look at earnings prospects Share prices remained depressed for most of the day as the yen's rise above the Y100 level against the dollar hurt investor confidence, but afternoon buying led by dealers finally supported the Nikkei index, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average closed 38.21 up at the day's high of 20,862.77 after a low of 20,772.15. The yen's appreciation hit export-oriented electricals, and the index declined in spite of buying by overseas investors. Late index-linked demand from brokers eventually lifted shares. Volume amounted to 266m shares, down from Wednesday's 356m. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost a marginal 0.66 at 1,663.09 and the Nikkei 300 was off just 0.03 at 302.76. Declines led rises by 505 to 435, with 215 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 4.54 to 1,349.14. Overseas investors continued to buy steels and chemicals, but the gains were eroded by profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, eased Y1 to Y374 and Sumitomo Chemical dipped Y3 to Y575. In spite of the low trading volumes, Nomura Securities advanced Y30 to Y2,330, while other leading brokerages held steady. With average turnover slowing to Y340bn per day, Baring Securities in Tokyo believed that earnings at the Big Four houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and 10 second tier brokers could be weaker than previous estimates based on a forecast of daily turnover averaging Y450bn. Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo, which believed that turnover had bottomed out, was advising investors to include in their portfolios medium-sized brokerages with larger sensitivity to equity commissions. Multimedia and telecommunications related stocks, which had been firmer on Wednesday, lost ground as profits were taken. Victor dropped Y40 to Y1,350 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y1,000 to Y879,000. DDI, the long distance telecom operator listed on the second section, fell Y30,000 to Y1m. High-technology stocks were lower on the yen's rise: Toshiba receded Y5 to Y764 and NEC Y10 to Y1,230. Japan Airlines moved ahead Y13 to Y773 on buying led by foreign investors, who expected the company to benefit from a restructuring plan, as well as the sharp rise in overseas travel during the summer holidays. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 17.40 down at 23,189.90 in volume of 44.1m shares. Export-related shares declined, with Shima Seiki, a machinery maker, losing Y100 at Y8,700. Roundup Following this week's increase in US interest rates - a move broadly welcomed by the world's financial markets - analysts yesterday were expecting investors in the south and south-east Asian region to concentrate on earnings growth. With the exception of Hong Kong, earnings in the region had generally exceeded expectations, they said, assisted by relatively low inflation and interest rates. No slowdown in growth was seen in Malaysia and Singapore in 1995, while Thailand and Indonesia were expected to see an acceleration in earnings momentum. The one exception to the positive picture was China: most brokers continued to underweight the market in light of the economic and political uncertainties overhanging equities. SINGAPORE closed higher, boosted by buying of blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 13.57 at 2,357.97. Analysts expected the market to ease slightly soon, having strengthened 10 per cent since early July. SEOUL was pushed up by selective interest in blue chips. Both Samsung Electronics and Korea Mobile Telecom set record highs again, Samsung advancing Won3,000 to Won104,400 and Korea Mobile rising the day's limit to end Won10,000 up at Won420,000. The composite index put on 3.52 at 946.48 and volume rose from 21.1m shares to 30.5m. TAIPEI fell sharply on heavy profit-taking by institutions. The weighted index ended 59.74 lower at 6,586.16 and turnover was active at TDollars 107bn. MANILA eased on a technical correction. The composite index shed 25.63 to 3,004.07, having peaked at 3,054 during the day. Bank of Philippine Islands, one of the country's top five commercial banks, was the most heavily traded, its shares falling 3.6 per cent to 1,060 pesos. SYDNEY finished mildly firmer, overseas investors having encouraged a recovery from a morning low. The All Ordinaries index was finally 7.3 up at 2,066.8 in volume of 153.7m shares as the market warmed to Wednesday's key interest rate rise to 5.5 per cent. CRA jumped 22 cents to a record closing high of ADollars 19.48. WELLINGTON's NZSE-40 index softened 4.08 to 2,097.38 in thin turnover of NZDollars 34m. INL slipped 9 cents to NZDollars 5.20 ahead of its annual profits announcement today, which promises to be busy with half a dozen companies due to report. HONG KONG digested Wednesday's sharp gains and the US rate rise, while investors took a close look at the prospects of an increase in domestic key rates and how this would affect equities. Property shares were weak as the Hang Seng index retreated 19.09 to 9,518.89 in turnover down from HKDollars 5.66bn to a preliminary total of HKDollars 3.50bn. BOMBAY finished at a record closing high as buying by foreign investors and speculators forced local mutual funds to stop their selling and keep to the sidelines. The BSE index was ahead 27.83 at 4,534.33. Gujarat Ambuja Cement rose Rs30 to Rs770 after the company announced a board meeting for today to declare a scrip issue, its annual results and a dividend. JAKARTA was led higher by a range of blue chips, closing 9.28, or 1.9 per cent, better at 492.88. Analysts suggested that firm foreign sentiment and local bullish interest were the market's main driving factors.</p>

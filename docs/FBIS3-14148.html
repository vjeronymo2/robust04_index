More details in the following report by our correspondent for  political affairs Salim 'Ali Dhiyab:    [Begin Dhiyab recording] The Middle East is witnessing  extensive and large-scale activities to end the stalemate in the  Arab-Israeli talks following the Israeli massacre in the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque.    A short while ago, Jordanian-U.S. talks began at the Prime  Ministry following the arrival in Amman of the U.S. coordinator  of the Arab-Israel talks, who began a brief visit to Jordan as  part of a regional tour.    The Jordanian side, which is chaired by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali, includes Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani,  Finance Minister Sami Gammuh, the deputy chairman of the  Jordanian delegation to the peace talks, a number of advisers,  and the members of the Jordanian side to the peace talks. The  U.S. side, which is chaired by Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of  the peace process includes members of the U.S. delegation and  the U.S. ambassador in Amman.    Ross' regional tour aims at reviving the Arab-Israeli talks,  which were suspended by the Arab parties involved in the peace  talks. Observers also believe that Ross will seek to explain  the recent American stand vis-a-vis the Security Council  resolution and U.S. abstention from voting in favor of some of  its paragraphs.    Ross, who arrived in Amman this evening, was received by  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani and the U.S. ambassador in  Amman. [end recording]</p>

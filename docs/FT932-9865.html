			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Snub for coal pension plea BRITISH COAL has signalled that it will reject a proposal from the trustees of its staff superannuation scheme that part of a Pounds 1bn surplus should be used to guarantee inflation-linked annual pension increases. British Coal said that it had not yet given a formal response to the proposals and had no timetable for doing so. The trustees, who include representatives of both management and staff, sent British Coal proposals in January to allocate half the surplus to scheme members in accordance with the trust deed. Trustees said the scheme actuary estimated that guaranteed index-linking would use up only Pounds 130m of an estimated Pounds 1.017bn surplus as at 1992. Pensions have been increased in line with inflation in recent years, but future index-linking is not guaranteed. It is believed that there are concerns about the ability to sell parts of British Coal if employers have to provide index-linked pensions. Guaranteeing inflation now will also leave the government with few incentives to offer the trustees in exchange for their agreement to surrender part of the scheme's assets. A similar plan has been proposed for the British Rail pension scheme post-after privatisation. Coal scheme trustees yesterday testified before the parliamentary select committee on social security on their preferred method of running the schemes after the disposal. Sir Norman Siddell, chairman of the staff superannua tion scheme, said the trustees would like to see the scheme split in two - with one pool of assets dedicated to current and deferred pensioners, and another of assets dedicated to those who remain employed. The trustees said they would meet Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, next week to seek assurances that there would be no worsening of benefits after privatisation, that no future employer should be able to tap the pension funds, and that new employers should be prohibited from transferring other employees into the scheme. MPs yesterday questioned the trustees about their dispute with British Coal over the company's refusal to make a Pounds 104m payment into the scheme on April 5.</p>

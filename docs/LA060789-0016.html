			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'IMAGINING AMERICA': FOUR RIFFS ON A COMMON THEME  </P> <P> Until this year's "New York Stories," one might have thought the anthology film  was dead. Yet just as that movie revived the genre cinematically, "Imagining  America," which airs tonight at 9 on Channel 15 and at 10:35 on Channel 28,  reinvigorates the format for TV.  </P> <P> A presentation of "American Playhouse," it's such a superb, offbeat collection,  one hopes more will follow. Conceived and produced by John H. Williams, it  offers four riffs on a common theme: America, viewed personally. Only one of  the four, Ralph Bakshi's "This Ain't Bebop," is a narrative. The others include  two fine documentaries: Ed Lachman's "Get Your Kicks on Route 66," a racy ode  to the great American '50s highway, and Mustapha Khan's "Reflections of a  Native Son," a grim, clear-eyed look at the teen-age subculture of a South  Bronx housing project. The fourth, Matt Mahurin's "Tribe," is a lyric  kaleidoscope of public gestures in America: a cross between impressionist  documentary, music video and live-action photo-essay.  </P> <P> "This Ain't Bebop" is, in a way, another nostalgia piece about the '50s. But  this is nostalgia for the buried '50s: of the beat or counter-culture figures  such as Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady, James Dean and splatter-painter Jackson  Pollock.  </P> <P> Brooklynite Bakshi follows an aging would-be hipster (Harvey Keitel) on his  barren rounds through the pool halls and streets, looking for action and sex,  juxtaposed with his memories of a '50s youth, and the self-destructive idols  whose gestalt haunts him. Sinuous Miles Davis-style jazz threads under the  action; "This Ain't Bebop" itself is an apocryphal remark attributed to Cassady  as he collapses on the railroad tracks before his death.  </P> <P> Though Keitel's presence reminds us of Martin Scorsese's mean street ethos,  Bakshi shows style and personality all his own. His first totally live-action  effort suggests others should follow.  </P> <P> "This Ain't Bebop" is the longest of the shorts, but it doesn't dominate. The  films all weave together, a quartet of variations on the theme of the American  outsider: whether white, black, urban, western or on the road between.  Subthemes trace their way from film to film, like the jazz and rock underscore.  </P> <P> "Tribe" is probably the anthology's heart: with its multi-images of Americans  of all classes, races and sexes in a huge dance -- staged variously to the slow  movement from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, drums and "Hang On, Sloopy." And  the shorts have been embedded in a rich collage of clips from bland,  celebratory documentaries from the '50s and earlier: a technique that recalls  experimental gems like Michael Wallin's "Decodings."  </P> <P> One other note on this excellent package. Khan's and Mahurin's films are in  black-and-white; so are sections of Bakshi's and Lachman's. And they all look  beautiful. In this sad time of the denigration of monochrome cinematography --  through the colorizing antics of Ted Turner and his shortsighted industry  supporters -- watching four fine film makers make such creative modern use of  black-and-white is heartening indeed.

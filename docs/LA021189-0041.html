			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER GUN CONTROL LAWS  </P> <P> Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) says that he has heard "precious little"  from those who would support him in stopping the spread of weapons of war ("To  Ban Assault Weapons, Voices Must Be Heard," Op-Ed Page, Jan. 30). I am happy to  add my voice to his.  </P> <P> I would like to see semiautomatic and automatic assault guns banned from sale  to the public, and, if it could be accomplished, those guns already in the  public's hands confiscated (with compensation). There is no legitimate reason  why anyone should want or need such a gun. I commend the owner of Grant Boys in  Costa Mesa who has added his voice by withdrawing these weapons from sale in  his store.  </P> <P> If Roos knows that poll after poll has shown that the vast majority of  Californians supports the banning of these guns, why do his fellow legislators  not know it? Or if they do know it, why do they not act as elected  representatives and do what the vast majority of their constituents want?  </P> <P> PETER COPPEN  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

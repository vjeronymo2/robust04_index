			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum has received a challenge grant from the Kathryn G.  Thompson Development Co. of Irvine to match, dollar-for dollar, each new or  upgraded membership received during the museum's winter, 1990, membership  campaign. The grant, of up to $30,000, will double the value of members'  contributions, thus giving them the benefits of a higher membership level.  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum will give a progress report in early 1990 on the  campaign to raise $50 million for its new building, due to open in 1993,  President Thomas H. Nielsen said this week. So far, the museum has raised $10  million, officials report. Progress in the search for a new director -- former  director Kevin E. Consey resigned in August -- and design details for the new  museum building also will also be announced, Nielsen said.  </P> <P> Compiled by Kenneth Williams  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May.    Harmodio Arias, commerce and industry vice minister,  announced yesterday that the Mexican Government decided not to  accept Panama's latest offer for paying off this country's crude  oil debt, which has been pending for the past five years.  Despite the fact that an agreement was made, negotiations will  continue, and it is expected that an understanding satisfactory  to both parties will be reached shortly. Vice Minister Arias  refrained from disclosing the details of Panama's offer but did  say that the current administration would like to reach to an  agreement before the new government is sworn in. Panama  currently maintains a $120 million debt to Mexico for crude oil  purchased within the framework of the San Jose Pact. This debt,  which has been outstanding since before 1989, accumulates  monthly interest totalling $800,000.

Tax exemptions and customs rights  for imports totalled $135.9 million, of which $124.1 million  corresponds to the manufacturing sector. Exemptions within this  sector represent 91.4 percent of total exemptions and are  related to machinery, heavy equipment, spare parts, raw  material, semi-processed goods, containers, and imported  bearings. The Comptroller General indicated that, although the  1993 figures are evidence of an 8.3 percent drop from the 1992  level, "Panama still continues to be basically an exempt  country." He believes that the practice should be amended in  order to use these additional revenues in other government  sectors. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 10 May 94 p  B1)</p>

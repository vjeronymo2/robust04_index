			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOK ACCELERATES THE DEBATE OVER TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS  </P> <P> Orange County could raise enough money to relieve crowded freeways if motorists  were charged "congestion fees" for commuting during peak traffic hours and if  truck weight fees reflected road wear, according to UC Irvine economist Kenneth  A. Small.  </P> <P> Those and other theories about highway financing are contained in a new book in  which Small and two East Coast economists argue that the nation's current  system of highway financing is unable to cope with the real costs of  maintaining and providing transportation facilities.  </P> <P> "Road Work: A New Highway Pricing &amp; Investment Policy" was published last  month by the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. It states that  transportation experts have virtually given up on solving the highway mess  because of the tremendous financial burden involved. The authors say that  ride-sharing, parking fees and other such means to improve traffic flow are  fine but that they will never allow the system to catch up with the pent-up  demand.  </P> <P> By making it more costly to motorists to jam existing roads, however, Small  says, some of the existing license fees and road taxes could be retired.  Car-pool lanes might not be needed because some commuters, rather than pay a  congestion fee, would choose different work hours, travel by commuter trains or  buses or find jobs closer to their homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Some Distinction'  </P> <P> It is an idea that would be especially applicable in Orange County, Small said  in an interview.  </P> <P> "California has more congestion than most other states," he said. "And  certainly Orange County has some distinction on that score."  </P> <P> In the book, Small -- who came to UC Irvine from Princeton University six years  ago -- cites the planned 14-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway as an example of how  a two-tier pricing system could work: Raising the price of a 50-cent toll to 85  cents during peak traffic periods would reduce estimated peak traffic 19% in  1995 and 30% by 2015, compared to the reductions that would result from a flat  60-cent toll, "even though the two toll structures would have virtually  identical impacts on total daily traffic."  </P> <P> By charging congestion-based tolls of $1 to $2 per trip during peak hours, most  states would be able to pay for major increases in highway capacity, Small  says. Small would, however, limit the use of such funds to the particular area  that was generating the toll revenue. "I wouldn't want to see congestion fees  collected here be used for a new road way up in Eureka," he said.  </P> <P> Singapore, which charges a toll of about $2.50 per day to enter its central  business district, achieved a 69% reduction in rush-hour traffic over a  four-year period in the late 1970s, according to the book. Residents display  monthly window stickers bought in advance to pass checkpoints along the main  highways into the district, Small said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technology Has Advanced  </P> <P> County tollway officials have not seriously considered higher prices for  peak-hour use, Small said, because the tollway projects now under way are  already heavily financed with developer fees. A congestion fee would be more  practical, he said, if developers were not already footing up to 48.5% of the  construction costs and if there was no possibility that the project could  receive federal highway funds.  </P> <P> Still, county tollway chief John Meyer said he would recommend charging higher  peak-hour tolls once the roads' traffic capacity is reached.  </P> <P> The technology involved, Small argues, has advanced enough that queues at toll  booths will not be a problem. Window stickers or license plates can be scanned  electronically. Such a system is being proposed for Orange County's tollways.  </P> <P> Small and co-authors Clifford Winston and Carol A. Evans acknowledge that there  are many political obstacles to widespread implementation of their book's  proposals, primarily because special interest groups have competing interests.  </P> <P> The book's timing could not be better, though, Small says, partly because of  the media's recent focus on the economic and social costs of traffic  congestion. The book and its controversial policy proposals have already been  discussed in several newspapers and magazines as well as on public television.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticism of Book  </P> <P> Its critics include former Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, a key  member of the California Transportation Commission. Nestande, who is vice  president of Arnel Development Co. in Costa Mesa, said he prefers car-pool  lanes, flexible work hours and other such traffic mangement strategies, arguing  that "congestion fees would be met with instant public outrage" and that doing  much to adjust truck weight fees would be politically unfeasible.  </P> <P> "Academicians can come up with good-sounding proposals that might even work,  but I'm in favor of doing what's practical right now," Nestande said.  </P> <P> Keith McKean, Caltrans district director in Orange County, is mentioned in the  book as a supporter of Small's congestion fee idea. In an interview, McKean  said he would prefer to call the charge a "peak-hour users' fee" because that  would generate less public opposition.  </P> <P> McKean said he envisions annual vehicle registration cards that would be  magnetically encoded by the Department of Motor Vehicles and displayed on the  right side of the windshield. Every time the vehicle crossed into a peak-hour  toll zone, a detector would record the registration code and a monthly bill  would be mailed to the owner. Trucks, he said, would be charged higher  peak-hour use fees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who Should Bear Costs  </P> <P> "My feeling is that if people want to use the freeway, they should use it in  the off-peak hours," McKean said. "But if they're going to use it in the peak  hours, let's make them pay for it. Rather than tax all the people all the time,  let's (tax) people who insist on peak-hour use for improving the flow out  there."  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission recently voted to try to secure  state approval for at least one privately built and operated toll road --  possibly the extension of the Orange Freeway along the Santa Ana River. Small,  however, says he is not in favor of "privatized" roads.  </P> <P> "I don't trust government-granted franchise monopolies," he said. "They are  subject to abuse."  </P> <P> Small concedes that he himself may not have to pay many tolls: "I bicycle to  work."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PAYING FOR CONGESTION  </P> <P> Here's how a congestion fee might work:  </P> <P> Any road where traffic is a problem -- a downtown city thoroughfare, a highway  or a toll road -- isdesignated as a congestion fee area.  </P> <P> A driver entering such an area has a window sticker, card or license plate  automatically readby an electronic scanner.  </P> <P> The driver then is billed periodically, based on the information read by the  scanner.  </P> <P> The fee could be a set amount -- for example, $1 or $2. Or, in the case of a  toll road, it wouldbe above the regular toll, for example, 85 cents rather than  50 cents.  </P></p>

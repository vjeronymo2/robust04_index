BRIEFING;  </P> <P> KOLLMORGEN AND VERNITRON TO MERGE  </P> <P> Kollmorgen Corp. announced today it will merge with Vernitron Corp. of Deer  Park, N.Y., in a deal worth about $320 million, ending months of jockeying in  what began as a hostile takeover attempt.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the agreement, Vernitron will pay $25 per share for 12.8  million outstanding Kollmorgen shares, officials said.  </P> <P> Kollmorgen produces submarine periscopes, electronic circuit boards and  electric motors. It reported earnings of $14.1 million last year, or $1.34 per  share.  </P> <P> In February, Vernitron raised its by then $23 per share bid for Kollmorgen to  $25 per share if Kollmorgen would agree to redeem a so-called "poison pill"  that was part of a shareholders' rights plan adopted by Kollmorgen in December  in response to the initial offer. Vernitron spokeswoman Roanne Kulakoff said  the poison pill will be redeemed as part of the merger agreement.  </P></p>

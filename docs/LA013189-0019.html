			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME IN U.S. COURTS  </P> <P> Recent television coverage of sensational trials has captured the public  imagination. Yet it underscores the conflict existing between a community's  right to know and a defendant's constitutional entitlement to a fair trial.  Important state criminal cases in the nation are increasingly televised,  replete with instantaneous commentary by photogenic legal experts who explain  the intricacies of proceedings that may change the course of a defendant's  life. At the same time, U.S. law prohibits the use of cameras in federal  courts. While greater access of broadcast media to the courtroom is desirable,  recent experience in state courts suggests that removal of the federal ban  would be premature.  </P> <P> The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure deny federal judges any discretion in  such matters. Though assailed both by defendants seeking to maximize media  coverage of their trials and by broadcasters asserting the public's First  Amendment right to be informed, the federal ban is inflexibly enforced.  </P> <P> Federal courts have ruled that a prohibition on televising trials does not  violate the First Amendment if reporters are free to attend and convey any  information that they gather. The presence of cameras in court, it is argued,  impairs the dignity and decorum that are essential to judicial proceedings.  While broadcasters strive to enlarge their coverage of litigation, the invasion  of cameras into the courtroom risks casting judges, lawyers and parties as  actors. Moreover, publicity attending the intrusion of television into the  judicial process may fan the flames of community indignation over a crime,  threatening to deprive defendants of their constitutional right to an impartial  jury and a fair trial.  </P> <P> But cameras need not strain court decorum. Current technology allows for quiet,  unobtrusive electronic documentation and telecasting of trials. While a TV  camera is a powerful weapon that can devastate an accused in the public's eyes,  the risk of impairing a jury's impartiality is present in any publication of a  trial, whether by print or broadcast. In any event, judges are fully empowered  to control the manner in which the coverage is conducted.  </P> <P> Television is a uniquely efficient tool for distributing information to an  audience hungry for visual images and sounds to complement the printed word.  The cynicism and distrust that some individuals bear toward the rulings of our  courts result in part from lack of familiarity with legal reasoning. The  properly controlled broadcasting of trials might shed light on the troublesome  perception that the judicial branch is an undemocratic institution dominated by  the arcane rules of the legal intelligentsia.  </P> <P> The past 50 years have shown the historic and pedagogic importance of  broadcasting quasi-judicial proceedings. Televised coverage of the McCarthy,  Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings contributed to the nation's understanding of  the governmental process. In each of these instances there was the concomitant  risk of prejudicing some current or prospective defendant's right to an  impartial trial.  </P> <P> In 1791, during the infancy of our Constitution, freedom of the press meant the  uninhibited right to write and distribute news. Publication of the printed word  was then the best way to disseminate information. Today it is often asserted  that television provides a method of communicating to greater numbers of  people. It also allows viewers, it is argued, to experience events with their  own eyes and ears.  </P> <P> The architects of our Constitution did not define the scope or meaning of  freedom of the press, nor did they describe the method for ensuring an  impartial jury in criminal cases. These seemingly abstract and amorphous  concepts were left to be adapted to modern circumstances by succeeding  generations. Indeed, in a society where a majority of citizens rely on  television as their source of news, it has been suggested that a ban on  broadcasting any court proceeding is at odds with an evolving conception of the  First Amendment. Although we are far from a consensus on this viewpoint, James  Madison's words are frequently cited: "A popular Government, without popular  information . . . is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both .  . . . (A) people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with  the power which knowledge gives."  </P> <P> We will arrive at this stage of expanded freedom of the press only if the media  are afforded full opportunity to fulfill their vital function of disseminating  truth, and if they exercise that prerogative with dignity and regard for other  constitutional rights. Unfortunately, too often the trials that are televised  seem to involve sex, drugs, violence or racial animus. And if celebrities or  political figures are parties, the viewing audience expands exponentially. In  this state of affairs, federal fears, not state court hopes, are realized.  Television now offers much glitter but little of the educational promise that  broadcasting trials can offer.  </P></p>

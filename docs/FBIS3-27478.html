An official at the Civil Aviation Administration of  China (CAAC) in Beijing said that lower costs and national pride  were key factors behind the move.    However, Western aviation analysts have raised questions  about the quality of the CAAC's Chengdu Flying College,  especially if it is expanded too rapidly.    The official said a recent contract with Northwest Airlines  to train 250 mainland pilots in the United States this year  would not be affected as it mainly involved refresher courses  for pilots of five Chinese airlines rather than basic training.</p>

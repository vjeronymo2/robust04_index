			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Thailand's king seals accord to end violence THE KING of Thailand last night sealed an agreement between the government and pro-democracy demonstrators to end four days of confrontation in which at least 40 people have been killed. King Bhumipol Adulyadej, the country's 64-year-old constitutional monarch, summoned Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister, and Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the opposition leader arrested on Monday, and told them to make peace for the sake of the people and the economy of Thailand. Both Gen Suchinda and Mr Chamlong were seen on television crawling on their knees into the presence of the king. In a televised address soon afterwards, Gen Suchinda said Mr Chamlong was being freed, along with all others arrested during the bloody clashes. MrChamlong, sitting alongside him, appealed to protesters to refrain from violence. The agreement will bring relief to Thais and to foreign investors, although there are still many uncertainties. Most Thais think Gen Suchinda will have to step down and may even have to leave the country after presiding over the shooting of protesters, but he and his supporters appear reluctant to relinquish control. Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief appointed as premier by a coalition of pro-military parties which won elections in March, is not an elected MP and is likely to have to resign within a month. He may choose to stand in a by-election to retain his post, although he has previously rejected this course. He said that he would ask parliament to meet on Monday to amend the constitution, one of the key demands of the demonstrators, who want to reduce the influence of the military in politics and restrict the post of prime minister to elected MPs. Mr Chamlong, himself a former army general but a man noted for his campaigns against corruption, told Thais: 'I ask you not to support any people who are being disorderly, so that the situation can return to normal as fast as possible.' He added: 'The situation has eased because of the good offices of the king.' King Bhumipol told the two men to use the good offices of Mr Prem Tinsulanonda, prime minister between 1980 and 1988 and one of his closest advisers. 'You, especially you two, General Suchinda and Major General Chamlong, must turn towards each other and not confront each other in order to solve this problem,' the king said. 'In the end people no longer know why they are fighting. All they want is to win and this is dangerous.' Before the midnight announcement of a deal, there had been feverish speculation in Bangkok that Gen Suchinda would be overthrown by disaffected colleagues in the military. Bangkok remained under a night curfew after the king's intervention and troops continued to patrol the streets. But thousands of demonstrators manned barricades around the Ramkamheang University in the capital's north-east in defiance of the curfew. Gunshots could be heard elsewhere, even after Gen Suchinda's announcement. Undimmed loyalty, Page 4</p>

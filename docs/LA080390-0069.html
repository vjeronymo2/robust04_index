			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT TO SHOP: VENICE BEACH FLEXES ITS SHOPPING MUSCLE  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: My friends shop at the Venice Beach boardwalk and come home with  really cute stuff at very reasonable prices. I go there and all I see are  "Life's a Beach" T-shirts. Is there anything new? Where is it?  </P> <P>  -- R.K., GARDENA  </P> <P> DEAR R.K.: This is the Coney Island of shopping experiences, not a place where  you glide daintily to and from well-appointed emporiums. Venice Beach wants to  entertain you, so let it.  </P> <P> We found many inexpensive treasures on the boardwalk, where there's more than  surfer jams and sunglasses.  </P> <P> What first caught our eye was "Bud the Birdman," a new addition this summer.  For $5, Bud will take a Polaroid of you wearing one of his giant parrots in  your hair. After a parrot dances on your head, you'll be in a better mood to  ferret out the boardwalk's latest treasures. Be sure to see Linda Lagosse and  Magnus Walker's Venetian Paradise stand at 640 Ocean Front Walk (between Sunset  and Thornton). Their designs include whimsical '60s-inspired Mad Hatter-type  hats and funky patchwork overalls, vests and jeans.  </P> <P> Reckless Women, at 421 Ocean Front Walk, has a good selection of inexpensive  costume jewelry, including rhinestone earrings, colorful bangle bracelets and  hair ornaments. And be sure to stop in at All One People, 1011 Ocean Front  Walk, which was recently transformed into a candle shop for a scene in the  upcoming film "The Doors." In real life the shop carries a great selection of  ethnic clothing, jewelry and accessories from Guatemala, Africa and Jamaica.  </P> <P> We found the merchants friendly and talkative. Have a good time -- and don't  forget your sunscreen!  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: My husband and I will be attending several black-tie affairs this  fall, and for once I'd like to know what's appropriate to wear. Sales people  suggest everything from strapless cocktail dresses to ball gowns! Is there any  clear-cut definition?  </P> <P>  -- D.V., SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> DEAR D.V.: Etiquette expert Letitia "Tish" Baldrige lays it on the line in her  book, "Complete Guide to Executive Manners." For the fall and winter seasons,  she recommends a short, three-quarter or full-length evening dress of a "winter  evening fabric," such as satin, brocade, sequins, lame or heavy taffeta.  Jewelry can be glittery (real or faux); shoes and evening bags should match  (patent leather or peau de soie work well), and evening hosiery should be  sheer.  </P> <P> Tish offers safe, sage advice, but this is Los Angeles, where some people  believe studded black leather constitutes formal wear. And since there's  nothing worse than showing up for an event dressed inappropriately (it's been  the subject of several of our nightmares), we suggest finding out as much about  the event as you can before you go, perhaps by consulting the host or hostess,  or by asking someone else who's going. That way, you can find out if a short  dress would be appropriate or if most of the women will be wearing long gowns.  </P></p>

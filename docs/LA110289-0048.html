			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASTOR ACCUSED OF MOLESTATIONS IS SUSPENDED BY CHURCH BOARD  </P> <P> The Southern California conference of Seventh-day Adventist Churches suspended  with pay a Glendale pastor accused of molesting three sisters in his  congregation, an attorney for the church said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Walter H. Solis, 54, was arrested Friday and is charged with molesting three  girls -- ages 7, 11 and 14 -- at his office in the Glendale Spanish Seventh-day  Adventist Church on East Broadway.  </P> <P> He was released on $7,500 bail the day of his arrest and is scheduled to be  arraigned Dec. 12. Solis, who has denied the accusations, faces six felony  charges of child molestation, police said.  </P> <P> The pastor allegedly molested the children repeatedly between November, 1986,  and June, court documents state.  </P> <P> Robert Peterson, the church's lawyer, said Solis has been temporarily relieved  of his church-related duties but will continue to receive his full salary.  </P> <P> "We have suspended him, but we are not prejudging the case," Peterson said. "As  far as we can, we are trying to treat him as innocent until proven guilty, but  we have to protect the ministry and the congregation."  </P> <P> The alleged victims are the daughters of the couple who served as the church's  live-in janitors. The family lives in a house owned by the church that is  adjacent to the worship hall, Police Investigator Lief Nicolaisen said.  </P> <P> The family had been performing chores in exchange for rent for about four years  and during that time the sisters worked closely with the pastor, he said.  </P> <P> Nicolaisen said he learned of the alleged molestation four months ago from a  doctor who said he discovered during a checkup that one of the girls had been  molested. As required by law, the doctor reported the finding, Nicolaisen said.  The doctor, who is member of the congregation, declined to comment.  </P> <P> Weeks later, at least two newspapers -- The Times among them -- received an  anonymous letter accusing Solis of molestation and the church of covering up  his actions. Nicolaisen refuted the charges against the church. "The church has  been extremely cooperative at all times," he said.  </P> <P> Peterson said that when police informed the church of the investigation, Solis  was reassigned to fund-raising duties outside his congregation, a position he  occupied until his suspension.  </P> <P> No further determination of Solis' status in the church -- or the future of the  alleged victims' family -- will be made until the court decides the case,  Peterson said. A substitute pastor has been called out of retirement to conduct  services at the church, he added.  </P> <P> Neither Solis nor his attorney could be reached for comment, but Peterson said  that after his arrest, the pastor asked the church board to be allowed  immediately to preach again. "He understood the suspension, but was unhappy  about it," Peterson said.  </P> <P> Peterson added that despite the charges filed against Solis, "the church board  and the vast majority of the congregation have been very supportive of Elder  Solis and doubt very much the charges are true."  </P> <P> He said Solis has been a pastor at the church for more than 20 years and  enjoyed an excellent reputation as a preacher, fund-raiser and spiritual  adviser. "The church board was very disappointed when I told them about the  suspension," he said.  </P> <P> Three church members contacted by The Times, among the congregation's 500, said  they did not believe the charges against Solis.  </P> <P> "I don't think the pastor did anything wrong," said parishioner Alfa Soto.  "He's been at the congregation for some time and he's always conducted himself  correctly."  </P></p>

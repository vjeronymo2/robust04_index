			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / People: Lloyd's of London Heidi Hutter has been appointed by Lloyd's of London as project director to deal with the problems of outstanding liabilities on syndicates from past underwriting years. She will work on the creation of NewCo, the company to be established by the start of 1996 to reinsure all liabilities up to 1986. She will also lead a team working to develop a common method to calculate the reserves necessary on the insurance exposures of syndicates in 'old years', to deal with claims against asbestos, pollution and other risks. This will help determine the reinsurance terms to be handled by NewCo for the old syndicates after the end of the 1993 underwriting year. Lloyd's decided recently that it would in the short term appoint a project director to prepare for the creation of NewCo, and defer a decision on the appointment of its managing director until nearer the time that it will begin to operate. Hutter, 35, gained a degree in maths at Cornell University, New York, joined North American Reinsurance Corporation and moved to the Atrium Corporation within Swiss Re in 1983. She has been vice president responsible for underwriting of the European International Reinsurance Company since 1987.</p>

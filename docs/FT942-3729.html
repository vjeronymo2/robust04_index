			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Grande idee - shame about the building First there was the French assault on 'US cultural imperialism' during last year's world trade negotiations; then came rumours of a Hollywood boycott of the Cannes Film Festival; now the French are back on the offensive in a row over the American Centre, the latest incarnation of the cultural institute that has since the 1930s been a mecca for intellectually-inclined Americans in Paris. Even the most chauvinistic members of the French intelligentsia have failed to find fault with the aims of the new centre, which opened last week as a vast cultural complex including a theatre, language school, art gallery and artists' studios. It is, after all, an icon of francophilia and, as such, conforms completely to the Gallic definition of an intelligent arts institution. Instead the arts establishment has vented its wrath on the new building, which was designed by Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles-based architect. The New York Times hailed his design as a 'love poem'. Le Figaro, the conservative French daily, disagreed. 'We expected a great deal from the first major French project of this great expressionist. And we've been sadly disappointed,' grumbled Francis Rambert, its architecture critic. The crux of the criticism is that Gehry, who has achieved international acclaim for his 'urban jungle' buildings in Los Angeles, reflecting the chaos of the city through fragmented forms and clashing colours, has fobbed off the French with a watered-down version of his Californian work. 'Jeez, what do they want from me?' groaned the architect, who paid a flying visit to Paris for the opening. 'I know what it is - a jumble of everything I've already done in LA. But I did all that stuff in the context of Los Angeles. This is Paris. I did not want to rebuild LA here. That would have been terrible]' The American Centre is an understated building, at least by the standards of Gehry, who once designed a Venice Beach office block as a giant pair of binoculars. The main facade is an explosion of different shapes which, he said, were inspired by 'those wonderful jumbled roofs you see when you really look at Paris', although he has softened the cacophonic effect by using classic French sandstone as his main material. The soft curves and seductive skylights of the interior are Gehry's homage to Ronchamp, the Le Corbusier chapel in eastern France, which is one of his favourite buildings. Even this tribute to France's architectural heritage (the French prefer to forget that Le Corbusier was born in Switzerland) has failed to placate the critics. 'We might ask why so many great contemporary architects seem to save their B-grade work for France?' sniped Le Figaro. France has historically prided itself on its cosmopolitan attitude to the arts: not least on its appreciation of the finer aspects of US culture, from the jazz of Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, to the experimental drama for which the American Centre was famous in the 1960s. Yet this cosmopolitanism was founded on an unquestioned confidence in the strength of France's own cultural credentials. That confidence has been dented by the economic and social turmoil of recent years. Jacques Toubon, the centre-right arts minister, has responded with a string of protectionist policies - from his anti-American stance at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, to his clampdown on Franglais. Gehry is the latest victim of France's cultural insecurity. He has had plenty of practice in the firing line. His uncompromising style has few fans in the US public sector. 'They don't even think I'm fit to build a dog kennel,' he says.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Occidental escapes clean-up damages One of the US's longest-running and most notorious environmental clean-up cases passed a milestone yesterday as a judge threw out a Dollars 250m (Pounds 171.2m) suit for punitive damages against Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum. The case, brought by New York state over contamination at the Love Canal site in Niagara, marked the first attempt by a US state to win punitive damages in a clean-up case. If successful, it could have prompted other US states to take a more aggressive approach in such cases. Occidental has already been found liable for clean-up costs of Dollars 325m at the site. The Love Canal case dates back to the 1940s, when Hooker Chemical, later acquired by Occidental, dumped chemical waste in a disused canal on a site it owned near Niagara. The site was sold in 1953 to a local authority, which built a school on it. Chemical contamination began to affect the school and surrounding housing in the 1970s, leading eventually to the displacement of 2,500 local residents. A judge ruled yesterday that the prosecution had failed to prove Hooker had shown 'reckless disregard for the safety of others', although the company 'should have made greater efforts to keep local residents off the property'.</p>

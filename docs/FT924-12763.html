			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Forgings group warns of redundancies IF deliveries of forged products for the mining industry drop by more than 10 per cent, Mills Forgings of Coventry 'will have to think of redundancies', Mr John Simon, chairman, warned yesterday. Mills, one of the smaller forges, is exceptional for its concentration of customers in the mining industry. About 30 per cent of its production goes to three engineering groups for use in the manufacture of mining equipment. These groups, which supply British Coal and companies abroad, are still assessing the likely effect of the pit closures. The mining industry is the forging industry's biggest customer after the automotive sector, buying products such as coal cutters, props and conveyors. Last year the mining industry bought 6,337 tonnes of steel forgings - or nearly 4 per cent of total production. This year deliveries to the mining industry have matched those of last year and have therefore become relatively more important for the industry. Total production is running at 13 per cent below last year's level, according to Mr David Powis, director-general of the British Forging Industry Association. Uncertainty about the future is also felt at United Forgemasters of Warley, West Midlands. About 10 per cent of the company's forgings go, directly and indirectly, to the mining industry and half of that proportion is exported. But the fear of Mr Jim Mundell, United Forgemasters chairman, is that the demise of the British pits may induce the company's customers to withdraw from the supply of mining equipment.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Macedonia likely to disregard veto: Greeks press Twelve to withhold recognition in dispute over name MACEDONIA plans to press for membership of the United Nations later this month if the European Community fails to reach agreement in Edinburgh on recognising the ex-Yugoslav republic. Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, the deputy president, said that Macedonia had received 'a lot of encouragement from other countries' to go ahead with its UN application, which was submitted in September but put on hold while a special EC envoy, Mr Robin O'Neill, tried to resolve Greek objections to recognising Macedonia by that name. Hopes that Athens and Skopje could compromise on the name issue crumbled last week when Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, rejected the EC envoy's report. Both Athens and Skopje have been urged to accept a compound name in which the word Macedonia is used as an adjective not a noun. While the EC leaders may be unwilling to reverse their support at the Lisbon summit in June for the Greek view that Macedonia should not be recognised under that name, Greece fears that if Macedonia decides finally not to compromise, individual member states may go ahead with recognition after the summit. 'If the EC does not recognise us, it is realistic to go at once to the UN. We've no reason to suppose that anyone at the Security Council would veto our membership, since we meet the legal conditions,' Mr Crvenkovski said. Macedonia is increasing ties with individual EC members. Germany, which has opened a consulate in Skopje, is to provide aid for Bosnian refugees living in Macedonia, and Italy plans to open a consulate early next year. The economy is in increasing difficulty because Macedonia is excluded from the international credit system. Exports have collapsed and the republic has been unable to cover any of the Dollars 80m due this year in payments of interest and principal on its Dollars 480m foreign debt. In Brussels, a senior Nato official said that the US and some of its allies were considering new steps to prevent a spill-over of the Yugoslav conflict into the troubled province of Kosovo, agencies report. The growing threat of a wider war in the Balkans would be discussed when Nato defence ministers meet later this week and alliance foreign ministers meet next week, the official added.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEARS ON THE VIA DOLOROSA; POPE HEARS CONFESSIONS;  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS MARK GOOD FRIDAY  </P> <P> Hundreds of Christian pilgrims wept, prayed and sang hymns along the Via  Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City in a Good Friday procession that retraced the  path that tradition holds Jesus took to his Crucifixion.  </P> <P> About a dozen devotees carried heavy wooden crosses to symbolize Christ's walk  of agony, and many knelt for communal prayers at the 14 stations that mark the  route.  </P> <P> A costumed group from Southern California, complete with a thorn-crowned Christ  figure, performed along the way. A minor scuffle broke out when Roman Catholic  and Protestant groups crossed paths, each demanding right of way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Turnout  </P> <P> The turnout was considerably lower than in past years, reflecting fears over  the 15-month Palestinian revolt that has torn the Israeli-occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip and spilled into Arab East Jerusalem. No major violence was  reported.  </P> <P> At the Vatican on Good Friday, Pope John Paul II heard confessions from seven  worshipers at St. Peter's Basilica.  </P> <P> Wearing a dark mantle over his white cassock, the Pope spent 70 minutes hearing  the confessions of a 29-year-old West German religion teacher, two Roman bus  drivers, two Italian army cadets and a mother and son from the northern Italian  city of Verona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carrying the Cross  </P> <P> In the evening the pontiff carried a 6-foot wooden cross through Rome's ancient  Colosseum symbolizing Christ's walk to his Crucifixion on Calvary Hill.  </P> <P> The Polish-born Pope started hearing confessions on Good Friday shortly after  his election in 1978.  </P> <P> Holy Week observances culminate on Easter Sunday when the Pope celebrates mass  in St. Peter's Square and delivers his twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city  and the world) address from the central balcony of the basilica.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7 Nailed to Crosses  </P> <P> In the Philippines, at least seven people were nailed to crosses and thousands  of Filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the back to symbolize the  suffering of Christ. About 5,000 people attended the ritual in San Pedro Citud,  40 miles north of Manila.  </P> <P> In Bulacan province, Luciana Reyes, 30, had her palms and feet nailed to a  wooden cross for the 13th straight year. Another woman was also to have been  crucified, but she screamed in pain when the nails pierced her palms and the  crucifixion was stopped.  </P> <P> This year, for the first time, the government's Department of Tourism financed  the spectacle in San Pedro Citud.  </P> <P> Stalls selling food, soft drinks, beer, straw hats, fans and other souvenirs  lined the area.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, scores of city police and paramilitary border forces armed with  automatic rifles, tear-gas grenades and riot batons were moved into the Old  City to ensure security for worshipers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Street of Sorrow  </P> <P> The procession swept through the Via Dolorosa, or Sorrowful Road, to the Church  of the Holy Sepulcher, where tradition holds Christ was buried after dying at  the hands of the Roman rulers of the Holy Land.  </P> <P> The main procession was led by 20 Roman Catholic Franciscan monks. About 600  worshipers followed, a fraction of the crowd that traditionally participates.  </P> <P> The group that provided the street theater was made up of residents of Southern  California. Ralph Beltran of Los Angeles portrayed Christ, his head crowned  with thorns. His companions, dressed as Roman guards, pretended to flog him as  he dragged a wooden cross through the streets.  </P> <P> Joanne Petranela of Brea costumed as Mary Magdalene, ran among astonished  onlookers shouting, "It's all my fault!"  </P> <P> A German pilgrim from Munich, who identified himself only as Helmut, termed the  show "a disgrace to Christianity."  </P> <P> A scuffle broke out when the procession crossed the path of a Protestant group  moving in another direction. Police stepped in to stop fistfights, then quickly  set up a barricade.  </P></p>

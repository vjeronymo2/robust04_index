			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY SHEARER  </P> <P> I disagree with what Harry Shearer was trying to get across to readers when he  wrote "Tube-tied" (Oct. 28).  </P> <P> The problem is regulating what children watch; if we don't, who will? Shows for  children, especially those shown at school, should be screened. Millions of  taxpayers are not willing to give up money to have their kids going to school  to watch television.  </P> <P> Christoper Whittle and company may be paying for the VCRs and televisions, but  who is paying for the teachers' to "teach" the children? If we do not allow  these subliminal commercials to enter the public school, then we will not have  to worry about it being regurgitated in our children.  </P> <P> KERRY LEE  </P> <P> Hacienda Heights  </P></p>

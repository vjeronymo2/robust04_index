			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica calls time on international bauxite pact Jamaica is leaving the bauxite producers' organisation, which it helped to create 20 years ago, suggesting that it is no longer relevant to its members. It will tell the other members of the International Bauxite Association that the body should be dissolved. If the others disagree then Jamaica will secede, says Mr Robert Pickersgill, the island's mining minister. The government's decision has come after several months of uncertainty over the future of the IBA, which has its headquarters in Kingston, following reports that many members were delinquent in meeting their financial obligations. The association, which bauxite (aluminium ore) and alumina (aluminium oxide) consumers had feared would become a cartel, has been acting as a data bank for its members, allowing them to exchange information and ideas on the state of the industry. It received a setback two years ago when Australia, its most important member, pulled out, questioning the IBA's relevance. This deprived the IBA of about 40 per cent of its budget, and the situation was worsened by a high level of delinquency among the remaining members. The association lists its members as Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Sierra Leone and Surinam. Before Australia pulled out the IBA lost two of its founding members - the Dominican Republic and Haiti - because their industries were shut down. It also lost another founding member with the break-up of Yugoslavia. 'When the IBA was established in 1974 its members accounted for about 75 per cent of the world's bauxite production, but this has fallen to about 25 per cent today,' Mr Pickersgill says. 'We have said to the other members that we do not think that we are progressing, and that we want an end to the IBA.' The IBA was unsuccessful in expanding its membership, and failed to attract producers such as Brazil despite repeated attempts. It also failed to broker a commodity pact between bauxite producers and consumers under the aegis of the UN Committee on Trade and Development, because of a lack of support from either side, and because bauxite trade could not be organised in pacts similar to those for other commodities.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (7): A four-year revolution - The privatisation programme Hungary's Socialist-led government has set itself the ambitious target of completing its privatisation programme by the end of its four-year term. To show it is in earnest, it has appointed a political heavyweight, Mr Ferenc Bartha, a former central bank governor and more recently head of Banque Indosuez Hungary, to the new job of government privatisation commissioner. 'We don't expect to privatise 100 per cent of the economy by 1998,' concedes Mr Peter Mihalyi, Mr Bartha's deputy. 'But we would like the economy to be largely in private hands. We have to reduce the state's involvement so that privatisation is no longer a top priority political issue.' To achieve this goal, a group of 30 economists from the state and private sectors spent several weeks this autumn drawing up a new privatisation strategy and draft bill. Mr Bartha is hopeful the bill will be passed by parliament before the year ends. 'The political will exists,' he says. He says the state will reduce the number of companies in which it will retain a majority stake and privatise companies immediately rather than restructure them first. Cash would be generated from sales of the big blue chip companies such as utilities, while companies would be teamed up with strategic investors. Finding good partners and providing for companies' long-term survival will take priority over revenue generation for medium-sized firms. The state intends to sell small companies as quickly as possible, preferably for cash, or failing that by offering incentives to management and/or employee groups or other investors. Mr Bartha wants to make greater use of the country's nascent capital markets. One idea is to launch a country fund grouping shares from 10 to 12 partially privatised companies such as Matav, the telecommunications monopoly, 30 per cent of which was sold to a Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech consortium in December. Most foreign advisers believe good companies would generate more revenue if sold individually, but Mr Bartha says a country fund would attract interest from the many new emerging market investment funds. The appointment of Mr Bartha and the new strategy have been generally well-received by foreign investors. However, most are reserving judgment until they see action. 'There's an element of strategy fatigue. We've heard much of this before,' says one western investment banker. Investors add that, in the short term, some of the government's proposals, such as the merger of the two main privatisation bodies - AV Rt, the state holding company, and the AVU, the state property agency - will inevitably slow down, not accelerate, the process. Investors have also been unsettled by sweeping per- sonnel changes at AV Rt, inc- luding the dismissal of Mr Lajos Csepi, its respected general director, and the sacking of several top mana- gers at large state companies due for privatisation such as MVM, the electricity mono- poly. 'However competent the new managers, such radical changes will inevitably slow privatisation of these companies,' one banker says. Observers fear the sackings and a much-publicised inquiry into alleged corruption in privatisation under the previous government mean the process will remain highly politicised. A western diplomat says: 'The government is spending a lot of energy investigating the past and attacking its predecessor's record. Instead, it should be concentrating on the future.' Despite their criticisms, most investors are hopeful the government will move ahead with the privatisation of its gas distribution and electricity monopolies, both of which are attracting significant foreign interest. Gas will come first with the government expected to announce a tender date this autumn for the sale of 25 per cent stakes in the five regional domestic gas distributors. Mr Laszlo Pal, Socialist industry and trade minister, says the government will follow this up in the first quarter of 1995 with the first tender for the privatisation of MVM, the electricity monopoly. The aim is to close a deal by the end of the year. The government, which is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, is expected to offer stakes first in MVM's power distribution subsidiaries. Before this can happen, however, the government must complete the regulatory framework for the industry. This includes tightening the contractual relationship between different MVM subsidiaries and resolving the socially sensitive issue of price regulation. Mr Pal says prices, which are controlled by the state, will become 'market-based'. But to achieve this, the government has to ensure that increases are acceptable to the public and do not 'gallop away'. Analysts estimate that electricity prices must rise by at least 70 per cent to make the company attractive to outside investors.</p>

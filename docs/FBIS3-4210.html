The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 </H5>   In 1993, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line, the people of all nationalities across the country worked  hard as one to implement in an all-round way the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress, thus scoring tremendous  achievements in all fields of endeavor. The reform of the  economic structure continued to deepen, and the national economy  grew in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. A bumper  harvest was reaped in agriculture; industrial production  witnessed rapid growth; the domestic market was brisk, and the  people's living standards continued to rise as their income  increased; the state of fixed-asset investment improved  somewhat, and the construction of infrastructural facilities and  basic industries was increased; and as China opened itself wider  to the outside world, international economic cooperation and  trade contacts increased considerably. The aforementioned  situation indicated that reform and opening to the outside world  had brought about vitality and potential for developing China's  economy, that all economic operations were continuing to move  forward in a healthy direction, and that it was entirely  necessary and correct for the party Central Committee and the  State Council to adopt the measure strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control.    On this basis, total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482  billion yuan -- (including 69.384 billion yuan in income  received from domestic and foreign debts) -- covering 113.1  percent of the budget, a 23.2-percent increase over the previous  year. Total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan  -- (including 33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle  and interest on domestic and foreign debts) -- equalled 112.5  percent of the budget, a 21.2- percent increase over the figure  for 1992. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan,  which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. Of this figure,  the central finance deficit came to 20.5 billion yuan, which is  the same as the budgeted figure. Local revenues and expenditures  were balanced. These figures were initially figures taken from  the monthly report on the budget's implementation. There will  be some changes when the final state accounts are compiled.    The state of implementing the state budget for 1993 based  on the double-entry system was as follows:    Revenues in the regular budget totalled 407.391 billion  yuan,  or 119.3 percent of the budgeted figures. The main forms of  revenue were: 1) Various taxes were 402.805 billion yuan, or  116.3 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Income from state  budget regulatory funds was 10.172 billion yuan, or 86.2 percent  of the budgeted figures. 3) Other income was 17.889 billion  yuan, or 187.7 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Subsidies  for nonproductive enterprises were 20.527 billion yuan, which  was 1.473 billion yuan less than the budgeted figure, and the  amount was reversed in the budget entry. Expenditures in the  regular budget totalled 334.834 billion yuan, or 111.3 percent  of the budgeted figures, accounting for 62.9 percent of total  state expenditures. The main items of expenditures were: 1)  Capital construction for nonproductive projects totalled 19.519  billion yuan, or 112.4 percent of the budgeted figures. 2)  Expenditures for developing various public undertakings and for  social security [she hui bao zhang 4357 2585 0202 7140] totalled  129.718 billion yuan, or 112.1 percent. Of this total,  expenditures for agriculture, forestry, and water conservation  projects totalled 14.214 billion yuan, or 107.5 percent of the  budgeted figures; expenditures for cultural, educational,  science, and health undertakings were 96.046 billion yuan, or  112.7 percent of the budgeted figures; and pensions for disabled  people and families of deceased people and social aid totalled  7.516 billion yuan, or 108.4 percent of the budgeted figures.  3) Expenditures for state political power were 102.406 billion  yuan, or 112.2 percent of the budgeted figures. Of this total,  expenditures for administration and management were 54.033  billion yuan, or 121.5 percent of the budgeted figures; and  expenditures for national defense were 43.248 billion yuan, or  101.8 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Expenditures for  price subsidies were 29.622 billion yuan, or 79.5 percent of the  budgeted figures. 5) Other expenditures were 51.719 billion  yuan, or 149.7 percent of the budgeted figures. Total revenues  were 72.557 billion yuan more than total expenditures in the  regular budget, and the balance was shifted to the construction  budget.    The construction budget revenues (not including income from  domestic and foreign debts) totalled 107.264 billion yuan, or  122.5 percent of the budgeted figures. The main sources of  revenue were: 1) The amount of the balance in the regular budget  shifted to the construction budget was 72.557 billion yuan. 2)  Specialized construction revenues (including income from energy,  communications, and other key construction projects and taxes  for city maintenance) were 48.699 billion yuan, or 96.7 percent  of the budgeted figures. 3) The income of various enterprises  was 5.433 billion yuan, or 65.1 percent of the budgeted figures.  4) Transfer funds were 1.302 billion yuan, or 26 percent of the  budgeted figures. 5) Subsidies to make up for losses by  productive enterprises were 20.727 billion yuan, resulting in a  balance of 3.877 billion yuan which represents a debit in the  budget that has been deducted from the receipts. Construction  budget expenditures were 197.148 billion yuan (including  expenditures for the repayment of domestic and foreign debts,  plus interest), or 114.6 percent of the budgeted figures,  accounting for 37.1 percent of the total budgeted expenditures.  The main items of construction budget expenditures were: 1)  Productive capital construction expenditures were 73.187 billion  yuan (including 26 billion yuan by utilizing foreign debts), or  102.8 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Expenditures for  tapping potentials, restructuring existing enterprises, and  introducing the trial production of new products were 42.362  billion yuan, or 170.5 percent of the budgeted figures. 3) The  additional appropriation of revolving funds for enterprises  totalled 1.882 billion yuan, or 134.4 percent of the budgeted  figures. 4) Expenditures for geological surveys and prospecting  were 5.16 billion yuan, or 105 percent of the budgeted figures.  5) Expenditures for supporting agricultural production were  17.977 billion yuan, or 112.6 percent of the budgeted figures.  6) Expenditures for city maintenance and construction totalled  19.47 billion yuan, or 124.7 percent of the budgeted figures.  7) Expenditures for supporting economic development in less  developed areas were 2.226 billion yuan, or 104.6 percent of the  budgeted figures. 8) Expenditures for the repayment of domestic  and foreign debts plus interest were 33.735 billion yuan, or  96.5 percent of the budgeted figures. The difference between  construction budget revenues and construction budget  expenditures was 89.884 billion yuan, and the balance was  included in the central state budget. Of this total, 38.484  billion yuan were covered by domestic debts and 30.9 billion  yuan were covered by foreign debts, and the remaining 20.5  billion yuan were an out-and-out financial deficit which will be  covered by borrowing from the People's Bank of China according  to the budget approved by the First Session of the Eighth NPC  last year.    The result of the implementation of the 1993 state budget  was that both revenues and expenditures exceeded the budgeted  figures by a fairly large margin. According to our preliminary  analysis, the overfulfillment of revenues by a large margin was  mainly due to three factors: First, the national economy's  sustained, rapid growth caused an accompanying increase in  revenue. In 1993, the gross domestic product increased 13.4  percent compared to the previous year; industrial value-added  production increased by 21.1 percent; and the total volume of  retail sales increased by 26.1 percent. The rapid growth of the  national economy and the expanded circulation of commodities  brought about the overfulfillment of revenues of the main tax  categories closely related to economic growth. Revenues from  the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax alone were  49.5 billion yuan greater than the budgeted figure. Second,  measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control yielded positive results and led to a marked drop in  revenue losses. As a result of the implementation of measures  taken since last year by the party Central Committee and the  State Council to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control, situations such as reducing or remitting taxes without  authorization, refunding tax payments arbitrarily, assigning  people to collect fixed amounts of taxes, and other violations  of financial and tax laws have been brought under effective  control. Meanwhile, cases of reducing or remitting taxes for  the time being or because of financial difficulties were no  longer examined and approved. As a result, financial revenues  increased month by month. According to State General  Administration of Taxation statistics, efforts to screen tax  reductions and exemptions and to collect tax payments in arrears  for previous years brought about a 30 billion yuan increase.  Third, in 1994, the central authorities decided to implement the  fiscal tax assignment system, under which the central government  will return to local governments a certain percentage of their  tax revenues based on their 1993 figures. This new system  aroused the local governments' enthusiasm for revenue  collection, and they took a number of measures to strictly  collect taxes, manage revenues, and prevent tax evasion. As a  result, revenues increased by a large margin in the fourth  quarter. However, some local governments, to inflate the base  figure for the central government's reimbursement, resorted to  illegitimate means and to fraud by collecting taxes before the  due date. We have urged local governments to examine and  correct themselves, and we will organize forces to verify and  handle cases in accordance with the State Council's requirements.    Expenditures exceeded the budgeted figure. This is mainly  because local governments may spend more when they have more  revenue according to the principle of striking a balance between  revenues and expenditure and after turning over what they have  to turn over to the higher authorities in light of the  contracted financial responsibility system. So, a big increase  in local revenues gave rise to a corresponding rise in local  expenditures. 1) As far as the categories of increased  expenditures were concerned, expenditures related to economic  growth increased by a bigger margin. Of these increases,  expenditures for domestic capital construction exceeded the  budgeted figure by 4.164 billion yuan, expenditures for tapping  the potentials of enterprises and their restructuring exceeded  the budgeted figure by 16.982 billion yuan, and expenditures for  aiding agriculture exceeded the budgeted figure by 3.004 billion  yuan. 2) Expenditures needed to develop various undertakings  increased by a larger margin. Of these increases, spending on  cultural, educational, science, and health projects were 10.816  billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending on  education alone were 6.463 billion yuan more than the budgeted  figure. Spending on urban maintenance and construction were  3.86 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. 3) Spending on  wage adjustments for workers and staffers of administrative  institutions and units was budgeted at 4 billion yuan. In the  course of its implementation, however, because the margin of  wage adjustments was higher than the originally estimated  figure, in addition to an increase in personnel and changes in  jobs and grades throughout the year, the actual spending was  almost double the budgeted figure. It should be said that such  spending increases are reasonable and necessary for ensuring the  development of reform, construction, and various undertakings.  At the same time, however, it also should be noted that the  scale of construction has expanded in an unplanned way, and that  the situation of going after things new and foreign and engaging  in extravagance and waste is quite serious in the way that  administrative expenses are disbursed. In a few localities,  spending was even reported falsely. These are also important  reasons for expenditures having exceeded the budgeted figures.    Generally speaking, the 1993 budget was implemented well.  To ensure the deepening of reforms and to bring about the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy, the finance and taxation departments at all levels did  a great deal of work under the unified leadership of the party  and the government. First, they achieved positive results in  collecting revenues, strictly managed revenue collection, and  screened cases of tax reductions and exemptions and cases of tax  payments which are in arrears. In accordance with the unified  arrangements of the State Council, local governments carried out  a complete screening of tax reductions and exemptions that they  had authorized, as well as of the policies regarding the "two  funds" and abolished some improper policies and provisions. In  view of changes in sources of revenue, many localities carried  out timely readjustments of their emphasis with respect to tax  collection, improved their management, and ensured a reasonable  growth of revenue. Second, they tried in every possible way to  collect funds and thus ensured revenue for major expenditures.  Especially while revenue growth was slow in the first half of  1993, the finance departments at all levels managed to reduce  less essential expenditures and to rationalize the distribution  of funds, and they did their best and ensured funding for  essential expenditures. Third, important progress was made in  fiscal reform and legislation. The "General Rules for Enterprise  Finance" and the "Rules for Enterprise Accounting" were  successfully put into effect on 1 July 1993. A great deal of  preparations were made last year for a comprehensive reform of  the fiscal and tax systems. The "Registered Accountants Law,"  revised the "Individual Income Tax Law," and the "Accounting  Law" have been promulgated and put into effect. The State  Council has promulgated some interim taxation regulations,  including those concerning the value-added tax, consumption tax,  business tax, resource tax, enterprise income tax, and land  value appreciation tax. The "Budget Law" will be submitted to  this session for deliberation. Special mention should be made  of the fact that although treasury bond sales were sluggish for  some period last year, party committees and governments at all  levels, as well as relevant departments, attached great  importance and lent their enthusiastic support to such sales.  Financial departments at all levels also devoted massive  manpower to providing services aimed at promoting sales, thereby  ensuring the completion of the task of issuing treasury bonds.  This was of vital importance to the fulfillment of last year's  budgetary tasks.    Deputies, at present we are in a important period of  economic  restructuring and rapid economic development. Not only is the  contradiction between the supply of funds and the demand for  funds very sharp, but management in various sectors urgently  needs to be improved. In 1993, all large increases in both  revenues and expenditures were attained at the local level, and  the central government did not fulfill the budget targets in  revenues and expenditures. While local revenues increased by a  big margin, the revenue from the turnover tax belonging to the  central government was far below the budget target, thus further  aggravating the central government's financial difficulties.  All these show from different angles the problem of the fiscal  and tax systems, especially when some localities could not pay  the wages of their workers and staff members in a normal manner  even after local revenues increased by a big margin.  Governments at all levels should pay great attention to this  problem. To solve these problems once and for all, we will  comprehensively reform the fiscal and tax systems this year  according to the decisions and unified arrangements of the State  Council. We will seize this opportunity to further improve  fiscal and tax management and gradually establish fiscal and tax  operating mechanisms to meet the requirements of the socialist  market economy so that fiscal and tax management will be  standardized and legally institutionalized, and so the country's  financial situation will be improved as quickly as possible.    2. The Draft State Budget for 1994    The year 1994 is a crucual year for implementing in an  all-around way the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee; realizing reform in establishing  a socialist market economic structure; and continuing to  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy. The deepening of reform and economic  development have created many favorable conditions for state  finances, but have also brought about difficulties. The current  financial situation is still grim. On the one hand, market  demands this year will remain brisk due to the reaction of such  factors as the increase of investments and the rise in the price  of farm products and workers' and staff's wages. On the other  hand, after two years of successive rapid growth, China's  economy is faced with an expanding "bottleneck" restraint and  inflationary pressure. The overall environment for economic  growth is by no means easy, and the contradiction in money  supply and demand is quite serious. To maintain a basic balance  between total demand and total supply and to alleviate the  inflationary pressure, it is necessary to follow the principle  of tightening budgetary restraint in drawing up the state budget  for 1994.    On the basis of this understanding, the guiding principles  for planning the state budget for 1994 are: Fully implementing  the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; ensuring  smooth progress in financial, taxation, and other major economic  reforms; continuing to tighten and improve macroeconomic  regulation and control; actively building up financial sources;  paying attention to improving enterprises' efficiency; ensuring  that increases in financial revenue match economic development;  upholding the principle of acting within one's means;  readjusting the expenditure structure; appropriately increasing  input in such key sectors as agriculture, education, science and  technology, and infrastructure; maintaining needed increases in  funds for national defense, public security, and judicial  departments; strictly controlling ordinary fixed assets  investment and consumptive expenditures; and promoting  sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national  economy, as well as overall social progress.    In line with the general plan of the party Central Committee  and the State Council, we have carried out a major reform of the  taxation system, the financial system, and the system of profit  distribution in state-owned enterprises this year. After  financial and taxation reform, there have been considerable  changes in the requirements for drawing up the budget. For  example, following the reform of the indirect tax system --  because of the fact that the value-added tax has been  universally practiced in production and circulation areas -- the  turnover tax levied on wholesalers and retailers and the product  tax levied on some products have been converted into value-added  tax. As a result, the value-added tax has increased nearly 100  percent while the turnover tax has decreased correspondingly.  With the cancellation of the product tax, the levying of a  consumption tax on a small number of products has begun. Here  is another example: in accordance with the stipulation on the  division of central and local tax categories set by the new  financial system, fixed central revenue and fixed local revenue  are to be listed as central revenue and local revenue. As for  tax revenues to be shared by central and local authorities, 75  percent of the value-added tax is to be listed as central  revenue. At the same time, tax revenues to be returned to local  authorities by the central authorities are to be listed as  central subsidy expenditures for local authorities. The amount  of central expenditures has increased considerably because the  amount of tax revenues to be returned to local authorities is  fairly large. As a result of these changes, corresponding  readjustments have been made in the draft state budget for 1994.    In accordance with the guiding principles for budgetary  planning and the changes made in calculations, we have initially  planned the 1994 budget as follows: State revenues (excluding  income from domestic and foreign debts) total 475.995 billion  yuan, a 7.7 percent increase over the previous year, calculated  on similar terms. State expenditures (excluding expenses  incurred to service domestic and foreign debts) total 542.914  billion yuan, a 15 percent increase over the previous year,  calculated on similar terms. This leaves a deficit of 66.919  billion yuan. We also made certain changes from the previous  year in the way incomes and expenditures from domestic and  foreign debts and budget deficits are calculated. Primarily, in  the past, income from debts was included in total revenues, and  debt service was included in total expenditures; budget  shortages resulting therefrom were regarded as real deficits and  were covered by borrowing from the people's bank. Many experts  at home and abroad have raised issues concerning this method of  calculation. To better reflect how the state's regular revenues  and expenditures and debt obligations stand, beginning this  year, we will change the way deficits are calculated. Under the  new method, receipts from debts will not be included in total  budgets, nor will debt service be included in total  expenditures; budget shortages will be covered entirely by  borrowing. At the same time, domestic and foreign debts due for  repayment will be serviced by borrowing. The adjustment only  changes the way deficits are calculated and will not affect  their actual size.    Under the 1994 budget plan, state revenues will increase 7.7  percent over the previous year, which is not high. This is  mainly because last year's revenues were substantially above the  budgeted amount. The increase in last year's revenues has  limited the scope of increase in this year's revenues. At the  same time, policy-related factors -- such as exemption from  state budget regulating funds and communications and energy  construction funds granted to state-owned enterprises this year,  the implementation of the "General Financial Rules for  Enterprises," and the increase in export tax rebates -- have  reduced revenues by about 30 billion yuan. These policy-related  revenue-reducing measures are all designed to support  enterprises, exports, and reform. Calculated in comparable  terms, this year's revenue will actually increase 14.4 percent  over the previous year. The current revenue plan, therefore, is  positive, and is based on a full consideration of  revenue-enhancing factors, such as rapid economic development  and improved management. In the area of expenditures, although  we appropriately reduced investment in fixed assets, the high  expenditure base for 1993 made it necessary to increase  expenditures by more than 50 billion yuan to cover such  policy-related expenditures as increases in essential  expenditures on agriculture, education, science and technology  and other key areas; wage increases for employees of  administrative departments and public institutions; and  increased subsidies following the introduction of a single  exchange rate. All this has made it quite difficult to balance  the budget and has actually resulted in a considerable increase  in deficits from the previous year.    The draft state budget compiled according to the dual  budget system follows:    Revenues in the regular budget total 448.911 billion yuan, a  9.9 percent increase over the previous year. The main receipts  are: 1) Tax receipts, 446.123 billion yuan; 2) receipts from  state budget regulating funds, 2.8 billion yuan; 3) receipts  from other sources, 15.288 billion yuan; and 4) subsidies to  make up for losses for nonproductive enterprises, 19.3 billion  yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already  been deducted from projected receipts. The expenditures in the  regular budget amount to 392.846 billion yuan, which posts a  17.3 percent increase over the previous year and represents 72.4  percent of total expenditures in the budget. The main  expenditures break down as follows: 1) Nonproductive capital  construction, 19.486 billion yuan; 2) expenditures for  development and operation of certain undertakings and for social  insurance, 153.566 billion yuan, including 16.737 billion yuan  in expenses for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy,  113.296 billion yuan for culture, education, science, and public  health, and 8.386 billion yuan for pensions for the disabled and  families of the deceased and social relief payments; 3) expenses  for building up the national strength, 119.199 billion yuan,  including 61.359 billion yuan for administrative expenses and  52.04 billion yuan for national defense; 4) subsidies to  compensate for price rises, 37.342 billion yuan; 5)  miscellaneous expenses, 54.353 billion yuan; and 6) central and  local reserves, 3.5 billion yuan. When revenues are set against  expenditures in the regular budget, there will be a surplus of  56.065 billion yuan, which will be transferred to the  construction budget.    Revenues in the construction budget total 83.149 billion  yuan, a decrease of 22.5 percent from the previous year. The  main receipts break down as follows: 1) Regular budget surplus,  56.065 billion yuan; 2) receipts for special construction  projects, 43.718 billion yuan, including 4.8 billion yuan from  funds collected for construction of key energy and transport  projects; and 3) subsidies to make up for losses suffered by  productive enterprises, 16.634 billion yuan, which represents a  debit in the budget that has already been deducted from the  receipts. Expenditures in the construction budget total 150.068  billion yuan, which posts an increase of 9.2 percent over the  previous year and represents 27.6 percent of total budgetary  expenditures. The breakdown of major items of expenditures  follows: 1) Expenses for productive capital construction,  45.756 billion yuan (excluding 14.245 billion yuan arranged from  foreign loans); 2) funds for tapping the potential of existing  enterprises, upgrading technology, and subsidizing trial  manufacture of new products, 38.508 billion yuan; 3) additional  working capital for enterprises, 1.882 billion yuan; 4) expenses  for geological surveying, 6.198 billion yuan; 5) expenditures  for support of agricultural production, 21.063 billion yuan,  including 6.685 billion yuan of special funds for agricultural  development; 6) expenses for urban construction and maintenance,  21.6 billion yuan; and 7) development funds to aid economically  underdeveloped areas, 2.55 billion yuan. Expenditures exceed  revenues in the construction budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919  billion yuan, which is to be covered by issuing treasury bonds  and borrowing from the bank. Coupled with the principal and  interest of domestic and foreign debts in the amount of 48.081  billion yuan, which mature and must be repayed this year, and  14.245 billion yuan's worth of foreign loans used by the state  for key construction projects this year, the total amount of  debts incurred for 1994 will be 129.245 billion yuan.    In the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the central  budget are set at 332.91 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase  over the previous year. The figure includes revenues of 272.056  billion yuan by the central government and revenues of 60.854  billion yuan turned over by local governments to the central  government. Expenditures in the central budget amount to 399.829  billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year.  The figure includes expenditures of 186.289 billion yuan by the  central government and expenditures of 213.54 billion yuan as  tax refunds and subsidies to local governments. Expenditures  exceed revenues in the central budget, leaving a deficit of  66.919 billion yuan. According to the budget drafted by us for  local governments, a total amount of 417.479 billion yuan is  arranged as financial revenues for local governments. The  figure, including financial revenues of 203.939 billion yuan by  local governments and tax refunds and subsidies totaling 213.54  billion yuan by the central government, posts an increase of 6.8  percent over the previous year. Expenditures in the draft local  budget come to 417.479 billion yuan, an increase of 6.8 percent  over the previous year. The figure includes expenditures of  356.625 billion yuan by local governments and an amount of  60.854 billion yuan to be turned over to the central government.  Thus, local revenues and expenditures are balanced.    The central budget compiled according to the dual budget  system follows:    Revenues in the regular central budget total 325.923 billion  yuan, a 6-percent increase over the previous year. The main  receipts are broken down as follows: 1) Various tax receipts,  264.529 billion yuan; 2) receipts from state budget regulating  funds, 1.64 billion yuan; 3) receipts from other sources, 1.49  billion yuan; and 4) receipts turned over to the central  government by local governments, 60.854 billion yuan.  Expenditures in the regular central budget total 310.667  billion yuan, a 10.7-percent increase over the previous year.  The main expenditures are broken down as follows: 1)  Expenditures for nonproductive capital construction, 12.046  billion yuan; 2) expenditures for the development of public  services and social security, 19.457 billion yuan; 3)  expenditures for building up national strength, 62.361 billion  yuan; 4) subsidies to compensate for price increases, 13.1  billion yuan; 5) miscellaneous expenses, 9.391 billion yuan; 6)  central reserves, 1.5 billion yuan; and 7) subsidies by the  central government for regular expenses incurred by local  governments, 187.412 billion yuan. When revenues in the regular  central budget are offset against expenditures, there is a  surplus of 15.256 billion yuan, which will be transferred to the  construction budget.    Revenues in the central construction budget total 22.243  billion yuan, a 44.3-percent decrease from the previous year.  The main receipts are broken down as follows: 1) The surplus  from the regular budget, 15.256 billion yuan; 2) receipts for  special construction projects, 13.21 billion yuan; 3) subsidies  to make up for losses in productive enterprises, 6.223 billion  yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already  been deducted from the receipts. Expenditures in the  construction budget total 89.162 billion yuan, a 27.2-percent  increase over the previous year. The main expenditures are  broken down as follows: 1) Expenditures for productive capital  construction, 29.899 billion yuan; 2) Funds for tapping existing  enterprises' potential, upgrading technology, and subsidizing  the trial manufacturing of new products, 11.998 billion yuan; 3)  additional working capital for enterprises, 1.15 billion yuan;  4) expenditures for geological surveying, 6.158 billion yuan; 5)  expenditures for aiding agricultural production, 1 billion yuan;  6) development funds for aiding economically underdeveloped  areas, 1.385 billion yuan; and 7) subsidies for local  construction by the central government, 26.128 billion yuan.  Expenditures exceed revenues in the central construction  budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan, which will be  covered by debt. The total debt volume for 1994 will total  129.245 billion yuan, including 48.081 billion yuan in principal  and interest on domestic and foreign debts that will become due  this year, and 14.245 billion yuan in foreign loans to be used  for key state construction projects.    The 1994 state draft budget was drawn up in light of the new  situation following financial and tax reforms. During the  budgeting process, we gave as much consideration as possible to  various factors that may affect budget revenues and  expenditures. Nonetheless, the actual situation will inevitably  be different. Specifically, it is difficult to estimate with  complete accuracy revenues transferred from one tax category to  another, changes in enterprises' burdens, and increases or  decreases in local revenues following reform of the taxation  system. The effects of financial and tax reforms on various  economic activities can be seen clearly only after such reforms  have been implemented for a considerable period of time.  Because the budget was drawn up amid a significant number of  uncertain factors, some changes may occur when it is  implemented. If the changes are substantial, we will rework the  budget and submit the revised version to the National People's  Congress Standing Committee for examination and approval. To  facilitate examination by fellow deputies, I would like to  expound on policy-related issues in compiling the draft state  budget:    (1) On the question of debts in 1994. Domestic  and foreign debts for 1994 are set at 129.245 billion yuan, a  39.361 billion yuan increase; the total debt volume accounts for  3.8 percent of the year's gross domestic product, a slight  increase over the previous year. The increase in the debt  volume is related to three factors. First of all, to balance  regular financial revenues and expenditures, 66.919 billion yuan  treasury bonds are to be issued to make up for the increased  financial deficit which, from 1994, can only be settled through  issuing bonds, not borrowing money from banks; thus increasing  the debt volume. Second, treasury bonds are also issued for  paying for the principal and interest on domestic and foreign  debts due this year, which totals 48.081 billion yuan. Third,  to step up major construction, the state's financial input for  key construction projects will be 14.245 billion yuan in foreign  loans. I would like to explain here the relatively big volume  of treasury bonds to be issued this year. Although we have  substantively reformed the procedures for issuing and managing  bonds in line with the requirements of a market economy,  successful fulfillment of the issuance task still needs the  undertanding and support of leaders at all levels and people  throughout the country. So long as we ensure good publicity, not  only can this year's task of issuing bonds be fulfilled, but  also their market operations can be better than in the previous  year.    (2) On the question of promoting rural economic  development in an all-around way. The development of  agriculture and increase of peasant income is the prerequisite  for ensuring a basic balance between the total supply and demand  of society and for safeguarding social stability. To this end,  expenditures for aiding production and for paying various  agriculture-related operating expenses in this year's state  budget total 37.8 billion yuan, a 17.4 percent increase over the  actual expenses in the previous year. Including other budgetary  items used as agricultural expenses, the state's planned  financial input in agriculture totals 52.3 billion yuan, a 7  billion yuan increase over the previous year. Meanwhile, to  comprehensively implement the central authorities' "Several  Policy Measures Regarding the Current Agriculture and Rural  Economic Development," the state will adopt additional policy  measures, including perfecting the grain reserve system and  establishing the central and local grain risk fund systems;  appropriately raising the procurement price of grain and the  contract price of cotton after new grain and cotton crops appear  on the market; and readjusting the state's input into  agriculture to ensure stable grain markets and to increase  peasant income, thereby promoting rural economic development in  an all-around way.    (3) On the question of further invigorating large and  medium state enterprises. Further invigoration of large  and medium state enterprises is crucial for maintaining a  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy, as well as an important foundation for establishing a  socialist market economic structure. In line with the central  authorities' requirements for transforming the operating  mechanisms of enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise  system, this year's reform of the fiscal and taxation systems  will focus on transforming mechanisms and standardizing the  taxation system for all enterprises, because this will have a  positive impact on building up state enterprises' stamina for  development and competitiveness. Meanwhile, the tax reform will  abolish the regulatory tax for state enterprises and exempt them  from the payment of funds for construction of key energy and  transport projects and for state budget regulating funds,  thereby increasing their financial resources by over 14 billion  yuan. The implementation of the "two sets of rules" will change  the computing method for profits and losses of enterprises and  enable them to keep their capital intact while reducing their  delivery of revenues to the state and increasing their funds for  upgrading technology. The impact of the aforesaid reduced  revenues has already been taken into account in the draft state  budget.    (4) The question of increasing input in science and  technology, education, and other key areas. In 1993, the  actual expenses from state finance on science, technology, and  education increased over the previous year; and operating  expenses related to culture, education, science, and public  health increased more than 20 percent over 1992. On the basis  of last year's increase, this year's budget for culture,  education, science, and public health expenses is 17 billion  yuan, or 18 percent, more than last year. Of this, operating  expenses for education will be 66.233 billion yuan; and for  science, 7.989 billion yuan; 18.5 percent and 19.8 percent more  than the previous year's actual amounts respectively, which are  both higher then the increase of the financial revenue.  Including other budgetary items used as expenses for education,  science, and technology, this year the state's financial input  in education will be 81.5 billion yuan; and science and  technology, 23.4 billion yuan. In addition, because of price  rises, wage reform in the army, and increased living standards,  expenditures in national defense are also adjusted accordingly.    3. Deepen Fiscal and Tax Reforms, Vigorously  Increase Revenues and Reduce Expenditures, and Strive To Fulfill  the 1994 State Budget    Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the  overall task for the entire party and nation. The key to  complying with and serving this overall task in fiscal and  taxation work lies in ensuring smooth progress in fiscal and tax  reforms and in fulfilling the state budget for 1994. Leading  comrades in all localities and departments must attach great  importance to these two aspects and earnestly strengthen  leadership. Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels  should seize the opportunity, seek truth from facts, change  their work style, and work hard to ensure the success of fiscal  and tax reforms and the completion of budgetary tasks.    We must carry out work in a down-to-earth manner to  ensure that fiscal and tax reforms will produce the desired  results. The main aspects of this year's fiscal and tax  reforms include reforming the current local financial contract  system to institute a separate taxation system based on a  rational division of power between central and local  authorities; reforming the taxation system to establish an  indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax and to  unify enterprises' income tax and personal income tax; and  reforming state enterprises' profit distribution system. These  reforms are vitally important for our country's efforts to  establish a socialist market economic system; to promote  sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national  economy; and to ensure long-term national stability. Fiscal and  tax reforms are the centerpiece of this year's reform of the  economic system, and they cover a wide range of areas and carry  significant policy implications. In devising the reform plan,  we took account of the need for gradually increasing central  financial resources and fully considered local interests and  enterprise operations. We also shifted the focus of reform to  changing operating mechanisms and did not significantly adjust  the income distribution pattern. Judging by the practice of  reform in the two months or more since the aforementioned  reforms were implemented on 1 January, it is evident that the  reform plan is correct and that it has been implemented quite  satisfactorily without any major incident. However, we must  remain sober-minded and cannot afford to lower our guard.  Although we conducted many investigations and studies, listened  extensively to the opinions of all quarters, and repeatedly  introduced readjustments based on our findings during the course  of devising our reform plan, the way the plan was designed will  necessarily differ from how it will relate to the actual  situation; this will require readjustments and improvements in  the course of implementation. Current fiscal and tax reforms  affect the vital interests of all sectors and the broad masses,  directly affect progress in overall economic reform and social  stability, and have a bearing on this year's economic and fiscal  situation. We must organize them meticulously and advance them  steadily in order to ensure their success. Leading comrades in  all localities and departments should earnestly strengthen their  leadership over fiscal and tax reforms, step up their efforts to  coordinate various reforms, promptly deal with new circumstances  and problems that emerge in the course of reform, and pay  attention to incipient problems and take preventive measures.  Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels should increase  investigations and studies, detect new circumstances on a timely  basis, sum up new experiences, and solve new problems. In  particular, they should properly handle the issue of ensuring  policy continuity in shifting from one system to another, and  ensure that all reform plans are implemented. Unity in  understanding and action holds the key to successful reform.  Although we can point out problems, we must take overall  interests into account when it comes to implementing reform. We  cannot go our own ways, overstep our authority, enact our own  rules and regulations, and distort or alter reform plans. If  such problems occur and are confirmed after investigations, we  should deal with them sternly.    (2) Improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation  and control to promote sustained, rapid, healthy economic  development. The fiscal and taxation departments, as vital  departments exercising the state's macroeconomic regulation and  control, shoulder the major responsibility for healthy economic  development. We must, in line with the requirements of a  socialist market economy and the principle of matching  construction scale with national strength, effectively improve  and strengthen marcoeconomic regulation and control to promote  competition among enterprises on an equal footing, coordinate  regional economic developments, and strive to increase  production and practice economy, and to increase revenues and  cut back expenditures. We must, through the allocation of  fiscal funds and application of fiscal and taxation policies,  strictly control the investment scale of fixed assets; promote  the development of agriculture, science and technology, and the  basic industries; facilitate the readjustment of the production  structure and enhancement of enterprise economic efficiency; and  guide enterprises to develop themselves through tapping internal  potential. We should do things strictly in accordance with the  state budget, and should not allow new items leading to reduced  revenues or increased expenditures. The central government  should control bond issuance under the state-approved scale;  while the local governments should persist in keeping  expenditures within the limits of income, striking a balance  between revenues and expenditures, and avoiding budgetary  deficits. In the course of reforming the price system and  changing enterprise operating mechanisms, we should relentlessly  help enterprises stop deficits and begin to earn profits; should  stop subsidies for operational losses; and should reduce  subsidies for losses permitted by policy. We should accelerate  the legislation on the fiscal and taxation system, reinforce  economic and financial discipline, and codify the financial and  tax management as soon as possible.    (3) Seize the favorable opportunity for fiscal and tax  reform to improve and strengthen the collection and management  of revenues. After tax reform is instituted, taxpayers must  pay, and tax offices must collect according to the law; tax  revenues must be calculated and levied according to the rates  prescrived in the tax law, and "contracting for tax payment" and  wanton alteration of tax rates are not permitted; and except for  reductions and exemptions stipulated in the tax law, no  government or department is allowed to set a precedent in  granting tax reduction and exemption. We must take the task  against tax evasion seriously, closely watching new trends of  tax evasion following the introduction of the new tax system.  Especially those criminals who forge special vouchers for the  value- added tax, or who exploit the use of vouchers to evade  taxes must be severely punished without mercy. In keeping with  new circumstances arising from the fiscal and taxation reform,  we must earnestly improve and strengthen the levying and  collection of various revenues to prevent income losses. We  must, in accordance with the central authorities' unified  arrangements, carry out step-by-step the reorganization of  central and local tax offices, properly resolving problems  related to division of labor and coordination of work to ensure  normal operation of tax collection and management. Meanwhile,  efforts must be made to clear payments in arrears for the "two  types of funds" and to continue to collect the "two types of  funds" from nonstate-owned enterprises and institutions, on  which reductions and exemptions should not be granted without  authorization.    (4) Improve the procedures for issuing state treasury  bonds to ensure the accomplishment of targeted sales. The  large volume of state treasury bonds to be issued this year has  a direct bearing on the success of fiscal and tax reform and the  balance between revenues and expenditures. One of the important  factors for accomplishing the targeted sales of treasury bonds  this year lies in good publicity and coordination. In line with  the requirements for developing and perfecting financial  markets, we should reform the procedures for issuing treasury  bonds, effectively planning contract procurement and marketing  of bonds, improving and expanding the system of primary  individual operators, and standardizing and developing secondary  markets of treasury bonds to increase their circulation and  stability. We should also combine bond sales with banks' open  market business. Under the unified leadership of local party  and government organizations, financial departments at various  levels should closely coordinate with banks and other relevant  institutions in ensuring priority sales of treasury bonds.  Balances of retirement pensions, unemployment insurance, and  postal savings deposits should mainly be used in purchasing  treasury bonds. We should do everything within our capacity to  sell treasury bonds to the masses, and to enable them to buy and  cash the bonds conveniently. Meanwhile, we should also give  offices, institutions, enterprises, and units access to  subscribe to treasury bonds. Financial and banking departments  at all levels should accumulate experiences in bond sales and  actively explore ways for issuing bonds under the conditions of  a market economy.    (5) We should control total expenditures and ensure  that funds are available for key projects.    When making arrangements for financial expenditures, we  should stay within our means, ensure that funds are available  for key projects, and curb expenditures for ordinary projects.  In addition to continuing to increase input in such key sectors  as agriculture, education, science and technology, and  infrastructure, as well as guaranteeing the necessary increases  in outlays for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and  public security departments, this year we should give priority  to expenditures incurred in paying wages and building up state  grain reserves. We should never permit the diversion of funds,  which are earmarked for remunerating staff members and workers,  to new projects. Areas that delay the payment of wages to staff  and workers should resolutely stop or postpone the construction  of projects funded by financial departments. Institutions that  delay the payment of wages to staff and workers are not  permitted to purchase small vehicles or other expensive,  luxurious consumer goods. Financial departments at all levels  must attach great importance to this issue. We should strictly  control the scale of investment in fixed assets. Except for  indispensable projects that have been approved, we should not  start new ones. We should resolutely halt or postpone the  construction of projects for which no funds are available and  whose prospects are uncertain. Currently, the problem of wasting  funds is quite serious as money is being spent lavishly to  renovate houses and buy equipment. The practices of traveling  for meetings and of wining and dining at government expense  continue despite repeated efforts to ban them. Specifically,  there is a lack of effective control over staffing, and  "personnel fees" have eaten up a substantial amount of funds  earmarked for developing various undertakings. Therefore, we  should curtail expenses for personnel, vehicle purchases, and  meetings this year. We should vigorously promote the fine  tradition of diligence and thrift, and urge the broad masses of  cadres and people to combat extravagance and waste. Moreover,  as price reform deepens, we should gradually slash subsidized  projects and ensure that total expenditures for such projects  will not surpass the budgeted figure. We should deepen reform of  fiscal management in institutions, continue to encourage and  support such institutions in rationally disposing of their  incomes as permitted by policy and law, and exercise overall  planned management of total revenues and expenditures. We  should resolutely and fully implement provisions regarding the  "separation of revenues and expenditures," and exercise unified  budgetary control over revenues that should be subject to  budgetary management, such as those derived from fees charged  for using land and from selling public housing.    Fellow deputies: Our fiscal and taxation tasks are rather  formidable in 1994. Nevertheless, we can surely surmount  various difficulties, achieve the desired results in various  reforms, and successfully fulfill the state budgetary tasks for  1994 as long as we fully implement the guidelines of the  "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, earnestly implement various reform measures, take  practical steps to improve and tighten macroeconomic regulation  and control, and properly handle the relationship between  reform, development, and stability under the leadership of the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jewellers use 2% more gold GOLD JEWELLERY demand last year in the six key markets rose by 2 per cent to a record 602.1 tonnes, according to preliminary estimates by the World Gold Council, the promotional organisation supported by gold producers world-wide. This was in spite of a slight fall, by 1 per cent to 219 tonnes, in the US, the largest individual market. Also recession in the UK caused a 17 per cent drop, to 40.1 tonnes, there. The council says it is possible the US total might have been 15 tonnes higher but 219 tonnes 'remains the best figure at present.' It suggests an 8 per cent rise in Italy, to 130 tonnes, 'is an indicator of the strength in demand world-wide since exports to a great number of countries account for about two-thirds of Italian gold jewellery fabrication.' Japan, the second largest market, took 5 per cent more gold jewellery last year or 126.6 tonnes; France saw a 3 per cent increase to 40.4 tonnes; and the biggest increase was in newly-unified Germany: 12 per cent to 46 tonnes. The council's statistics are estimates of the fine gold content of jewellery purchases by retailers. It says its research corrects the impression - caused by 'the well-publicised difficulties of Ratners in the UK and Zale in the US' - that gold jewellery sales were down last year.</p>

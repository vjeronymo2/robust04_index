			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Air Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov by </F> Aleksandr Zhilin, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI military commentator:  "Weapons in Clean Hands"; place and date not given]    [Text] Under Boris Yeltsin's edict, Air Marshal Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov has been appointed the president's representative  in Rosvooruzheniye [State Company for the Export and Import of  Arms and Military Equipment].    This is Shaposhnikov's fourth appointment in the last three  years. In 1991 he replaced Dmitriy Yazov as USSR defense  minister; in 1992 he was appointed commander in chief of the CIS  Joint Armed Forces; and since 1993 he has held the post of  Russian Federation Security Council secretary. It is noteworthy  that each time, Marshal Shaposhnikov has resigned at his own  will.    Rosvooruzheniye was created under the Russian Federation  president's edict of 18 November 1993. The company's main tasks  are investments in military industrial complex enterprises, the  export and import of military equipment of all types, creation  of maintenance facilities and personnel training centers abroad,  and so forth.    MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's correspondent asked Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov to answer a few questions.    [Zhilin] There has been controversial reaction to your  appointment. Some think that the president has entrusted this  responsible post to you as a man not tainted by corruption.  Others suppose that they are thus trying either to "buy" or  "sell you out."    [Shaposhnikov] How can I be bought? If I was a careerist, I  would not have voluntarily resigned my previous high positions.  I have received numerous proposals to work in political and  commercial foundations and organizations. But to me, state  interests have first priority. Therefore I gratefully accepted  the president's proposal, which I regard as his trust in me.    [Zhilin] Incidentally, about the post. Do you not see it as  somewhat artificial? There is Rosvooruzheniye's head, General  Samoylov, who is overseen by the government. Why then is there  a need for a presidential representative?    [Shaposhnikov] In all countries engaged in exporting  military equipment and arms this sphere of state activity is  supervised personally by the president because it is so  important and, I would say, sensitive. In this sphere,  absolutely objective information is needed. I am ready to  provide such information to the president, no matter what.    [Zhilin] What specifically will be your duties?    [Shaposhnikov] Arms export is a substantial revenue source  which may not be ignored, especially under difficult economic  and financial conditions. Together with the top Rosvooruzheniye  executive we shall analyze the proposed deals from the viewpoint  of their usefulness and profitability for Russia. We are to get  a clear understanding of the situation on the world market, and  calmly come to agreement with our partners in arms trade about  Russia's place on this market. In a word, there will be plenty  of work.    I shall try to do everything possible to make sure that  Russia is not accused of unfair arms trading practices and that  all the revenues are returned to the state treasury, not end up  in the Western bank accounts of some dubious commercial  structures.</p>

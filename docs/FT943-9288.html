			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / US nears sweeping telecoms reform The US is now just two steps away from the most sweeping changes to its telecommunications law for 60 years, after the Senate commerce committee yesterday agreed to a bill that would allow long-distance and local telephone companies, as well as cable television companies, to enter one another's markets. 'This legislation is as important to the economy as the healthcare legislation,' said Senator John Danforth, the senior Republican on the committee. 'Millions of dollars hang on every comma.' But the bill still needs to pass the full Senate, and must then be reconciled with similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives in June. The legislation would set the terms under which the seven regional Bell operating companies - known as 'Reeboks' or Baby Bells - would open up their local telephone network monopolies in exchange for being allowed to enter other markets. The Bells now face severe restrictions on their activities under the court order which broke up the original AT&amp;T monopoly 10 years ago, in order to prevent them from abusing their local monopolies. They are barred not only from offering long-distance services but also from making telephone equipment. Although yesterday's committee vote of 18-2 suggests widespread support, several senators plan to propose controversial amendments when the bill comes to the floor of the full Senate. Some supporters of the bill fear it will not be possible to set aside enough time for debate before congressmen go home to fight the November mid-term elections. One of the fiercest fights is expected to be over a measure that would require the Bells to manufacture telephone equipment in the US and buy most of their components from US suppliers. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has warned that this domestic content requirement conflicts with the US's obligations under Gatt and the North American Free Trade Agreement. The bill drafted by Senator Ernest Hollings, the commerce committee chairman, represents a delicate compromise over when the Bells will be allowed to expand from local telephone services to the long-distance and other markets. Mr Hollings dropped his original requirement that the Bells must face 'actual and demonstrable competition' in their local market before they may start to offer long-distance services. Instead, they must open up networks to other suppliers and obtain the permission of both the attorney-general and the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-rebels to promote phone poll THE ORGANISERS of Dial for Democracy, the telephone referendum on the Maastricht treaty, are to advertise in newspapers in an effort to encourage greater participation, David Owen writes. The advertisements, which the organisers plan to place in local papers such as the Evening Standard in London, would be designed to lift the number of callers to about the 100,000 mark. Since the poll was launched to great fanfare with the help of Baroness Thatcher in Westminster three weeks ago more than 50,000 calls have been received. But backers are so far giving no indication of which way callers are voting. The organisers hope the exercise will both build a picture of how the British electorate would vote and increase pressure on the government for a real referendum. Since the launch one national newspaper - The Sun - has regularly carried the two 0891 numbers which eligible voters are invited to dial. The two-minute calls cost 48p per minute outside cheap rates.</p>

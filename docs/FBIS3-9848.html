Albanian-Danish talks mainly focused on the development of  the bilateral relations and the situation in our region. Mr.  Serreqi informed the Danish foreign minister of the need of the  Albanian economy for foreign investments, the facilities created  by Albanian new legislation and urged him to lift the double  taxation. "We are for a wide bilateral cooperation especially  at this important moment of the reform and at the difficult  geopolitical situation in the Balkan region," Mr. Serreqi said.    "It is our privilege to contribute to your small democratic  country in this difficult situation," the Danish foreign  minister, Petersen, told Mr. Serreqi. Mr. Petersen emphasized  that "We should try to find out the fields for a fruitful  bilateral cooperation."    The two foreign ministers agreed to start the cooperation  between Albania and Denmark in the agriculture, tourism and  culture. As Mr. Petersen said, Denmark agrees to start and big  projects with the aim of assisting Albania.    The Albanian party presented its views about the recent  events in the region and it especially appreciated the agreement  between the Croatians and Muslims reached in Washington. The  Kosova question was one of the main topics of the talks in which  the Albanian party reiterated its approach in defence of the  rights of the Albanian population in this area.    Mr. Petersen condemned the violation of the human rights in  Kosova and said that the presence of the international observers  there is indispensable. Mr. Petersen said that a solution for  the Kosova problem requires a greater internationalization of  this important question.    In regard to the Albanians living in The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia and their rights, Mr. Petersen said that  in some previous meetings they had presented to the Macedonian  party the concern of the Albanian Government concerning this  question.</p>

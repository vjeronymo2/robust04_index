			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 LISA STANSFIELD "AFFECTION" ARISTA. ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Barry White, the mid-'70s soul star, isn't having any hits these days, but  young English white-soul singer Lisa Stansfield launched her solo career with  the smash-hit single "All Around the World," which cleverly modernizes his old  R&amp;B style. Obviously influenced by the R&amp;B greats, she sounds just like  a black singer, singing with gospel-style fervor and heartfelt emotion.  </P> <P> She delves into R&amp;B history for most of her material, which she co-wrote.  Songs like "Mighty Love" and "This Is the Right Time" reflect the soulfulness  of the old Philly sound. There are no bad songs on this album and some, like  "Mighty Love" and "When Are You Coming Back?," are exceptional -- particularly  the arrangements. There's nothing new here, just a glorious re-creation of that  '70s soul sound. But in today's music world that's plenty. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

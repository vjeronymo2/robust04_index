			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Altman called in from banking NO ONE is more practised than Roger Altman, the Blackstone Group partner named Senator Bentsen's deputy at the Treasury, at bridging the gap between the chintzy elegance of New York investment banking boutiques, and the stately portals of Capitol Hill. For most of his professional life, the tall, softly spoken banker who advised the Clinton campaign, has glided between politics and money. As a student, Mr Altman was a Clinton contemporary at Georgetown University, before going to University of Chicago, to acquire the requisite MBA. Despite having worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, banking proved his first call. In 1969, he joined Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment firm, rising to partner five years later. In 1977, the arrival of the Carter administration took him back to Washington, as assistant secretary at the Treasury, with responsibility for domestic finance. That, in turn, gave the New Englander a role in two of the late-1970s most dramatic financial restructurings - New York City and Chrysler. With the Carter administration's end, Mr Altman headed back to Lehman, before joining his former boss, Pete Petersen, as a Blackstone partner. His specific role at the investment banking firm has been international co-ordination, and Blackstone has duly forged links with Nikko Securities in Japan, Hambro Magan in the UK, Banque Indosuez in France and Germany's Sal Oppenheim. Meanwhile, Mr Altman has kept his economic views very much in the public domain. An assiduous contributor to newspapers columns, he was arguing in autumn 1990, for example, that the US economy was almost certainly in recession. His prescription was a sharp lowering of interest rates, despite inflationary worries then stemming from the Gulf conflict.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Minister pledges help for Tyneside Extra measures to help rejuvenate Tyneside in the wake of a wave of recent heavy job losses were pledged yesterday by Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister. He announced during a visit to Newcastle upon Tyne that the government had given the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation approval to spend Pounds 8.7m on redeveloping part of South Shields' riverside. The Northern Development Company would be given an additional Pounds 50,000 to promote inward investment opportunities and redundant employees would be given immediate access to Tyneside Training and Enterprise Council courses and Employment Service programmes. Mr Taylor confirmed the government's support, first voiced 17 months ago, for a Tyneside enterprise zone, subject to European Commission approval, if local people favoured it. This, he said, could benefit the region to the tune of Pounds 40m and create a possible 5,000 jobs. He said the government was considering proposals from the private and public sectors to help Tyneside build on its maritime skills by moving into sub-sea technology.</p>

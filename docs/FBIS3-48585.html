More than 1 billion dong (roughly USD 100,000) have been  spent in rebuilding the Dien Bien Airport, supplying it with air  traffic control equipment, and building an air services system.    To upgrade the Na San Airport will take about 250 million  dong (roughly USD 25,000). And to keep regular arrivals at the  airport will need a further 1.2 billion dong (approximately USD  120,000).    Operators will be Vietnam Airlines, Pacific Airlines and  Vasco.    These two airports fell into disuse three to four years ago  due to the lack of passengers and poor infrastructure.    Now growing demand for fast transport to serve tourism and  business has prompted the Vietnam General Department of Civil  Aviation to reopen these short flights between northern airports.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Labeling <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Various methods have been used in the past to inform consumers of handling instructions. Such methods have included putting the instructions on the product label, on inserts, on tags attached to the product, and on point-of-purchase materials displayed near the product at the point of sale. FSIS has concluded that the outside label is the most appropriate location for safe handling instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency considered three options for presenting safe handling information on the label. These options included long word messages, short word messages, and short word messages with symbols or graphic representations to accompany the message. To collect information on which format would most effectively influence consumer behavior, FSIS initiated consumer focus-study research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the FSIS initiated consumer focus-study, most participants wanted to see safe handling instructions on raw meat and poultry products. Consumers in the study expressed a preference for the safe handling instructions to be on the package label and felt that other labeling, such as pamphlets or in-store signs, should only be used to supplement package labels. Instructions with graphic illustrations were generally preferred to those without graphic illustrations and the short word messages were preferred to the long word messages. Also, most participants of the focus-study research felt that the rationale statement was a necessary part of the safe handling instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Current Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations currently require the placement of safe handling statements on packaged products that require special handling to maintain their wholesome condition. Sections 317.2 and 381.125 of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 317.2(k) and 9 CFR 381.125, respectively) provide that packaged products which require special handling to maintain their wholesome condition shall have prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label the statement: ``Keep Refrigerated,'' ``Keep Frozen,'' ``Perishable Keep Under Refrigeration,'' or such similar statement as the Administrator may approve in specific cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS proposed to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to mandate the inclusion of safe handling instructions on the labeling of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products along with a rationale statement to indicate the reason why it is important to follow such handling instructions. The Department has established required cooking temperatures for certain beef, poultry, and patty products. These requirements are set forth at 9 CFR 318.17, 381.150, and 318.23, respectively. The proposed rule applied the beef temperature requirements to beef, swine, sheep, goat, horse, and other equine. The Department has also established processing requirements for the curing or other treatment of certain meat products to control microbial activity. Some of these products are identified in part 319 of the meat inspection regulations. These cooked products, e.g., cooked sausage, and some products that have been otherwise further processed so as to render them ready-to-eat, e.g., dry fermented sausage, are not considered to be at sufficient risk of microbial contamination to warrant the application of safe handling labels. However, some products that are traditionally considered ready-to-eat receive no lethal heat treatment and may not be pathogen free. FSIS is reevaluating its policies and regulations governing these products and plans to propose a regulation requiring that these products either bear the safe handling instructions or be processed in such a manner as to assure the destruction of pathogens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS proposed to permit official establishment and retailers to use alternate approaches to deliver the safe handling instructions until April 15, 1994, except for comminuted products. For comminuted products, FSIS proposed to require that safe handling instructions be included on the label within 30 days after publication of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The alternate approaches presented in the proposed rule are: (1) Official establishments may include in the shipping container either pressure-sensitive labels containing the safe handling instructions for retailers to apply to packages or leaflets containing a facsimile of the safe handling instructions in lettering no smaller than one one-sixteenth of an inch for retailers to place in close proximity to the packages to ensure that leaflets are likely to be seen and taken home by consumers; and (2) retailers may distribute leaflets containing the facsimile described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, it was expected that retailers might prefer pressure-sensitive labels or leaflets of their own design and manufacture to those that an official establishment would provide under the permitted alternative. FSIS proposed that if a retailer notifies an official establishment in writing that it intends to supply its own labels or labeling, the official establishment would not be required to supply the materials in the shipping container. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following rationale statement was proposed for products prepared from inspected and passed meat and/or poultry: This product was prepared from inspected and passed meat and/or poultry. Some food products may contain bacteria that could cause illness if the product is mishandled or cooked improperly. For your protection, follow these safe handling instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS proposed the following rationale statement for poultry slaughtered under exemptions specified in 9 CFR 381.10: Some food products may contain bacteria that could cause illness if the product is mishandled or cooked improperly. For your protection, follow these safe handling instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

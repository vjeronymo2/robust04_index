			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN AGREES TO VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY IN POINDEXTER TRIAL;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: THE FORMER PRESIDENT FORGOES HIS RIGHT TO EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. HE  WILL BE QUESTIONED UNDER OATH AS A DEFENSE WITNESS.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, forgoing his right to claim executive  privilege, agreed Friday to testify on videotape as a defense witness in John  M. Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial.  </P> <P> Reagan will be questioned under oath by Poindexter's lawyers and cross-examined  by the Iran-Contra special counsel during the taping. Although Reagan  previously provided information about the scandal that broke out during his  second term, the videotaped testimony will be the closest he has come to the  give-and-take of a court of law.  </P> <P> In a four-page brief filed with U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, Reagan's  lawyers said the use of videotape -- instead of live testimony in the courtroom  -- would permit the former President to respond to questions without running  the risk of inadvertently disclosing sensitive national secrets. If such  secrets were mentioned, they would be deleted from the tape.  </P> <P> The brief said Reagan "recognizes that the videotape deposition format will  provide an appropriate mechanism for all parties, including the incumbent and  former presidents, to protect sensitive, classified national security  information and confidential deliberations."  </P> <P> Reagan's attorney, Theodore B. Olson, said the former President "will not  assert executive privilege" with respect to the videotaped testimony. He added  that Reagan would defer to President Bush and the Justice Department "with  respect to issues of executive privilege concerning national security or  foreign affairs that may arise during the taking of the videotaped deposition."  </P> <P> Greene ruled earlier that either Reagan or Bush could claim executive  privilege. Reagan has already claimed executive privilege to avoid turning over  excerpts from his diaries; that issue remains unresolved.  </P> <P> In a brief submitted late Friday, the Justice Department concurred somewhat  reluctantly with Reagan's decision regarding the videotaping.  </P> <P> "The current Administration . . . hereby also notifies the court that, like the  former President, it waives that aspect of the executive privilege which would  otherwise excuse President Reagan from submitting to such a deposition," the  department said.  </P> <P> "Many of the questions (Poindexter) proposes to ask former President Reagan fit  squarely within the area protected by executive privilege," the department  added. "They seek to inquire into foreign policy deliberations within the  President's office. Accordingly, the privilege could be claimed as to these  lines of inquiry."  </P> <P> However, the department said it decided against invoking privilege at this  point, although it reserved the right to do so during the taping if sensitive  matters are raised.  </P> <P> Reagan suggested that the taping be done next Friday in his office in Los  Angeles. The Justice Department supported that date. After receiving the former  President's brief, Greene issued a one-sentence order setting a hearing for 11  a.m. Monday to approve the ground-rules for the session.  </P> <P> "Former President Reagan recognizes that this court has a considerable  responsibility to protect and preserve the rights of the defendant in this case  as well as to be sensitive to the interests of the former President and the  constitutional rights and duties of the presidency," Olson added.  </P> <P> In an earlier order, Greene said he would preside over the former President's  testimony, ruling on objections raised by lawyers from either side.  Specifically, the judge said he would consider claims of executive privilege or  national security that might be raised as the taping goes along.  </P> <P> The judge also limited Poindexter's lawyers to 154 specific questions which  they submitted in advance. Although lawyers will be allowed to ask follow-up  questions, they will not be permitted to introduce additional subjects.  </P> <P> The Justice Department said that seven of the 154 questions "delve into the  nature of various communications between former President Reagan and foreign  heads of state, which are, to our knowledge, still undisclosed and sensitive."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the department said that none of the questions, including the  seven, "pose serious problems" as phrased by Poindexter's lawyers.  </P> <P> "However, follow-up questions could lead into sensitive areas, including  foreign relations matters, that are still protected . . . thus it is possible a  specific follow-up question may raise an issue of privilege."  </P> <P> Greene reserved the right to edit the tape to eliminate matters which should  not be disclosed. The tape would be kept secret until it was played during  Poindexter's trial, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 20.  </P> <P> In contrast to his agreement to give oral testimony, Reagan earlier this week  invoked executive privilege in an effort to avoid turning over to Poindexter's  lawyers more than 30 excerpts from his White House diaries. Greene has said he  will hold a hearing to determine whether Reagan's claim of constitutionally  guaranteed confidentiality outweighs Poindexter's need for evidence to defend  himself.  </P> <P> Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser, is charged with five  felony counts of obstructing Congress, making false statements and conspiracy.  He apparently is seeking to show that he was acting with presidential approval,  although Reagan has denied that.  </P> <P> Reagan was interviewed by the Tower Commission, which first investigated secret  arms sales to Iran and the diversion of some of the profits to the Contra  rebels in Nicaragua. Later, Reagan supplied written answers to questions  submitted by the Iran-Contra grand jury. Excerpts from Reagan's diaries were  given to the congressional Iran-Contra committees, but the papers were never  made public.  </P> <P> Reagan's two immediate predecessors -- Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter -- both  provided videotaped testimony while in office. Ford testified as a defense  witness in 1975 in the trial of Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, who was convicted of  trying to assassinate him.  </P> <P> Carter gave taped testimony twice. Once he was a government witness in the  perjury and gambling trial of a Georgia state senator. Later, he testified  before a federal grand jury investigating allegations that fugitive financier  Robert Vesco tried to bribe officials of the Carter Administration.  </P> <P> Although no President or former President has ever been forced to testify in  open court against his will, the courts have held as far back as 1807 that a  President has an obligation to provide evidence in trials.  </P></p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / French and Belgian police search Paris HQ of Schneider French and Belgian police searched the Paris headquarters of Groupe Schneider as part of a fraud investigation into Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the chairman of the French electrical engineering group who has been held in a Brussels prison since last week, the company said yesterday. Schneider said it had co-operated with the search, which took place on Wednesday and yesterday morning. The police, accompanied by two French judicial officials, took accounting documents and correspondence from the offices to assist in their investigation into Schneider's management of Cofibel and Cofimines, two Belgian subsidiaries at the centre of the invest-igation. The search and the seizure of documents follows Wednesday's ruling by a Brussels court to extend the detention of Mr Pineau-Valencienne and Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessmen arrested as part of the same investigation. Lawyers for both men said they would appeal against their imprisonment, which could see them detained for up to a month. The appeal will be heard within 15 days. The continued detention of Mr Pineau-Valencienne prompted a sharp fall in shares in the company, one of Europe's largest electrical engineering groups with annual sales of about FFr56bn (Pounds 6.52bn). The shares, which were suspended on Wednesday pending the announcement of the court ruling, yesterday lost 5.5 per cent of their value, falling from FFr390.5 to FFr368.9. Industry observers in Paris said the detention of the Schneider chairman was unsettling for investors. 'The subsidiaries involved are relatively small, less than five per cent of the group's total assets,' said one analyst. 'But the damage to the image of the company is much greater.' The accusations facing Schneider centre on its treatment of Cofibel and Cofimines and a bid to buy out minority share-holders in the two subsidiaries which was launched in 1992. Belgian prosecutors claim there were irregularities in the offer. They claim that offshore companies and assets were concealed from regulators and investors in the subsidiaries and believe that Schneider received more than BFr3bn (Pounds 58m) at the expense of its Belgian subsidiaries between 1988 and 1992. Belgian prosecutors are also examining the alleged non-payment of dividends to all the subsidiaries' shareholders by the offshore companies. Schneider denies the accusations and says it has not acted against the interests of minority shareholders.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> ANOTHER COLUMBIA S&amp;L OFFICIAL TO LEAVE  </P> <P> Another senior executive at Columbia Savings &amp; Loan is leaving the troubled  Beverly Hills thrift.  </P> <P> Daniel C. Rohr, Columbia's executive vice president and chief credit officer,  will join First Bank System in Minneapolis on May 21 as executive vice  president and manager of the bank's commercial banking group.  </P> <P> A former Continental Bank executive, Rohr, 44, will work for First Bank  Chairman John F. Grundhofer, formerly Wells Fargo's top Los Angeles executive.  </P> <P> Rohr's job at Columbia, which he joined in September, 1988, included monitoring  credit problems in the troubled junk bond portfolio.

Fish, former Chief Financial  Officer James A. D'Aquila and David A. Sachs, a Columbia executive vice  president whose resignation is effective Friday. JAMES BATES  </P></p>

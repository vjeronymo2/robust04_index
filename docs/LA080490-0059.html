			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HAND TOTH A NET LOSS  </P> <P> Zoltan Toth, a five-time MISL All-Star and two-time Goalie of the Year, has  been told by the Sockers that he will not be re-signed for the upcoming season.  </P> <P> Toth's agent, Scott Simpson, said Friday he received a call from Socker Coach  Ron Newman on Wednesday and was told the Sockers could not afford to pay Toth's  salary after signing Victor Nogueira, the team's other goalie.  </P> <P> Toth made $68,000 last season and became a free agent at the conclusion of the  playoffs. Simpson said Socker President Ron Cady told him several weeks ago  that the Sockers would sign Toth for $50,000 but has not had any contact with  him since.  </P> <P> "I'm just awfully upset at the way they handled this," Simpson said. "He has  given them six good years."  </P> <P> Said Toth: "I don't think I deserve that kind of treatment. I think I did  something for the Sockers, if you look at how successful we were."  </P> <P> Neither Newman nor Cady could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> At 34, Toth is still marketable coming off a season in which he played a number  of superb games during the playoffs. He said he will consider offers from other  teams but will take into account the welfare of his family. Toth's 1-year-old  son, Christopher, underwent heart surgery shortly after birth, and Toth said he  wants him to be able to stay in San Diego where he can remain under the  supervision of his current doctor.  </P> <P> Toth, a 10-year veteran who played his first four seasons for the New York  Arrows, said St. Louis and Tacoma have expressed interest in signing him.  Simpson said he has received an offer of $50,000 from one team in the league.  Toth said he plans to make every effort to stay in the game for at least two  more years.  </P> <P> "I live for soccer and all my heart is in soccer," Toth said. "The World Cup is  here in 1994. I want to hang in and do the best for the sport."  </P> <P> The Sockers appear to be digging themselves into a bit of a hole with their  inability to re-sign key veterans. Along with Toth, defenders Ralph Black and  George Fernandez have departed to other teams, and sources say defender Cacho  was told this week he won't be re-signed for next season.  </P> <P> Certainly, the salary cap reduction from $770,000 to $630,000 makes it  difficult for a team coming off its third consecutive championship to pay  players and reward them for their accomplishments. Yet questions are being  raised as to why the players aren't being kept up to date on their status.  </P> <P> "There has got to be a better system for players to know if they're wanted,"  captain Brian Quinn said. "We haven't had a lot of communication. We absolutely  didn't know what was happening."  </P> <P> Taking into account the salary cap, Quinn thinks the Sockers will fill their  thin areas by the start of the season.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned at the moment," he said, "but I think there are still going to  be good players available. If everyone adheres to the salary cap, no one is  going to be able to afford all the players they want."  </P></p>

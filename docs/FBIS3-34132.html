[Unidentified correspondent] Kabul was relatively calm today  with clouds, rain, and snow calming clashes between rival groups.    Meanwhile a source close to the government of Borhanoddin  Rabbani reported attacks by government fighter planes on the  northern Afghan airport of Jozjan.    The source who is close to Rabbani, also emphasized that  forces supporting the president will not agree to a fresh  temporary cease-fire in the current fighting.    The coordination council in opposition to Rabbani's  government announced last night that, following a request by the  UN secretary general's special envoy in Afghan affairs, the  opposition was ready to accept a four-day cease-fire on the  condition that negotiations would concentrate on the resignation  of Rabbani from his post.    In reply to this suggestion by the opposition, the source,  Seyyed Habib Shah Hamed, emphasized that Rabbani will hold the  presidential post until the end of his term.    Meanwhile the Kabul Jihadi commanders and a 100-strong  mediation group from east Afghanistan, led by Maulawi  Jallalulddin Haqani, who have spent three days in Kabul,  continued their negotiations today with the representatives of  President Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, and  tried to prepare and propose a mediating plan that would be  acceptable to both sides so as to prepare the grounds for  negotiations and an understanding between the president and the  prime minister of Afghanistan.</p>

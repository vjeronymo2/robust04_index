			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagorno-Karabakh "pins certain hopes" on the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, which has stepped up its peace  mission in an attempt to settle the Karabakh conflict. This has  been declared in an interview with journalists in Stepanakert by  Karen Baburyan, the acting chairman of the parliament of the  self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.    He leads a Karabakh delegation to Kyrgyzstan's capital  Bishkek to take part in a meeting of the heads of Armenian and  Azerbaijani parliaments. Mediated by the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly, the meeting has been scheduled for 3-6 May.    In Baburyan's words, the gathering in Bishkek will largely  depend on the position of Azerbaijan, "whose leadership is not  too willing to maintain contact with Karabakh." He noted that  broader contacts "would help to lead the conflict out of the  deadlock."    Taking part in the Bishkek meeting, initiated by the Kyrgyz  Parliament's Chairman Meditkan Sherimkulov and the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly, will be the Assembly's Chairman  Vladimir Shumeyko, the head of Russia's Federation Council.</p>

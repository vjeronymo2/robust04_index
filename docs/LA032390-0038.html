			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL TRAVELOGUE OF CLUB STYLE;  </P> <P> EURO-AMERICAN LOOKS HAUNT TOKYO  </P> <P> The streets of the Roppongi neighborhood stay alive deep into the night. The  area is home to the Lexington Queen, a favorite hangout for musicians, celebs,  models and young Japanese.  </P> <P> "The Lex" is a few steps from Roppongi Square Building, a 10-story structure  that houses eight discos, a jazz club, a restaurant and a game center.  </P> <P> The most popular club in the building is Java Jive, a restaurant-disco that is  decorated "Jamaica-style" and features a Jamaican band and a deejay playing  international disco hits.  </P> <P> Buzz, also in the building, is Tokyo's hottest video dance club with a huge  screen at one end and monitors showing the latest music videos scattered around  the club.  </P> <P> But most young Japanese, and many foreigners who live in Japan, prefer pubs,  especially Charleston's and Paradisio, both in the Roppongi area.  </P> <P> The music is pretty much the same as in the States. The Japanese also keep up  with the latest U.S. dance crazes. BILL HERSEY  </P></p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Williams maps out route for progress Nigel Rudd is not a man to suffer an identity crisis. As chief executive of Williams Holdings, the 1980s-born conglomerate, he is crystal clear about the route his company intends to take in the 1990s in spite of the apparently waning popularity of the sector. 'We are not a conglomerate in the sense that people see a group of sprawling industrial businesses,' he says. 'We are no more diversified than ICI.' The acquisition announced yesterday of Corbin &amp; Russwin, the US locks business, reinforces Mr Rudd's picture of a company focused on businesses in three areas: building products, security, and fire and safety. Security, more than any of Williams Holdings' other core divisions, needed a boost to give it critical mass, particularly in the US. Little had been added since the purchase of Yale and Valor in 1991. 'Yale is a worldwide brand name, but the business is smaller than anyone thinks,' Mr Rudd says. Corbin &amp; Russwin will bring the division's sales to more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 203m) worldwide and almost double the group's presence in the US market. Mr Rudd says the group will squeeze a significant amount of improvements out of the business through synergies in distribution networks and product integration. He says there is scope to double the recently-restructured Corbin's underlying 7-8 per cent margins, even without raising prices, in two years. The City is inclined to agree with Mr Rudd's perception of the deal. 'It certainly makes a great deal of strategic sense,' said one conglomerates analyst. However, the purchase is widely seen as little more than a reassuring step in the right direction. Williams still faces phantoms which must be laid to rest before the City rushes in. The most oft-quoted criticism is the company's failure to generate cash and the state of its balance sheet. The deal announced yesterday will push year-end gearing to about 60 per cent, against expectations of less than 40 per cent. Now, many are expecting that any further deals will have to be done through share issues. Mr Rudd is scathing about many of those who criticise Williams, but reserves his strongest attacks for those who condemn the group's use of long-term leverage. 'The last thing we want to do is pay the debt down. We want to use it to have assets that are earning,' he says. Mr Rudd quotes the group's Dollars 370m in long term debt - with covenants attached to the US businesses leaving the parent free to 'do what we like' - as one of Williams's strengths, in spite of the higher interest rates. 'I would rather pay another 1 per cent on interest rates so no horrible banker can come and poke me in the eye,' Mr Rudd says. He also denies charges of failure to generate cash. 'In the last three to four years we have spent a lot of money improving the business.' Mr Rudd roughly calculates that Williams has invested Pounds 150m since 1990. 'This year, and next, that will come through in a big way.' The City is still uncertain, however. Although agreeing that cash flow will certainly improve this year, 'it wont be enough to fund the bolt on acquisitions strategy if it is maintained at the same pace (of Pounds 100m a year),' says one analyst. There will have to be further disposals, but these are at least one to two years away. The final consensus appears to be that Williams has much left to prove before it convinces sceptics of its ability to perform in the post-conglomerate age. The recent strategy, says one industry observer, 'is probably better than what has been employed in the past, and for that reason they deserve to be looked at, but there is nothing . . . that will produce strong outperformance.'</p>

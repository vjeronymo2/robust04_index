			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN AM PLACES ADS MARKING ANNIVERSARY OF LOCKERBIE BLAST  </P> <P> Pan American World Airways, in advertisements placed Thursday in nine  newspapers in the United States and Europe, called for a "moment of prayer" for  the 270 people killed in the terrorist bombing of its Flight 103 over  Lockerbie, Scotland, a year ago.  </P> <P> The ad, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Miami Herald  and USA Today, along with newspapers in Scotland, England and Germany, is  considered unusual because airlines rarely draw attention to air disasters.  </P> <P> "We felt we wanted to do something," said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners.  </P> <P> The carrier also held memorial services for victims at airports in New York,  London and Frankfurt and flew its flags at half mast.  </P> <P> The Lockerbie tragedy has haunted Pan Am, which lost $150 million in revenue  earlier this year in part because fearful travelers avoided the airline.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration in September fined the airline $630,000 for  security violations in Frankfurt, the flight's point of origin, and London,  where it stopped before exploding in the air on its way to New York.  </P> <P> The FAA said, however, that it couldn't link the security lapses to the  bombing.  </P> <P> Pan Am has said the security problems had been corrected.  </P> <P> The father of a Lockerbie victim reacted bittersweetly to Pan Am's ad.  </P> <P> "It is a lovely sentiment," said Robert Berrell of Fargo, N.D., who visited the  grave of his 20-year-old son, Robert, Thursday. "It's kind of ironic coming  from Pan Am."  </P></p>

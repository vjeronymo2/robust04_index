			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Viacom secures Paramount financing VIACOM, the cable television company locked in a takeover battle for Paramount Communications, announced yesterday it had lined up the loan financing it needs to support its Dollars 9.5bn agreed offer for the film and publishing group, which also faces a Dollars 9.5bn hostile offer from QVC Network. Both Viacom and QVC are in the throes of a cash tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares at Dollars 80 a share. This will cost each of them Dollars 4.8bn. Viacom said last night its loan package, which had been 'substantially oversubscribed, on very favourable terms', included a Dollars 3.5bn senior unsecured revolving acquisition credit facility and a Dollars 1bn bridge term loan. The bridge loan would help it buy shares in the tender if regulatory matters delayed a Dollars 1.2bn investment in Viacom by Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company. Viacom is also getting a Dollars 600m investment from video rental group Blockbuster Entertainment. QVC has already lined up around Dollars 5bn in cash, consisting of Dollars 3bn in bank loan commitments and Dollars 500m of equity investments from four other media companies.</p>

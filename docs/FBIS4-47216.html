			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Vasiliy Gryazov under the </F> rubric "Session of the Supreme Soviet": "What Kind of Bank Do We  Need?"]    [Text] Financial experts are receiving complaints  from all sides today.    The people are looking for the causes of the  deterioration of our life and are inclined to see them in the  sphere of monetary circulation and the work of the banks. They  think the latter have caused their investments to lose value,  they are "heating up" inflation, ruining the economy, etc. Money  has become the measure of everything on earth, and nobody ever  has enough of it. The banks are the main ones involved with  money....    "In fact," says the republic's chief banker, Daulet  Sembayev,  "such an approach to the realities of the day is too simplistic."    He was speaking before parliament at the plenary session on  the morning of 16 June. And before that he "passed" through two  committees of the Supreme Soviet--on finance and the budget and  on the economic reform. The latter discussion with the deputies  lasted four hours.    The amount of attention paid to Daulet Sembayev is linked to  the fact that the parliament had to approve the president's  edict of 17 December of last year on his appointment to be  chairman of the republic's National Bank.    As we know, the previous members of the Supreme Soviet had  approved Galym Baynazarov for this position for a period of six  years.    But after the parliament's authority was suspended he  submitted to the republic president a request to resign because  of health reasons. The president granted his request, placing  Daulet Sembayev in the position of head of the National Bank.    Every one of us is constantly dealing indirectly with banks.    But many are unaware of the specific nature of their  activity. And everything that has occurred in our former USSR  has had a negative effect on their operation. First of all there  was the collapse of economic ties and the destruction of the  ruble zone. Additionally, our banking system, in the opinion of  specialists, has remained immobile for decades and is the most  outdated in the world.    And now it must rise to the level of world standards almost  all at once. Is this possible?    Probably a lot could have been done during the past two or  three years. It is up to specialists to analyze the reasons why  this did not happen. But even today the National Bank has not  yet entered the market age. It continues to perform many  functions that are not properly within its realm. Forces are  being dispersed and the normative base is in need of further  improvement although, it seems, there are special laws on banks.  Its possibilities of effectively influencing the monetary-credit  policy are still limited.    And nonetheless, in Daulet Sembayev's words, the National  Bank is taking certain steps in the necessary direction.    Today it is no longer working directly with economic agents  and is not granting them direct credit but is concentrating its  efforts on administering the state banking system. Credit  auctions have become a regular event and payment relations are  being arranged with the banks of the countries of the  Commonwealth.    More than 20 normative acts have been developed and will be  enacted, work is proceeding on new laws, and measures are being  taken to lower the inflation level to 12-15 percent by September  and to 5-10 percent by the end of the year. We already managed  to reach these goals in January-March of this year.    The deputies were interested in the reports not only on the  main directions of the banks' activity but also on more specific  measures it has begun to implement.    In particular, effective 1 July up to 40 percent of the  credit resources will be distributed through auctions in the  oblasts. The introduction of auctions--an element of the market  in monetary circulation--is linked to the fact that only through  them is it possible to establish the true value of money. The  use of credit for its intended purpose is being monitored more  closely. Effective 1 July a system of "mortgage credit" will be  introduced whereby it will be possible to borrow money using  securities, mainly government, as collateral. Three auctions  have already been held for selling these securities.    According to the logic of the transformations the republic  National Bank should become a normal state bank that meets world  standards, and all commercial banks should be executive bodies  that preserve their authority as intermediaries that attract  investments from the population and legal entities. The first  version of this reformation has already been developed and sent  to all interested parties for study. It earmarks the  transformations of the branch banks, especially the  Agroprombank, increases demandingness with respect to commercial  banks, etc.    As early as last year a supervisory department was created  in  the National Bank that was intended to protect the interests of  the depositors. During the year it investigated the activity of  160 banks and 261 branches.    For violations revealed during the course of these  inspections 15 licenses were revoked and 200 million tenge in  fines were imposed.    The following detail is also of some interest: The structure  of the apparatus in the National Bank has been reduced recently,  and 143 jobs have been cut. A new form of wages will be  introduced for employees whereby focus will be placed on bonuses  for workers for their personal contribution to the institution's  successful activity. Plans are being developed for training and  retraining of personnel and the introduction of electronic  equipment with future access to the consolidated computer  network.    In a word the National Bank is gradually making the changes  demanded by life.    But Daulet Sembayev's report did not satisfy all the  deputies  even though it was filled with information. The speaker was  asked many questions and then the members of parliament  exchanged opinions. The chairmen of the Supreme Council  committees on finance and budget, Orazgeldy Baymuratov, and on  economic reform, Orazaly Sabdenov, reported on the conclusions  drawn at the committee meeting. Both sets of conclusions  contained harsh critical remarks against the National Bank, but  the former recommended that Daulet Sembayev be confirmed for the  position and the latter abstaining.    The same range of opinions existed among the deputies.  Mukhtar Tyunikeyev, for example, was inclined to think that a  certain amount of the blame for today's situation in the economy  and finances lies with Daulet Sembayev personally, and Kazhmurat  Nagmanov is convinced that it is wrong to blame the National  Bank for all the problems because it cannot conduct an  independent economic policy but carries out the will of the  government and parliament. This range of opinions became more  apparent during the voting. There were 95 members of parliament  who voted in favor of approving the president's edict.</p>

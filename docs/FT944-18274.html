			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks hit by profits warning A deeply disturbing profits warning from SG Warburg, one of the UK's leading integrated securities houses, pushed panic buttons among investors and analysts. The shares responded by plunging more than 15 per cent to hit their lowest level since the beginning of last year as analysts cut forecasts. By the time the smoke had cleared the stock was down 101 at 569p with 4.3m shares traded and beginning to look relatively cheap, according to some banking specialists. Nevertheless, with the market capitalisation already putting the bank at the bottom of the FT-SE 100, its future in the blue chip index looked precarious. Warburg announced that profits expectations of around Pounds 140m for the six months to September would be disappointed and the figure was more likely to be between Pounds 55m and Pounds 65m. There was much speculation as to what lay behind the downgrade. Warburg cited difficulties in equity and fixed income trading, but some dealers said the big falls in global bond and stock markets had occurred before the March year-end. It was suggested that the house might have lost heavily in its risk manage-ent business, particularly derivatives. Downgrades followed swiftly. James Capel moved to the bottom of the range, reducing its full-year estimate by Pounds 100m, to Pounds 140m. Credit Lyonnais Laing took a more optimistic stance, lowering its forecast by Pounds 72m to Pounds 158m. However, the most shocked appeared to be NatWest Securities, which had seen Warburg as the best of a bad bunch. The house cut by Pounds 145m, to Pounds 155m, and moved its recommendation from 'add' to 'hold'. Laing, formerly a strong bear of the stock, took the opposite view and upgraded to a more neutral stance. Analyst Mr Martin Hughes argued that with staff salaries averaging Pounds 105,000, the high cost base compared to rival houses would hit profits when revenues were down, but the bank's net worth was now offering support. The Warburg statement turned the spotlight on to other investment banks as well as clearing banks with investment arms. Smith New Court, which has a very strong marketmaking presence, dropped 40 to 334p. Schroders, the merchant bank, shed 43 to 1335p, with concern focusing on its Wertheim arm. Clearers National Westminster and Barclays fell 8 1/2 to 479p and 11 1/2 to 559p respectively, although analysts said their strong presence in more stable foreign exchange markets would offer protection.</p>

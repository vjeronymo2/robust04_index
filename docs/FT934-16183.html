			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Soros takes undisclosed investment in Viatel MR George Soros, the international financier, has made an investment in Viatel, a small but fast-growing private telecommunications services company which plans to come to market in London and New York next year. Viatel, founded two years ago by Mr Martin Varsavsky, a New York-based entrepreneur, sells software-based telecommunications services, mainly to small and medium-sized businesses in Latin America and western Europe. The company's revenue has grown to Dollars 7m last year from about Dollars 360,000 in 1991. It had sales for the first quarter of this year of Dollars 4.3m and projects sales of Dollars 25m for 1993. The size of Mr Soros's stake in Viatel is undisclosed. About 80 per cent of the company is owned by Mr Varsavsky. Mr Soros and one other private investor, associated with the merchant bank Goldman Sachs, hold the remaining 20 per cent between them. Viatel is one of a growing number of small telecommunications service companies exploiting the liberalising international telecommunications regime to provide value-added services on the back of existing national telecommunications networks. The US and the UK are the company's main hubbing and software-development centres. Its expansion plans centre on western Europe, which is expected to account for 30 per cent of sales this year. The investment is a further indication of Mr Soros's interest in the telecommunications industry. He is a private investor in privatised Latin American telecommunications companies and is believed to be keen to broaden his telecommunication activities.</p>

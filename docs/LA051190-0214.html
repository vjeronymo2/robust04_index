			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GREAT 'TRAVELLING PLAYERS' MAKES IT TO L.A.  </P> <P> They enter the city slowly: a quiet, sad, stately group of actors who, for  years, have been roaming the countryside, performing Perisiadis' hackneyed but  wildly popular folk tale "Golfo the Shepherdess."  </P> <P> Their names and fates, now and past, bizarrely mirror the major figures in  Aeschylus' "Oresteia": Agamemnon, Orestes, Elektra. They are "The Travelling  Players" (at the Monica 4-Plex), central figures of a towering modern  masterpiece by Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos.  </P> <P> As the players arrive it is 1952. Suddenly, as they walk with desultory  slowness through the streets, we are back in 1939. Instead of campaign trucks  for Marshal Papagos, a visit from Goebbels is being announced. For the next  four hours, we will watch this troupe as they pass in and out of present and  past, through the major upheavals of a violent era.  </P> <P> We will watch them struggle, starve, betray and even kill each other; dance in  the mountains; cavort beachside for British troops; mad with hunger, stalk a  solitary chicken in the snow; sneak through streets aflame with rebellion and  riot. We will see history as they do, from the edges and far away.  </P> <P> "The Travelling Players" is one of the major neglected movie masterpieces of  our times. First made in 1975 and a legendary work in Europe for years --  winner of 15 major festival awards and innumerable "best film" polls -- it is  receiving its first Los Angeles commercial release beginning today, for one  week only.  </P> <P> Because the film is so extraordinary, and so easily misunderstood and  undervalued, some misconceptions have to be attacked. "The Travelling Players"  is not pretentious, opaque, self-indulgently static and slow -- though some  will definitely see it that way.  </P> <P> Part of the confusion involves Angelopoulos' unique style: the long-take,  moving camera mise-en-scene, which he takes to such harrowingly beautiful  extremes -- using only 80 shots in nearly four hours. This austerity will  madden some audiences.  </P> <P> But, watching "The Travelling Players," our emotional temperature changes,  cools out. We are not jerked from point to point, hammeringly, insistently. We  have to do our own editing, become more intellectually and emotionally alert.  Each scene is a memorable, masterful set-piece. For those willing to do so --  and Angelopoulos' strongest partisans include brilliant colleagues like  Bernardo Bertolucci and Akira Kurosawa -- the rewards of this movie are  intense.  </P> <P> In "The Travelling Players," the characters are less individuals than groups,  less groups than figures of the Earth, lost in what surrounds them: the land,  the sky and the sea. Angelopoulos -- and his virtuoso cinematographer Giorgio  Arvanitis -- give us bewitchingly lovely landscapes, made increasingly  significant because of the terrifying events enacted against them. National  betrayals echo personal ones. The Metaxas dictatorship falls with its Hitlerite  allies; the resistance fighters are duped into giving up their arms; the  British assume greater control; the left splits; finally Papagos, a scant  improvement, takes over.  </P> <P> "The Travelling Players," melancholy, profound and humane, is a great  anti-fascist epic. Incredibly, most it was shot in a country under the tyranny  of a military junta. The ellipsis and indirection, even the parallels to  Aeschylus, were all part of an elaborate strategy to dupe the censors and speak  to the audience, right over their heads. The film, one of the biggest popular  hits in Greek history, did just that -- though the "colonels" fell before its  release. (Ironically, some "progressive" American critics have proven just as  dense as the fascist censors.)  </P> <P> I haven't mentioned actors -- which may seem a contradiction. All of them, Eva  Kotamanidou, Aliki Georgouli, Stratos Pichis, and Yannis Firios -- the frail  old accordionist who opens the show -- are perfect. Yet "The Travelling  players" is far more an ensemble effort: a poetic vision of a world in all its  facets, human and inanimate, living and dead.  </P> <P> Poetry in the movies is always rare; Angelopoulos' is to be particularly  cherished because it is wedded to such profound intelligence, such stunning  sensitivity and courage. "The Travelling Players" (Times-rated Mature for  nudity, sexual scenes and adult themes) has the kind of high artistic  significance that "Intolerance," "The Rules of the Game," or "Greed" had in  their day. A classic of our times, it is a work whose purpose, as Joseph Conrad  and D. W. Griffith claimed for themselves, is to make you hear and feel: above  all, to make you see.  </P> <P> 'THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS'  </P> <P> A Kino International presentation of a Giorgios Papalios production.

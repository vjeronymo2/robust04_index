			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EISENHOWER IS SHOCKED BY MATER DEI;  </P> <P> DIVISION I: TWENTY POINTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER GIVE MONARCHS A 34-20 VICTORY  OVER DIVISION'S TOP-SEEDED TEAM. THEY WILL FACE QUARTZ HILL IN SEMIFINALS.  </P> <P> For two weeks, Eisenhower High School was at the top of the Southern Section  Division I, but the Eagles came crashing down in the fourth quarter Friday  night.  </P> <P> Mater Dei scored 20 points in a fourth-quarter blitz to knock off top-seeded  Eisenhower, 34-20, in the quarterfinals of the Division I playoffs in front of  6,500 at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> It was hardly expected.  </P> <P> Eisenhower came into the game with an 11-0 record and a No. 12 ranking in USA  Today's national poll. The Eagles had given up a grand total of 80 points in 11  games.  </P> <P> Mater Dei had won only one more game than it lost, but its offense began to  click in recent games.  </P> <P> The Monarchs' offense had proved nearly unstoppable once already in the  playoffs. Last week, Mater Dei rolled to a 58-31 victory over Long Beach Poly,  passing and running for impressive numbers.  </P> <P> Friday, Mater Dei trashed Eisenhower's stingy defense. The offense carried  Mater Dei (7-5) into next week's semifinals against Quartz Hill, a 24-14 winner  over Rubidoux.  </P> <P> Quarterback Billy Blanton completed 13 of 17 passes for 220 yards and three  touchdowns. At one point, Blanton, a junior, completed six consecutive passes  for a 21.5-yard average.  </P> <P> Running back Derek Sparks gained 188 yards and scored two touchdowns in 26  carries.  </P> <P> The big passing yardage might have been expected, what with Eisenhower coming  from the run-oriented Citrus Belt League. But Sparks' running was an added  bonus.  </P> <P> "We knew we could throw," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "We wanted to  keep them off balance."  </P> <P> Most of the time it looked easy.  </P> <P> Blanton's first pass was a step too long for receiver Ricky Ellis. Otherwise it  would have gone for a 75-yard touchdown play.  </P> <P> Later, Ellis slipped behind Eisenhower's defense for a 69-yard touchdown on a  play that was nearly identical. This time, however, Ellis ran under the ball at  the Eisenhower 30 and sprinted into the end zone.  </P> <P> Between, Blanton found Tom Martinez standing alone in the end zone for a  32-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> By the end of the first quarter, Mater Dei led, 14-0.  </P> <P> "We told our kids we can't give up the turnovers or the big plays," Rollinson  said.  </P> <P> An interception set up Eisenhower's first touchdown, a 12-yard pass from  quarterback Jason Davis to Demond Thompkins. The Eagles' second came on an  85-yard run by Marcus Collins.  </P> <P> " . . . and it was 14-14," Rollinson said.  </P> <P> Davis hit Thompkins on a fade pattern with 4:49 left in the third quarter, but  Robert Talley's extra point hit the upright.  </P> <P> Sparks' one-yard run and an extra point by Cliff Roberts gave Mater Dei a 21-20  lead with 11:57 left.  </P> <P> But the Monarchs turned the game into a runaway soon after.  </P> <P> First, the defense recovered a fumbled pitch by Davis at the Eisenhower 15,  setting up a seven-yard touchdown pass from Blanton to David Gonzalez with 8:53  left.  </P> <P> Then, Mater Dei stopped Eisenhower on fourth and goal at the Monarch eight.  </P> <P> On the next play, Sparks blew through a huge hole and cut back three times to  avoid defenders to complete a 92-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> There was 3:57 left and Mater Dei held a firm, 34-20, lead.  </P> <P> "This is the greatest win," Rollinson said.  </P></p>

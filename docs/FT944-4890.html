			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved ahead strongly, making good a large part of the big sell-off experienced at the end of last week, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the close of pit trading the FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,041, up 36. The final two sessions of last week saw the December contract fall by 88 points. The premium to the cash market was around eight points - roughly where it had traded all day - or some five points above fair value. Business was thin, with 12,683 contracts dealt, down from 15,919 on Friday. Moreover, around a quarter of these constituted spread trading as investors rolled over into the March contract. The December contract expires on December 16. The contract reached a 3,045 best of the day around 3pm - 30 minutes after the opening on Wall Street - and dealers said that at that point there was a flurry of useful two-way business. In late, screen-based trading the contract moved down to 3,039 in little additional turnover. Traded option volume was significantly lower than on Friday, although heavy trading built up around a number of individual options. There were 30,168 total contracts, down from 44,235. BTR was the most active stock option at 3,960 lots, followed by GrandMet at 2,481. BAT and Boots were also actively dealt.</p>

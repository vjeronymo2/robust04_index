Regarding this statement, ATA reporters asked explanations  from the vice chairman of the SP, Servet Pellumbi, and Deputy  Bashkim Zeneli, who repeated they support the conclusion they  have declared. But, according to them, the blockade of the  information has been more evident in other mass media than the  ATA.    Asked for concrete facts related to their conclusion, the SP  officials mentioned only two cases, that of the rally in Kucove  and the case when some people in Shkoder didn't allow some  deputies of the SP to have a rally they had previously  announced, both events have taken place 7-8 months ago.    For these two cases, since its correspondents have not been  present in the spot for lack of transportation means, ATA has  made the report referring to the spokesman of the Ministry of  Public Order, since incidents took place in these events.    Mr. Pellumbi and Mr. Zeneli admitted that reports of the SP  sent to ATA have been few. According to them, the SP spokesman  has not known the practice of sending reports to main mass media  and secondly, in some cases, proceeding from the former practice  of not giving reports, it has been prejudiced that these  institutions have made a continuous blockade to reports.    For further explanations about their claims regarding the  ATA, Mr. Pellumbi and Mr. Zeneli said they will discuss about it  the next day.</p>

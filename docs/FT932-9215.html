			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan agrees deal to buy parts from Toyota supplier NISSAN, Japan's second largest carmaker yesterday took the unprecedented step of agreeing to buy parts from a supplier affiliated to Toyota, its arch rival and Japan's largest car manufacturer. The deal is the clearest challenge yet to the traditional structure of the Japanese car industry, in which car manufacturers are supported by a vast hinterland of suppliers dedicated to that car maker. By taking this move, Nissan and Toyota are signalling to other makers and suppliers that they are not opposed to cost cutting measures which involve companies from different corporate groupings. The agreement marks a departure for Japan's car makers which are restructuring to cut costs in response to deeply depressed domestic sales, stagnant export markets and heavy fixed costs from past investment. The agreement is for Nissan to purchase about Y1bn (Dollars 9m) worth of engine parts a year from Aisan Industry, an affiliated supplier in which Toyota has a large minority shareholding. The deal is small and does not come into operation until 1995 but it could well pave the way for other car manufacturers to break the strict demarcation lines between suppliers for different car makers. Nissan will buy vacuum pumps from Aisan Industry. The parts which are used in diesel engines for Toyota's Camry and Corona models will be used, without modification, in two of Nissan's six types of diesel engine. Nissan executives indicated that Aisan's vacuum pumps were more reliable than the pumps it uses. Some car industry executives predicted that the deal would pave the way for Nissan and Toyota to cut costs by jointly designing and procuring common engine parts, including commercial vans and trucks as well as cars. Japanese car manufacturers are planning to cut the number of components they use by up to 40 per cent in an attempt to cut costs. It is likely that this will lead to a sharp reductions in the number of suppliers affiliated to car manufacturers.</p>

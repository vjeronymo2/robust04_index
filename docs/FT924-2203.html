			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Being forced towards more accountability / A look into the impact on life companies of Standard &amp; Poor's ratings THE usually staid ranks of the UK's life insurers were shaken into uproar last week at the attempt by Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit-rating agency, to rank them according to their financial strength. Actuaries and analysts were prepared to accept S&amp;P's central claim that life office strength has been reduced in the last five years and that solvency margins will remain permanently lower. But many attacked the wisdom of classifying individual offices into three categories on the basis of publicly available information alone. Falling property values and disappointing equity markets in the last five years have cut heavily into the assets and reserves of life companies. Meanwhile, costs of distribution have increased since the Financial Services Act, 1986, which led insurers to raise commissions and establish costly ties with building societies and banks. S&amp;P says that many offices are 'suffering severe expense inefficiencies'. This has led to widespread falls in the free-asset ratio, the most commonly used crude measure of strength. This measures the proportion to which an office's assets exceed its liabilities to policyholders. Even Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life office and awarded the top AAA ('Superior') claims-paying rating by S&amp;P, has seen its ratio fall from 22.9 per cent in 1986 to 12.6 per cent in 1990. Over the same period Legal &amp; General, the UK's fourth largest life insurer and also rated at the highest level by S&amp;P, has suffered a decline from 30.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent. Several companies have taken evasive measures to avoid capital strain, by cutting policyholders' annual bonuses, and by switching from equities and property into fixed interest securities, which are valued more favourably under the DTI's stringent solvency requirements. When this happens, pay-outs to policyholders are hit. This has led to greatly increased interest in financial strength among the independent brokers on whom the longest established 'with-profits' offices are dependent for much of their business. The actuarial calculations involved are complicated, but several leading independent financial advisers have called for a simple rating for life office strength. S&amp;P is bidding to fill this gap in the market, and its importance was demonstrated by the immediate impact on National Provident Institution, one of the four companies it described as 'vulnerable'. Within an hour of its London office opening on Friday, 20 alarmed policyholders had telephoned asking to cancel policies. However, it is difficult to classify life offices solely on the basis of published information and DTI returns, as different actuaries use various assumptions when valuing liabilities. Changing the assumption on future interest rates can drastically alter an office's total liabilities. This means that free-asset ratios and other crude measures can prove individual offices have weakened, but not necessarily that one office is stronger than another. 'Information available from published sources can provide only a broad indication of the relative financial strength of life offices. In particular, no comparison is meaningful unless full account is taken of the degree of conservatism inherent in the determination of liabilities since there is considerable variation between companies,' says R Watson, consultant actuaries. All the four companies branded as 'vulnerable' complained they had not been consulted. NPI, which could be seriously damaged by S&amp;P's rating as most of its business comes from independent advisers, quickly issued a rebuttal, supported by R Watson. Mr Bernard Brindley, NPI's chief actuary, pointed out that it used a conservative valuation policy - in other words, it assumes future interest rates will be relatively low at 4 per cent. Meanwhile it has kept 65 per cent of funds in equities. This is lower than some offices which have high free- asset ratios, such as Pearl, with 81 per cent invested in equities, but remains higher than offices such as Scottish Equitable (43 per cent) and Guardian Assurance, another to receive an S&amp;P 'vulnerable' rating, with 38 per cent. Mr Brindley also pointed out that NPI's free-asset ratio was only slightly lower than those of several other similar-sized offices, and suggested that singling it out for a 'vulnerable' rating was arbitrary. S&amp;P's ratings may, therefore, be too blunt an instrument to apply to such a complex topic. But the insurers' howls of anguish do reveal one problem which the industry must address. One consulting actuary put it this way: 'If you always put about the message that strength is important but life offices cannot be compared, it's a natural consequence for someone to come along and say that if the best information isn't published, then they'll just have to rely on published information. It's the sort of service financial advisers need to do their job properly, and the offices will have to put up with a degree of arbitrariness.' Life insurers have come under increasing pressure from both regulators and the press to be more open about their charges and accounts this year. And none denies that the industry as a whole has weakened. The dispute over the S&amp;P ratings is the latest chapter in a story which seems to be moving towards a more open and accountable industry.

"All sorts of plots are presently being hatched against us,  the special services are onto us, and so we must strengthen our  unity. At the fifth congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia, which is to be held in Moscow on 2 April, I shall raise  the issue of strengthening the single chain of command in the  party," Zhirinovskiy said.    Touching on the state of affairs in the economy, he used his  usual vocabulary to describe the profound crisis, and reiterated  the lack of talent amongst the country's leaders. Only the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, once in power, can in his  view offer Russian Federation citizens a better life.</p>

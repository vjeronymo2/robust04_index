In two to three years Iceland must decide whether the country  will be linked to Europe or the United States. The decision is  not easy, and a debate on the country's future is only just  beginning. Pirjo Auvinen continues from Reykjavik:    [Auvinen] The Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian negotiation  results with the European Union [EU] surprised even Icelandic  Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson. By his own words, he  could not imagine that agreement would be found so quickly.  Hannibalsson said however, that he was even more surprised by  the negotiation result achieved by Norway. According to him, it  is much better than expected and is in fact good. Finland's and  Sweden's EU membership is chiefly an academic matter for  Iceland, which lives off fish and fish processing. On the other  hand, Norway's potential membership in the EU brings Iceland to  a historic situation, in the Icelandic foreign minister's own  words.    [Begin Hannibalsson recording in Swedish-Norwegian] [words  indistinct] it is clear that Iceland is at a historic juncture,  and we do not yet know in what direction we want to go. [end  recording]    [Auvinen] According to Foreign Minister Hannibalsson,  Iceland  must choose between two alternatives: Either it seeks  membership in the EU like the other Nordic countries or it seeks  to strengthen its current EEA [European Economic Area] treaty by  concluding a free trade agreement with the United States and  Canada. [passage omitted]    According to Hannibalsson, by present prospects, Iceland  cannot seek EU membership until after the big EU conference in  1996, but creating closer relations than at present with the  United States would not be easy either. The foreign minister  yesterday handed a report assessing those difficulties to the  Icelandic parliament.    Hannibalsson admits openly that Iceland may be drifting into  a very isolated position. Its opportunities to exert influence  will be reduced, and the Nordic cooperation, which is important  to Iceland, will move beyond its reach. [passage omitted]    According to Hannibalsson, the decision on which direction  Iceland will take in future must be made quickly, in two to  three years.</p>

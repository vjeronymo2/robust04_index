			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> STEVEN BERKOFF'S MACHISMO DIARY  </P> <P> Most men on location in Acapulco, filming something as mindless as "Rambo II,"  would probably spend their off hours with a margarita or a Magdalena on the  beach, or drowning the bad taste by bellying up to a bar and letting it go at  that. But Steven Berkoff isn't most men and he doesn't let things go. So he  wrote a play instead -- not about the making of "Rambo II," but about the  extras and bit players and blow-hards with whom he traded chatter at the bar.  </P> <P> Berkoff has called "Acapulco," which he directed and which opened Saturday at  the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, "a painted study of people's moods and spirits."  That's putting a poetic face on it. Scratch "Acapulco" (not too deeply) and  you'll find it to be the stuff of locker-room conversations. There are two ways  to look at a play that offers that: as a merely tiresome and offensive  avalanche of male machismo absurdissimo or the way playwright Berkoff chooses  to see it -- as a humorous (read affectionate) portrait of lost boys with no  other subject of conversation than sex, sex, sex and women as its object.  </P> <P> Pathetic? Well, that, unfortunately, is the third totally valid way of looking  at it. Combined with the first (tiresome and offensive), it can be deadly. If  you think you fall into this category, "Acapulco" is not for you. But no matter  how hard Berkoff tries to paint a grotesque raunchy/funny picture, this most  vivid and original of sometimes indulgent writers can't help coming up with  some gems. True, he has given most of the best speeches to his alter-ego, the  Steve character at the bar (John Horn), who is just aloof enough, bemused  enough and tipsy enough to jump into the conversation at choice moments with  choice words.  </P> <P> The rest of this rogues' gallery is far less appealing. It includes a whining  Brooklynite self-hater named Will (Tom Flynn), an English-speaking cipher  living in Mexico named John (Michael Sollenberger), a tough-talking Yugoslav  braggart named Voyo (Richard Vidan), an inscrutable bartender (Sam Vlahos  a.k.a. Sam Markis) and Karen (Chandra Lee), an American bimbo, surely descended  of Lady Bracknell, who has an ongoing screaming fit about losing her handbag.  Let it be noted here that this is an equal-opportunity play; women have as much  right as men to be on their worst behavior.  </P> <P> In typical Berkoff fashion, Craig E. Lathrop's setting is simple -- an  unembellished bar that straddles the width of the stage, with a giant sketch of  Stallone as Rambo above it. The characters schmooze, complain, show off and  swing in and out of reality, talking to the audience as they might to  themselves. The switching is subtle, effected mostly by slight shifts in Doc  Ballard's lighting. Importantly featured in the background is a melancholy  musical thread composed by Rory Anton that underscores the poetry and offsets  pulchritude.  </P> <P> "Acapulco" is not, however, your typical Berkoff play. It is, for one thing,  linear and, unlike "Kvetch" or "Greek," very nearly naturalistic. It feels like  what it is: the dramatization of a personal journal. The result is episodic  with a series of arias that find only their own culminations.  </P> <P> Within this framework, Horn, who gives an uncanny performance as a Berkoff  look-alike and sound-alike, has some great speeches, in particular an account  of the making of the documentary of "Rambo II," which puts the puny barflies in  their place and him at the head of the class. Those barflies have their moments  too -- one anyway, when Vidan, Flynn and Sollenberger indulge in a joint  imitation of Rod Steiger in the taxicab scene from "On the Waterfront." But  their characters are intrinsically shoddy, which is part of the play's problem.  The evening officially belongs to Horn, through whose observations and  reactions we receive not only a sense of the event, but a composite, lyrical  image of the good and bad of Mexico as well.  </P> <P> A final word: This writer missed the first 10 minutes of the play because of  failing to register the 7:30 p.m. Saturday starting time. Apologies to all, but  especially to Lee, who has her biggest moment at the opening.  </P> <P>  At 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Thursdays and Fridays, 8:30 p.m.; Saturdays and  Sundays, 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $17.50-$22; (213) 477-2055.  </P> <P> </P></p>

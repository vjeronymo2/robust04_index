"We needed another close game like this to get  ready for our Big 10 season."  </P> <P> Ohio State (9-0) will play Miami, Ohio, a 101-99 winner over Miami, Fla.,  tonight in the championship game.  </P> <P> Unranked Mississippi State (7-1), which competes in the Southeastern  Conference, pushed the Buckeyes throughout the game and led, 44-41, at  halftime.  </P> <P> The lead changed five times after halftime before the Buckeyes went ahead,  69-67, with 6:45 left.  </P> <P> Jamaal Brown led Ohio State with 20 points and Jim Jackson had 18, including  three baskets in the last four minutes.  </P> <P> Greg Carter and Todd Merritt each scored 16 points for the Bulldogs.  </P> <P> Miami of Ohio (6-4) won its game despite a tournament-record 39 points by Joe  Wylie of Miami of Florida (1-7).  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER TOURNAMENTS  </P> <P> </P> <P> ECAC HOLIDAY  </P> <P> No. 12 South Carolina 52, Brigham Young 49 -- Joe Rhett made a basket and added  a free throw with 1:26 left to give the Gamecocks the lead for good in a  first-round game of the East Coast Athletic Conference Holiday tournament at  New York.  </P> <P> The Gamecocks (9-1) will meet Maryland, an 86-81 winner over Rutgers, in  Saturday night's championship game.  </P> <P> BYU (6-6) had two chances to score in the final minute, but 7-foot-6 freshman  Shawn Bradley was tied up for a jump ball on one and Jared Miller missed the  front end of a one-and-one with the other.  </P> <P> Bradley, who had 14 points, eight rebounds and seven blocked shots, controlled  the rebound, but he fell out of bounds.  </P> <P> Maryland 86, Rutgers 81 -- Walt Williams, a 6-8 junior point guard, scored 30  points, including 10 of 12 points in the deciding run as the Terrapins advanced  to the tournament final.  </P> <P> Rutgers (5-3) had rallied from a 12-point first-half deficit to lead, 76-68,  with 8:03 to play when Keith Hughes was awarded a basket on goaltending. That  was the Scarlet Knights' last field goal until 1:57 remained and it ended a  10-0 Maryland run, with Williams scoring eight of the points.  </P> <P> Evers Burns added 16 points for Maryland (5-3), which built its first-half lead  through an effective trapping defense.  </P> <P> Donnell Lumpkin led Rutgers with 21 points.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOOSIER  </P> <P> No. 5 Indiana 91, Marshall 67 -- The Hoosiers (11-1) scored the first 12 points  and held the Thundering Herd (5-6) to two points in the game's first six  minutes en route to an easy victory in the first round of their tournament at  Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Indiana will play Ohio, a 77-74 winner over North Texas, in the championship  game.  </P> <P> "We got started off really playing well defensively," said Indiana Coach Bob  Knight, whose team forced Marshall into four missed shots and four turnovers in  the game's first four minutes.  </P> <P> John Taft scored a game-high 28 points for Marshall.  </P> <P> Calbert Cheaney scored 27 points, 16 in the second half, to pace Indiana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUGAR BOWL  </P> <P> Villanova 88, Auburn 71 -- The Wildcats built a 20-point halftime lead and  cruised to the victory in the Sugar Bowl tournament at New Orleans.  </P> <P> Arron Bain scored 20 points for Villanova (6-3), which advanced to Friday's  tournament final against Georgia Tech.  </P> <P> Ronnie Battle scored 21 points for Auburn (6-2), which never got closer than 12  points in the second half.  </P> <P> Georgia Tech 95, Tulane 83 -- Malcolm Mackey scored 26 points and Kenny  Anderson added 19 as the Yellow Jackets (6-3) advanced to the final.  </P> <P> David Whitmore, who transferred from Georgia Tech, led Tulane with 21 points.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NONTOURNAMENT  </P> <P> No. 18 Kentucky 74, Eastern Kentucky 60 -- Reggie Hanson scored nine of his  career-high 27 points during a 20-6 run in the second half at Lexington, Ky.,  as the Wildcats (7-2) beat the Colonels (6-3) in only the second game between  the schools in 62 years  </P> <P> Seton Hall 103, North Carolina A&amp;T 77 -- Terry Dehere scored 20 of his  game-high 30 points in the second half to lead the Pirates (7-1) over the  Aggies (4-3) at South Orange, N.J.  </P> <P> Oregon State 101, Western Michigan 76 -- Will Brantley scored 28 points and the  Beavers (5-3) shot 72% in the first half to defeat the Broncos (3-5) at  Corvallis, Ore.  </P> <P> Nevada 68, San Jose State 64 -- Center Ric Herrin scored 17 points and grabbed  10 rebounds at San Jose to lead the Wolf Pack (4-8) over the Spartans (2-6).  </P></p>

Although U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hoped to  achieve tangible progress, due to the practical atmosphere  prevailing over the talks, all signs indicate that the Israelis  are avoiding responding to any substantive questions posed to  them, especially those concerning full withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories. The Israelis have adopted a policy  of prevarication while showing flexibility in techniques only.    The stand of the Israeli negotiators in Washington reflects  Yitzhaq Rabin's views, which have been described as a halfway  policy. On every occasion, Rabin calls on the Arabs to convince  Israel that they really want peace, given that the Arabs have  repeatedly reaffirmed their desire to achieve peace.    The Arab trend toward peace does not need further evidence  or  proof. Syria has presented a lot in order to render the peace  process a success and its efforts have enjoyed the international  community's appreciation. Syria was the center of attention  during the recent Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad  and Bill Clinton. The latter clearly and frankly praised  Syria's stands and its true efforts to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East. President Clinton  totally adopted President al-Asad's call for the peace of the  brave--a just and honorable peace that removes the occupation  and restores the rights to their owners.    From this we can see that Israel's prevarication has  certainly not been caused by the doubts it is claims to have on  Arab intentions for peace, especially Syria's intentions. It is  caused by its desire to devour as much occupied Arab territories  as possible under the pretexts of security, given that a firm  peace is the ideal security guarantee for all the countries in  the region.    It is no surprise that during his official address to the  European Parliament in Strasbourg, Yitzhaq Rabin said he is not,  and will never become, Israel's de Gaulle, in clear reference to  [former] French President Charles de Gaulle's decision to  withdraw from Algeria and recognize its independence. At the  time, this decision was described as a brave and courageous  decision and enjoyed world appreciation. Rabin added: Israel  will very carefully explore the road until it is reassured of  Syria's intentions toward peace and security.    It is clear to every observer that Israel, through its  officials, is deliberately raising these doubts in order to put  an end to the momentum of the peace process after the Geneva  summit and to buffer the active and effective U.S. role. the  Arabs understand peace as a full withdrawal from all their  occupied territories -- not from half of these territories-- and  a restoration of all their rights -- not having them restored in  increments.    The halfway policy that Rabin is promoting is a flagrant  attempt to circumvent the call for the peace of the brave and  the world community's expectations that Israel will rise to the  level of the Geneva summit and the desired peace in the Middle  East. This is especially so since, after long years of feeding  the Zionist community on Talmudic illusions, kindling  fanaticism, and promoting expansionist schemes, the rulers of  Israel have no alternative but to adopt a true and brave stand  themselves and confide in the Israeli people the facts of the  20th century and the requirements of peace, the foremost of  which is a full withdrawal from the occupied territories and  closing the chapter of Jewish settlements once and for all.    This bravery, which the world community is eagerly awaiting,  has been frankly rejected by Rabin. Instead, he is still  talking about the same security claims and fabricated doubts.  It is natural for all of this to reflect on the Washington  talks and for the Israeli negotiators to continue evading the  requirements of the peace process and the necessary answers to  substantive questions.    Because peace is an important and basic issue, on the fate  of  which the future of the region depends, the Arabs will continue  talks until the end. The next days will reveal the extent of  the rulers of Israel's response to the will of the world, the  resolutions of the world community, and the results of the  Geneva summit.</p>

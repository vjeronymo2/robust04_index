At a congress Mr. Kooijmans called Kosovo a volcano that could  erupt at any moment. According to the foreign minister, an  explosion of violence there must be prevented through dialogue.    Mr. Kooijmans places responsibility for the tense situation  in the province primarily on the Serbs. Three years ago  Belgrade ended the autonomous status of Kosovo, which has a  majority population of ethnic Albanians.</p>

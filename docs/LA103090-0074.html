			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN JAILED IN HUSBAND'S DEATH RELEASED  </P> <P> On her 75th birthday and slightly more than 24 hours after police raided her  home, a Redondo Beach woman was released from jail Monday after declining to  answer police questions about the death of her 79-year-old husband,  investigators said.  </P> <P> Mary Seifert was arrested Sunday and booked for investigation of murder in the  death Saturday morning of Melvin Seifert, who police said died at his home of  an "injected overdose of a controlled substance."  </P> <P> Richard Schaeffer, 69, a prominent Rolling Hills Estates doctor who treated  Seifert's ailing husband, was also arrested and declined to talk with police,  investigators said. Schaeffer was expected to be released early today.  </P> <P> A coroner's spokesman said results of autopsy lab tests would not be available  until later this week. Deputy Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said the investigation  of Seifert's death could be completed by the end of next week.  </P> <P> Friends of Seifert and Schaeffer called the arrests an outrage. Seifert's  family declined to comment Monday or to provide the name of her attorney.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach police said Melvin Seifert was a retired coach and something of a  legend at Redondo Beach Union High School. One colleague referred to him as Mr.  Redondo.  </P> <P> Police released few details on the arrests. Lt. John Nelson said that after 24  hours of investigative work by at least eight detectives, police served search  warrants Sunday morning at Schaeffer's home in a gated community in Rolling  Hills Estates, at his Redondo Beach office and at the Seifert residence.  </P> <P> Police took possession of Seifert's body Saturday morning at a Redondo Beach  funeral home. Nelson said Mary Seifert had planned to have her husband's body  cremated.  </P> <P> "There's a substantial amount of evidence here," Nelson said, but he declined  to provide details. "We feel that this case is of a very serious nature and is  in fact a homicide and should be prosecuted as a murder.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the fact that Dr. Schaeffer is a prominent doctor in the community  was something we took into consideration," he said.  </P> <P> Nelson declined to discuss a possible motive for the alleged crime.  </P> <P> Schaeffer, a general practitioner, has worked in Redondo Beach for 45 years,  according to his secretary, Margie Welker.  </P> <P> Schaeffer had begun visiting the Seifert home in the last week because Melvin  Seifert's condition had deteriorated to the point that his wife could no longer  bring him into the office, Welker said. Melvin Seifert suffered from  Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, she said. Schaeffer visited the  Seifert home on Saturday, Welker said, because Melvin Seifert was suffering  breathing problems.  </P> <P> A neighbor also said that Melvin Seifert's condition had worsened recently.  </P> <P> "I saw Mary (Seifert) a week ago," said Betty Uhls. "I said, 'How is Mel?' She  said, 'Betty, I think I'm going to put Melvin in a nursing home.' "  </P> <P> Uhls added: "In the four years Melvin was ill I never saw a woman more devoted  to a husband than Mary. She wouldn't even get her hair done. She turned their  living room into a hospital room."  </P> <P> Uhls said it was difficult for Mary Seifert to care for her husband because she  has only partial use of one of her arms.  </P> <P> Friends and patients of Schaeffer expressed outrage at his arrest.  </P> <P> "I cannot believe that they would have put him in a lockup of any kind," said  Joan Hughes, 60, a longtime patient who credits the doctor with saving the life  of her husband. "He's not a killer. He's a God-fearing man, a wonderful man."  </P> <P> At Schaeffer's office in Redondo Beach -- where Western paintings and the  Hippocratic oath decorate the walls -- Welker said the doctor's telephone was  "ringing off the hook." Friends and colleagues called with messages of support  and concern, saying "he would never (murder anyone) . . . he has saved too many  lives, he cares about life too much," Welker said.  </P> <P> South Bay Municipal Judge Benjamin Aranda withdrew Seifert's arrest warrant  Monday morning, allowing her to be freed.  </P> <P> Nelson said that "due to her age and for humanitarian reasons," police did not  object. "Her release from custody should not be construed as (an admission) of  any weakness in this case," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bettina Boxall, Lily Dizon, Janet Rae-Dupree and Louis  Sahagun contributed to this report.  </P></p>

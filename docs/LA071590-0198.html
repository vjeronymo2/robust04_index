			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: HOME IMPROVMENT;  </P> <P> SEALING PINE CURBS KNOT BLEEDING  </P> <P> QUESTION: I have built-in corner cabinets in my dining room that I painted to  match the room trim. The cabinet doors are pine, and after two years, the knots  are bleeding through and looking really bad. The doors now have four coats of  paint but it doesn't stop the bleeding. Is there an easy way to seal these  knots to prevent this from happening again when I repaint the doors?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Probably your cabinet doors were not primed and sealed prior to the  original painting. The Parks Corp. of Somerset, Mass., has a product called  UnderCover, which they claim will keep wood-knot and sap stains sealed beneath  its prime undercoat. UnderCover is available in paint stores and costs about  $20 a gallon. Don't add a fifth coat of paint to the cabinet doors. Strip off  the four coats now on the doors and sand all the rough areas for a smooth,  clean surface. Apply the UnderCover primer paint, let it dry thoroughly and  then repaint.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shower Diverter Valve Is Easy to Fix, Replace  </P> <P> Q: I have a problem with the shower diverter on my bathtub faucet. When the  knob is pulled up to divert water to the shower, a lot of water continues to  flow into the tub. Is there any way either to replace or repair this fixture  without having to open up the wall?  </P> <P> A: Yes. The diverter valve mechanism you refer to is inside the tub faucet  spout, not inside the wall. The spout is screwed onto the water pipe and can be  unscrewed easily. Once the spout is off, you can see the mechanism. It's a  small gate valve on the base of the plunger shaft. Water pressure holds it up  (closed position). Turn off the water and the gate valve drops, opening the tub  spout so water flows into the tub next time it's turned on.  </P> <P> If the diverter can't be repaired, it's cheap and easy enough to replace the  entire spout, including the diverter mechanism. These spouts are available at  plumbing supply stores and home centers and usually cost between $10 and $15.  </P> <P> There are different types and sizes of diverter spouts available, so take your  old spout along to make sure you get the right one. Check especially that the  setback distance of the threads within the spout matches the length of the  protruding water pipe, so that you get a tight fit between the spout shoulder  and the wall.  </P> <P> When replacing the spout, use pipe-joint compound or Teflon sealing tape on the  threads to prevent leaks. Completely fill the hollowed-out back end of the  spout with plumber's putty to keep water from getting in behind it and  penetrating the wall.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With the approaching local elections, the  colonialist Turkish regime has infinitely escalated its violent  genocidal and oppressive actions. Our people cannot have the  opportunity to express their free will in the elections in such  an atmosphere of violence. We will not permit elections to be  held in an atmosphere of genocide, intimidation, and special  warfare measures put into effect by the colonialist regime.    Yes, dear listeners, in a statement issued on 1 March, our  PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] announced its policy on elections  [words indistinct] in a statement on behalf of our party, Kani  Yilmaz, ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan]  representative in Europe, said that we do not regard the  elections to be held in Kurdistan as legal, and for this reason  we are boycotting the elections. Therefore, in our view, the  DEP [Democracy Party] decision is the one preferred by the  Kurdish people. It is a correct decision that must be  supported. Had there been democratic conditions, the will of  the people in Kurdistan would have been revealed. Our leader  stated this fact many times. To prevent the expression of the  people's will, the Turkish state is using its army and its crime  syndicate, the counterguerrilla [words indistinct] as long as  the war continues in Kurdistan, we will take a clear stand  against an election to be held outside the will of the Kurdish  people. We will not accept these elections. Our people will  definitely not go to these elections. I am particularly  stressing: The candidates from the other parties must  immediately withdraw from the elections. I repeat: They must  immediately withdraw from the elections. If they do not  withdraw, as of today they are ARGK [People's Liberation Army of  Kurdistan] targets and will be shot dead. The fascist Turkish  state is detaining and (?torturing) those persons and candidates  who do not share its ideology. Those engaged in election  propaganda are being shot dead, the mayors are being removed  from their posts, and party headquarters are being bombed. The  ballot boxes will be opened at military garrisons. These boxes  are being handed over to the special teams and village guards.  There cannot be any talk of elections under these conditions.  This is a complete farce [words indistinct] our ERNK spokesman  in Europe added: The political parties must immediately  withdraw their candidates; otherwise, the candidates will be  punished by our ARGK [words indistinct] he added that at present  [passage indistinct] Every action to be taken against the  state's election preparations has been determined. The details  concerning each action will depend on the assessment to be made  by regional bureaus of the movement [passage indistinct]</p>

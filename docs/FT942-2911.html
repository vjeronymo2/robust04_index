			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Zimbabwe gives civil servants pay boost Zimbabwe's public servants, police and soldiers are to get an interim pay rise ranging from 10 to 23 per cent next month, at a cost of ZDollars 1.74bn (Pounds 146.6m). The chairman of the Public Service Commission said the increases were an interim measure designed to help civil servants cope with inflation of 24 per cent over the past year. Private-sector salaries were, on average, 172 per cent higher than those in the public service, while para-statal employees were paid 84 per cent more than civil servants. The government was committed to redressing this situation once it had considered the report of a British consultant. Further reviews of allowances for the police and the defence forces were under way, he added. Ironically, the announcement follows increasingly shrill warnings about inflationary pressures in the economy from the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe. The ZDollars 1.7bn pay award represents a rise of nearly 12 per cent in public spending in the 1994/5 fiscal year starting on July 1.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Listeners's Letterbox" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The first HIV-infection case  in China was reported in 1985 in the country's eastern province  of Zhejiang. Four children who had hemophilia contracted the  HIV virus because of contaminated blood used in transfusions.  The blood plasma was imported from abroad. The Chinese  Government banned the import of plasma immediately after that  case. Additional HIV infections were found among intravenous  drug users in the southern border province of Yunnan in 1989.  Since then, China has identified more than 1,150 cases of HIV  carriers, and 19 people have become afflicted with full-blown  AIDS. At present, 85 percent of those infected with the AIDS  virus in China are intravenous drug users. The border area with  Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia is the most infected area because of  its long history of opium trade and drug abuse. This area is  still backward economically and far from urban areas.  Transportation is limited. Radio and television sets, which can  be used to warn people about the dangers of contracting AIDS,  are rare, and medical service is not always available. In  addition, cultural habits are responsible for some of the  infections, as the local Dai and Jingpo ethnic groups believe  opium is a cure for headache and diarrhea.    Planting and processing opium is banned by the government,  but it is difficult for the small police force in the area to  eliminate the illegal practice when the villagers plant opium in  very small fields in the dense forests. Another problem is the  shortage of needles, forcing many of the drug users to share  needles. This causes the disease to spread even faster.    The Chinese Government has set up a clinic in Yunnan to  monitor AIDS cases and educate the public about the dangers.  But getting the information out is very difficult. Zhu Wei is  working as a researcher with the AIDS surveillance center under  the China Academy of Preventive Medicine. He has worked with  the local teams in Yunnan Province.    [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in  Mandarin, fading into English translation] The local people  know little about disease that is threatening their lives. When  talking with them, we need interpreters in Dai and Jingpo  languages, because these people do not speak Mandarin, and most  of them do not know how to read and write. The only thing they  care about seems to be drugs. Every year the AIDS surveillance  center sends a number of researchers to Yunnan to help with the  local work and get firsthand information. I went to Yunnan last  year. A lot of local medical workers who know the languages and  have knowledge of AIDS went to every family with us, explaining  the fatal disease to them. We put up a poster warning about the  danger of AIDS in the villages. We paid special attention to  the families that already had AIDS patients or HIV carriers. We  talked to the family members on how to protect themselves from  being affected. And now and then, the local medical workers  visit these families to see how things go on. [end recording]    Though drug users make up the majority of AIDS victims in  China, they are not the most dangerous factors of the spreading  of AIDS in the country. Medical experts say the most dangerous  factor is promiscuous sexual activity. For more than three  decades after the founding of the PRC, Chinese successfully  protected themselves against venereal diseases. However, while  the opening and reform programs that began in the 1980's have  brought prosperity to the country, they have also caused  dramatic changes in people's ideas about morality and sex.  Cases of prostitution are increasingly rapidly every year. The  number of people who have sexual partners outside marriage is  increasing, and sexual activity among young people and teenagers  is now occurring much earlier. The number of venereal disease  cases has increased dramatically. In 1991, sexually  transmission accounted for 10 percent of the total number of HIV  cases. In 1992 it was 20 percent. The rate is still growing.</p>

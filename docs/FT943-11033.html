			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Insurance watchdog says why he quit Mr Julian Farrand, who resigned as insurance ombudsman last Thursday and is to be pensions ombudsman, yesterday called for his new office to be given responsibility for complaints about personal pensions sold to people transferring out of occupational schemes. He also criticised the Personal Investment Authority, the controversial new watchdog to protect the private investor. He said it had significantly reduced the role of the insurance ombudsman by creating a new office of PIA ombudsman. Mr Farrand said yesterday that he had resigned as insurance ombudsman after a long period of 'disillusionment' over the role's future. He added: 'I preferred the challenge of being in a developed and enlarged role to remaining in something with a diminishing significance.' He said he had been searching for new appointments for some months as his role had been increasingly squeezed by the expansion of the authority. His resignation followed the news last Wednesday that his application to become pensions ombudsman had been accepted. He takes over on September 1. Mr Farrand had already hinted in evidence earlier this year to the Commons Treasury committee that he was unhappy with the new structures being implemented for the regulation of invest-ment. One particularly contentious issue has been the fact that there is a ceiling of Pounds 50,000 on the award the PIA ombudsman can make a financial-services organisation pay. This compares with a maximum of Pounds 100,000 under the insurance-ombudsman scheme. Mr Farrand said it remained unclear which body would take on the role of dealing with complaints about pension transfers and opt-outs if the rulings of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, were not accepted. He said shifting this responsibility to the pensions ombudsman had 'some sort of logic and clarity, and would be a little less confusing for the consumer'. While SIB has yet to publish its plans for dealing with compensation to customers who have suffered as a result of poor advice to take a pension transfer, there is little sign that it believes the pensions ombudsman is best placed to take on this role. SIB believes that most complaints will centre on the marketing side of pensions rather than on their administration, and so would fall more to the PIA ombudsman.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARTS;  </P> <P> BALTIMORE SYMPHONY STRIKE AT END  </P> <P> The board of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra unanimously approved today an  agreement between players and management to end a nearly 22-week strike -- the  longest walkout in the history of major U.S. symphonies.  </P> <P> The pact was announced after negotiators met for more than 12 hours in Gov.  William Donald Schaefer's Baltimore office. While details of the contract were  not released pending ratification by the 96 musicians on Saturday, both sides  appeared satisfied with the four-year contract.  </P> <P> Player negotiator Charles Underwood said by the third and fourth year of the  pact, orchestra salaries will be "competitive" with comparable orchestras in  other cities. The base average salary in the last contract was $700 weekly and  the initial demand in the 1988 negotiations was for $1,000 by the last year of  the new pact.  </P></p>

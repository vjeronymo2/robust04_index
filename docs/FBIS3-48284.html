			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shegeru Komago in Washington; from Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI </F> SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 January Morning Edition]    [Text] The U.S. Government will probably send very  high-ranking officials, including Chairwoman Laura Tyson of the  president's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), to the vice  ministerial level plenary meeting of the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks opening in Washington this week. It intends to  make an all-out effort to "gather information" on the tumultuous  political situation in Japan after the political reform bills  were rejected by the House of Councillors on 21 January]. As  early adoption of "economic stimulation measures, including an  income tax cut," which the United States had strongly hoped for,  has become quite improbable, this week's meeting may well decide  the fate of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting scheduled for February.    The vice ministerial level plenary meeting on 24 and 25  January is supposed to make an interim assessment of the  framework talks. Regular members on the U.S. side of this  meeting include Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president  (concurrently vice chairman of the National Economic Council),  and vice ministerial level representatives of the Departments of  Treasury, State and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative. The Japanese side will be headed by Koichiro  Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs.    According to a White House source, aside from Tyson, CEA  member Blinder [name as published], Deputy Secretary of the  Treasury Roger C. Altman, and National Intelligence Council  officer for East Asia Ezra Vogel may also participate in the  meeting "if time permits." It will be an unusual meeting, with  all the officials in charge of economic policy and intelligence  in the Clinton administration attending.    Behind this lies U.S. anxiety about the situation. While the  U.S. Government has expressed its discontent at the lack of  progress in the framework talks by criticizing Japanese  bureaucrats, it always felt a final breakthrough could be  achieved through a political decision by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa. However, with the rejection of the political reform  bills, the prime minister's leadership has been weakened, and it  has become difficult to make an early decision on any income tax  cut, not to mention market liberalization.    The U.S. administration, under pressure from Congress, is  now  forced to decide between pushing through or postponing a  Japan-U.S. summit which is unlikely to be fruitful. Therefore,  following the visit of Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen  to Japan on short notice to learn about the political situation,  the United States would again like to assess how effectively  Japan can respond in the framework talks at this week's meeting.    There is concern that if Tyson leads the discussions, there  will be heated exchanges between Japan and United States at the  meeting. If the meeting is characterized by confrontation at a  time when U.S. expectations of the Hosokawa administration are  being lowered, it could lead to a decisive deterioration in  Japan-U.S. relations.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Maastricht deal 'suffers from structural flaws' FLAWS in the Maastricht Treaty increase the difficulties of moves towards economic and monetary union, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, chairman of the Committee of European Community Central Bank Governors, warned yesterday. Speaking to the Financial Times in Basle, where he is today to report to his committee on the stalled plans for Emu, Mr Hoffmeyer said the treaty suffered from 'structural weaknesses' relating to the economic aspects and from a lack of clarity about the proposed political structure of a united Europe. The comments by Mr Hoffmeyer, who is also governor of Denmark's central bank, increase uncertainty over Emu, plans for which were jeopardised by a referendum of Danish voters earlier this month rejecting the treaty. Mr Hoffmeyer, a firm Emu supporter, said he had not been embarrassed by the vote of his fellow citizens. 'The debate in my country was fair and we have to respect the decision,' he said, adding that he remained hopeful Europe could 'get back into the game' of moving towards Emu. But exactly how to achieve this was a matter for politicians. The Danish bank chief, who will also take part in today's annual meeting in Basle of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' bank, said the tough economic criteria agreed at Maastricht on the terms for participation in Emu made it unlikely that the whole of Europe could join the union at the same time. The treaty also failed to address how wage and fiscal policy across Europe would have to alter. Third, the agreement had not been clear enough about the political framework for a united Europe. Mr Hoffmeyer said that his country had been wrong to vote against the Maastricht treaty. 'The decision has retarded the development of a united Europe. I would wish that my country was about to re-enter (the Emu debate).' Balanced View: Observer, Page 17</p>

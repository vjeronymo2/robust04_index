			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PLANNERS APPROVE NEW LIBRARY WING  </P> <P> What city officials describe as the largest library wing in the state for  children has been approved for Huntington Central Library.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission this week unanimously approved adding the $5-million  wing. Unless that vote is appealed to the City Council within 10 days,  construction can begin on the 26,476-square-foot addition to the library at  Talbert Avenue near Golden West Street.  </P> <P> Given the overwhelming support the project has received from city officials,  residents and businesses, library director Ron Hayden said he doubts that a  council hearing will be called.  </P> <P> Along with the children's library, the wing will include an expanded bookstore,  a small theater, a video and computer center and a new entry. Some outdoor  fountains will also be reconfigured.  </P> <P> About $2.5 million of the project's cost will be paid for by fund raising, with  the remainder covered by federal and state grants and the city, Hayden said.  </P> <P> The library is expected to open in fall, 1992.  </P> <P> The building's look will reflect the design of the existing library designed by  Richard Neutra, whom city officials call "a master architect."  </P> <P> The only public criticism came from Barbara Milkovich, a resident involved in  many historic preservation efforts. She called the design "a travesty" that  "violates the integrity of a major cultural resource."  </P> <P> However, city officials and other residents lauded the architect, Neill Noble.  "This is a masterful design," resident Claire Hansen said.  </P> <P> Planning for the second phase of the library's expansion -- a $2-million,  13,656-square-foot addition anchored by a 340-seat auditorium -- will continue  while construction begins on the first project, Hayden said.  </P> <P> Before the second phase is built, commissioners will consider new parking. The  expansion's third phase calls for Talbert Avenue to be realigned and widened.  </P> <P> However, the land planned for the Talbert realignment was recently discovered  to be tainted with high levels of methane, which may preclude the city's  building a road over it.

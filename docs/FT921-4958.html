			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Jitters fuel trading AN ATTACK of political jitters injected life into the UK money market yesterday, and rates firmed across the spectrum. A leaked NOP opinion poll showing the opposition Labour party with a five-point lead in 50 marginal seats kindled fears that the Conservative government could be toppled in the general election, expected on April 9. A fall in sterling against the D-mark increased the nervousness, arousing fears that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, may no longer have room to cut interest rates without bringing sterling under pressure. A survey of traders on Wednesday had found eight out of ten still expecting a near-term cut, with 44 per cent of those believing it would come between Budget day on March 10 and a likely election announcement on March 16. Yesterday, however, that optimism seemed to be crumbling, as operators took back their money in all periods. The key three-month interbank rate, often a pointer towards future base rates, moved up to 10 1/2 -10 3/8 per cent, having climbed gradually from around 10 1/4 per cent two weeks ago. The six-month rate moved out to 10 7/16 -10 3/8 from 10 5/16 -10 3/16 , and the 12-month rate climbed  3/16 to 10 7/16 -10 5/16 . The March short sterling contract dropped four basis points to 89.59, and June fell to 89.79 from 89.88. Overnight rates started around 10 5/8 -10 1/2 but firmed after the Bank of England forecast the daily shortage at Pounds 500m, but purchased only Pounds 10m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent at midday, having not operated in the early round. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 550m, and the Bank purchased Pounds 47m of band 1 treasury bills and Pounds 138m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 180m took the total for the day to only Pounds 375m. The overnight rate climbed as a result to 11 1/2 -11 per cent. German call money rates eased slightly, but the Bundesbank seemed determined to keep them above 9.60 per cent. Most trade was at 9.60 per cent rather than Wednesday's 9.65. Dealers said the Bundesbank was at a delicate stage in pay negotiations, and hit by inflation fears, but could not raise interest rates because of foreign pressure. It was therefore keeping market rates tight through its open market operations.</p>

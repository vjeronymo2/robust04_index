			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Italian deficit keeps investors at bay - International Italian bonds took a pounding last week on fears over Italy's swelling budget deficit. And until Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi makes a clear commitment to cutting the country's debt, investor confidence is unlikely to return in a hurry. The first indications of his government's fiscal stance are likely to be unveiled within the next six weeks, when it presents its economic and financial programme to parliament, setting the guidelines for budgetary policies for the next three years. The document was to have been presented at the end of May, but was delayed as the government had only taken office a month earlier. Moreover, just as the programme was ready for publication, the country's constitutional court surprised policy-makers with a ruling requiring the state-run pensions system to pay L30,000bn compensation for under-payment of pensions since 1983. This fuelled fears that Italy would be unable to meet this year's L144,000bn deficit target, which is already set to overshoot by L15,000bn, without a supplementary budget to cut the shortfall. 'They have to revise their whole fiscal outlook as a result of the ruling,' said Mr Jose Luis Alzola, economist at Salomon Brothers, who expects the three-year plan to be announced by mid-July. While the impact of the pension ruling on this year's funding may be moderate - if only because the government may spread payments over the next few years - it has served to highlight the market's unease over Italy's deficit outlook. 'After the euphoria following the elections, the market was reminded that the key issue remains the budget deficit and the debt outlook,' said Mr Graham McDevitt bond strategist at market analysts IDEA. 'The pension ruling magnified those risks.' Salomon Brothers' world government bond index shows Italian government bonds fell by 1.9 per cent last week, the sharpest losses in Europe. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent government bond due April 2004 had jumped to 11.03 per cent by Friday afternoon, from 9.93 per cent a week earlier. Its yield spread over German bonds widened to 388 basis points on Friday from 310 a week earlier. In late April the spread had narrowed to around 250 basis points. 'That level reflected an overshoot - there was too much euphoria after the elections without real news on the budget front,' says Mr Alzola. However, he feels that the market has now 'over-reacted on the negative side' and sees little reason for further substantial spread widening. On the other hand, 'I don't think we will see a significant narrowing of the spreads until the economic plan is released and restrictive fiscal measures are implemented,' he says. Having been elected on the promise of eventual tax cuts, Mr Berlusconi is likely to focus on spending cuts, rather than tax increases, to trim the deficit. And what better place to start than the state pensions system, which, before the ruling, was set to cost the government around 14 per cent of GDP this year? 'Painful measures are likely to be needed, as well as a shift towards private pension funds, so as to curb the increase in expenditure,' says Mr Colin Warren, European economist at HILFE, a political and economic research house in London. The government last week announced plans to promote the development of private pension funds. There are also plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 60 for women. 'If they convince the market that they're serious about cutting spending, for instance on pensions, the market could reward them with lower yields - which in turn could lower the interest burden on their debt,' says Mr Alzola. But a far-reaching pension reform will take considerable time to implement, and some observers are arguing for indirect tax increases to boost revenue in the short term. 'An increase in indirect taxes . . . would have the greatest immediate effect,' argues Mr Warren at HILFE. However, higher indirect taxes could threaten the inflation outlook, further depressing bonds. Dealers will be closely watching this week's release of June CPI data which may see the year-on-year inflation rate fall below 4 per cent for the first time this year. In its budget plan, the government is also expected to address the problem of refinancing next year's masses of maturing debt. Around L295,000bn of government debt matures next year, of which some L190,000bn is long-term. In comparison, this year has seen redemptions of L80,000bn. The government was hoping to pre-fund some of this refinancing this year, but given the current condition of the bond market, 'it is doubtful they will be over-funding this year,' said one dealer.</p>

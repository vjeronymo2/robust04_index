			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 2 May (PANA) -- Bujumbura is once again  filled by bird songs and no gun shot has been heard in the last  two days, not even in the district of Kamenge, north of the  capital, the main battlefield between the populations of the  majority Hutu ethnic group and the Tutsi-dominated Army.  According to witnesses, public and private transporters resumed  operations Monday [2 May], even if the schools, markets,  hospitals and health centres of the northern outskirts of  Bujumbura remained closed (following the outbeak of the crisis  in October 1993).    The Armed Forces during last week moved the populace to  search all the houses of the Kamenge District and seized all the  weapons illegally held by its inhabitants. No detail has been  given as for the number of weapons found. Meanwhile, the death  toll from the disturbances in the district has also not been  specified, perhaps because of the large numbers killed on both  sides. Observers have said, however, that 14 anti-tank rockets,  all kinds of pistols, AK-47s and automatic rifles were seized.  According to official figures, about 10,000 people affected by  the police search were held for 24 hours, in poor conditions, in  the capital's large "Prince Louis Rwagasore" Stadium of the  capital last week.    The new head of state, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, visited  them  on Saturday before they were released.</p>

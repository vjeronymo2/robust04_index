			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LONDON'S robusta coffee and cocoa futures closed easier but mostly off the day's lows in quiet trade. Dealers said the COFFEE price fall, which left the January position Dollars 8 down at Dollars 916 a tonne, was influenced by profit-taking following Tuesday's Dollars 33 rise. They said business was quiet and the market needed to consolidate around these levels. Profit-taking was also a factor in the COCOA market fall, dealers said. The March position closed at Pounds 718 a tonne, down Pounds 6 on the day. One dealer said the market had broken through chart points in Tuesday's currency-inspired rally but had not managed to stay at those levels. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices moved irregularly in the afternoon as Comex opened strongly then fell back and sterling surged, and then eased, against the dollar, traders said. Fears of a Chilean miners' strike waned after union leaders said they were encouraged by their government's response to calls for talks on privatisation of the industry. Compiled from Reuters</p>

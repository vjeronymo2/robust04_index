			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the State </F> Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances:  "Budget as Mirror of Russian Economy. Neither Government Nor  Parliament Prevents It From Being Examined More Frequently"]    [Text] After a long and stormy session on 15 April the  State Duma adopted the draft budget submitted by the government  as a basis and proposed that the government make changes to the  basic features of the document within two weeks and submit it  for first-reading examination by the Duma.    The difficulty and complexity of the debate clearly showed  how vulnerable the current budget is to criticism. Undoubtedly  it was better-prepared than previous ones, the methods used to  draw it up had changed, there were virtually no secret or hidden  articles, the foreign economic activity section had been  fundamentally altered, and it proposed for the first time  introducing a system of transfer payments [transferty] to  support needy Federation components. The budget is very  realistic and describes the difficult position of the Russian  economy without embellishment. It retains the best features of  the financial stabilization program that was begun in 1993 and  makes it possible to reduce the inflation rate to 9-10 percent a  month. Adoption of the budget will make it possible to finance  a whole host of highly important programs that are being put off  owing to the lack of a budget. Payments on domestic debt -- on  commodity bonds, checks, and targeted deposits -- will increase  sharply. And it is not even a question of erroneous figures,  although there are some of those. There are some fundamental  grounds for concern.    The most important problem is the delay in the submission  [predostavleniye] of the budget for a year and the lack of a  number of fundamental decisions on fiscal and customs policy.  We are well aware of the consequences that this delay will  have. Two options could operate in the future -- either the  scrupulous work on the 1994 budget (during which it will be  necessary to make substantial changes to tax and budget  legislation) will continue, or work on the budget will be  concluded as quickly as possible and attention turned to  implementing fiscal and customs reform and to preparing the 1995  budget on time. Both of these things cannot be done at the same  time. If the first option is followed, the annual budget will  be adopted only late in the fall and Russia will go into 1995,  once again, without a budget. In the second instance we would  lose a little as regards the current budget, but we would  prepare properly for 1995.    The budget's clear deficiencies include clearly overstated  levels of tax revenue, traditionally understated expenditure on  education, health care, science, culture, and social welfare,  huge amounts of administrative expenditure, and the retention of  many unjustified tax and customs concessions. The budget was  drawn up on the basis of a proposal on the need to repeal many  articles of laws and paragraphs of edicts and decrees that are  leading to increased spending. These laws, edicts, and decrees  should now be altered or suspended. In order to imagine how  unwieldy this work will be, we need only mention that it was  initially proposed to alter almost 100 documents involving  around 90 trillion [rubles] in expenditure.    The two weeks spent on finalization were not wasted by the  government. Numerous additional materials and calculations  envisaged by the law on the foundations of the budgetary system  and the budgetary process were sent to parliament. Draft  amendments have been made to existing legislation. Individual  features of the budget have been altered. The proposed amounts  of revenue from excise duties on consumer goods have been  lowered. The government has recognized that it is impossible to  levy a 35-percent excise duty on machines produced. By  repealing concessions and doing a better job of collecting taxes  it is planned to increase revenue from import-export duties by  R2.4 trillion and to increase targeted levies for the provision  of financial aid to the agro-industrial complex and the coal  industry by R1.1 trillion. It is additionally planned to obtain  R1 trillion from privatization and R1 trillion from oil excise  duties.    More than R9 trillion will additionally be channeled into  agriculture, of which R2.4 trillion will be used for capital  investment in targeted programs such as "Baby Food," "Sugar,"  and so forth; and it is planned to allocate R5.6 trillion for  the creation of federal and regional food funds. The principle  of food being purchased at home rather than abroad will finally  be laid down. Spending on television, radio broadcasting,  support for the periodical press, health care, and youth policy  will be increased.    But even the government-amended version of the budget  conceals major problems. The most obvious is the increase in  the budget deficit. Income has increased by R3.8 trillion,  spending by R10.2 trillion, and the deficit by R6.4 trillion to  stand at R68.8 trillion (9.5 percent of GDP). This is a huge  figure. The deficit is far more than R1,000 per day for  everyone in the country, including the old and infants. The  sources used to fund it are mainly inflationary -- Central Bank  credits of R44.4 trillion and R19.3 trillion in foreign loans.    Nonetheless, the proposal from the "Yabloko" faction to  increase the deficit to 43-45 percent of spending is a powerful  one. With the planned level of income this would come to more  than R93 trillion. There is no way to fund this deficit apart  from bank loans, and this means that instead of last year's R10  trillion, we would have to borrow R70 trillion from the Central  Bank this year. There would be another cascade of worthless bank  notes without any backing whatsoever, and prices would skyrocket.    The purposes for which it is proposed to use the additional  funds are very attractive -- structural changes to the economy  and increased financial support for the regions. But are they  feasible? Suppose the state once again, as in the days of old,  were to distribute another R20 trillion in capital investment to  "priority" and "key" sectors -- what then? Would we have to  send out armed men to guard every ruble? Remember the  archetypal example of the "GAZ" Plant, which used its tax  concessions not for investment but to buy vouchers. With  inflation and with salaries constantly having to be paid, who  will voluntarily invest money if there is little chance of  making a profit?    The territories undoubtedly need help. And it is correct if  we are pursuing a policy based on the principle of "take from  whoever has anything left and give to those who shout loudest."  The Finance Ministry wants to switch to transfer payments  worked out on the basis of a single method. Except that there  is one coefficient that would be out of place. In order to  determine whether a region needs subsidies, it will now be  necessary to compare per capita income in the given territory  with Russia as a whole, and if the territory figure is higher  than the Russian figure the region will get no subsidies. But  prevailing price levels are not taken into account. For  instance, if per capita income is R200,000 in Russia as a whole,  R199,000 in Krasnodar Kray, and R201,000 in Krasnoyarsk Kray,  then Krasnodar Kray will get the money -- and the fact that  budget expenditure should objectively be higher in the North  will not be taken into account.    The State Duma committees' conclusion about the draft budget  proposes retaining at last year's level the proportion of funds  transferred from federal budget funds to territories' budgets,  as well as the proportion of taxes and imposts retained by  Federation component budgets. At first glance this looks right,  but there are serious objections. First, the budget simply does  not have this money. Second, if funds are sought by increasing  the budget deficit, price growth will just "eat up" the entire  benefit of the extra money. Third, we cannot retain last year's  unfair distribution system, whereby funds were collected from a  handful of industrial territories and distributed among most of  the other Federation components.    We need to make substantial amendments to both the revenue  and expenditure sides of the budget. The main thing in our  further work on revenue is to prepare for tax reform. To my  mind, the approach should be extremely simple. First and  foremost, we need to abolish existing individual concessions --  this mainly applies to exports of goods. We need to step up tax  organs' work in collecting taxes -- above all, in the trading  sphere and those sectors of the economy where "black cash" (that  is, money that is unaccounted-for) traditionally looms large.  Distributing taxes equally among all payers will make it  possible to lower tax rates. It is time to get rid completely of  the taxation of profits used for investment. We can only  welcome the government's resolute steps in respect of the state  monopoly on liquor and tobacco products. It is time to increase  tax on individuals' excess income and, on the other hand, to  restore the former tax-exempt status of certain amounts of  material aid, prizes, and gifts. Nor should concessionary  travel be taxable. How are we to explain to pensioners that  they should pay out almost their entire pension in taxation on  free travel?    Serious changes are also needed on the expenditure side of  the budget. First and foremost, we need a careful and planned  reduction in spending on the bloated administrative apparatus --  there are some clearly unrealistic targets [obyekty] in the  investment section as well. On the other hand, the problem of  reforming the wages system has not been resolved and there is no  funding for a whole host of highly important social and cultural  projects. The Army and defense enterprises also need support.</p>

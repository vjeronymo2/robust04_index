			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: More dollar nerves THE CONTINUING uncertainty over the dollar is certain to dominate the markets again this week, writes James Blitz. Analysts believe that last week's good indicators for US industrial production and money supply make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at their Federal Open Markets Committee tomorrow. But the market will need to see extremely good figures for the US trade balance on Wednesday if it is to invest in dollars. Traders may still be influenced by last week's comments from Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, who said that Washington wants to see a strong yen. Those comments brought the US currency below Y130 last week. There is little doubt that if the dollar dips below Y129 or DM1.60 there will be another furious bout of selling. However, the outlook for Japan is not all that strong either. Yen traders will focus on the Bank of Japan's April money supply figures, due out on Wednesday at the earliest, as a key to whether the economy is about to recover. Analysts believe that the market is likely to be disappointed, with monthly growth falling back to 1.6 per cent after being at 1.8 per cent last month. If that is the case, it will further worry those who believe that the Japanese economy is slowing down too much. In Europe, attention will focus on whether the French franc and sterling can continue their onslaught against the D-Mark and breach their central rates against the German currency. With a Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, threatening yet another rate hike, the markets are likely to give the D-Mark the benefit of the doubt for the time being.</p>

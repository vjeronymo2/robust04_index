			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / New phase in IRA campaign THE BOMB attack on Staples Corner in north London, one of Britain's busiest road junctions, marks a new phase in the IRA's campaign against the capital's transport system, Richard Tomkins writes. Earlier attacks have involved relatively small devices on the London Underground or at main British Rail stations. Hitting a key element of the trunk road network disrupts the journeys of a much wider cross-section of the public, including many business and industrial road users. The sheer size of the explosion means disruption not just for hours or days, but for weeks and possibly months. The explosion took place at the point where the M1 motorway and A5 trunk road, two of the main traffic arteries to the north, disgorge their traffic into the London road system. As well as blowing a crater in the Staples Corner roundabout, the force of the explosion went upwards and stripped concrete off the reinforced box-girder bridge carrying the A5 over the junction. Highway engineers believe it may be possible to repair the bridge by recladding it with concrete, but are unlikely to reach a final verdict on the feasibility of this until after Easter. Meanwhile, the bridge and half the roundabout remain closed and traffic congestion is severe. The difficulty in preventing a recurrence is that access to roads is even more open than it is to the railways and the Tube. The only grounds for suspicion may be that a vehicle is unlawfully parked. But as Scotland Yard said: 'If we asked people to report every sighting of an illegally parked vehicle, we would end up in a state of chaos.'</p>

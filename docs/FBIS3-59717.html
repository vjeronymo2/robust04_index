			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Sumitomo Chemical Co. (Mr. Teruo Kosai, president)  will full fledge enter into the bio-agricultural chemical field  that will make full use of biotechnology. As a first shot, a  bio-agricultural chemical that will suppress the growth of white  flies will start selling in the United States during l994 and in  Japan, it is intended to start its sale possibly as early as  1997. At this point, with the background of the consumers safety  goal in mind, bio-agricultural chemicals other than chemically  synthesized agricultural chemicals are being actively developed  especially in countries centering Europe. In Japan, sex  pheromones and insecticides using natural enemy have been  partially introduced, but in the future, the company will  aggressively form a new agricultural chemical market in the  field of bio-agricultiural chemicals that makes use of  biotechnology.    The new bio-agricultural chemical to be marketed will act as  prevention and removal of white flies by suppressing its growth  by preventing skin shedding. Insects have hormones that enhances  skin shedding and hormones that prevent shedding. With the new  bio-agricultural chemical, the suppressing hormone is extracted  and artificially synthesized. The scheme is to use this hormone  to interfere in the white flies skin shedding.    The characteristics of the method is that unlike previously  used insecticides which possesses powerful poison, it removes  only designated harmful insects. Also, it is claimed that  because it applies to its mode of life, the insects will not  develop immunity as it does towards insecticides so there is no  worry about losing its effectiveness.    White flies will proliferate by centering around green house  cultivated plants such as green vegetables and tomatoes and also  to the outdoor fields. It is a world wide problem and recently,  many insecticides have lost its effectiveness due to immunity.    Sumitomo Chemical Co. has already registered in South Africa  and in parts of the Middle and Near Eastern countries where they  have started test marketing. Full fledge marketing will start as  soon as a permit is obtained from the United States in 1994.  Also, presently, application is being submitted in Japan and if  all goes well, marketing will be possible in l997.    Looking at the bio-agricultural chemical market world wide,  it is said that it comprises about 5&percnt;of the total  agricultural  chemicals, but by the year 2005, it should expand to about 12 to  30&percnt;. Domestically, bio-agricultural chemicals are being  developed such as sex pheromones that can disturb insect  copulation and others that use natural enemy to remove notorious  insects. At the present, bio-agricultural chemicals have not  been accepted widely due to regulations over conditions of  usage, and from the users side, there still exists the image gap  between insecticides and the bio-chemicals.</p>

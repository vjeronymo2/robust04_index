			<p>BFN     [Text] Our guest today is the Cameroonian communications  minister and government spokesman, Augustin Kontchou. For some  10 days now, Cameroon has been attempting to get the support of  the international community on its border dispute with Nigeria.  Seven delegations are currently touring the world in an effort  to persuade their partners that the Bakassi Peninsula claimed by  Nigeria belongs to Cameroon.    Augustin Kontchou has just ended his tour of Europe, and  Ghislaine Dupont asked him first if he felt like he had been  heard and understood:    [Begin recording] [Kontchou] We are convinced that we were  understood and we are returning home pleased with the result.  In France, Germany, and Belgium, we heard the same thing:  First, European governments supports the stand of the European  Union which called on both parties to settle their dispute in  accordance with international law -- that is, in the framework  of a respect for borders lawfully established -- to pull out  their troops in accordance with the principles previously  outlined. Everywhere we were told: Since Cameroon is within its  rights we will support it.    [Dupont] Cameroon has just turned to the International Court  of Justice in The Hague. What are the main arguments supporting  your case?    [Kontchou] Our arguments are unassailable, they are based on  historical and legal factors. Historically, Cameroon borders  were acknowledged by colonial powers; Cameroon was later placed  under UN mandate with the same borders. The UN organized a  referendum in the English-speaking part of Cameroon in 1961, to  let the local people decide for themselves either to join the  French-speaking Cameroon independent at the time, or Nigeria,  which was independent too. The people of this Bakassi region  decided to join Cameroon as other English-speaking people did  too. Later, even before that [as heard] the 1954 Nigerian law  defining the Nigerian borders placed Bakassi within Cameroon.    Until 1992, that is until very recently, Nigerian maps  placed  Bakassi within Cameroon. There has been a series of statements,  of agreements between Nigerian and Cameroonian authorities since  1960. They related to various bilateral border issues but none  ever questioned the border in the Bakassi region. We have legal  and historical arguments which Nigeria does not possess.  Nigeria bases its position on some texts dating back to 1906  and before, therefore we cannot see on which legal base Nigeria  could pretend to obtain sovereignty.    [Dupont] What is the current military situation in Bakassi?    [Kontchou] The front is quiet, but I must tell you that this  quietness is extremely fragile. Everyday detailed reports tell  us that the Nigerian side is strengthening, is bringing in more  troops and more equipment. Therefore, things might quickly get  out of hand.    [Dupont] Nigeria considered the arrival of 15 French  paratroopers in Cameroon a provocation. Was it Cameroon which  called on France?    [Kontchou] Nigeria must know that Cameroon is a sovereign  country and that it is entitled to choose its allies. It is not  for Nigeria to choose Cameroon's allies. It is not for Nigeria  to attack us and then decide who should be our ally after  attacking us in the first place. We know that the Nigerians,  who are our neighbors, have a defense policy and know who our  allies are. If they attack us they know perfectly well in what  predicament they get involved.    [Dupont] So it was Cameroon which called on its ally,  France?    [Kontchou] Yes, it was the Cameroonian Government which  called on France. The defense agreement between Cameroon and  France states that if France is attacked, Cameroon should come  to France's rescue, if Cameroon is attacked the opposite  applies, namely France should come to Cameroon's rescue. In  this particular case Cameroon is facing aggression and Cameroon  decided to call for the implementation of its defense agreement  with France.    [Dupont] France wishes to see a peaceful, a diplomatic  settlement to this dispute. Do you believe that France will  continue its support as firmly if war were to break out between  Nigeria and Cameroon?    [Kontchou] We fully understand France. No one likes to wage  war, France has major interests in both Cameroon and Nigeria, we  believe that France would not like to see its interests  sacrificed in one country or another, therefore France is in a  good position to find a negotiated settlement between both  parties. However, we in Cameroon have chosen the same solution  as France. Since we are not ready to abandon a single square  inch of our territory to anyone, if Nigeria wants to impose war  on us, what can we do?    [Dupont] In this case would it not be a case of David  fighting Goliath?    [Kontchou] In any case not a single square inch of  Cameroonian soil will be relinquished to a foreign power as long  as there is a single Cameroonian alive. This is a fact. So, if  Nigeria forces war on us we will wage a war we do not want. We  will then rely on our Armed Forces, we will rely on our people  which is closely united to these armed forces, but we will also  rely on our allies and mainly on France. We are convinced that  in this case, if war is forced upon us, France will lend us its  support till the very end. [end recording]</p>

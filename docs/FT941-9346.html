			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: When less means more on the US skyways - The big carriers are struggling against small low-cost airlines Which is the most profitable airline in the US? The mighty United Airlines, the nation's biggest carrier in terms of passenger miles flown? American Airlines, relegated this year to the number two slot? Delta Air Lines, still at number three? The answer is none of the above. All three of the biggest airlines reported yet another year of heavy losses, while by far the largest profits came, once again, from Southwest Airlines, the relatively small, Texas-based carrier transforming the US air travel market with its low-cost, no-frills services. The US airline industry, at least as represented by the big carriers, is still an industry in crisis. The fundamental problem is that too many seats are chasing too few passengers. The only airlines doing well are those with costs so low they can offer cheap fares and still make a profit - and that means airlines such as South-west. Still, the last year has not been quite as disastrous as the preceding three for the larger carriers. In the third quarter, traditionally the strongest because it includes the busy summer holiday season, most airlines managed to creep back into profit. The fourth-quarter figures, though showing most of the airlines back in loss, show the same improving trend, too. Admittedly, the improvement may not be evident in the results from American, Delta and Continental. However, in each of these cases there were special factors. American suffered a five-day strike by its flight attendants that wiped an estimated Dollars 190m from after-tax income; Delta took a pre-tax charge of Dollars 112.3m for the early retirement of nearly 1,500 workers; and the comparison at Continental has little meaning because the airline emerged from bankruptcy protection as a new company in April 1993. With or without these special factors, all the big airlines performed significantly better in 1993 than in the year before. Partly, this reflected efforts to get costs down to a level nearer the small carriers'. They shed thousands of jobs, and tried, with varying success, to get more efficient working practices out of their remaining employees. They also reduced capacity, retiring older aircraft and deferring delivery of new ones, and dropped some loss-making routes. With those efforts continuing into the current year, and the economy still showing modest growth, stock market analysts are expecting a further improvement in the figures for 1994. In fact, they believe the industry could make its first profit since the economic boom of the late 1980s, with net income of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn for the full year. Even so, the celebrations are decidedly muted. The reason is the big carriers are still far from delivering an acceptable profit margin, and profound uncertainties remain to be resolved before they do so. The biggest of these is the likelihood that domestic fares will plunge still lower, as the large carriers copy small ones by setting up low-cost, no-frills subsidiaries to handle short-haul flights. United's employees have already agreed to the company's plan to set up a low-cost airline-within-an-airline in exchange for a controlling stake in the company's equity. Delta is awaiting the results of an internal review which will decide whether it follows the same route. The largely non-union Continental is a step ahead of both with its low-cost operation nicknamed CALite offering 'Peanuts Fares' on many routes. A telling sign of the downward pressure on fares came when USAir recently responded to severe price competition from Continental and Southwest by slashing fares on hundreds of routes in the eastern US by up to 50 per cent. This was not just a special promotional offer hedged about with conditions and restrictions: the cuts applied to business fares as well as leisure fares, and will last indefinitely. The picture is not entirely gloomy. Airline capacity is lower this year, and passenger numbers should rise. However, with the competitive pressures on fares showing no signs of easing, the big carriers are caught in a cycle where each cost-saving is needed to deliver the next fare cut instead of flowing through into a profits recovery. 'Sure, I think there will be some spells of 12 to 18 months where we see some nice numbers,' says Mr Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank. 'But can I foresee a period of five or six years of decent profits? Not for the balance of the decade.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US AIRLINES - THE LONG HAUL BACK (excluding one-time charges for changes in accounting rules)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           4th qtr           Year             Revenue                         (dollars m)      (dollars m)        passenger                                                             miles (bn)                         1993     1992    1993     1992    1993     199  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- United Airlines          (64)    (224)    (50)    (417)    101       93 American Airlines 1*    (253)    (200)   (110)    (475)     97       97 Delta Air Lines         (141)    (144)   (226)    (601)     83       81 Northwest Airlines        11     (695)   (115)    (971)     58       59 Continental Airlines 2*  (27)     (14)    (36)    (125)     42       43 US Air                  (117)    (254)   (349)    (601)     35       35 Trans World Airlines 3*  n/a     (222)    n/a     (318)     23       29 Southwest Airlines        38       27     154       97      19       14 America West              10      (18)     37     (132)     11       12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes 1* Figures for AMR Corp       2* Emerged from bankruptcy 28 April 1993.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Debt Concerns"] </F>   [Text] The soaring growth of Brazil's public debt is a  source of concern. This time, however, the long-standing  distortions and shortcomings of public administration are not  the main cause of this growth. FOLHA DE SAO PAULO established  on 21 April that skyrocketing interest rates have pushed the  federal debt contracted outside the Central Bank from $43.7  billion in December 1993 to $50.6 billion in March 1994.    High interest rates hold demand in check, but are a heavy  burden for the government. The high profit margin of federal  bonds encourages the inflow of foreign capital, but converting  dollars to cruzeiros for investments in the financial market  also makes the domestic debt grow.    Ever since the Collor Plan failed and the Collor  administration started using high interest rates as the main  tool to counter inflation, there has been an underlying risk  that the growth of public debt could cause instability.    Brazil's monetary policy is once again tied to a delicate  balance. While on one hand soaring inflation is pushing  interest rates up to sustain consumption and prevent hoarding,  the payment of interest rates is increasing the debt and is  fueling inflationary expectations.    After staying high in 1991 and 1992, interest rates fell  significantly in 1993: Real interest rates stood at only 7  percent per year. This decline curbed the rate of expansion of  the debt and allowed the country to start growing again.  Meanwhile, inflation surpassed 35 percent in December 1993.    Interest rates again started going up in recent months,  rekindling the concern over the size of public debt. A very  short-term debt -- mostly in bonds that mature in one month --  growing at an excessively high speed could seriously complicate  the medium-term stabilization process.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wensum declines to 'creditable' Pounds 607,000 The Wensum Company, a USM-quoted designer of corporate clothing and menswear, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 746,000 to Pounds 607,000 in the year to January 25, but declared that this was a creditable performance. The fall would have been steeper but for a decline in net interest payable to Pounds 140,000 (Pounds 216,000). Trading profits of Wensum Clothing, the menswear side, were almost halved at Pounds 261,000 (Pounds 490,000) on turnover of Pounds 4.94m (Pounds 5.33m); for Wensum Corporate, they edged ahead to Pounds 486,000 (Pounds 472,000) on turnover down at Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 3.54m). Earnings emerged at 5.63p (6.62p) per share and directors propose maintaining the final dividend at 2.35p for an unchanged total of 3.5p.</p>

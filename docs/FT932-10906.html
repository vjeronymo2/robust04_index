			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Elf-Sanofi to sell clothing division ELF-SANOFI, the French pharmaceuticals company, plans to sell the ready-to-wear clothing division of Yves Rocher, one of its brand names, to Tessile Miroglio, the Italian textile group, for an undisclosed sum, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The disposal is the latest in a number of deals conducted by Elf-Sanofi, which is controlled by the Elf-Aquitaine oil company, notably its controversial acquisition earlier this year of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion and cosmetics house. The Yves Rocher clothing business, which includes the Claverie and Sym labels, will be merged under Miroglio's ownership to create a company with combined sales of about FFr300m (Dollars 55.5m). Miroglio has significant clothing interests in France, including the Caroline Rohmer business which it acquired six years ago, as well as operations in Spain and Germany.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 111 PROS AND CONS AND ENDING TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> Your May 14 editorial ("Making a Case for Car-Pool Lanes") chastises Orange  County for not enacting a "transit tax" as in neighboring Riverside County.  Orange County voters have twice rejected a sales tax increase, and may reject  Prop. 111 due to specific projects it would fund.  </P> <P> The last I heard, we live in a democracy and it is our prerogative to vote for  or against a measure based on merit.  </P> <P> Car-pool lanes have proved controversial, if not unpopular. Caltrans and the  Orange County Transportation Commission steadfastly refuse to permit an A-B  comparison study of mixed-use and car-pool lanes in such key areas as traffic  efficiency, cost-effectiveness and safety.  </P> <P> Give Orange County resident some credit. We see gridlocked freeways,  comparatively empty car-pool lanes, and plenty of self-serving statistics.  </P> <P> A no vote on Prop. 111 will send a message to the transportation mavens that  "enough is enough."  </P> <P> RICHARD DEIGHT  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P></p>

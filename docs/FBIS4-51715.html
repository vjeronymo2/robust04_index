			<p>BFN     [Text] The Bank of Thailand has reported that border trade  between Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic in the  first quarter of 1994 recorded a sharp and continuing increase  when compared with the same period the previous year, with a  combined total trade value of 1,907.3 million baht, in which  Thailand enjoyed a 790.1 million baht trade surplus.    Thai exports to Laos from January to March this year totaled  1,348.7 million baht in value, representing a 50 percent  increase over the 895.7 million baht recorded during the same  period last year. Of the Thai exports, 33.6 percent were  consumer products, including automobiles, motorcycles,  electrical appliances, shoes, and dairy products. Other goods  exported included construction materials and machinery.    During the same period Thailand imported 558.6 million baht  worth of goods from Laos, an increase of 65.9 percent over last  year. Of the imports from Laos, 85.4 percent was processed  wood. Timber imports from Laos increased significantly this  year due to the improved export quotas set by the Lao Government  and the timber extracted before the beginning of the  construction project of the Nam Theun Dam in Khammouane  Province, which was imported through the border checkpoint of  Nakhon Phanom Province.</p>

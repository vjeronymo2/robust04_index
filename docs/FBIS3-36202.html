The delegation included deputy chairman of the Council of  the  Federation, the upper house of the new parliament, Ramazan  Abdulatipov, Deputies Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, Sergey Baburin,  Sergey Glotov, Aleksandr Dzasokhov and Vladimir Podoprigora.    Russia's admittance to the Council of Europe should be  preceded by visits to Russia of the heads of some of its  committees and council leaders, Ambartsumov said. He said the  visit to France aimed at restoring ties between the Russian  parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly which have been  suspended after the 1993 October revolt in Moscow. "We think  this goal was achieved," he added.    Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, the  members of the delegation said that Russia's admittance to the  Council of Europe in being artificially delayed, which signifies  that Western parliamentarians are concerned about the situation  in Russia.    Abdulatipov stressed that the visit "was a good start of  coordinated activities of both houses of the Federal Assembly."  He said the parliament should set up a permanent delegation of  about 18 people in the interests of future visits. The  delegation should include representatives of all factions of the  parliament.</p>

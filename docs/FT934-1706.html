			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Conventional strategic wisdom takes a knock Forget what you learned at business school or from an executive training programme about the supremacy of those cornerstones of strategy: market share and 'value chain' analysis. They are still relevant, but their character is being altered, and their significance undermined, by the changing nature of industrial competition. This is the controversial thesis of one of the most influential strategy professors in the US, C. K. Prahalad of the University of Michigan. Prahalad teaches and consults for a large number of top companies around the world. So his views are likely to affect how at least some of them behave in the marketplace. To managers brought up on the best-known writings of the Boston Consulting Group and Harvard's Michael Porter, Prahalad's prescription for more effective competitive analysis reads like a revolutionary tract. Instead of being obsessed with their brand and market shares in finished products, he says, manufacturers should become far more concerned with their share of the market in key 'modules' within those products - what he calls, confusingly, 'core products'. Just as trends in the cotton industry helped to spark the revolutionary fervour of Marx and Engels, it is those in the electronics and motor industries that have now triggered Prahalad's. He unveiled his thesis to a packed room of executives and academics at a recent Strategic Management Society conference. Taking video cassette recorders as his first example, he showed that when Matsushita and its JVC offshoot held only a 24 per cent brand share of the world market, they had a 42 per cent share of total production, and more than 65 per cent of the 'core product' within a VCR - its recording head and the other key sub-assemblies which surround it. Among a long list of similar examples, other speakers cited the growing world market share of specialist suppliers of key modules such as complete engine pistons. The strategic importance of the trend towards 'core products' lies partly in their characteristics, says Prahalad. Most are technology and investment-intensive, and therefore require increasingly large-scale development resources - a factor which is being reinforced by the accelerating 'time-to-market' (development cycle) of the finished products for which they are destined. Together, both these tendencies are forcing companies to narrow still further their range of specialised 'core products', and to outsource more and more of them. In order to surround their own 'core products' by the most innovative components and sub-assemblies on the market, they have to buy not only from their traditional suppliers, but also from their competitors. Thus many Japanese and other Asian electronics companies buy compact disc mechanisms and lasers from Sony, which has a 60 per cent world share in them. By the same token, in order for Sony to create the necessary scale of development - and, in some cases, manufacture - it has to sell to its rivals. As Prahalad puts it, 'competitors become one more distribution channel for one's core technologies'. When a company's rivals also start acting as its suppliers and customers in this way, things get very confusing for its managers. Especially perplexing is how to manage all the internal and external dynamics of these links. A good start, says Prahalad, is to recognise the importance of the technology trade balance between two companies - which in the case of multinationals 'is increasingly more important than that between countries'. This recognition, in turn, underlines the vital importance of developing the company's core technology and its other 'core competencies', such as the managerial skills required to operate in fast-moving markets and within a network of partners. Despite the growing competitive importance of 'core products' and the competences which underpin them, Prahalad complains that 80 per cent of managerial attention and 99 per cent of academic literature on strategy is still devoted either to mundane manoeuvring for market share, or to the achievement of better price performance between low-margin finished products. 'Yet such measures are becoming less and less relevant as a way of measuring market power, influence over standards, and the creation of new businesses', he argues. 'It's like focusing only on today's skirmishes and forgetting the full-blooded war tomorrow'. Apart from paying more attention to their share of 'core products', Prahalad says companies should cease to be preoccupied with their degree of vertical integration and their own 'value chain' - their various value-creating activities, such as production, marketing and service. Instead they should pay more attention to their ability to create 'virtual integration' by allying with, and purchasing from, competitors. Rather than analysing competitiveness purely on the basis of individual companies, Prahalad also argues that managers - and their attendant consultants and academics - should realise that the most relevant unit of analysis in a growing number of industries is becoming what he calls 'open clusters': shifting networks of companies which form supply relationships and other types of collaborative arrangement. This must, by definition, be an overstatement: the competitiveness of individual companies remains vital, even in an era of what Prahalad calls 'inter-cluster competition' - as between Matsushita and Sony/Philips in compact disc players, for instance, or Intel versus Motorola in computers. Allowing for such exaggeration, Prahalad's revisionism is correct - as it is on market share.</p>

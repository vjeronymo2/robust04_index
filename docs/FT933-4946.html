			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Yeltsin's generals fear leading phantom army RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin made the remarkable promise, while visiting army units in the Moscow region last week, that he would spend one day a month 'working with the military'. It was a promise born of necessity, and of fear. The Russian military faces a series of structural crises which any armed force would find agonising to absorb. It is suffering a dramatic loss of prestige and power: plunging recruitment; wars on and within new frontiers; a worsening housing shortage; rock-bottom pay; the absence of any military doctrine; an inability to train because of lack of fuel, ammunition and equipment; disintegrating discipline; attacks on its property and threats to the bases it still tries to hold from the Baltics to Baikanur. It is a tribute to the officer corps, and to the stolidity of the Russian recruits, that this army has remained quiescent, with Colonel Stanislav Terekhov's national-communist Union of Officers still apparently a minority cause. But can it take much more without becoming dangerous? Mr Yeltsin, and Marshal Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, heard these grumbles when they toured the elite Taman division (whose soldiers defended Mr Yeltsin's parliament during the August 1991 coup). Mr Yeltsin spoke about difficult times not spoiling the capacity of the Russian army to respond to any and all challenges, but it was no more than words. An army which numbered 4m five years ago is now estimated by General Dmitri Volkogonnov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, at about 1.8 - and falling fast. New regulations for the draft exempt the majority of young men - allowing the army to take a mere 300,000 this year. Of the spring draft, only 13 per cent had reported. At its present rate of decline, the army will be below a target strength of 1.5m well before the set date of January 1995. Since the reduction will be an unplanned one, largely among the ranks of conscripts, it will be an army mainly composed of generals, officers and sergeants. The option of using 'contract' soldiers, the harbingers of the professional army which is an official aim, cannot fill the gap in spite of monthly pay of Rbs60,000 - 10 times more than a conscript's earnings. Only a little over 100,000 have signed up this year for all the armed services. The lack of interest is hardly surprising given that, in June, there was no pay at all for the army and, in some bases, electricity and gas were cut off. In addition to the vast demobilisation, and withdrawal from former satellites, the armed forces must adjust to a world at once less and more threatening than that in which they flourished. They have lost a great enemy to their west and found little ones everywhere else, but especially to the south. The North Caucasus - where an arc of ethnically-mixed autonomous states within Russia stretch across the borders of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - are in armed ferment. Increasingly, too, Russian forces are being drawn into conflicts in former Soviet republics, including Tajikistan, Georgia - and Moldova, around the River Dnestr, where they are protecting the interests of Russian speakers. From out of this dramatically swift re-ordering of its character and its duties, the Russian military could hardly be expected to produce a new doctrine - though one is promised. Mr Yeltsin said last week that he wanted it later this year. The general staff talks of a smaller army - but a more professional, more efficient, better equipped force. For the moment, however, they must strive to prevent disintegration - and the politicisation of a traditionally apolitical force.</p>

Last year, Canada's constitutional referendum coincided with the Blue Jays' victory parade, after the baseball players became the first non-US team to win the World Series. In an encore this weekend, they comfortably retained the title ahead of today's general election. Sadly, Blue Jay-induced euphoria bodes ill for the ruling Progressive Conservative party.

She could always take up baseball.</p>

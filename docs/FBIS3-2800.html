			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- On 10 March, Zhang  Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said  that because the British Hong Kong authorities brought the  second part of their constititional reform package to the  Legislative Council, they had completely pulled up the rails for  the through train and once again laid bare their true,  perfidious features. He stressed that after the complete  termination of British colonial rule in Hong Kong on 30 June  1997, the Chinese side certainly will join hands with Hong Kong  people in effecting Hong Kong's smooth transition according to  the Basic Law and the relevant decisions made by the National  People's Congress.    Zhang Junsheng made this statement when answering reporters'  questions folloiwng a news conference about an international  tourist festival in China this year.    Zhang Junsheng pointed out: Now, the British Hong Kong  authorities may submit or pass whatever bills they like, and  this is their business. He reiterated: As there is no  agreement between China and Britain, the three-tiered political  structure set up by the British Hong Kong authorities definitely  will come to an end as a whole, together with the end of the  British colonial rule on 30 June 1997. The Chinese Government  will re-establish the three-tiered councils of the future  special administrative region [SAR] government according to the  Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National People's  Congress. The Chinese side and Hong Kong people will be  completely able to do a good job in arranging Hong Kong's  transition.    Zhang Junsheng said: In the past, the British side proposed  the through-train arrangement, and the Chinese side accepted it.  However, the British side now does not want to see any  convergence or any through train by simply removing the rails  for the through train. This once again has exposed their real  feature of not keeping diplomatic promises. The behavior of the  British side has wasted a lot of our time and energy, and also  has caused a certain amount of concern to Hong Kong people. As  the British side broke its promise and provoked an open debate,  Hong Kong society was split and social shocks were caused;  certain economic losses also were caused.    Zhang Junsheng reiterated that since the British side  refused  cooperation, we should join hands with Hong Kong people and work  more intensively. We will be completely able to properly  arrange Hong Kong's transition and set up the SAR Government.</p>

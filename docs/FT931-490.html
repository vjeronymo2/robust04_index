			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cook accuses Heseltine of misleading Tories NONE OF the 12 pits saved by the coal white paper will be open in a year, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said yesterday, accusing Mr Michael Heseltine of trying to mislead wavering Conservative backbenchers. In last night's debate, in which the government secured a majority of 22, Mr Cook said the trade and industry secretary had selected a number of pits for reprieve purely to get rebel backbenchers 'in the same lobby as himself' without securing markets for 'one extra bag of coal'. He added that what the government was doing was ' . . digging a pit for them to fall into because one year from now, not one of these pits will be open'. He said the 'biggest failure' of the white paper was that it had not accepted any of the trade and industry select committee's recommendations for ending the 'rigged' electricity market. He challenged Mr Heseltine to explain where the market for the 13m tonnes the 12 pits would produce this year would come from, arguing that the coal imports which this production might displace had only been forecast at 9m tonnes and contracts for 2m tonnes of this had already been signed. Faced by Conservative demands to say whether he backed strikes threatened by miners, Mr Cook said the Union of Democratic Mineworkers' ballot on possible action highlighted the extent of the government 'betrayal'. In his opening speech Mr Heseltine said no pit would be closed without the private sector having an opportunity to bid for it and set out fresh details of the circumstances under which subsidies might be offered to private mine operators. He said he would be prepared to offer a subsidy to private-sector organisations which could demonstrate they had found a 'genuinely' additional market for coal. This would exclude offers to supply coal under the core five-year contracts signed yesterday. He rejected suggestions that the tapering subsidies announced last week would be for two years only. The trade and industry secretary indicated they would last until the industry was privatised. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, who voted against the government, said she could not support the government motion because it did not address 'the problem of equality in the market'. She said coal needed 'a fair crack at an equal-opportunity market'. Privatisation ought to get rid of layers of British Coal bureaucracy such as its regional offices 'and hopefully the chairman as well'. Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, who also voted against the government, said that the government had not done all it 'could or should have done to provide a wider market for coal'. Coal privatisation should have taken place before electricity privatisation, he said. Mr Winston Churchill, who abstained on the motion, had earlier said he would not support the government unless it indicated that it was prepared to impose tighter restrictions on output from gas-powered electricity generators. He said the deal giving Electricite de France 'privileged' access to the UK electricity market was 'a scandal of enormous proportions'. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the trade and industry committee, protested that the core recommendations of his committee had been rejected by Mr Heseltine, 'without exception'. Winding up, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said the government was optimistic of obtaining EC approval for its subsidy plans.</p>

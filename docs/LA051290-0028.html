			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RAPIST IN DNA TEST CASE GETS 48 YEARS  </P> <P> A judge sentenced a rapist to 48 years in state prison Friday after a trial in  which a controversial new DNA fingerprinting test was admitted as evidence.  </P> <P> Barrett Littleton, 45, of Pacific Beach received the maximum possible sentence  from Superior Court Judge William Mudd, who also ordered Littleton to pay  $10,000 to a crime victims restitution fund.  </P> <P> "If I had my way . . . I'd never allow you to see the light of day," Mudd said.  "You are that dangerous."  </P> <P> Littleton received consecutive sentences for raping a 25-year-old Pacific Beach  woman twice and forcing her to engage in oral copulation. Also included in the  sentence is a 15-year term for Littleton's three prior sex-related convictions  in the 1970s.  </P> <P> The victim of the September, 1988, attack, who attended Friday's sentencing,  noted that Littleton was convicted of rape in 1972 and told the judge: "I'm not  the first person he's raped. He shows no remorse."  </P> <P> "I think the notion that he could be productive (through rehabilitation) is  ludicrous," she said.  </P> <P> Mudd said a probation report characterized Littleton as arrogant. "You took the  stand and the jury didn't buy it. You, sir, are one extremely dangerous  person," the judge said.  </P> <P> Mudd also noted that, in the probation report, Littleton "admitted a habit of  forcing himself on women."  </P> <P> "He's not capable of meaningful rehabilitation," the judge concluded.  </P> <P> Littleton's lawyer had opposed the introduction of the DNA fingerprinting  evidence, but Mudd allowed it to be heard by the jury after weeks of hearings.  </P> <P> Laboratory tests showed that semen stains had a strong likelihood of being  caused by Littleton, and the jurors that convicted him March 8 said the  evidence provided corroboration to the victim's identification of him.  </P> <P> Littleton's case was the second in San Diego in which such genetic evidence was  used in a trial and the first in which the defense attorney opposed its use.  </P></p>

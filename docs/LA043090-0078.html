			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS GROUP SEEKS RIGHT TO SITE  </P> <P> For the second time in as many months, the City Council has been asked by a  religious organization for permission to congregate at a site zoned for  industrial use.  </P> <P> Lorani Ministry, a nonprofit organization affiliated with Grace Korean Church  of Norwalk, wants to run a youth ministry center for about 120 high school  students from a site on Portal Drive.  </P> <P> Industrial businesses and Los Alamitos Elementary School border the property.  </P> <P> The council held a public hearing on the matter but postponed a final decision  until May 14 so that the city can contact the organization's potential  neighbors.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission had approved the group's request for a conditional use  permit on April 2, but Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi appealed that decision to  the council, saying a five-year lease is too long and that the surrounding  tenants should be notified.  </P> <P> Distinctions were made at the council meeting between Lorani Ministry's request  for a permit and the one made by Grace Church (a different organization) that  the council denied earlier this month.  </P> <P> While Grace Church wanted to establish its headquarters -- complete with  sanctuary and fellowship hall -- on Winners Circle, representatives from Lorani  Ministry said they would only use the Portal Drive property as a gathering  place for the youth ministry program and that church services would not be held  there.

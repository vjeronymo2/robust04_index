How can the results be interpreted? To what degree can these scores be aggregated with nonadapted assessments? What are the best methods for selecting appropriate accommodations and adaptations? How can testing accommodations be related to instructional accommodations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative assessments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When alternative assessments (such as performance assessments or portfolio assessments) are provided for students with disabilities, how can these assessments be compared with conventional assessments? What technical criteria can appropriately be applied to these assessments when used with students with disabilities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Development of assessments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> How can general educational assessments be developed to be more inclusive for students with disabilities? How can problematic items and item formats be identified? How can students with disabilities be adequately represented in test development and validation samples? What are the effects when tests developed for general populations are administered to students with disabilities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Including students with disabilities in general assessments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> How should decisions be made and documented to include or exclude students with disabilities in general educational assessments or alternative assessments?

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD STOCK PRICES PLUNGE BUT OIL SOARS;  </P> <P> MARKETS: COMPANIES SCRAMBLE TO SECURE SUPPLIES AS JAPAN AND THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITY JOIN IN HALTING OIL IMPORTS FROM IRAQ.  </P> <P> Stock prices worldwide plunged, and oil prices rose more than $3 a barrel today  after Japan and the European Community joined other nations in halting imports  of Iraqi oil to protest the invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Tokyo's Nikkei stock market index tumbled 916.23 points, or 3.1%, to 28,599.53  after shedding 729.42 points Friday.  </P> <P> "With Japan so dependent on oil, the bond market is getting battered by the  high prices, and stocks responded in kind today," said a broker at a major  Japanese brokerage. "If I were an investor, I certainly wouldn't be buying  stocks right now."  </P> <P> Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index shed 248.97 points, or 7.42%, to close at  3,107.98.  </P> <P> "I would describe it as panic selling -- selling for the sake of selling," said  James Osborn of Baring Securities.  </P> <P> Crude oil prices leaped more than $3 a barrel in Asia as oil companies  scrambled to secure supplies. U.S. West Texas Intermediate climbed to $27.45 a  barrel for October delivery from $24.38 in the New York futures market Friday.  </P> <P> Gold bullion was quoted at $379.35 an ounce in late Tokyo trading against New  York's $377.60/378.10 close Friday.  </P> <P> In the Singapore stock market, the Straits Times industrial index dropped to  the year's lowest level, losing 96.03 points, or 6.35%, to close at 1,415.02.  </P> <P> "It was all sell, sell. No one was interested in buying," one broker said.  </P> <P> Even the Australian stock market, where oil stocks benefited from the crisis,  finished sharply weaker. The All Ordinaries index ended off 41.4 points at  1,548.3.  </P> <P> In Europe, share prices plummeted on London's Stock Exchange as worries over  increasing oil prices gripped the market.  </P> <P> At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 64.4  points, or 2.9%, to 2,220.2. The session low was 2,202.5. It peaked at 2,253.1.  </P> <P> Volume came to a busy 591.3 million shares compared with 523.4 million shares.  </P></p>

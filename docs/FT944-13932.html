			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: ICF Kaiser heads Czech consortium ICF Kaiser, a US engineering group, is to head an international consortium to prepare project financing for the construction of a Dollars 250m mini-mill for Nova Hut, the Czech steel producer. The consortium, which includes Tippins, a US steel producer, and Samsung Heavy Industries of South Korea, may also take a 49 per cent stake in a joint venture with the state-owned Czech group. A consortium of international banks, possibly including the International Finance Corporation, a private affiliate of the World Bank, will provide Dollars 150m for the project. The remaining Dollars 100m is likely to come in paid-in capital from a joint venture between Nova Hut and the ICF-led consortium, with the Czech company contributing Dollars 51m and the foreign group, Dollars 49m. Mr Adrian Basora, the US ambassador in Prague, called the deal the biggest US greenfield investment to date in the Czech Republic. The mini-mill will provide 200 jobs and produce an annual 1m tonnes of steel. Construction work is expected to start in early 1998. Nova Hut is 67 per cent state owned and employs 17,000. Last year it posted profits of Kcs1.05bn (Dollars 37m) on turnover of Kcs21.32bn, down 50.8 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively on 1992.</p>

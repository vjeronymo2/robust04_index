			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'Labour gainers' rise by more than other big companies THE trend of the past two weeks reasserted itself yesterday. 'Labour gainers' rose by more than the rest of the big companies, as represented by the FT-SE 100 index. 'Conservative gainers' were almost unchanged. Labour gainers are only one point below the level at which the campaign started but Tory gainers are more than six points below their starting level.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Turkey loses taste for fresh action TURKEY, a robust member of the anti-Baghdad coalition in the retaking of Kuwait in 1991, has shown little enthusiasm for the renewed allied military action against President Saddam Hussein in the run-up to yesterday's action. It is concerned at possible Kurdish gains in the north of the country, where Kurds have established a de facto government under the umbrella of allied air deterrence. Ahead of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's planned visit to Syria and the Gulf states next week, where Turkey is forging closer ties, officials have been reluctant to express reservations over US action. However, at the public level there is growing bitterness over the west's and particularly the US's foreign policy priorities at a time when it is sending troops to Somalia, threatening Baghdad with renewed air strikes yet ignoring Serbian atrocities against Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina. One newspaper even suggested the recent US relief mission was to secure Somalia's oil rights. 'The same treatment should be given to Saddam Hussein in Iraq and to Milosevic in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' one commentator wrote in Sabah, the largest Turkish newspaper. Zaman, the Islamic daily, criticised the US for banning Iraq from 'taking military measures on its own soil. This is a violation of Iraq's sovereignty rights'. As long as the danger was confined to the south of Iraq, Turkey voiced diplomatic concern at Iraqi violations of UN ceasefire and other resolutions. But Turkey has suffered economically from Iraq's political and economic isolation, and has long argued that Baghdad should comply as a first step to being accepted back by the international community. However, the news that anti-aircraft missiles have also been deployed inside the no-fly zone established above the 36th parallel in the north means Turkey may come under pressure to provide bases for US and allied aircraft.</p>

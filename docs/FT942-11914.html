			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Greater Philadelphia (4): Acquisitive CoreStates becomes a target - In the financial sector, the region has a bit of everything Correction (published 13th May 1994) appended to this article. Like two other historic port cities on the eastern coast of the US, Philadelphia is a mature financial centre. But while New York is the focus of the banking and securities businesses, and Boston is the home of the mutual fund industry, Philadelphia's financial industry is less clearly defined. Philadelphia does, however, have a bit of everything. The city and outlying region has large banks: CoreStates is headquartered there; and several other big 'super-regionals', such as PNC and Mellon of Pittsburgh and First Fidelity of New Jersey, have a strong presence in the city. It has insurance companies: Cigna is one of the nation's largest. It has brokerage firms and investment banks: Janney Montgomery Scott is the biggest local firm, and every major Wall Street house operates in the city. It has money management firms: the Vanguard Group, one of the largest mutual fund groups, has Dollars 127bn under management. And it has the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, best known for its thriving currency options business. Not surprisingly, the financial services sector is a big employer in the Philadelphia area: CoreStates employs 8,400; Cigna 6,500; the stock exchange upwards of 3,000; and Vanguard 3,600, at its headquarters in Valley Forge just outside the city. Banking, the largest single sector in Philadelphia's financial services industry, has an interesting story to tell. As in other regions, banks in the 'tri-state' area around Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware) have been part of an industrywide consolidation process that has trimmed the number of banks through mergers, acquisitions and failures. In the Philadelphia region, many of the mergers were completed in the first wave of consolidation at the start of the 1990s. That was when larger regional banks began to expand by aggressively acquiring smaller ones in their area. The result was the creation of 'Super-regionals' such as PNC and Mellon, both based in Pittsburgh, and First Fidelity, based in in New Jersey. CoreStates, Philadelphia's biggest bank with net income last year of Dollars 327.9m and assets of almost Dollars 26bn, joined in this trend during that period with its acquisition of First Pennsylvania. Yet the bank did not hit its stride in the acquisitions business until the past year, by which time the other super-regionals from the area had exhausted their appetite for expansion. In the past eight months, CoreStates has spent Dollars 1.15bn purchasing three banks (Constellation of New Jersey, and Independence Bancorp and Germantown Savings Bank of Pennsylvania) and one asset management company (Rittenhouse Financial Services of Pennsylvania) from within the tri-state area. Two of the bank acquisitions - Independence and Germantown  - were widely viewed as astute moves. Richard Lawrence, banking analyst at Janney Montgomery, described the two banks as 'gems', and both will strengthen CoreStates' presence in Pennsylvania. The Constellation deal, however, was another matter. Analysts were quick to point out that the bank had its fair share of problem loans, and many believed the Dollars 320m price tag was too steep. Terrence Larsen, chairman of CoreStates, says some of the Constellation deal criticism is valid. 'It was seen as being pricey and difficult, and I think that's a fair assessment. We paid full price for it, and we'll have to work very hard to make it work.' For CoreStates, however, Constellation 'finishes what we need to do in northern Jersey,' says Mr Larsen. The bank will be quickly merged into CoreStates' New Jersey National Bank affiliate. As for the problem loans: they will either be sold off or taken as a charge against earnings. Although the acquisitions were primarily about building CoreStates' retail franchise, the bank also has a flourishing wholesale and electronic banking business. On the commercial side, the bank focuses on servicing mid-sized companies in the region, with annual sales of anything between Dollars 15m and Dollars 20m, while in electronic banking it has long been an industry leader in providing cash management and transaction processing services to clients. The bank also has a sizeable presence overseas, having stuck with its international business during the 1980s when other US banks pulled out. Funds transfer and trade finance are trademark businesses, and Asia is where CoreStates is enjoying the most growth. The one big question hovering over CoreStates is whether it can retain its independence for much longer. It is the right size, and is sufficiently profitable to make it a tempting target for bigger banks, such as PNC, which has often been mentioned as a potential suitor. Mr Larsen takes a sanguine approach to the issue. 'I would like to think we're on some people's list, sure. We're a very attractive franchise. But we're not interested in being acquired. At the same time, we have not put in place any shark repellants, and I've never refused to talk to anyone.' While CoreStates stands out among banks in Philadelphia, the region's insurance industry is dominated by Cigna, one of the largest insurers in the US. The company is involved in a wide range of businesses, including property/casualty and life insurance, reinsurance, pension management, and financial services. Cigna is also heavily involved in the healthcare business, being one of the largest, and most profitable, providers of managed care services in the US as the operator of 48 HMOs (health maintenance organisations). It is Cigna's property/casualty business, however, that has attracted most of the attention recently, and for all the wrong reasons. Since 1989, the company has lost Dollars 1bn on its p/c business, primarily because of high asbestosis and environmental insurance claims and the generally 'soft' pricing environment. In an attempt to turn the business around, last year Cigna hired Gerald Isom, head of Transamerica Insurance, to clean up the p/c operation. Mr Isom quickly restructured the business, cut back the underwriting book, and reduced the payroll. With the help of a more favourable pricing climate, Cigna is expecting to see the first improvement in the p/c operation's bottom line this year. Given the 'long-tail' nature of the insurance business, however, it is not likely to return to profitability for several more years. CORRECTION CoreStates, the Philadelphia-based bank, serves companies with sales of between Dollars 15m and Dollars 250m. This range of figures was incorrectly stated in our survey on Greater Philadelphia (May 4).</p>

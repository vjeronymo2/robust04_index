			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal Issued on (?27) January by His Excellency Khieu </F> Samphan, Chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to Our  Compatriots Nationwide;" place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Dear respected and beloved compatriots:    I. The 23 October 1991 Paris accord has clearly stipulated  that the Vietnamese communists should withdraw all their  aggressor forces from Cambodia and that a quadripartite Supreme  National Council be set up to settle the issue of national  reconciliation.    The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] has correctly and  meticulously implemented every point of the Paris accord,  especially the important clauses. But the Vietnamese  aggressors, the Vietnamese communist puppets, and an alliance  inside and outside UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]  have opposed the accord from the beginning.    II. UNTAC organized elections in violation of the Paris  accord. However, the Cambodian people have voted for the  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the PDK has  supported the outcome of the elections the FUNCINPEC Party has  won. This is to allow the FUNCINPEC to form a new  (?transitional) government, to set up a parliament, to codify a  constitution, and to establish a real national government.  Nevertheless, the Vietnamese aggressors, who have occupied  Cambodia for 15 years, and their puppets as well as the alliance  have shown their opposition to this by revolting and separating  the seven provinces bordering Vietnam. They have used force and  pressure to form a two-headed government. In reality, real  state power still belongs to the puppets of the Vietnamese  communists. They have repeatedly reorganized the formation [of  the government] in opposition to and in violation of the  Cambodian people's wishes, democracy, and the 23 October 1991  Paris accord.    III. Shortly after the creation of the two-headed  government, the Vietnamese aggressors, the Vietnamese puppets,  and the alliance marshalled their forces in Cambodia to attack  the Cambodian people, national resistance forces, and Democratic  Kampuchea [DK]. In August 1993, they began launching military  offensives on Phnum Chhat and Stoung [District]. They created  all kinds of disasters, burned and plundered the people's  property, shot the people dead, and raped their children in the  most savage manner. These actions have caused appalling  devastation.    IV. On 21 November 1993, King Norodom Sihanouk put forth a  five-point policy for national reconciliation. The PDK, like  the Cambodian nation and people, has fully supported the royal  policy. The five points of the royal policy are as follows:    A. A total and immediate cease-fire across Cambodia;    B. A cessation of all military activities, including  mine-laying and so on.    C. Return of Preah Vihear Temple, Pailin, and other  regions controlled by Democratic Kampuchea to the state and  government of the Kingdom of Cambodia;    D. Dissolution of the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea and its incorporation into the Khmer Royal Armed  Forces; and    E. Obligation of the government to offer the posts of  co-ministers, deputy co-ministers, and co-state secretaries as  well as advisory roles to PDK personages.    The king will appoint a PDK personage as his senior privy  councillor.    In this context, the PDK, on the one hand, should cease  having liberated zones and armed forces, while on the other, it  should join both the government and army. This is to form an  authentic national government and to establish an authentic  national army.    The Cambodian nation and people as well as the PDK and the  peace- and justice-loving countries of the world have supported  the royal five-point policy with the aim of achieving national  reconciliation. Also, among the people, the movement demanding  national reconciliation has become increasingly vigorous.    V. The two-headed government, however, does not care about  the royal five-point initiative, the national reconciliation,  and the desire of the Cambodian nation and people and peace- and  justice-loving countries of the world. They are only busy with:    A. Allowing the Vietnamese, old and new alike, to flow  into Cambodia at will. There are now nearly four million  Vietnamese in the country.    B. Attacking and attacking.    C. Amassing money extorted from the people to buy war  materiel to further inflame the war.    D. Forcibly drafting the people and their children to  serve as soldiers and to die on the battlefield one after  another.    E. Creating thievery, banditry, and corruption; allowing  commodities prices to go sky-high; and generating unemployment,  beggary, and all kinds of vices.    F. Whatever the two-headed government is called, in  reality it is the Vietnamese communist government that assumes  99 percent of state power in Phnom Penh and 100 percent in the  provinces. This includes power in the military, police,  civilian, and all other sectors. Therefore, it is the  two-headed government, in particular the Vietnamese communists  and their puppets as well as the alliance that should be held  responsible for the survival of the Cambodian nation and people.    National problems are becoming increasingly serious as there  are almost four million Vietnamese communists nationwide,  especially in eastern Cambodia. The presence of over four  million Vietnamese has created all kinds of serious national and  social problems. Social problems, in particular, have become  critical. People are starving; soldiers, policemen, public  servants, teachers, and professors have not been paid; the  number of beggars are increasing; and the problem of corruption  and others have become acute.    G. In the face of this serious situation and national and  social problems, I wish to appeal to the compatriots:    1. To join hands to carry out all kinds of activities to  stop the war waged by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese  communist puppets, and the alliance;    2. To join hands to conduct all kinds of activities to  prevent the serious social situation caused by the Vietnamese  communist aggressors' occupation of Cambodia, by the power of  the Vietnamese communists' puppet, and by all sorts of corrupt  practices.    3. To join hands to support the national reconciliation  plan of King Norodom Sihanouk;    4. To join hands to carry out all kinds of activities to  prevent and do away with the problem of corruption and the  problem of nearly four million old and new Vietnamese in  Cambodia, and to promote national reconciliation in accordance  with his majesty's five-point policy.    Our entire nation and people have become more united under  King Norodom Sihanouk's national reconciliation banner. The old  and new aggressors and their puppets have become terribly  isolated, and have already been sentenced by the entire  Cambodian nation and people. The cause of our nation and race,  which is in the hands of all our people, will certainly prevail  over their atheist enemies.    Down with the warmongers!    Long live the Cambodian nation and people!    Long live the king's national reconciliation policy!</p>

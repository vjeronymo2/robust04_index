			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A cheap, cheerful integrated package - Computing MANY PC users find that the best software to run on their computer is an 'integrated' package. This combines into one the three most common applications - word processing, spreadsheet and database - and is invariably a much cheaper solution than buying the three of them separately. There is a further advantage in that all the applications are designed to operate in the same way: once you have mastered one you are half way to mastering the other two. Office Manager is perhaps the cheapest integrated package on the market. It was released in 1989 and combines a word processor, spreadsheet and simple database and will run on floppy or hard disk machines. It is available from Software Toolworks (0444-246333) at Pounds 51.08 including VAT, and by a special mail order offer from PC Answers magazine at only Pounds 19.97. Under the influence of the marketing department most packages these days come overloaded and complicated with masses of irrelevant features: working your way through them is a struggle. Office Manager, by contrast, shows the influence of the engineer who tries to come up with a simple design that contains the essentials and nothing else. At the beginning you have a quick look through the menu options and think: 'Is that all? Surely there's got to be more to it than this.' But then you put the package through its paces and all the really important things you need are there sure enough. Office Manager may be cheap, but in design terms it is bang up-to-date. It adopts IBM's CUA (Common User Access) style that is becoming industry standard. Hit the Alt key and you activate drop-down menus from a menu bar at the top of the screen. It supports a mouse and the HP laserjet printer. Initial impressions are good. The opening screen presents a neat list of the files available in each application. I chose the word processor. Up came an attractive white screen with red margins. For the typical business user who needs to write letters and memos this word processor is excellent - clear menus, easy editing, and adequate layout facilities. For anyone who writes in foreign languages it offers a simple way of including non-standard characters such as umlauts and circumflexes. It can also link to the database module for 'mailmerge', the facility to print personalised standard letters. The 'Calc' spreadsheet module is again simple and clean, but the lack of a tutorial created a few difficulties. It took me some while to work out the exact sequence for copying one cell to a group of other cells. The Help key (F1) in the spreadsheet was corrupted in my copy and locked up the keyboard, so I had to switch off and restart. Formatting options are limited; you cannot display a figure as a percentage and I could not find a way of centring the contents of one cell. Another weakness is that Office Manager is only set to print 10 characters per inch on to the paper. This is unlikely to be a problem with the word processor but in a spreadsheet you really need condensed print at 17 cpi to squeeze a year's figures onto one page. For Office Manager to print in other sizes - such as 12 cpi or 17 cpi - you have to enter printer escape codes. The database module ('Filer') is the least successful. With most packages designing a database is usually easy, because you simply 'paint' the data entry form on the screen. I tried to set up a mailing list database but found it a struggle. Office Manager's manual is clear and well written, but is no substitute for a brief tutorial taking you through worked examples and illustrating how everything hangs together. Another problem is that 'date ' and 'telephone' fields only accept US formats (eg April 17 1992 appears as 4/17/92). Once you have got over all these hurdles, data entry is easy, and I found the report writer clear and easy to use, but at the beginning users will have to struggle unnecessarily. None of the above defects is insuperable. On the credit side, Office Manager's word processor is excellent, its spreadsheet perfectly adequate. Overall design is admirably clear and logical, and for the beginner or occasional user this package is is a top recommendation irrespective of price. At less than Pounds 20, what have you got to lose? Office Manager is available at the special price of Pounds 19.97 including VAT, from PC Answers magazine, Future Publishing Ltd, order ref.

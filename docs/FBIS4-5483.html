			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Washington appears  concerned that North Korea's connection with Japanese ruling  quarters may lead to a softening of Tokyo's attitude toward  Pyongyang, a Tokyo newspaper reported Tuesday.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement of  resignation Friday has raised concerns that some figures in the  coalition may adopt a more conciliatory position toward  Pyongyang, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported from Washington in its  evening edition. The SANKEI dispatch named Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Shinseito's [Japan Renewal  Party] senior member Hajime Ishii as having close links with  North Korea.    Hosokawa has so far expressed support for Washington's plans  to seek economic sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang  continues to refuse thorough safeguard inspections of its  nuclear program.    Takemura, speaking at Tuesday's evening news conference,  dismissed the concern as a "laughing matter."    Government officials said they know that a number of  politicians within the Japanese ruling coalition would likely  support a political connection with North Korea, the SANKEI  report said.    The officials allowed that Takemura's and Ishii's connection  with North Korea may be entirely legitimate, but added that they  hope Tokyo will not dilute its attitude toward the North Korean  nuclear problem, the report said. Takemura and Ishii appear to  have been singled out by Washington because of their involvement  in a trip to North Korea in September 1990 led by then-Liberal  Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru.    "It is a laughing matter," Takemura told reporters in Tokyo  on Tuesday, commenting on his reported political links with  Pyongyang. Takemura and Ishii are also members of the  Japan-North Korea Parliamentarians League, but Takemura denied  that this was any indication that he had a political connection  with Pyongyang.    Washington has spearheaded an international campaign since  last March to persuade Pyongyang to accept full inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to ensure that its  nuclear program is not being used to manufacture an atomic  weapons arsenal. Pyongyang has denied allegations it is seeking  to build a bomb, but its refusal to permit unfettered IAEA  inspections has fueled suspicions that it may be diverting  radioactive materials from its power plants to military purposes.    Two rounds of high-level talks between Washington and  Pyongyang last summer yielded an agreement for inspections that  were held last month.    The IAEA, however, was prevented from completing the  inspections and the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential  statement March 31 urging Pyongyang to permit completion of the  checks.</p>

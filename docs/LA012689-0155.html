			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOBBYING WAR EXPECTED OVER EXTENDING 1984 CURBS ON FOREIGN-PRODUCED STEEL  </P> <P> The new session of Congress signals the beginning of a lobbying war over  whether the United States should extend soon-to-expire steel import curbs that  have helped the U.S. steel industry become profitable.  </P> <P> The current import ceilings, which were negotiated in the fall of 1984, expire  Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Already there has been "a lot of rhetoric" on whether they should be renewed,  William Reinsch, steel trade expert for Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), said this  week.  </P> <P> "In terms of parties coming and sitting down, it's just now beginning to heat  up," Reinsch said.  </P> <P> Pressured by the steel industry and by Congress, the Reagan administration  negotiated 5-year steel trade agreements with Japan, South Korea, the European  Community and other leading steel-exporting nations.  </P> <P> The idea was to give American companies breathing space from subsidized foreign  competitors by pressuring the competitors to restrict imports on a  product-by-product basis.  </P> <P> USX Corp., Bethlehem Steel Corp., LTV Steel Co. and other large steel companies  have begun pushing for an extension of the curbs beyond 1989.  </P> <P> But with the steel industry turning a second consecutive profit last year and  with some importers complaining of steel product shortages, it is no sure bet  that the large firms will win renewal of as strong a package of quotas as those  of 1984.  </P> <P> Three days before winning the November election, President Bush pledged to  continue the so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements in some form. But  opponents of the plan believe that they can make a case for ending or at least  scaling down the import curbs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Import Reductions  </P> <P> There is little argument that the curbs have aided the steel industry's  revival. Imports have been reduced from 26.4% of the American market in 1984 to  about 20.5% last year. Meanwhile, employment and profits of U.S. steel  companies were up last year over 1987.  </P> <P> The issue is whether the quota agreements are still necessary, and to what  degree, if any, they have harmed sectors of the American economy other than  steel companies.  </P> <P> The Precision Metalforming Assn., an industry group, says the availability of  steel has been reduced because of the import curbs. The association represents  hundreds of metal product manufacturers of such products as brake pedals and  computer frames.  </P> <P> "Our position is because of the restrictions on steel supplies -- which cause  increases in prices and limited availability -- we would rather see the most  open and competitive steel market possible," spokesman Greg Estell said Monday.  </P> <P> The steel trade issue has already spawned some angry language.  </P> <P> After Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria, Ill., issued a September, 1988, paper arguing  against continued import ceilings, the American Iron and Steel Institute soon  compiled a 20-page, point-by-point rebuttal.  </P> <P> In the Jan. 1 rebuttal, the trade association accused Caterpillar of "numerous  distortions and inaccuracies." The paper claimed that the import curbs "do not  cause steel price increases or otherwise impede the competitiveness of U.S.  manufacturers."  </P></p>

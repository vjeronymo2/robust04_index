			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Cocoa support scheme abandoned INTERNATIONAL COCOA Organisation delegates decided yesterday to abandon efforts to negotiate a market stabilisation pact based on a stock withholding scheme. With time quickly running out for reaching an agreement that could be ratified in time to replace the present moribund pact when it expires at the end of September, and with wide gaps remaining between producers and consumers on several crucial issues, the delegates decided to consider the softer option of an agreement based on voluntary production control, promotion of consumption and running down the organisation's 233,000-tonne buffer stock. A special session of the ICCO council will be held on June 8-11 to discuss this plan, which an official described yesterday as more than an administrative pact but well short of a full economic accord. The announcement, which came too late to produce any response at the London cocoa futures market, is unlikely to have come as much of a surprise to traders, most of whom had long ago given up hope of an effective market support pact being agreed. Late trading in New York showed little sign of a reaction, though prices were tending lower. Sugar continued to be the brightest star in the commodities firmament this week as New York futures prices surged to three-year peaks and their London counterparts to the highest levels since April 1991. The August contract in London closed yesterday at Dollars 265.20 a tonne, up Dollars 25.20 on the week, while New York's July contract moved above the 12 cents-a-lb mark. In late trading it was quoted at 12.50 cents a lb, up 1.72 cents from the end of last week and three cents from a month ago. Having been wakened from its torpor a few weeks ago by drought-induced cuts in the Thai crop projection - down from the initial 5m tonnes to 3.51m, which would be the lowest level for five years - the sugar market was given a further boost by news that Cuba had been hit by the storms that swept the eastern seaboard of the US last weekend. London analysts were dubious from the first about the extent of the damage to Cuba's sugar crop, which was already expected to be well down from last year's 7m tonnes, possibly as low as 5m tonnes. And in its daily Commodity Report yesterday GNI, the London trade house, noted that a Cuban request for United Nations aid revealed that 'only Dollars 46m of damage was done to the sugar crop - or 190,000 tonnes'. That figure was well below some of the earlier estimates, GNI said, 'and adds weight to our negative view point'. Traders were in no mood to be dissuaded from their new-found bullishness, however. 'The market is still tight,' one London analysts told the Reuter news agency yesterday. 'It's on an uptrend and it has recovered a long way.' But he was not sure that it could sustain present price levels, which offered attractive profit-taking opportunities for speculators and might tempt producers to sell from their stocks. 'There is a lot of material to be sold short term and if selling begins, we could see the top of the market,' he suggested. In contrast, the coffee market extended last week's heavy fall. The London Futures and Options Exchange's May robustas price closed yesterday at Dollars 879 a tonne, up Dollars 6 on the day but Dollars 34 down on the week. In the absence of fundamental developments traders attributed the market's continued weakness to the high level of consumer stocks and pessimism about the prospects for progress towards the revival of the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system being made at next week's London meeting. GNI suggested yesterday that lack of enthusiasm from the US, the biggest coffee consumer, could scupper the negotiations. 'It is likely that the US delegation has not received a fresh mandate from (President) Clinton,' it said in its Commodity Report, 'in which case the meetings will merely be to set another date for talks, but if (delegates) have had word that the US position has not changed under Clinton, then everyone might as well pack up and go home early.' At the London Metal Exchange tin proved the brightest spark as commission house buying fuelled a late rally in prices. Dealers said labour unrest in the Bolivian mining industry also provided support as an accelerating Dollars 230 surge over three days wiped out an earlier Dollars 142.50 fall and left the cash position at Dollars 5,755 a tonne. The cash copper price ended Pounds 61.50 down on the week at Pounds 1,459.50 a tonne, but most of that resulted from sterling's strength against the dollar, in terms of which the pice was only down about Dollars 12. Despite high stocks, poor demand growth outside North America and Japanese selling early in the week, copper made several attempts to break long-standing resistance at just above Dollars 2,200 for three months metal. Dealers said buyers were encouraged by concern over the situation in Zaire, labour unrest in Chile and falls in stocks at the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), suggesting that output losses caused by widespread flooding in Arizona this year had been heavier than thought earlier. The gold price moved steadily higher this week, ending yesterday at Dollars 331.45 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.70 on balance. But dealers expected any closer approach to the ceiling of the recent Dollars 326/333 price range to attract producer selling, especially as in South African rand terms the price near a record.  -------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------------------- Aluminium    +3,425    to    1,715,075 Copper       +1,250    to      347,350 Lead         +7,275    to      242,425 Nickel          -12    to       85,740 Zinc         +6,050    to      593,450 Tin            -125    to       19,045  --------------------------------------------------</p>

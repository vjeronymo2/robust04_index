			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, 8 April (AFP)--Bombs exploded 15 minutes  apart near Iraqi ministries in Baghdad on Wednesday, an Iraqi  group said here Friday without reporting casualties.    "An explosive device was placed at al-Nidal Street about 100  meters (300 feet) from the Industry Ministry and another was  placed near the agriculture and Irrigation Ministry," the Iraqi  National Congress said in a statement.    "The two explosions caused panic among security services and  coincided with the anniversary of the foundation of the ruling  (Ba'th) party," said the statement dated from Sulaymaniyah and  Kurdish-controlled norther Iraq.    It said the first occurred at 5:30 a.m. (0130 GMT) and the  second at 5:45 a.m. (0145 GMT).</p>

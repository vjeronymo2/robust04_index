			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 29 SAPA -- South Africa joined the  Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] on Tuesday [31 May] and Foreign  Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said SA would like to share its  special human rights experience with other countries. "We have  suffered too much ourselves not to do so," he told the 11th  conference of NAM foreign ministers in Cairo.    In a speech released in Johannesburg, he pledged to  strengthen relations between South Africa and members of the NAM.    South Africa's problems were very similar to those faced  daily by the international community, he said, and with barriers  removed it could now offer something from its experiences.  "Although our democracy is still in its infancy, we have already  made significant progress in overcoming the effects of ethnic  and other differences and in removing totalitarianism," he said.    He thanked the NAM for its work to eradicate apartheid.  "Your  efforts were not in vain, and today we can rejoice together at  the successful establishment of a free and democratic SA."    Mr Nzo said SA would also like to share its economic,  scientific and technical knowledge with other countries in  Africa and the rest of the world. "Our goal is to establish sa  as a responsible possessor of advanced technologies."    It would further like to act in concert with other members  of  the community of nations as a responsible world citizen, and was  committed to supporting global efforts to deal with sustainable  development and the environment.    South Africa's efforts to relieve poverty, which reflected  international efforts to combat the north-south economic divide,  would contribute towards stable and good government, he said.    There was a basis for close cooperation between South Africa  and the NAM.    "If we can serve as a bridge to bring the interests of the  industrialised world and developing world closer together, we  will know that our struggle has been truly worthwhile," Mr Nzo  said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jelena Vidic -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Vidic] President [of the Srpska republic] Karadzic  assessed that the visit to Moscow was very significant and that  the resolution of the Bosnian crisis will take a new direction.    He assessed that Russia's involvement in the search for a  peaceful solution is of crucial importance and that the balance  of powers has now been restored on the international scene.  Russia is not returning to the international scene in the sense  of confrontation with the West, but in the sense of a very  active role in the process of searching for a solution to the  crisis, Karadzic said and assessed that the Serbian side, as he  said, has finally found somebody through whom it can articulate  its views and point to what is totally unacceptable for it.    When we asked him whether we can now expect a concrete new  Russian initiative regarding the conflict in Bosnia, Karadzic  replied:    [Karadzic] I think that the Russians will work in sync with  others. It seems to me that at least two moves so far --  Yeltsin's letter regarding heavy arms to [Serbian] President  Milosevic and via him to me, and now this about the Tuzla  airport -- have surprised western circles. It seems to me that  Russia has accomplished a considerable advantage here, on the  basis of which it can now take part in the resolution of the  crisis on an equal footing. I expect and assume that meetings  similar to those in Washington will also happen in Moscow.    [Vidic] Karadzic then commented the Washington agreement on  the Muslim-Croatian confederation:    [Karadzic] We are still studying this agreement and we are  not sure yet whether it has been struck at the expense of the  Serbs or as a partial step toward peace. We fear any sort of  Croatian-Muslim coalition, we remember them from World War II  and from the beginning of this war, and for this reason we are  very cautious. If they form a joint state then we must also  take care of our territories and borders. They must be easily  defendable in case this country, this neighbor, starts  displaying hostile feelings toward us. In principle, we think  that it is not good that the United States has assumed the role  of the United Nations, and has taken the place of the  international institutions, so to speak, with the great ambition  of helping along an agreement of the Croats and Muslims only. I  am afraid that the United States is missing another opportunity  to portray itself as objective. Therefore, the impression of  its partiality and orientation against the Serbian interests is  strengthening.    [Vidic] The next steps of the Srpska republic will be to  strengthen peace on all front lines in order to negotiate in the  best possible atmosphere, Karadzic said. We will participate in  all negotiations, however, we have reserves toward those who act  as arbiters and neglect the significance of the Serbian side in  this conflict. We will not allow the realization of the  Croatian-Muslim coalition and joint state to the detriment of  the Serbs, Karadzic emphasized.    Commenting on [Croatian Foreign Minister] Granic's  invitation  to the Serbs to enter the confederation, Karadzic said that the  Croatian Minister should have said this in Belgrade and not in  Paris.    Karadzic then replied to a question about the decision to  open Tuzla airport:    [Karadzic] We have never opposed the opening of the airport  for humanitarian purposes. Our fundamental concern was that the  airport could be abused for military purposes. We have held  very fruitful talks regarding this in Russia and received  assurances that the arrangement that we had agreed with the  Russians protects against any sort of misuse of the airport. In  such a case, we have nothing against the opening of the airport.  [end recording]</p>

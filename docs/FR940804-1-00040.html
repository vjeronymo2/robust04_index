			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Trash dumping has also degraded vernal pools in San Diego County. Discarded chunks of concrete, tires, refrigerators, furniture, and other pieces of garbage or debris have been found in pools containing the San Diego fairy shrimp. This trash crushes or shades vernal pool plants, disrupts the hydrologic functions of the pool, and in some cases, may release toxic substances. Vernal pools in San Diego County have also been degraded by off-road vehicles. These vehicles compact soils, crush plants when water is present, cause turbidity, and leave deep ruts. This type of damage may alter the microhydrology of the pools. Dirt roads that go through or adjacent to pools are widened as motorists try to avoid mud puddles and in this way, the pools are gradually destroyed. The San Diego fairy shrimp's vernal pool habitat is also vulnerable to indirect destruction due to the alteration of the supporting watershed. An increase in water due to urban run-off leads to increased inundation and makes pools vulnerable to invasion by marshy plant species resulting in decreased abundance of obligate vernal pool taxa. At the other extreme, some pools have been drained or blocked from their source of water and have shown an increased domination by upland plant species. The San Diego fairy shrimp is especially vulnerable to alterations in hydrology. Development projects adjacent to vernal pools are often responsible for adverse alterations in drainage. Hydrological alterations are sometimes a result of agricultural development, or a combination of urban development and agriculture.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes Overutilization is not currently a known threat factor for the San Diego fairy shrimp. C. Disease or Predation As vernal pools mature, there is a gradual increase in numbers and size of predaceous aquatic insects, known to consume fairy shrimp (Zedler 1987). D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Existing regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection for the San Diego fairy shrimp include: (1) Consideration under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); (2) implementation of conservation plans pursuant to the State of California's Natural Community Conservation Planning Act of 1991 (NCCP), the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP), and the San Diego County Multiple Habitat Conservation Plan (MHCP); (3) section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act; (4) occurrence with other species protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; (5) land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies, or by private groups and organizations; (6) local laws and regulations; and (7) Mexican law. Most of the known populations of the taxon occur on privately owned land. Local lead agencies empowered to uphold and enforce the regulations of the CEQA have made determinations that have or will adversely affect the San Diego fairy shrimp. Required biological surveys are often inadequate and project proponents may ignore the results of surveys if occurrences of sensitive species are viewed as a constraint on project design. Mitigation measures used to condition project approvals are essentially experimental and fail to adequately guarantee protection of sustainable populations. For example, in San Diego County, vernal pools containing the San Diego fairy shrimp and the Federal- and State-listed Pogogyne abramsii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (San Diego mesa mint) were destroyed without adequate environmental documentation or coordination with the Service and the California Department of Fish and Game. In this case, the project proponent was a school district. Section 15380 of CEQA requires that impacts to any taxon that meets the criteria for listing under the California Endangered Species Act be treated as significant regardless of its current listing status. The San Diego fairy shrimp has been recognized as a distinct taxon by the scientific and local conservation communities since 1990. Impacts to this species would qualify as significant under section 15380 of CEQA even though this species was not formally recognized until 1993 (Fugate 1993). However, this taxon has only been considered in a limited number of environmental impact reports since 1990.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Conservative Party leader Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg says  his party stands by its decision not to participate in the  election. Speaking in Roodepoort last night, Dr. Hartzenberg  said the latest concessions by the ANC [African National  Congress] and the government still were not enough.    [Begin Hartzenberg recording, in Afrikaans] We say up till  tonight nothing has happened, nothing at all, to make it  possible or necessary for us to change our decision not to take  part in their election. Nothing has happened, nothing at all.  Mr. Chairman, by participating in the election, we will only be  helping to give it legitimacy. We will be helping to give it  credibility. What's more, we will become party to subjecting  our people to a communist government. And as I said, Mr.  Chairman, that constitution and that South Africa will not be  tenable. Let us not be party to keeping it artificially alive.  We must do everything possible to bring about its collapse as  soon as possible. [end recording]</p>

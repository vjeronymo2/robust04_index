			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEENS TARGETED IN TOBACCO ADS, MODEL TESTIFIES  </P> <P> A model who for six years was Winston's answer to the macho "Marlboro man"  urged Congress today to take the glamour out of tobacco advertisements, saying  teen-agers are the target of the ads.  </P> <P> "I have had children tell me that they smoked Winstons so that they could be  just like me," David Goerlitz told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.  "For that I shall always feel guilty."  </P> <P> Goerlitz described himself as a 25-year, three-pack-a-day smoker who kicked the  habit in November. He has worked for private groups that fight smoking-related  illnesses and his testimony was intended to bolster legislation sponsored by  Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D-Ohio).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ad Ban Sought  </P> <P> Luken, on a self-described crusade "to reduce cigarette smoking to zero," wants  to ban all tobacco ads that might be seen by youths.  </P> <P> "When I modeled for Winston, I was told very clearly that young people were the  market we were after," Goerlitz said. "The other models and I were depicted as  young and daring buddies, and that's what young people relate to at 14 or 15  years old."  </P> <P> The ads showed cigarette-smoking members of a search-and-rescue squad, dangling  from helicopters and hanging from cliffs to rescue stricken climbers.  </P> <P> Luken's bill calls for stripping billboards and printed ads of everything but  printed words, and banning tobacco ads from all sports facilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Job Loss Predicted  </P> <P> The Freedom to Advertise Coalition, representing six advertising trade  organizations, released results of a study predicting Luken's legislation would  put 62,992 people out of work if it became law. It said jobs would be lost in  retail trade, outdoor advertising, direct mail advertising, newspapers,  magazines and printing.  </P> <P> The coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union also argued against the  bill on constitutional grounds.  </P> <P> Charles Whitley, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said the legislation  "rests on the false premise that cigarette advertising is responsible for  smoking by young people and that young people would not begin smoking if  cigarette advertising were banned."  </P></p>

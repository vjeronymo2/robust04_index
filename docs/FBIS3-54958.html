According to experts of his ministry, Russia exported  armaments worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.    A major contract on shipments of MiG-29 fighter planes to  Malaysia is expected early next year, Davydov told Business-TASS  on Tuesday.    The minister denied allegations that Russia had sustained  considerable losses by ceasing military shipments to former  Soviet allies as those were mostly free of charge deliveries.    "for political reasons we have stopped arms shipments to a  number of warring countries - Afghanistan, Angola, Ethiopia and  others. But Russia did not practically earn any money from that.  Now the arms trade is going on only for hard currency", Davydov  said.    The minister hopes the creation of the "Rosvooruzhenie"  company which is to unite major Russian military exporters will  open new prospects for arms trade.    He added that his ministry retains the licencing right, will  draft intergovernmental agreements and carry out export control.</p>

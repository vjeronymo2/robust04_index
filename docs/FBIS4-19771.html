			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Altan Oymen: "Bloodstained Remarks"-- </F> punctuation as published]    [Text] The "bloodstained" remarks made by Prosperity Party  leader Necmettin Erbakan in his address to his party's  parliamentary group meeting have had a "chilling effect" even on  those who sympathize with that political party. He was expected  to adopt a different approach after the demonstrations in Ankara  and Istanbul on Sunday [10 April]. Many people believed that  Erbakan would warn those who gathered under the Prosperity  Party's banner and created incidents. They believed so because  Erbakan supported "peace and brotherhood" in the statements he  made during his election campaign. A move by him to warn the  supporters of the Prosperity Party who prefer to call for war  and engage in hostile activities instead of upholding the  concept of peace and brotherhood and the militants who acted on  behalf of the Prosperity Party would be in line with the  principles Erbakan defended. But he did exactly the opposite.  He supported the militants by saying that they are "members of  our population." He described their "terrorist activities"  against the state-owned buildings, political parties, and  international establishments as an "uprising." He also  described the administration in Turkey as a "terrorist" and  "servile" entity that serves as a "colonialist subcontractor."    What was more confusing was his statement on "bloodshed."  According to Erbakan, an unchanging fact is as follows: The  Prosperity Party will come to power. The problem is whether the  transition period will be "nice and smooth or bloody." The  people will make the decision.    Who are the people who will make that decision? Will it be  the aggressive individuals who were described by Erbakan as  "within the ranks of his people"?    Obviously, over 90 percent of our people, including most of  those who voted for the Prosperity Party in the local elections,  have been disgusted by the aggressive activities. Would anyone  other than aggressive individuals support the idea of a "bloody"  change of administration? Who else would prefer a state of  "bloodshed," which Necmettin Erbakan described as "one of the  two options" in Turkey? The speech Erbakan gave two days ago  should be read often. No other meaning can be given to it. If  the Prosperity Party cannot come to power in a nice, smooth  manner, that is, in a democratic way, it will do so through  "bloodshed," that is, through an "uprising" similar to that  which took place on Sunday.... It will definitely come to power  one way or the other....    Considering the meaning of Erbakan's speech, President  Suleyman Demirel and all the other political party leaders moved  to act yesterday. They were justified in doing so. They warned  him in a way that he could and should understand them.    Erbakan claimed after he met the speaker of the Turkish  Grand  National Assembly that his remarks were distorted. Obviously,  he reverted to the position he held prior to the local  elections. He said: "We support peace and tranquillity."    The broadcasting of his speech two days ago by the  television  networks has confirmed that his remarks have not been distorted.  His revelation yesterday was probably prompted by the reaction  to his remarks, which has made him realize that he did something  wrong. Of course, trying to correct a mistake is a positive  approach. But which of the two revelations Erbakan made is  true? Which of them reflects his true intention? It is  becoming harder to establish that.</p>

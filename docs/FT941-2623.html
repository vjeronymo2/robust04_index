			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery hopes lift Wellcome Shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, experienced a sharp turnround in late trading as dealers said forecasts were being moved higher on expectations of a pick up in the company's fortunes. The optimism focused on sales of Wellcome's headline product Zovirax, which is sold as a treatment for shingles and herpes. Sales growth for the drug had dwindled to 7 per cent last year, but the latest prescription data from the US has suggested it has recovered to around 13 per cent. This led the more pessimistic analysts to adjust their figures - one broker apparently raised its full-year forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 720m ahead of first-half results on Thursday. The figure is at the higher end of a wide range from Pounds 680m to Pounds 750m. First-half figures are predicted to come in at between Pounds 340m and Pounds 367m. The share price had languished by 14p in early trading, but recovered to close only 3 1/2 lower at 627 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Untitled Item MOSCOW yesterday was given observer status in Gatt's Anti-Dumping Committee, marking a further step to eventual membership of the world trade organisation, William Dullforce reports from Geneva. Last May it won observer status in Gatt itself, and in March this year similar standing on Gatt's import licensing committee. Moscow now has access to two of the codes to which Gatt members subscribe separately, which are meant mainly to lower non-tariff obstacles to trade.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Franc besieged THE NEW year begins where the old one left off, with a tug of war over the French franc. On one side are investors increasingly doubtful about the ability of any French government to sustain interest rates at current levels. On the other side is the French political establishment, aided at least rhetorically by the German. As the pull from the markets has increased, so has the need to pull still more strongly on the other side. Yesterday, therefore, the Banque de France temporarily replaced its five-to-10 day lending at an interest rate of 10 per cent by an overnight rate of 12 per cent. More significantly, the Bundesbank and the Banque de France said that they 'will pursue their close co-operation in order to ensure the proper functioning of the ERM', this being an apparently stronger statement than the one released last September. As important was the commitment by Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, to an independent Banque de France, which creates a consensus on this policy among the respectable French parties. The question is whether the authorities have done enough. Interest rate increases are not particularly effective even in a country that is able to shield the bulk of borrowers from the effects of higher rates in the money markets. When the problem created by the exchange rate link is excessively high interest rates, any battle won by still higher rates would, think the markets, not be worth winning. But by thinking this, investors ensure it is true. The Bundesbank's commitment is far more important. At the limit the Bundesbank can guarantee the exchange rate, though that would threaten domestic monetary control. Whether it would go that far is at least dubious. But the possibility that it might will give people who are selling the French franc short pause for thought. Commitment to an independent central bank increases the credibility of the current policy, by making it easier to believe that the French authorities will keep interest rates up for longer. But it also makes the alternatives more palatable. Should the franc be forced to float, for example, central bank independence would increase the likelihood of its remaining strong. An independent Banque de France would also increase the chance of German acceptance of early monetary union as an alternative to disarray. This then is a good try by the Franco-German authorities. But it will not be enough on its own to ensure the present parity. What is needed for this is confidence that German monetary policy will soon be eased. No statement, certainly no statement by the French authorities, can create such confidence. But they have done what they can to win the present tug-of-war and have made the fall-back positions more attractive as well.</p>

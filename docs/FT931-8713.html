			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Retreat on taxing foreign companies PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has had to execute an embarrassing climbdown in his claim that foreign-owned companies could be made to pay billions of dollars more in US taxes. In his campaign manifesto, Mr Clinton said that making foreign companies pay their fair share of taxes by stricter enforcement of the transfer pricing rules that govern transactions between subsidiaries and their parents would bring in Dollars 45bn in four years from 1993 to 1996 - the second largest source of savings identified in the document. This number was less extravagant than the estimate of Dollars 30bn a year that commonly circulates in congressional subcommittees, but it was still widely ridiculed. Last night's economic package, more modestly, estimates only Dollars 1.8bn over the same 1993-96 period, or a total of Dollars 3.8bn over a longer six-year period from an initiative to enhance penalties on transfer pricing abuses. Even this estimate appears to involve a good deal of guesswork; this line contains far the roundest numbers in the entire Treasury document detailing the new tax increases. A Treasury official said the tighter enforcement would involve penalties that may be levied when a company is found to have cheated on transfer pricing arrangements. Companies must have contemporaneous documents justifying their pricing structure, instead of being able to construct post hoc justifications. At the same time, the Treasury plans to increase compliance with transfer pricing rules by spending Dollars 38m on more tax inspectors and doubling the frequency with which foreign companies are audited, and an official said the additional revenue from this enforcement drive, while as yet uncalculated, would be large. A second measure in the Clinton package will also affect some foreign companies: earnings stripping rules, designed to prevent companies from converting taxable dividends into tax deductible debt repayments by lending money to their subsidiaries for capital, will be tightened to cover bank loans guaranteed by the parent company. The administration estimates this could bring in Dollars 579m over the 1993-98 period. More significant revenue, however, could come from measures aimed at US multinationals with foreign subsidiaries. By reforming the foreign tax credit for oil multinationals, including royalties in the passive basket of the foreign tax credit, and stopping deferral for excessive accumulated foreign earnings, the Treasury hopes to reap Dollars 4.3bn in the 1993-98 period.</p>

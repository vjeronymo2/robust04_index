			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Observer: Ill defined Amazing things these computer spell-checkers. David Burns, a London-based banker who does business in Spain, reports that his checker suggested 'bozos' was a better way of spelling bonos, the Madrid government's volatile bonds. It also recommended that IRPF, the acronym for Spain's swingeing income tax, should be rendered 'irrupt'. Burns then keyed in (Mario) Conde, the disgraced financier who was removed from the chairmanship of Banesto by the Bank of Spain. The machine thought 'conned' a reasonable alternative. (Luis) Valls, the distinguished chairman of the profitable Banco Popular, came up as 'value'. For the IU, the Communist party's Izquierda Unida coalition which campaigns for greater public spending, the checker proposed 'IOU'. The Catalan nationalist coalition CIU, the power-broker in Spain's hung parliament, flashed up as 'CIA'. Clearly the machine has inbuilt anti-Spanish sentiments. El Pais, one of the top newspapers, it regards as 'El Pain'.</p>

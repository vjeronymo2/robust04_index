			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SQUABBLES PROMPT NUREYEV TO BOW OUT OF PARIS BALLET POST  </P> <P> A 14-month battle between Rudolf Nureyev and the president of the Paris Opera  Ballet ended today when the Soviet-born dancer resigned as dance director of  the company he helped bring to prominence.  </P> <P> A statement issued after a meeting between Nureyev and ballet President Pierre  Berge said the two "decided mutually that Nureyev should step down as dance  director."  </P> <P> The break, however, sounded more like a separation than divorce. The statement  said Nureyev would stay on as "premier choreographer," a post created for him  "to insure the presence of his productions at the Paris Opera."  </P> <P> Nureyev, 51, had been artistic director since 1983.  </P> <P> The Paris Opera became almost a soap opera in recent weeks, with tensions  mounting as Nureyev and Berge exchanged charges in the press.  </P> <P> Nureyev's contract as dance director expired Aug. 31. Interviewed last month by  the newspaper Le Figaro, he complained he had not heard from Berge, whom he  later described as harder to reach than God.  </P> <P> Berge retorted that it was difficult to communicate with someone who is so  rarely in Paris.  </P> <P> Nureyev has been frequently absent. He is touring the United States with "The  King and I" and is scheduled to play the lead role immortalized by Yul Brynner  for another two years.  </P> <P> Berge called for the dancer's contract to include a six-month residence clause  with the ballet company -- which Nureyev was certain to refuse. Insiders said  Berge hoped to boost the morale of the ballet company, which has not  appreciated Nureyev's part-time, long-distance directing.  </P></p>

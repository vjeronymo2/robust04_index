			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Company News: Banks strike deal on loans to BNL unit FOREIGN bank creditors to Agrifactoring, the Italian factoring concern linked to the troubled Federconsorzi farm services group, are set to be repaid their outstanding loans in full, writes Haig Simonian. The agreement concludes one of the most acrimonious episodes in relations between Italian and foreign banks in recent years, and should restore harmony to links between foreign financial institutions and the state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in particular. Foreign bank creditors to Agrifactoring, which is 50 per cent owned by the BNL group, had taken the bank to task over its refusal to repay loans to Agrifactoring following the collapse of Federconsorzi last year. BNL disclaimed responsibility for Agrifactoring. Under the compromise, BNL, along with Banco di Santo Spirito and Efibanca, the two other Italian bank shareholders in Agrifactoring, will subordinate their L429bn (Dollars 346.5m) lending to Agrifactoring to that of other financial institutions.</p>

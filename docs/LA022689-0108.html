			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPORTED GUNS: JUST WHAT IS A SPORTS WEAPON?  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of foreign military-style assault weapons are being  imported into the United States despite a federal law that prohibits the  importation of any firearm that is not for "sporting purposes."  </P> <P> The 1968 Gun Control Act makes it illegal to import any firearm unless it is  "generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to  sporting purposes. . . ."  </P> <P> The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms uses that law to ban cheap  foreign-made handguns and some other firearms, but Israeli Uzis, Chinese AK-47s  and other foreign-made assault weapons are pouring into the country with the  approval of federal authorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ban Held Possible  </P> <P> "I don't think the law is being properly applied," said Rep. Howard L. Berman  (D-Panorama City), who has introduced legislation to ban the possession, sale,  manufacture and importation of assault weapons. "These are not weapons that can  be reasonably construed as having legitimate sporting functions. And I think  the existing law could easily be applied to ban the (importation of) civilian  versions of the Uzis and AK-47s. . . ."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), author of a similar bill on the state  level, said that after learning of the federal importation law he is drafting a  state resolution to ask the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to  re-evaluate its policy of allowing Uzis and AK-47s into the country.  </P> <P> Both the Uzi and the AK-47 -- semiautomatic versions of fully automatic  military rifles -- are increasingly used by drug dealers and youth gangs on the  streets of Los Angeles and other American cities, according to law enforcement  officials.  </P> <P> The weapons have been used routinely in street crimes that often get little  attention outside the areas in which they occur, law enforcement officers say.  But the firearms have also been used in widely reported mass murders.  </P> <P> An Uzi was among the weapons used in San Ysidro on July 18, 1984, by a deranged  gunmen who killed 21 people and wounded 15 others at a McDonald's restaurant.  And a Chinese AK-47 was used in the Jan. 17 attack in a Stockton schoolyard  that left five children dead and 30 wounded in a matter of minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Chinese Model  </P> <P> More than 88,000 AK-47s, most of them from China, were imported into the United  States from January, 1985, through November, 1988, according to federal data.  About 75,000 Uzi carbines have been imported from Israel since 1980, according  to Action Arms Ltd. of Philadelphia, sole U.S. importer of the weapon.  </P> <P> Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials say their policy of allowing  importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons is based on a decision made  20 years ago by the Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel, which held  meetings during a two-month period in December, 1968, and January, 1969, and  then disbanded.  </P> <P> The bureau, in a written response to questions from The Times, said the federal  firearms panel did not examine Uzis or AK-47s, but determined that several  civilian models of other military weapons made in foreign countries "had a  particular use in target shooting and hunting."  </P> <P> "It was recommended that these types of semiautomatic versions of . . .  military rifles be approved for importation," the bureau statement said. The  bureau said that years later it used that evaluation in deciding to permit  importation of Uzis and AK-47s as sporting weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Saturday Night Specials'  </P> <P> But a former member of the federal firearms panel told The Times that the  six-member body paid scant attention to the importing of foreign rifles and  concentrated instead on handguns in an attempt to screen out cheap "Saturday  night specials."  </P> <P> Harold E. Johnson, a former Army weapons expert and now a private firearms  consultant, said the federal panel looked briefly at four semiautomatic  versions of foreign military rifles to make sure that they were not readily  convertible from semiautomatic to fully automatic fire.  </P> <P> (A fully automatic weapon, also called a machine gun, fires a steady stream of  bullets with a single pull of the trigger. A semiautomatic weapon fires one  bullet for each pull of the trigger.)  </P> <P> The panel did not try to determine whether the rifles were suitable for  sporting purposes, said Johnson, but the particular weapons examined "were  basically (suitable as) target rifles and relatively expensive. . . . There was  a lot of interest (in these rifles) in match shooting and a lot of collector  interest. But they were never used in crimes that I know of because they were  too big and expensive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Expensive Types  </P> <P> As for the smaller, less expensive imports such as the Uzi and AK-47, Johnson  said: "Nobody had ever thought about those. They weren't imported back in those  days."  </P> <P> The question of what constitutes the sporting purposes of a firearm has become  a central issue in the increasingly heated debates over proposed federal, state  and local legislation to outlaw assault weapons. Opponents of the firearms say  they are instruments of death, specifically designed to kill human beings.  Their defenders say they are not only collectors' items and guns that are  useful for self-defense, but also are suitable for sporting purposes.  </P> <P> What are the sporting purposes of a firearm?  </P> <P> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said a weapon must be suitable for  hunting or target shooting to be a sporting firearm and therefore importable.  Target shooting, said the bureau, does not include what is called "plinking" --  shooting at tin cans.  </P> <P> In the case of handguns, the bureau uses objective criteria developed by the  Treasury Department firearms evaluation panel to determine whether the weapons  are importable. The criteria, meant to prohibit importation of cheap handguns,  include such features as barrel length, weight, caliber, safety mechanisms and  construction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Criteria  </P> <P> But for rifles and shotguns, few such objective importation criteria exist.  </P> <P> To be importable for civilian use, a rifle -- like other weapons -- cannot be  capable of automatic fire. Neither can it be readily convertible to fully  automatic fire -- a judgment that is somewhat less objective.  </P> <P> Finally, there are the highly subjective hunting and target shooting questions.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms denied importation of a  South African riot shotgun called the Striker 12, maintaining that the weapon  had little hunting or target shooting value.  </P> <P> The bureau was unimpressed with the applicant's argument that "combat shotguns  are importable because they have sporting use, such as bowling pin shooting  competitions."  </P> <P> The effect of the importation ban, however, was short-lived. A copy of the  Striker 12 was soon produced domestically by an Atlanta company that called it  the Street Sweeper. It is advertised to the American public as having "awesome  firepower, 12 rounds in less than three seconds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Favored Nations  </P> <P> But neither the Uzi nor the AK-47 has been forced to undergo such a domestic  reincarnation. In the case of the Chinese-made AK-47, domestic production would  almost certainly cause an increase in price due to the higher cost of American  labor. The prices of both weapons are held down somewhat because both China and  Israel enjoy "most favored nation" status as trading partners of the United  States and pay low import fees.  </P> <P> Defenders of assault weapons argue that some of the firearms, such as the  American-made AR-15 and M1A, are popular and effective target rifles.  </P> <P> But are the Uzi and the AK-47 suitable for target or hunting purposes?  </P> <P> First, the Uzi.  </P> <P> The most popular model of the Uzi, made by Israel Military Industries, is the  carbine. It is a civilian copy of the submachine gun named after Uziel Gal, who  began development of the weapon for the Israeli armed forces in 1949.  </P> <P> The civilian version, like the military model, is a compact black rifle with a  folding stock that allows it to be fired from the hip as well as the shoulder.  With the stock folded, the import-model carbine is only 24.4 inches long, and  the ease of concealment causes concern among law enforcement officials. The  weapon holds magazines containing up to 32 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controlled in Israel  </P> <P> Although Americans in most states can buy the Uzi carbine across the counter,  it is not available to most civilians in Israel, where strict gun control laws  are in effect, according to Ilan Mor, spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in  Los Angeles. He said an exception is made for residents of settlements under  threat of terrorism, who may be issued weapons.  </P> <P> The Uzi carbine -- which sells for $500 to $700 -- was first introduced into  the United States for the civilian market in 1980 after several models were  rejected by federal authorities as too easily convertible to fully automatic  fire.  </P> <P> While the weapon finally approved for importation is not easily converted into  a fully automatic rifle, independent entrepreneurs have put a conversion kit on  the American market with which to do so.  </P> <P> "Anybody with any mechanical ability should (be able) to do it in an hour,"  said a federal weapons expert, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Such fully automatic Uzis subsequently began turning up in the hands of  criminals, but many of the conversion kits, which have been deemed illegal,  have been confiscated and the supply seems to be drying up, said the federal  weapons expert.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Collector Customers  </P> <P> C. B. Stern, operations manager for Action Arms, importer of the Uzi, said that  two-thirds of the customers who answer a company questionnaire said they bought  the weapons as collectors' items.  </P> <P> "The other third," he said, "is everything between home protection, plinking,  target shooting, self-defense . . . survival -- some people think Armageddon is  around the corner and they want to be ready."  </P> <P> As for target shooting -- one of the sporting criteria for importation -- the  Uzi, with its 9-millimeter pistol ammunition and short 16.1-inch barrel,  doesn't have the range or accuracy for rifle competition, gun experts say.  </P> <P> The public education division of the National Rifle Assn. indicates that Uzis  are not used in the national championship large-bore rifle competitions,  co-sponsored by the NRA. Neither is the weapon suitable for any kind of serious  hunting, gun experts say.  </P> <P> Ammunition magazines for the Uzi, which contain 20 to 32 bullets, are illegal  under the hunting regulations of some states that limit the amount of  ammunition a rifle may hold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not for Killing Animals  </P> <P> Jerry Upholt, executive director of the California Wildlife Federation and the  California Sportsman Lobby, said the Uzi does not have the range for hunting  game.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware of anybody that uses an . . . Uzi to go hunting," he said.  </P> <P> As head of the Sportsman Lobby, Upholt opposes abolition of assault rifles. He  said that rather than being a hunting weapon, the Uzi is "more suitable for  protection of the home and for recreation. . . . A lot of people like to go out  in the country and set up cans. . . . People love to plink with it."  </P> <P> The real appeal of the Uzi carbine to the non-criminal buyer, say many gun  experts, is its aura as an Israeli commando weapon.  </P> <P> "These are real fantasy toys (for) cabbage patch commandoes," said a federal  gun expert who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Ray Holt, general manager of B &amp; B Sales, a popular gun store in North  Hollywood, said of the weapon:  </P> <P> "The Uzi is designed to break in the door and kill everybody."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Enter the AK-47  </P> <P> The Chinese AK-47 arrived on the American scene in 1984, four years later than  the Uzi, but it seems to have overtaken the Israeli weapon in popularity,  probably because many models are cheaper -- selling for less than $300 -- and  because the AK-47 is much more powerful.  </P> <P> The AK-47 was developed as a fully automatic submachine gun by Mikhail  Kalashnikov for Soviet troops shortly after World War II and subsequently was  adopted by the armed forces of other Communist Bloc countries.  </P> <P> There is inescapable irony in the importation into the United States of the  civilian version of the weapon. Twenty years before an AK-47 was used by a  crazed gunman to kill Asian-American schoolchildren in Stockton, the military  version of the weapon was used by North Vietnamese troops to kill American  soldiers in Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> The AK-47 is being exported by a poor Third World communist country to a  wealthy capitalist nation, where it is used with increasing frequency by black  gang members to kill other impoverished blacks on the streets. While the weapon  is readily available in U.S. cities, strict gun-control regulations in China  prohibit ordinary citizens in urban areas from possessing AK-47s, or anything  comparable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holds 30-Round Clips  </P> <P> The AK-47 comes equipped with three banana clips, each holding 30 rounds. Drum  magazines holding up to 100 rounds are also available. A bayonet is frequently  included. Some models have folding stocks that make them more easily  concealable.  </P> <P> The main importers of the AK-47 are China Sports Inc. of Santa Fe Springs and  Keng's Firearm Specialty Inc. of Riverdale, Ga.  </P> <P> The annual Complete Book of Assault Rifles magazine said in its 1989 issue that  a dozen special "National Match AK-47s," equipped with 20.9-inch barrels and  accurate enough for target competition, have been imported from China.  </P> <P> But the standard AK-47 with its short 16.3-inch barrel and 7.62x39-millimeter  ammunition does not have the range or the accuracy to satisfy most serious  competitive shooters.  </P> <P> None of the competitors in last year's national championship large-bore rifle  competition, co-sponsored by the National Rifle Assn., used an AK-47, according  to the NRA's public education division.  </P> <P> "Most of the people who buy the guns use them to plink with," said Steve  Langford, marketing director of China Sports. "It is a gun that can be fun to  shoot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overkill for Game  </P> <P> Langford said the AK-47 is also used to hunt small- and medium-size game. But  the AK-47, while powerful enough to rip through one side of a car and out the  other in a drive-by shooting, is considered a marginal hunting weapon because  of its lack of range and accuracy.  </P> <P> Some hunting enthusiasts give the AK-47 a lukewarm endorsement.  </P> <P> Upholt of the California Wildlife Federation said he does not know anyone who  uses an AK-47 for hunting, although he noted that it is only slightly less  powerful than the lever-action 30-30, which is used for hunting deer at  relatively close range.  </P> <P> "It could be used for that purpose," said Upholt, who then expressed the view  of most hunters: "I prefer a bolt action."  </P> <P> Wayne Klein, a chief game warden in Northern California with the state  Department of Fish and Game, said his officers have not encountered AK-47s in  the field, but he has received reports of hunters with such weapons buying deer  hunting licenses.  </P> <P> "They acquired a gun and want to go deer hunting, but they're not deer  hunters," Klein said. "It's a trendy type of thing. Most deer hunters have  their favorite guns that they've been using a long time, not some Russian thing  that shows up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regulation Problems  </P> <P> As with the Uzi, the AK-47 also encounters the problem of regulations in some  states, other than California, that limit the number of bullets that can be  held in a hunter's rifle. Hunting magazines that hold five rounds may be  ordered for AK-47s, but are not standard equipment, gun dealers say.  </P> <P> Beyond the practical and legal questions, there is a philosophical issue in  using an AK-47 with a 30-round banana clip to hunt deer.  </P> <P> "It flies in the face of tradition as far as I'm concerned," said Lanny  Clavecilla, information officer with the California Department of Fish and  Game.  </P> <P> "A tenet of deer hunting," he explained, "is to cleanly take the animal with  one shot."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Rich Roberts and David Holley contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MARKETING OF ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> An American magazine specializes in assault weapons, many of which are  imported, while U.S. companies publish brochures promoting Chinese AK-47s,  above, and Israeli Uzis, below. Such weapons are pouring into the U.S. from  foreign countries, especially Israel and China, despite a federal law that bans  importation of firearms that are not for "sporting purposes."  </P></p>

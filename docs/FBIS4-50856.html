			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station editor Huang Zhiqing: "Boycotting </F> Travel to Mainland China Hurts Travel Agencies' Interests"; from  the "News and Current Events" program]    [Text] Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] has  directed the boycott of economic, trade, cultural, and other  exchanges with Mainland China under the pretext of the Qiandao  Lake incident. Travel agencies were the first to bear the brunt  of the boycott, following the announcement of a boycott of  package tours to Mainland China as of 1 May by the Taipei  Association of Travel Agencies. As of now, cross-strait economic  exchanges and trade remain brisk and are unstoppable, while the  travel agencies which play a leading role in the boycott have  suffered misfortune and incurred heavy losses.    The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted heavy  economic losses on travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and  Mainland China, with the losses suffered by those in Taiwan  especially heavy. Travel agencies who organize mainland-bound  tours represent a sizable proportion of all travel agencies in  Taiwan. In Taipei City alone, there are up to 100 travel  agencies that operate mainland-bound tours. It is estimated  that Taiwan's travel agencies incurred 200-300 million yuan in  losses as a result of suspending mainland-bound package tours in  April. Every year, the months of April through June are the  peak season for mainland-bound travel. Boycott-induced losses  incurred by travel agencies this year are inestimable.    The boycott of mainland-bound tours is against the will of  the majority of travel agencies. Travel agencies raised strong  objections when the boycott injunction was first issued on 13  April. They noted that the Association of Travel Agencies had  not consulted the organizations representing travel agencies  when it announced the boycott. They also complained that the  MAC should not use their business as a political bargaining chip.    The Qiandao Lake incident has been resolved. At the  invitation of Mainland China's Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Straits, officials of the Straits Exchange  Foundation, the victims' families, and relevant experts traveled  to Hangzhou on 8 May to deal with post-incident matters. It is  believed that efforts of relevant departments will lead to a  reasonable resolution of matters arising from the Qiandao Lake  incident.    The Association of Travel Agencies recently asked MAC to  call  off the boycott, citing the heavy losses suffered by travel  agencies, the prospect of closure facing travel agencies, and  attendant social problems. The MAC, however, asked travel  agencies to continue the boycott on the grounds that Mainland  China had not met three requests -- investigating the actual  state of affairs, paying compensation in the aftermath of the  incident, and determining who is to blame. This practice, which  is driven by self-interest without regard to the interests of  travel agencies, has compounded the woes of the latter who are  already in deep trouble.    Problems of one kind or another are inevitable in the  ever-expanding exchanges and contacts across the Taiwan Straits.  What matters is how the relevant departments on both sides of  the Taiwan Straits confront or resolve those problems. The  Taiwan authorities have played up the Qiandao Lake incident,  which is purely a criminal case, in order to politicize the  incident and to use the incident as a bargaining chip to  strengthen their political leverage with Mainland China. Such  actions will only hurt, not benefit, the sound development of  cross-strait relations.    The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted  unnecessary losses on travel agencies on the both sides of the  Taiwan Straits. However, people should heighten their vigilance  and prevent the boycott from snowballing and causing more  problems of a greater magnitude.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread Whitbread is starting to look more like a retailer than a brewer. Its answer to the challenge from volume brewers like Bass is to walk away from the battle for market share. Instead, it is now pushing its brand values, its strengths in the off-trade, and, above all, food where its turnover is beaten in the UK only by McDonalds. That looks a sensible approach. With a share of only 13.5 per cent of the UK beer market, Whitbread could hardly expect to win any battles based on volume. Instead of chasing low margin business in the free on-trade it is almost certainly better off concentrating on food where margins are higher and the gearing to recovery greater. Some risks remain. Whitbread will be at a disadvantage over brewers which can manage greater economies of scale. It must also resist pressures from supermarkets on its margins. The chances are that the sluggish beer market will continue to hold back growth this year, but its approach may still give it an edge over other brewers. Indeed the strategic question may eventually become one of the extent to which it should remain in brewing at all. Doubtless the arrival of Sir Michael Angus as chairman has helped focus Whitbread's thoughts. He also appears to have homed in on a financial weakness: poor cash generation. Last year's improvement reflected reduced spending on plant, property and acquisitions and there will be a smaller inflow from pub sales from now on. That should not matter much for a company with such modest gearing, but Whitbread's restrictive share structure precludes rights issues. It has to play safer on debt than others.</p>

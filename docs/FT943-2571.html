			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Financial team to advise Saudis Britain is to send a team of technical and financial experts to Saudi Arabia to advise King Fahd on the Saudi government's fledgling privatisation programme, Kevin Brown in Jeddah writes. British officials said the king confirmed the Saudi government's growing interest in privatisation during several hours of talks last night with Mr John Major, the prime minister, who is on a week-long trip to Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and South Africa. Officials said Britain had agreed to send two telecommunications experts to advise on the possible sale of the state telephone company. Saudi Arabia has given no formal indication of other industrial sectors which might be privatised, but the petrochemical industry and the state-owned airlines are thought to be prime candidates. Saudi Arabia is believed to be considering the privatisation of parts of the public sector to replenish reserves depleted by the cost of the Gulf war. Declining real prices for oil exports and rising spending, particularly on arms, have pushed the government's finances into deficit for 12 consecutive years. Mr Major also hopes to initiate privatisation discussions in South Africa, where he arrives tomorrow for the first official visit by a British prime minister since 1960. Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for privatisation, will have extensive talks with government and commercial officials to identify state assets which could be sold.</p>

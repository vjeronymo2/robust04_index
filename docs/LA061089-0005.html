			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRECINCT STUDY;  </P> <P> BERNARDI WON STRONG LATINO, BLACK SUPPORT  </P> <P> Precinct breakdowns from Tuesday's Los Angeles City Council election show that  Councilman Ernani Bernardi made a strong showing in black and Latino areas of  Pacoima and Lake View Terrace, apparently backing up his claims that he had  strong grass-roots support there.  </P> <P> As expected, Bernardi also retained strong showings in the few Van Nuys  neighborhoods that remain of his original district, which was drastically  redrawn toward the north in 1986.  </P> <P> There were few surprises in the results for challenger Lyle Hall, either. He  did best in Mission Hills -- where he is captain of the local fire station --  and near his Panorama City home, in Arleta and in parts of Sun Valley near the  Golden State Freeway.  </P> <P> But Hall lost the Panorama City precinct where he lives, 37% to Bernardi's 63%,  while Bernardi won the northern Van Nuys precinct where he lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fertile Ground  </P> <P> All of Lake View Terrace was fertile ground for Bernardi, but particularly the  neighborhoods nearest Lake View Medical Center, where he gained nearly  three-fourths of the vote.  </P> <P> Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn.,  attributed Bernardi's popularity in the area to his opposition to a proposal to  locate the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation in the defunct medical  center. Hall supported that proposal.  </P> <P> When the former First Lady killed the center plan by withdrawing her  participation 11 days before the election because of community opposition, Snow  said, Lake View Terrace residents felt that Bernardi's backing had contributed  to her decision.  </P> <P> Lake View Terrace also includes some of the most predominantly black areas of  the district, although with the low turnout in Tuesday's election -- not quite  20% of the voters registered in the 7th District -- it was not known whether  Bernardi actually drew a large black vote there.  </P> <P> Bernardi's best precinct was in southeast Lake View Terrace near the Little  Tujunga Wash, where he gained 85% of the vote. That is generally the more rural  area of Lake View Terrace, where horse owners endorsed Bernardi and praised him  for helping preserve their trails and rural life style.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lopez Canyon Landfill  </P> <P> The incumbent also won precincts closest to the Lopez Canyon Landfill, in Lake  View Terrace and Pacoima, even though Hall had taken a stronger position  against the city-operated dump.  </P> <P> During the primary, both candidates promised to call for immediate closure of  the dump, a step sought by many area residents. But in the runoff, Bernardi  said such a stance might not be realistic until alternative solutions for  disposing of Los Angeles' garbage could be found.  </P> <P> Sylmar, Los Angeles' fastest growing community, was an important battleground  in the runoff race for a San Fernando Valley City Council seat, campaign  consultants said. The more than 4,000 votes cast there in the primary showed  that it held enough votes to sway the election.  </P> <P> Sylmar is where both Bernardi and Hall located their campaign headquarters,  within a block of each other on Foothill Boulevard. Both campaigns organized  precinct walking, placard posting and telephoning in Sylmar neighborhoods.  </P> <P> When votes were tallied Tuesday, neither candidate had won the area decisively.  Of the 4,149 votes cast in Sylmar, 2,308 went to Bernardi and 1,841 to Hall.  </P> <P> Bernardi won the election by 1,658 votes -- 8,826 to 7,168.  </P> <P> Precinct-by-precinct totals show that Hall gained many of the neighborhoods  closest to San Fernando. His best precinct, where he gained 71% of the vote,  was between Glenoaks Boulevard and Herrick Avenue, next to San Fernando.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rural Neighborhoods  </P> <P> Bernardi won the more rural neighborhoods and most of the region northeast of  the Foothill Freeway. His campaign consultant, Allan Hoffenblum, said that once  again horse owners and other rural enthusiasts who backed Bernardi made the  difference there.  </P> <P> Hoffenblum also said Bernardi gained ground in Sylmar after the more  conservative voters there learned of Hall's endorsement by the liberal Edmund  G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., former California governor and current chairman of the  state Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Hall's campaign has insisted that Brown's endorsement did not hurt them with  conservative voters.  </P> <P> Already there are indications that Sylmar may prove to be an important  battleground in the 1993 City Council race.  </P> <P> Raymond Magana, who indicated interest in running this year but then decided to  help Bernardi instead, said he "would be very interested in running" in four  years. He lives in Sylmar and said he would work to gain the area's backing.  </P> <P> Jules S. Bagneris III, a candidate in the primary, recently said he may move  from Lake View Terrace to Sylmar to broaden his base of support in preparation  for the next council election.  </P></p>

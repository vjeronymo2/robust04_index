			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Gateway changes name to Somerfield The Gateway banner is to disappear from the UK's high streets, after the grocery retailer said yesterday it was changing the name of its stores and the group to Somerfield, and launching a Pounds 100m store refit programme. At the same time, Mr David Simons, chief executive, said the group had achieved a 12 per cent increase in like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, for the four weeks to January 1. He added that Gateway's sales since introducing its Price Check campaign of price reductions last May had increased by 20 per cent. Mr Simons said the name change was an important part of the programme to revive the group's fortunes. 'We wanted to unify the business behind one name,' he said. The Somerfield name, already carried by 60 shops launched four years ago, was chosen after trials involving eight modernised stores. Four were badged Gateway, and four Somerfield, but Mr Simons said the latter scored better in customer research. He believed the change would not cause confusion, as Gateway shoppers would recognise the Somerfield name as that used on its own-label products. The company plans three store conversions a week for at least the next two years. The refit cost is expected to be about Pounds 40 per sq ft - or more than Pounds 300,000 for an 'average' store of 8,000 sq ft. Gateway will spend another Pounds 100m over two years on introducing scanning into all its stores, plus new systems to improve efficiency. Mr Simons said the investment would be funded largely out of profits, and was envisaged at last April's financial restructuring, when Gateway was ringfenced from all but Pounds 500m of the Pounds 1.4m debt of its parent, Isosceles. 'When we agreed the business plan with the banks it was understood that investment would be required if the group was to prosper,' he said. Gateway said it had seen double digit sales growth in the eight pilot stores. The refit includes a change in the external colour scheme to turquoise, blue and red, new fittings and better signs. Fresh food areas will be extended, and one innovation includes fitting calculators on all shopping trolleys. Existing Somerfield stores will not be changed. Mr Simons said it was possible some Gateway stores might close in locations where there was more than one, but the planned expansion of the group's 25 Food Giant discount stores meant total floor space would remain little changed.</p>

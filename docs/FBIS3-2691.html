The Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] will soon  open at the Great Hall of the People. The magnificent meeting  hall is all lightened up; all NPC deputies are waiting for the  arrival of the solemn moment. In the capacity of the executive  chairman of the Second Session of the Eighth NPC Presidium and  as executive chairman of today's session, Chairman Qiao Shi will  preside over the session's opening ceremony. As soon as he  entered the lounge, he cordially shook hands with and extended  his regards to Vice President Rong Yiren, and then sat down next  to Ann Tse Kai, vice chairman of the Eighth National Committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CPPCC]. He asked Ann Tse Kai with concern if she could get  used to life in Beijing since she just arrived from Hong Kong,  and then talked about resuming sovereignty rights over Hong  Kong. Qiao Shi said: On the Hong Kong issue, our stand is  consistent. The responsibility for the breakdown of the Sino-  British talks on the Hong Kong issue is totally on the British  side. We are firm and unshakable in resuming sovereignty rights  over Hong Kong in 1997.    Speaking of the Second Session, Qiao Shi said: "This year's  work and objectives have been clearly defined. According to the  responsibility entrusted to the NPC by the Constitution, we  should quicken the pace of legislation, strengthen supervision,  regularize the socialist market economic system, and ensure that  the state's major policies are smoothly and thoroughly carried  out."    At 0850, General Secretary Jiang Zemin entered the lounge  and  sat down next to CPPCC National Committee Chairman Li Ruihuan.  They talked about stepping up building socialist spiritual  civilization. While they were chatting, Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and foreign minister, approached  Jiang Zemin and said: "The UN Committee on Human Rights has  vetoed an anti-China resolution tabled by some countries."  Jiang Zemin said: "Trying to make human rights an issue cannot  win people's support. We should justly and forcefully refute  them." Premier Li Peng, who had just come into the lounge,  added: "I plan to make our stand clear on this particular issue  in today's government work report." Jiang Zemin said: "Good!"    Turning to the Second Session, Jiang Zemin said: "Currently,  the general situation is very good and the major principles and  policies have been laid down. The key problem now is for people  of all nationalities to work together with one heart and in a  down-to-earth manner."    Premier Li Peng, who was about to step up to the podium to  deliver a report on the government's work, smilingly told  reporters: "Comrade Xiaoping has always favored short and solid  reports. This year's report gives prominence to the theme of  reform, development, and stability, and we have tried our best  to make the report realistic. Comrades and friends from all  sectors have offered many valuable opinions on the draft report;  I am very grateful to them. I also hope that, during the Second  Session, all NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members  will speak freely and offer more opinions on the report."    "Reform is the driving force, development is the goal, and  maintaining stability is the first priority. The general  guidelines and principle for this year's work have been set; so,  as long as we can properly handle the relationships between  reform, development, and maintaining stability, and as long as  we work with one heart and one mind, we will be in an  impregnable position," added Li Ruihuan.    The atmosphere in the lounge was warm. Zhu Rongji, Liu  Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and other comrades also cheerfully chatted  with comrades sitting next to them.    Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun, who also is executive chairman of  the Second Session Presidium, arrived at the Great Hall very  early to inspect the preparatory work for the opening ceremony.  He also inspected the podium's audio system. At the lounge, he  asked Zou Jiahua: "At which delegation are you going to hear  deputies' opinions?" Zou Jiahua replied: "I am a member of the  Sichuan Provincial delegation." "The Sichuan delegation is a  big one," Tian Jiyun said. "Sure, Sichuan's population accounts  for 10 percent of the country's," Zou Jiahua said. The two  leaders then discussed how to take effective measures to further  improve large and medium state-owned enterprises.    Seeing Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, coming toward him, Wu Bangguo, secretary  of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, stepped toward him and  told him: "The day before yesterday, we relayed the Third  Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission  guidelines to lower levels; these guidelines are being further  carried out." They said the anticorruption struggle must be  carried out continuously and in a penetrating manner in the new  year.    "You have been doing very well in Shandong!" said Wang  Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, to Jiang  Chunyun, secretary of the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee.  "It is very kind of you. There is still a lot we need to learn  from our fraternal provinces and municipalities," Jiang Chunyun  said modestly.    Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin, who also is executive chairman of  the Second Session Presidium, asked reporters to make sure they  file more reports on the NPC's legislative work because it is an  important assurance for building and refining the socialist  market economic system, for accelerating economic development,  and for promoting social progress.    The bell is ringing for the opening ceremony.    While walking to the meeting hall from the lounge, the  leading comrades still enthusiastically chatted with each other.  The discussions of those attending the Second Session -- some  of them may have or may not have seen each other often, some are  and some are not CPC members, some are with the central  authorities and some are from various localities, and many are  from different posts and fronts -- focused on one [as published]  subject: reform, development, stability, and striving for new  victories in the new year.</p>

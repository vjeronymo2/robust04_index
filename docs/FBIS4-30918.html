			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 29 -- The third congress of the  All-Poland Alliance of Trade-Unions (OPZZ) which ended on Sunday  re-elected Ewa Spychalska the OPZZ chairwoman for a four-year  term. During a three-day debate the congress stressed the need  to be independent and define its place in the coalition of  groupings forming the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). One of  the seventeen resolutions adopted by the third congress  recommended that the union deputies circle be set up within the  SLD caucus.    Spychalska said in her address that the union is not going  to  "unfold any umbrella over any government." Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak, who was the congress guest on Saturday said,  commenting Spychalska's statement, that "I am glad the  government will not be under the umbrella, we will have to be  careful so that we are not out of the frying pan into the fire."    He added that the government will be fulfilling the  coalition  promises and another revaluation of pensions and retirement  benefits will be carried out in June.    Another congress guest Grzegorz Kolodko, the deputy PM  [prime  minister] and finance minister presented the government-prepared  plan of Poland's long-term development, entitled "The Strategy  for Poland." Kolodko said that when implemented, the programme  may bring about a 22 per cent growth of gross national product  (GNP) within four years and a 15 per cent growth of consumption  in real terms.    Commenting on Ewa Spychalska's statement that "the OPZZ does  not have any obligations to the Social Democracy of the Republic  of Poland (SDRP), Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SDRP leader said  that none of his statements about the OPZZ suggested unilateral  obligations of the alliance towards the SDRP. "We have mutual  obligations because we participated in the (September 19)  elections together," Kwasniewski argued.    In adopted resolutions, the congress delegates demanded a  100  per cent revaluation of pensions and retirement benefits, based  on the average wages' growth. They also demanded that  government take immediate measures aimed at solving the crisis  in housing construction.    The congress protested against "the hitherto passive policy"  of the government in fighting unemployment.    Spychalska told newsmen after the conclusion of the congress  that the OPZZ authorities are considering whether to sign  contracts with political parties in order to be able to withdraw  union deputies from parliamentary work as their union activities  are restricted closely as if they were "in a corset".    Spychalska also stressed the need to strengthen the trade  union movement in the private sector.    Alfred Miodowicz, the first OPZZ chairman has been chosen  head of the committee for the preparation of the celebrations  marking the tenth anniversary of the organisation's activity.</p>

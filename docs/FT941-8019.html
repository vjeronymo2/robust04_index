			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Electricity bills face rise from nuclear levy Electricity bills, which already face the imposition of value added tax, could also be hit by a rise in the nuclear levy to offset the recent price-capping agreement in the power generation industry. The levy, now 11 per cent, provides more than Pounds 1bn a year of the money needed by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned nuclear utility, to cover the cost of decommissioning ageing plant. A small proportion of it also goes to finance renewable forms of energy such as wind farms. The price-capping agreement by National Power and PowerGen will reduce electricity bills and also, therefore, the yield from the levy. This means that it will have to be raised if it is to reach its target of Pounds 8.5bn by 1998, when it is due to be phased out. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator who arranged the price-capping agreement and sets the levy, recently announced that it would fall from 11 per cent to 10 per cent next April. He was thought to be responding to government pressure to offset the introduction of VAT on home heating. But the levy is already several hundred million pounds below target, and the combination of the cut and price-capping means it will almost certainly have to be raised quite sharply to get it back on course. Dr Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, yesterday accused Prof Littlechild of granting the generators 'a licence to collude' by sanctioning the price-capping arrangement, which Offer, the electricity regulator, says could lead to a 7 per cent cut in wholesale electricity prices. Nuclear Electric stands to lose more than Pounds 200m a year from the agreement because it sells most of its output in the wholesale market. This is on top of whatever it loses from the reduction in the levy. Dr Hawley said that National Power and PowerGen agreed to price-capping only because their profits were protected by long-term contracts to sell electricity to the retail market. Delay in reaching the price-capping agreement - originally due by the end of last year - has also forced the government to reconsider the timing of its sale of the residual 40 per cent shareholding in National Power and PowerGen. Originally set for next autumn, the Pounds 4bn sale is now likely to be postponed to February 1995. However, provided the government can complete the sale by the end of March 1995, the revenues will still enable it to achieve its target of Pounds 5.5bn privatisation receipts in the next financial year.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett named as Dairy Crest broker Dairy Crest, the milk processing and dairy products subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, has appointed Hoare Govett as the stockbroker to handle its flotation next year. The float is expected to give Dairy Crest a market value of about Pounds 500m and raise Pounds 150m of new money. Schroders has already been appointed as the merchant bank for the issue. Dairy farmers will have shares in Dairy Crest, a factor which will complicate the flotation. The appointment of Hoare Govett, chosen from a number of contenders, gives a boost to the broker which had suffered from uncertainty of ownership until it was bought by ABN Amro, the Netherlands bank, last June. Hoare Govett has recently been appointed broker to Irish Permanent Building Society.</p>

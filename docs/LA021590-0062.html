			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULES FOR CHOLESTEROL CUTBACKS  </P> <P> The following is advice from the American Dietetic Assn. for those interested  in reducing dietary intake of cholesterol and maintaining an overall healthful  diet.  </P> <P>  -- Cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin.  </P> <P>  -- Eat five or more servings of a combination of fruits and vegetables --  especially green and yellow vegetables and citrus fruits -- per day. An average  serving is equal to one-half cup for most fresh or cooked vegetables or one  piece of fruit.  </P> <P>  -- Increase starches and other complex carbohydrates by eating six or more  daily servings of a combination of breads, cereals and legumes. An average  serving is equal to one slice of bread, one roll or muffin or one-half cup dry  or cooked cereal or legumes.  </P> <P>  -- Eat moderate amounts of lean meat, skinless poultry, fish and nonfat or  low-fat dairy products.  </P> <P>  -- Eat fewer foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol by reading package  labels for content.  </P> <P>  -- Be aware that lean, light or 95% fat-free food labels can be misleading and  that these foods can be loaded with calories from just fat.  </P> <P>  -- Eat more unsaturated fats, such as those found in most vegetable oils and  nuts.  </P> <P>  -- Exercise regularly; it helps lower blood cholesterol levels and can protect  against osteoporosis.  </P> <P>  -- Bake, broil, microwave or poach meat, poultry and fish instead of frying.  </P> <P>  -- Trim visible fat from meat and poultry and drain meats after browning.  </P> <P>  -- Defat cooked soups, stews and gravies by cooling, then skimming off  hardened fat.  </P> <P>  -- Use nonstick pans and vegetables sprays when sauteing.  </P> <P>  -- Substitute seasoned tomato juice, broth or wine for gravy; low-fat or  nonfat yogurt for sour cream; skim milk for whole milk in recipes, and ice milk  or low-fat frozen yogurt for ice cream at dessert time.  </P> <P>  -- Never assume that low cholesterol means low in fat. Liquid nondairy  creamers, for example, have no cholesterol but they have up to 90% fat  calories.  </P> <P>  -- Watch out for sugar hidden in juice drinks, cereals, spaghetti sauce and  luncheon meats.  </P> <P>  -- Leave some food on the plate or request a doggie bag when dining out.  </P> <P>  -- Split an entree with a friend and share the calories in restaurants.  </P> <P>  -- Substitute fruit or small green salads for French fries.

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROSES GROW WHERE STROLLERS DIED  </P> <P> One year after four pedestrians were killed when a suspected drunk driver  slammed into them at a Glendale intersection, a rose garden was dedicated to  the memory of the victims on the median divider where the accident occurred.  </P> <P> More than 200 Glendale residents walked silently to the divider at the north  fork of Verdugo Road and Canada Boulevard at dusk Thursday, many holding hands,  bearing flowers and weeping softly in memory of the two young mothers and  daughters killed on July 13 of last year.  </P> <P> Valerie Cramer, 32; her daughter Brianna, 9; Patricia Carr, 36, and her  daughter Karen, 6, were waiting on the median divider while on an evening  stroll about 8:30 p.m. when a speeding car struck them on the unprotected  island, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Billy Cramer, 12, the only survivor, said during a preliminary hearing in  January that he saw the car coming and threw himself flat before he could yell  a warning. He suffered a broken finger and an injured knee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Outraged  </P> <P> The accident gave rise to widespread community anger at drunk drivers and shock  at the deaths. In April, Glendale city officials allocated $16,000 to create  the memorial. The plants in the garden were paid for by private donations.  </P> <P> As hundreds of pink and white balloons reading "Please Don't Drink and Drive"  were released, Bill Cramer, whose wife and daughter were killed in the crash,  held a friend's hand and stared at the garden.  </P> <P> "Before it was landscaped, I used to cry every time I went by this," Cramer  said. "Now it's pretty. It makes it bearable. And the roses look like the  girls."  </P> <P> The garden is planted with four varieties of pink floribunda rose bushes, each  representing one of the victims. The memorial also includes a granite plaque  engraved with the victims' names.  </P> <P> The city has since installed guard rails to protect pedestrians on the island  and changed traffic signals to slow approaching vehicles.  </P> <P> The driver of the car, William K. Conway, 27, is free on bail pending a trial  scheduled to begin Sept. 13 in Pasadena Superior Court. Conway is charged with  four counts of manslaughter and one count of causing an accident with injuries  while driving under the influence of alcohol.  </P></p>

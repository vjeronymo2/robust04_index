			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ruben Dario Carles, Change `94 presidential </F> candidate; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Those of us here make up the best presidential  slate, and you know it because I have insisted that,  individually and collectively, we are the best option for the  country. In view of all the announcements recently made and the  statements recently released, we must make the following  observations. We already talked with leaders of the Molirena  [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], Morena [National  Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal Party. Paradoxically, we  the democrats make these statements, convinced that we will  accept the results released by the National Vote-Counting Board  as definite and fully valid.    Although many people never believed in elections, nor  respect  public opinion, we say here that we will accept what the  Electoral Tribunal [TE] has to say. We must also say that,  according to the information already released by it, 48 to 50  percent of the votes have yet to be counted. In light of this  situation, it would be irresponsible to declare any party or  group of parties the winner. It would be even more  irresponsible to declare an individual the winner when all the  information has not yet been released. We know for sure that  the information so far released by the TE lacks the foundations  to give an opinion due to the relative importance of certain  provinces and electoral districts in terms of number of voters.  Thus, I believe in a country where an urban, suburban, or rural  vote is relatively significant because of the many interests of  its sectors.    I refuse to say that this or that slate won in Chiriqui,  Veraguas, or any other province. We will accept the TE results  when all votes have been counted. We will also subject our  approval, as far as the results are concerned, to the honest and  fair counting of votes for legislative, mayoral, corregimiento  representative, and councilmen candidates. I repeat: About 48  to 50 percent has to be taken into account properly. These  votes represent an enormous difference for the future of our  country.    As I said before, those who are here with me and those who  are running with me are the most capable people. Our plans are  the best ones. We also offer the best options for legislators,  mayors, and corregimiento representatives. I refuse to say that  a specific person is the winner, because giving opinions on a  process that is still incomplete would be absurd.    Regardless of the results, the country will have as a future  reference the fact that we offered the most capable people to  rule. Those of us who will stay here because we live here and  who have fought for justice and democracy now have the authority  to become the opposition. [applause]</p>

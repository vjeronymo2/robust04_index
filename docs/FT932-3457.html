			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Policy Portfolio poised for main market with Pounds 11m tag POLICY Portfolio, a market-maker in second hand endowment policies, is planning to join the main market next month. The company is likely to raise up to Pounds 5m via a placing, sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney, and will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 11m. Endowment policies are frequently used in the UK as a means of repaying a mortgage. Returns on so-called 'with profits' endowments can depend heavily on a terminal bonus, which is only paid to those who keep up policies for the full term, often 25 years. Those who give up their policy before the full term normally receive a 'surrender value' determined by the life company. The second hand market grew up as investors who were dissatisfied with surrender values sold their policies to third parties, who intended to keep up the payments and receive the full benefit of the terminal bonus. Policy Portfolio, a member of FIMBRA, was founded in 1988 by Mr Isaac Rubin who had himself invested in second hand policies in the early 1980s. The group buys policies from investors and attempts to sell them at a profit. To date, the group has financed itself from bank borrowings and the issue will give it the capital base to expand. Pre-tax profits have grown from Pounds 245,000 in the year to March 31 1991 to an estimated Pounds 817,000, on turnover of Pounds 7.91m, in the year to March 31 1993. The market for second hand policies was about Pounds 80m last year, giving Policy Portfolio a market share of 10 per cent, behind Foster &amp; Cranfield and Beale Dobie - part of the quoted Hambro Insurance Services. The second hand market is expanding rapidly in response to the large number of endowment policies sold in the 1980s.</p>

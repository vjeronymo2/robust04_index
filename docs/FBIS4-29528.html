			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yi Hong-ku, South Korean deputy prime </F> minister and minister of unification appearing in split screen  from unspecified place, by KBS anchorman Yi Yun-song, in studio  -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Anchorman Yi Yun-song] How are you, Minister Yi?  President Kim Il-song's recent proposal for a summit was made  through a third person, namely former U.S. President Carter, not  through official channels. What is behind the government's  assessment that official verification of the North's intention  is not necessary?    [Minister Yi Hong-ku] If a proposal is related to internal  relations or is put forward between two different countries, it  should be made through diplomatic channels and be examined  through official means. However, as you know, this is related to  an international issue of the nation, and there is no fixed  procedure for this kind of event.    We assessed that the North's intention conveyed by former  U.S. President Carter is relatively precise. Therefore, we  decided to push ahead for the talks.    [Anchorman Yi] As you, Mr. Minister, pointed out earlier,  acceptance of the proposal for a summit and our proposal for  holding a working-level contact for the summit have taken place  simultaneously. Is there any special reason for us to propose  first a working-level contact?    [Minister Yi] As all of our people may agree, the situation  on and around the Korean peninsula is very strained. This being  the case, we think that if one decides to resolve all problems,  including the strained situation, through summit talks, we  should push ahead with such talks as soon as possible. This is  precisely the reason we put forward the proposal first.    Besides, we maintained the position that all problems can be  sufficiently discussed between the top leaders of both sides.  Therefore, there would be no serious obstacles in preparing the  summit.    [Anchorman Yi] How does the government grasp the true  intention of the North side in proposing a North-South summit at  this point?    [Minister Yi] As we know, former U.S. President Carter  recently visited North Korea. However, in view of the  international atmosphere and of the atmosphere on the Korean  peninsula, it is highly likely that the North Korean side drew a  conclusion that a resolution of all problems would be difficult  without direct dialogue between the North and South, which are  the very relevant parties.    [Anchorman Yi] How will you deal with the issue of nuclear  transparency in the future?    [Minister Yi] The issue of nuclear transparency is an  important, inevitable issue for a solution to the nuclear  problem. Therefore, this issue will always remain as an  important one in the future as well. However, we do not intend  to raise this issue during the forthcoming preliminary contact  because we want to advance the contact to a summit without  wrangling with each other over agenda items, just as in the  past. This is why we do not directly mention the issue.    [Anchorman Yi] People think that a summit without any  substantive result and a summit merely for the sake of a summit  is not desirable. What we are most worried about is that the  summit may result only in giving time to North Korea for its  suspected nuclear development. How do you view this?    [Minister Yi] Such worries are quite natural. However, as  our president has mentioned many times, our position is not to  hold talks merely for the sake of talks. The very situation we  are facing today necessitates talks between the North and the  South. This is why we are pushing ahead with the talks.    Who would benefit from these talks is an issue that we  should  cautiously examine. However, we believe that holding talks would  be beneficial to both sides and to our nation.    [Anchorman Yi] The world, although welcoming it, is  generally  showing a cautious reaction to the North-South summit proposal.  How is the government analyzing external conditions for a summit?    [Minister Yi] History shows that summits were not successful  on the Korean peninsula despite brisk discussions for their  realization. This being the case, no one can be sure about the  success in talks. This is why some people have expectations and  hope for the talks while the others are worried about them.    Nevertheless, we believe it is right that at a time when the  Cold War has ended, both, the North and South should directly  seek means for the resolution of problems based on the principle  for solving problems by those who are directly concerned. This  is the position of our side in pushing for the talks.    [Anchorman Yi] Thank you for your interview today.</p>

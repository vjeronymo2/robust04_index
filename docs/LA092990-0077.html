			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> THE NEW SEASON;  </P> <P> 'GOOD GRIEF': A NOT-SO-WISE UNDERTAKING  </P> <P> The new Fox comedy series "Good Grief" is as funny as a funeral.  </P> <P> Premiering at 9:30 p.m. Sunday on Channels 11 and 6, it's about funerals, in  fact, starring Howie Mandel as sleazy Ernie Lapidus, whose attempts to impose  his used-car-salesman mentality on Sincerity Mortuary outrages his  brother-in-law (Joel Brooks), who ran the dignified family business on his own  until Ernie married his sister (Wendy Schaal).  </P> <P> The opening story finds Ernie hawking the mortuary in TV commercials and  scheming to confiscate a fancy sports car that a client was buried in and  replace it with a Pinto.  </P> <P> This half-hour is a Pinto -- all chromed up with a gyrating hula girl in the  rear window and a pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rear-view mirror.  </P> <P> In the second episode -- which introduces Ernie's con-artist friend Ringo (Tom  Poston) -- Ernie announces that he will honor a transvestite's request to be  buried in a dress, shocking the dead man's family. The concluding eulogy is  grating witlessness. They should have buried this script.  </P> <P> Put "Good Grief" in the category of good ideas left in the oven too long.  Instead of approaching Evelyn Waugh's grossly funny satire of the burial  business in "The Loved One" and its ensuing movie version, "Good Grief" gives  you only the gross. Instead of black humor, you get only the black -- endless  overbaked gags accompanied by laughter that sounds as if it was run through an  echo chamber. Better a cremation chamber.

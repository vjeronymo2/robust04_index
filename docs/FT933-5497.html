			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Bosnian foes peer into the abyss: Karadzic warns Moslems former Yugoslav republic could be carved into two MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday warned the Moslems that Bosnia could be divided in two following the collapse of peace talks on Wednesday. 'Carving up Bosnia in two pieces would never happen by our intention but it may happen by the events,' he said in Geneva shortly before the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems prepared to leave the negotiations. Mr Karadzic said the Serbs had offered the Moslems a 3km corridor linking enclaves in Serb-held eastern Bosnia, meeting one of Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic's three territorial demands. 'The Moslems accepted the concession but they wanted more,' he said, but added that the Serbs would never yield Moslem towns they conquered in the west of Bosnia as Mr Izetbegovic wanted. Mr Karadzic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman both said they had expected a deal until the last moment. 'I was surprised in a way because very important circles were convinced Alia Izetbegovic would agree to the plan,' Mr Tudjman told Croatian radio on his return to Zagreb. Breakdown of the talks has led to mounting concern over the threat of renewed fighting in central Bosnia and signs that the US would step up pressure on the Serbs and Croats for a settlement. Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations' special envoy, said the breakdown of negotiations had been 'a great tragedy', since the parties had come so near an agreement. 'I fear more war and more suffering, more people being killed, which is an awful result,' he said. International mediator Lord Owen had earlier warned of 'fragmentation, anarchy, warlords and chaos' in Bosnia - and indicated that part of the blame for the breakdown lay in the lack of support the agreement had received from western countries. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, yesterday met Mr Stoltenberg to discuss the crisis. Mr Boutros Ghali is to issue a report to the Security Council warning of the potentially 'devastating' effect on the civilian population. A senior US official in Geneva yesterday held out the hope that the three leaders would have a change of heart because the remaining differences were 'small'. The three sides in the conflict said they still believed a peace deal would be possible, and pledged to try to broker a ceasefire. However, Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN special envoy, said in Zagreb there was a 'real possibility' of fighting continuing throughout the winter, particularly in central Bosnia, where Moslem and Croat forces have engaged in skirmishes in recent days. A UN protection force spokesman in Zagreb yesterday confirmed that sporadic clashes were continuing in central Bosnia, although not on a scale that suggested that either the Croats or Moslems had yet launched a serious assault. But, in another sign of the rising tensions in the region, UN officials in Sarajevo accused Bosnian Croat forces of forcing more than 3,000 Moslem women and children from their homes in recent days. Croat leaders denied the charges and claimed that Moslem forces were harassing the small Croat enclaves in central Bosnia. Amid signs that the western world remained deeply devided over what action to take, diplomatic sources yesterday said that the threat of air strikes or sanctions against Croatia was now likely to re-emerge in the coming days. Both British and German officials however yesterday stressed that a negotiated settlement remained the only solution to the Bosnian settlement. Some British and US officials are understood to favour extending economic sanctions to Croatia, in an effort to force the Croats to lift their siege of Mostar and possibly make new concessions in the negotiations. However Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, indicated at a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary in Germany on Wednesday that he remained opposed to this, preferring to use his diplomatic influence over the Croats. The breakdown of the Geneva conference came almost one year after its launch. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatia's President Tudjman were livid with rage on Wednesday night as Mr Izetbegovic sat impassively in Geneva's Palais des Nations. Mr Izetbegovic, a Moslem, yesterday defended his decision to hold out for further territorial concessions in spite of warnings about the imminent danger of an upsurge in violence. 'The signing of this plan would be tantamount to a collective suicide for the Moslems,' he said before leaving Geneva for talks with Mr Suleiman Demirel, the president of Turkey who is one of Bosnia's main backers. 'Either we get a viable state, or no deal,' he said. Mr Izetbegovic plans to address the Security Council in New York on Monday. Mr Izetbegovic appeared to dismiss the threat of more war, saying that Sarajevo could survive another winter. Both sides said they would respect a ceasefire agreement. Mr Izetbegovic had reluctantly agreed to Bosnia's partition into a union of three 'ethnic' republics. Under intense pressure and faced with Serb and Croat military victories, on Wednesday he scaled down his demands to a 'minimum of minimums' of 34 per cent. 'I did not understand,' said Mr Karadzic when asked why the talks broke down. 'I cannot believe the Moslems are refusing this offer, which is honest and fair.' But the senior US official yesterday made clear that Serbs and Croats are now expected to hand over more territory.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bosnia-Hercegovina: fears grow of an intensified war  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mid-summer As the Geneva peace talks started up in July, the alliance between Croat and Moslem allies had long broken down: the Moslem-lead Bosnian army had pushed back Croat forces in central Bosnia, Croat forces stepped up the assault on Mostar's Moslem sector, and the Serbs continued the assualt on other Moslem enclaves, cutting off Goradze from Sarajevo, isolating Tesanj and surrounding Sarajevo, prompting Nato in early August to threaten the Serbs with air strikes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Now By the time the talks stalled this week, Moslem forces had made considerable gains, while the Croats had succeeded in beseiging Mostar. After taking Bugojno, Moslem forces are now attacking Konjic and appear to be preparing an assault on the Makljen ridge. Croat forces are reportedly being reinforced and preparing an assault to defend their enclaves in central Bosnia. Despite Serb threats of a new assault, Serb lines have remained fairly static, though fighting continues around Brcko.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed partition The Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the land and have achieved most of their military aims, would see their portion reduced to 52 per cent. The Bosnian Moslems, who control 10 per cent, would receive 28 per cent, though losing some recently conquered land and have only tenuous access to the Adriatic and their eastern enclaves. Some Moslem commanders hope to wrest more land, though, in practice, their forces would be little match for a Serb assault or reinforced Bosnian Croats.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: HIGHLAND PARK;  </P> <P> ONE OF FIRST SUBURBS GETS A SECOND WIND;  </P> <P> YOUNG PROFESSIONALS ATTRACTED BY CLOSE-IN LOCATION, HOME PRICES THEY CAN  AFFORD.  </P> <P> The Rev. Jim Friedrich moved there because it "was the only place that didn't  seem to have this air of unreality about it, that was within a reasonable range  of affordability."  </P> <P> Kathy Hanks moved there from Fullerton with her husband and their then  5-week-old baby because "the drive was a killer and the things we like to do  were up there."  </P> <P> Steve Johnsen "looked in all the normal places" and then moved there with his  wife and daughter because "we fell in love with our house."  </P> <P> "There" is Highland Park, an older community of rolling hills covered with  distinctive single-family houses, halfway between downtown Los Angeles and  Pasadena. The largely Latino area is undergoing re-gentrification, an influx of  younger homeowners with higher income levels.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, people wouldn't even get off the freeway to look at homes  here," says Bill Raftery, a realtor with Uptown Properties.  </P> <P> "Now, with the preservation movement -- there are some 30 historic register  homes where once there were only five -- combined with the affordability and  the need for people to move back into the city, we're getting a wave of  people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looked in Other Areas  </P> <P> Friedrich, 44, is one of the new wave of residents transforming the once-sleepy  community. An Episcopal priest at St. Augustine by-the-Sea in Santa Monica and  president of Cathedral Films in Agoura, a religious media company, Friedrich  looked in Topanga Canyon, Pasadena and Santa Monica before settling on top of a  hilltop in Highland Park.  </P> <P> A renter in Studio City for the past 16 years, Friedrich paid "something over  $250,000" for his first home, a 2,200-square-foot house built in 1905 that only  needed light detail work.  </P> <P> "My street has stability and residential stillness, the block is kind of an  anchored neighborhood," he said. The area is "close to everything but tucked  away. . . ."  </P> <P> Kathy Hanks also bought an old house. Since moving in last October, Hanks, 31,  an analyst with the Los Angeles County Treasurer's office, said she and her  husband, Michael, 32, a finance analyst in the county's Chief Administrative  Office, are busy "restoring the period fixtures, redoing plumbing and  electrical while working around our new baby."  </P> <P> Both wanted to end the commute from Orange County to their downtown jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rent Out Apartment  </P> <P> "We heard about the great bargains here," Mike Hanks said, "and next thing we  knew, we were signing on the bottom line. We both fell in love immediately"  with the 86-year-old, four-bedroom, two-bath 1,800-square-foot Craftsman-style  house.  </P> <P> The house cost $230,000; a one-bedroom apartment out back helps them meet the  mortgage.  </P> <P> The only problems so far: Their car has been broken into and they have to go to  the San Fernando Valley to find large discount home fix-it stores.  </P> <P> But these are small concerns. Kathy Hanks said they "really love L.A." and love  not having to make "that killer commute."  </P> <P> The Hankses' experience with their car is typical, according to Northeast  Division Police Sgt. Mike Nichol. "The major crime is theft from autos (radios,  etc.). Highland Park has the second-lowest crime rate in our division, after  Silver Lake," he said.  </P> <P> And, outside of an outbreak of gang violence in 1985, "crime in Highland Park  usually remains about status quo," Nichol said. The local gangs "are still  there, but pretty quiet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Early Suburb  </P> <P> Like Mt. Washington on its western border, Highland Park in the early 1900s  became one of the first suburbs of Los Angeles, home to a new middle class and  a large contingent of artists and writers attracted to the hills and canyons.  </P> <P> There was a significant religious component as well: Monte Vista Street has  many churches that were built a half-century ago as well as one of the earliest  synagogues in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The coming of the Arroyo Seco Parkway -- now known as the Pasadena Freeway --  signaled the beginning of the area's decline. North Figueroa Street, which had  become a strong commercial district in the 1930s, was bypassed by potential  customers on their way to and from Los Angeles and Pasadena. Highland Park  settled into its sleepy ways.  </P> <P> It remains a community in search of a center. Two landmarks have gone under in  recent years: The Northeast Division police headquarters on York Boulevard was  moved to Atwater (the two-story brick building, vacant since 1983, is now a  popular film location used for its old-fashioned jail cells and booking room).  </P> <P> And Iver's department store on Figueroa Street closed in 1984 after 71 years at  the same spot, leaving a large vacuum. The once-proud family-owned store is now  a mini-mall, and there is no large or well-known store to anchor the  10-block-long shopping strip along North Figueroa Street between Avenues 50 and  60, Highland Park's main drag.  </P> <P> The cultural attractions are scattered, but well worth searching out:  </P> <P> The Southwest Museum houses the nation's greatest collection of American Indian  artifacts; Heritage Square is a collection of one-of-a-kind 19th- and  20th-Century houses moved to a vacant field next to the Pasadena Freeway.  </P> <P> Another is El Alisal, the home of Highland Park's most famous resident, Charles  Lummis, a pioneer in the preservation of Southwest architecture and artifacts  and founder of the Southwest Museum (1914), who walked to California in 1885  from Ohio to become the first city editor of The Times. Lummis died in 1928.  </P> <P> Steve Johnsen, 36, a free-lance graphic designer, said the cultural attractions  are just one of many reasons that he and his wife, Pearl Beach, a free-lance  illustrator, moved to Highland Park with their daughter in late 1986.  </P> <P> "Highland Park has a small-town atmosphere in the middle of this huge city,"  Johnsen said. "We're five minutes from downtown, and it feels like we're miles  and miles away. We love the culture here, the people -- it's a colorful  community."  </P> <P> Realtor Bob Taylor of Harnsberger &amp; Associates. showed the couple around  the area; they had never been there. Taylor said they were among the first  trickle of young professionals moving into the community.  </P> <P> "Steve and Pearl were among the 'pioneers,' " Taylor said. "As artists, they  were very open to my showing them interesting houses. It's fun to show  newcomers the hidden treasures here."  </P> <P> Johnsen and Beach had looked in Laurel Canyon, the La Brea area, Silver Lake  and Echo Park before finding their house, which Johnsen describes as a  "charming little place built from stone from the arroyo, very unique."  </P> <P> The 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom, one-bath house, built before the turn of the  century and located on what became known as "Professors' Row," because it  housed educators from Occidental College in the 1920s, has since been declared  a cultural monument.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prices Have Climbed  </P> <P> Johnsen says the house had a beautiful garden and the exterior "was pretty  clean -- what can you do to stone?" They are restoring the interior room by  room; the bedrooms are finished, the bathroom is next.  </P> <P> Like much of Los Angeles, Highland Park house prices have gone up dramatically,  particularly in pockets like the Pine Crest area bordering pricey South  Pasadena, some sections north of York Boulevard, and the area near Avenue 64 on  the Pasadena border.  </P> <P> Last summer, prices broke through the $200,000 ceiling; this spring it is not  uncommon to see houses listed at or near the $300,000 mark. Not surprisingly,  hillside homes with a view and/or the quiet woodsy ones generally command the  most money.  </P> <P> There are also a few expensive exceptions, including the magnificent Queen  Anne-style hilltop home purchased by Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage on El  Mio Drive for nearly $450,000 a year ago and a huge turn-of-the-century charmer  on Figueroa Street currently listed for $525,000.  </P> <P> Even so, the area remains affordable. Classified ads in a recent issue of the  Highland Park News-Herald &amp; Journal, the local newspaper, showed a number  of houses for sale for under $200,000, including a small group of "starter"  homes near $125,000.  </P> <P> Dan Pilgreen, who has a chiropractic practice on Avenue 64 and who moved a year  ago from Sherman Oaks to Glassell Park near the Highland Park border, is  investing in two houses in Highland Park because "the area is just so prime."  </P> <P> "Prices here are cheap compared to most places and there are wonderful homes  available," Pilgreen said. "I think York Boulevard -- with its proximity to  Pasadena, Glendale and downtown -- could be the next Melrose Avenue."  </P> <P> Pilgreen, who is rebuilding one of his Highland Park houses, a large,  two-story, three-bedroom clapboard house that was damaged in a fire, thinks the  area is "severely undervalued."  </P> <P> But even though prices are climbing -- helped by the preservation movement and  proximity to major work centers -- the area remains one of the last affordable  housing markets in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> For long-term residents and newly moved-in yuppies alike, the goal now is to  restore Highland Park's former luster, to make it as grand a place entering the  last decade of the 20th Century as it was at the beginning.  </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1988 estimate: 53,564  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: 16.6%  </P> <P> Median age: 30.4 years  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix  </P> <P> Latino: 63.8%  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 26.3%  </P> <P> Black: 1.0%  </P> <P> Other: 8.9%  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: 8,775  </P> <P> Median household: 23,256  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 31.5%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 32.0%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 24.2%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 9.3%  </P> <P> $75,000 + : 2.9%  </P></p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Lending to most business sectors falls Bank loans to the car manufacturing sector have risen by 15 per cent in the past 13 months, lending figures issued by the Bank of England yesterday revealed. The figures also show that the motor vehicle, hotel and retail sectors were almost the only business sectors which increased their indebtedness during the first three months of this year, as total bank sterling lending to UK residents fell during the quarter by 0.1 per cent. Bank loans to the motor sector rose by 5.9 per cent, or Pounds 0.1bn during the first quarter, with Pounds 1.8bn worth of outstanding sterling loans. Meanwhile, bank loans to garages, hotels and distrib-uting groups also rose by 0.4 per cent, or Pounds 0.1bn. This was partly due to a seasonal growth in the demand for credit by hotels and catering companies, the Bank said. Overall, though, industry reduced its level of indebtedness by 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. This suggests that many companies were seeking to pay off their loans as the business climate picked up earlier this year. This happened in spite of evidence from other banking surveys suggesting a more recent surge in company credit in March. One of the largest falls in lending occurred among food, tobacco and drinks companies, which reduced their borrowing by 4.1 per cent, or Pounds 0.3bn, after a strong increase in lending in the previous quarter. However, this drop in business borrowing was partly balanced by a 0.9 per cent rise in individual borrowing, the Bank said. Although consumer credit fell in the quarter by 0.2 per cent, this was a result largely due to seasonal factors, and was more than offset by a 1.5 per cent rise in mortgages. Over the year as a whole, mortgages rose by 9.3 per cent, the Bank said.</p>

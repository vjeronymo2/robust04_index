			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Strategists assess Europe after Danish 'No' The European equity world reacted more or less coherently last week to the Danish 'No' vote in a referendum on the European Community's Maastricht treaty, the French decision to hold their own referendum after the summer holidays, and the uncertainty this cast on the process of European Monetary Union (Emu). The Danish component of the FT-Actuaries World Indices dropped 6.1 per cent, after a 4.8 per cent gain in the previous week when domestic polls were pointing to a 'Yes' vote. The Nordic block registered a 3.2 per cent fall; France one of 2.2 per cent for President Mitterrand's temerity; and the Mediterranean bourses in Italy and Spain declined by 1.6 and 2.7 per cent respectively. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, notes that bourses had a clear lead from their bond markets, with yields in the Mediterranean rising by around one-third of a percentage point, and that there were comparable moves in some of the Nordic countries. There is a twin risk for countries either in or entering the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), says Mr Bell. Within the ERM, the Spanish and Italian economies have unresolved structural problems, and embedded inflation. For those outside, such as the Nordic bloc, the newfound respectability of their currencies based on EC entry and economic convergence might have to be deferred. However, BZW is not pessimistic about European equity prospects. There was little corporate news about last week to test reactions and the broker thinks that, unless there is a prospect of the ERM actually falling apart, equity markets will limit themselves to trading, rather than fundamental asset allocation moves. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's senior strategist Mr David Roche thinks the EC must now try to draw up a new treaty covering Emu and European political union (Epu) for member states. Major changes in any new treaty, he says, are likely to lead to the emerg-ence of a 'twin-track' Europe with greater emphasis on economic integration than on political unity. Working along similar lines to Mr Bell, he says assets of countries which have already achieved a large degree of convergence with the Maastricht criteria for monetary union - France, Germany, the Benelux countries and, to a lesser extent, the UK - should continue to command a premium. His probable losers are Denmark, Italy, Spain and Switzerland (where, he says, the referendum on the European Economic Area may be called into question), and Sweden and Finland, which may see their applications to join the EC delayed by the confusion. Morgan Stanley likes non-European markets although, clearly, the Japanese were not listening last week as the Tokyo market fell by 2.3 per cent. Within Europe, Mr Roche believes that cyclicals and dollar-earners, German financials, and defensive stocks are likely to outperform. BZW's Mr Bell thinks that timing of European recovery and falls in German interest rates will be much more important to equities than rows over European union, and that cyclically exposed markets in Norway and Sweden could bear study in the interim. About Denmark, he says the Danes have done more than almost any other country to achieve convergence with the ERM, at a price of a niggardly growth rate in the 1980s while the rest of Europe was booming. So while they face some risk of political reprisals, there is also the possibility that the economy can improve its investment appeal.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change    % change                     % change in local currency #    sterling #  in US                                                                 dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                            1992       1992       1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria          +0.91    +2.21  -20.84    +9.89      +6.48      +4.46 Belgium          -0.87    -1.52   -1.38    +4.32      +1.48      -0.45 Denmark          -6.10    -3.35   -7.86    -6.69      -8.46     -10.19 Finland          -2.70    -6.61  -29.42    +4.80      +2.12      +0.18 France           -2.16    -3.29   +8.48   +12.85     +11.33      +9.22 Germany          -1.01    +1.12   -0.45   +11.21      +8.29      +6.23 Ireland          -0.41    -5.06   -7.62    -1.29      -3.44      -5.27 Italy            -1.62    -0.49  -18.02    -0.36      -2.93      -4.76 Netherlands      +0.21    +1.62   +6.00   +12.26      +9.34      +7.26 Norway           -1.05    -2.60  -16.47    +9.36      +6.83      +4.79 Spain            -2.74    -0.08   -9.58    +3.79      +2.20      +0.26 Sweden           -1.28    -0.24   -6.43   +12.99     +11.16      +9.05 Switzerland      +0.10    -0.84  +11.24   +15.38      +9.87      +7.77 UK               -1.46    -2.11   +6.51    +8.29      +8.29      +6.24 EUROPE           -1.38    -1.31   +2.56    +8.97      +7.43      +5.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia        -0.22    +0.72  +10.38    +0.93      +3.31      +1.35 Hong Kong        -0.39    +9.15  +65.34   +43.19     +46.80     +44.02 Japan            -2.31    -2.56  -29.99   -22.16     -21.78     -23.26 Malaysia         +0.39    -2.79  -10.64    +2.24     +12.51     +10.37 New Zealand      -0.21    +5.76   +0.06    +0.95      +2.61      +0.68 Singapore        -1.69    +2.88   +0.00    +2.73      +4.48      +2.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada           +0.05    +0.51   -5.75    -3.08      -4.31      -6.13 USA              -0.56    -0.69   +8.11    -0.79      +1.12      -0.79 Mexico           +1.98    +3.58  +62.88   +23.26     +22.60     +20.27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa     +0.06    +3.55  +19.99    +8.90      +0.79      -1.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX      -1.17    -1.03   -5.35    -4.18      -3.76      -5.59  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # Based on June 5th 1992.

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Manufacturing jobs 'continue to fall' The number of jobs in manufacturing is continuing to fall and the outlook continues to look uncertain, says a report on employment trends in the last quarter of 1993. The survey, published today by the AEEU engineering and electrical union and based on information from the union's local offices, found only one company in the survey with job vacancies in the period while 15 per cent made redundancies. Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, said: 'Our survey shows employers are acting nervously while talking about confidence in the recovery. Our members are fighting for this recovery. It is time the employers started to do the same.' Over the whole of last year one-in-five companies in the AEEU survey reported redundancies compared with one in 25 with vacancies. The survey also found a fall in the number of companies reporting good prospects for orders. They dropped to 17.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 27.8 per cent in the previous three months. The survey sample of 413 companies covered more than 40,000 employees.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Slight pressure on franc BOTH THE French franc and Danish krone weakened mildly against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised some dealers by deciding not to change its officially posted interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting, writes James Blitz. The decision not to reduce either the discount rate or the rate for securities repurchase tenders caused some disappointment. Earlier in the week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, had suggested that short-term money market interest rates could fall in the wake of changes in German minimum reserve requirements, and the D-Mark softened on Monday and Tuesday. Yesterday, positions were retraced. The franc closed at FFr3.398 to the D-Mark,  1/3 centime down on the day. At lunchtime in the US, the franc crossed the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark for the first time in more than a month. The Danish krone also wobbled yesterday, dipping sharply to DKr3.8550 to the D-Mark from DKr3.835 as the news from Frankfurt emerged. By last night it was comfortably trading at DKr3.8369. The dollar fell back nearly a pfennig to close at DM1.6355 in London. In New York it recovered a little to finish at DM1.6398. If the market's reaction was muted yesterday, it was because there was a strong expectation of an easing in Bundesbank policy at the next council meeting on March 18. Negotiations on the Solidarity Pact to reduce Germany's budget deficit and help the reconstruction of eastern Germany will resume on March 11-12, and the successful conclusion of these talks may be an important precursor to any further easing in Bundesbank policy. Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets said the talks are unlikely to be fully completed before the summer. But she believes there may soon be a resolution of the critical issue of how the central and regional governments share the development costs of east Germany in the 1990s, and this may help to bring a cut in the discount rate in two weeks' time. Some market participants said there could still be a resurgence of ERM strains in the interim. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, believed that pressure on the French franc could intensify if the Bundesbank does not lower its repo rate next Tuesday. A leading London-based fund manager said ERM pressure was unlikely to emerge, however, because of a feeling that the Bundesbank would ease policy in the event of any pressure on the French currency. One factor testing the D-Mark's strength will be today's non-farm payroll figure in the US. The market is expecting the February number to come between 80,000 and 150,000. According to Mr Hawkins, the D-Mark will only make gains if the figure comes in at a very low level.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Kiev pays the price of indecision: Chrystia Freeland on the background to Ukraine's political crisis UKRAINE'S parliament reconvenes today to try to resolve the stalemate that has led to the most dangerous political and economic crisis since it won independence 18 months ago. Unless the three-way tug-of-war between the parliament, the prime minister and the president is quickly resolved, Kiev is unlikely to muster the political will to cope with Russia's decision to raise prices for fuel to world levels. Failure to respond to steeper energy prices with an austere fiscal and monetary policy and more rapid moves toward the market could push Ukraine into hyper-inflation and exacerbate the country's painful drop in industrial output. The crisis began two weeks ago, when the cabinet of ministers' extraordinary power to rule the economy by decree ran out. Promising 'sweat and tears', Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma asked parliament to extend his powers, and give him control over Ukraine's spendthrift central bank, in order to push through his stalled programme of market reforms. Instead of backing Mr Kuchma, as he had been expected to do, President Leonid Kravchuk made his own bid for power, asking parliament to amend the constitution and make the president, rather than the prime minister, head of the cabinet of ministers. Parliament rejected Mr Kuchma's offer to resign, thus implicitly turning down Mr Kravchuk's bid to remove the post of prime minister altogether. But at the same time, the parliament failed to grant Mr Kuchma the additional powers he was seeking. The result is that parliament writes the laws, the prime minister is responsible for running the nuts and bolts of the economy and the president, who has weak decree-making authority, is overall head of state. On May 21, after rejecting both the prime minister's and the president's requests, parliament offered a vivid demonstration of why this patch-work political structure is ill-equipped to resolve Ukraine's looming economic crisis. In response to increases in Russian fuel prices, Ukraine has no alternative but to raise domestic prices. But fearing a public outcry, parliament refused to vote for a price rise and asked the prime minister to authorise price increases. Mr Kuchma refused, insisting that parliament, having denied him extraordinary power over the economy, faces the consequences of its decision. President Kravchuk dodged the issue altogether. The final outcome: parliament voted to raise the average pension and the minimum wage but took no decision to raise prices. One possibility when parliament reconvenes today is that Mr Kuchma will make a second request for extra powers. But Mr Kuchma has neither the will nor the savvy to outsmart his political opponents. A more likely option is that Mr Kravchuk will make a second bid for expanded authority. Opposition politicians fear that Mr Kravchuk, who has promised to use additional powers to push through market reforms, will do the opposite if he wins. The third possibility, that Ukraine's ex-communist dominated parliament will again reject both the prime minister's and the president's requests, could be the most dangerous.</p>

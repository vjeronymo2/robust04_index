			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> VOICE OF AMERICA ON HOLD IN ISRAEL  </P> <P> Israeli environmentalists won a Supreme Court injunction today barring the U.S.  Voice of America from building a radio transmitter complex in the Negev Desert  until environmental questions are resolved.  </P> <P> The Israeli Nature Protection Society and residents of the Arava Valley  appealed to the court to block the project, saying a 43-aerial complex would  harm the environment and disorient millions of migratory birds.  </P> <P> A government planning board approved the billion-dollar project last month and  the U.S. Embassy said it hoped the transmitter would be built immediately.  </P> <P> The transmitter would broadcast programs of the VOA and Radio Liberty, both  funded by the U.S. government, in 28 languages to Eastern Europe, Central Asia  and Africa.  </P></p>

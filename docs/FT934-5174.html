			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Gripped by 'Wild Things' - Theatre Physician, heal thyself. But who can heal the hospital system whereby our psychiatric patients are treated? Anna Reynolds, author of the new play Wild Things, speaks in a programme note of her time in a mixed ward of a psychiatric hospital; and her play portrays the pathetic situation whereby such patients are dealt with by partly insensitive and inadequate staff. At the same time, however, it shows how patients start to help each other. Gradually, it works through the hopeless tedium of everyday life in the ward. Gradually, it becomes deeply affecting. Wild Things - Reynolds's second play - is receiving its first performances from the touring company Paines Plough in Salisbury. It has just four roles: Dr Phoebe Trick (psychiatrist), Katie (nurse), Johnny (male patient who has raped and killed a prostitute), and Diane (girl traumatised into silence by the triple whammy of discovering her mother's body after suicide, of trying to commit suicide herself, and of being pregnant). In the earlier scenes, we need either writing that will make us sense the ward's larger life or staging that will more tightly focus the quartet's internal dynamics. Later, however, we are gripped. Johnny's aggressive intelligence gives Dr Trick and Katie one set of problems, and Diane's constant silence (she keeps switching into the language of dance) another. Dr Trick is tired, prissy, and no communicator; Katie is a blowsy loudmouth, hostile to Johnny and incapable of comprehending Diane's silence. The play's central irony is that the two patients understand each other better than do their keepers. (For one thing, only Johnny has the instinct to dance alongside Diane.) The play ends with Johnny at last releasing his guilt and rage in bitter tears; and, though cynicism tells me that this ending is too good to be true, the fact is that I was in tears too. All too believable is the way that Dr Trick, having led Johnny to recount the story of the rape and murder he committed, actually cuts him off before he reaches the climax. And the degree to which Reynolds has entered Johnny's mind is very fine; she catches his uncanny ability to read thoughts, and the need to love and be loved that is at the root of his crime. Jennifer Scott-Malden, as Diane, and Christopher McHallem, as Johnny, give excellent performances. Her silence and grace are perfectly contrasted with his noisiness and violence; and the pain of both is equally real. Holly de Jong catches all the clinical limitations of Dr Trick; and though Joy Elias-Rilwan misses some of the nurse's anti-male nervous system, she has her well-meaning insensitivity and chattiness. Geraldine Pilgrim's designs effectively change to show different parts of the ward. Deborah Paige, the director, must be responsible for the staging's major virtues and its minor weaknesses. Two particular strengths of this play make me look forward to any future play Reynolds may go on to write. Wild Things sees all its characters as rounded, complex and self-contradictory people. And it has shafts of poetry that pierce through its basic prose. At the end, Diane says to Johnny 'You're a blind man, stumbling through a minefield, hoping for the worst.' The metaphor perfectly sums him up; coming from Diane, it takes our breath away. At the Salisbury Playhouse's Salberg Studio until December 18, then on tour</p>

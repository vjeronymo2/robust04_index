			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Observer: Fergie factor Meanwhile, another casualty of current market conditions has been a new issue for Sleepy Kids, the USM-listed animation company. Having bought the film and merchandising rights to the Duchess of York's 'Budgie The Little Helicopter' books, Sleepy Kids has had a spot of bother refinancing itself. It has only raised half what it hoped for through a share placing and its shares have gone to a discount. In spite of the adverse publicity surrounding the Duchess of York, Sleepy Kids is adamant that its disappointing performance has nothing to do with Her Royal Highness' recent troubles. It blames the perilous state of the markets. However, John Bryan, the Duchess' financial adviser on the deal, must feel proud that this time he seems to be earning his keep.</p>

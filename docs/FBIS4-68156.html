			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Letter That Was Filed"; first </F> paragraph is SI editorial introduction]    [Text] Six months after it was signed Shining Path [SL]  has made public the often reported third letter from prison of  Abimael Guzman, which President Fujimori wanted to regard as an  offer for SL to surrender and lay down their arms. [President  Fujimori originally censored the contents of this letter. See  item PA2610034493 in 5 November 1993 Terrorism Report]  <H5>  Text of Letter </H5> <H8>  APPEAL </H8>   COMRADES OF THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FIGHTERS OF THE  PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY COMRADES AMONG THE MASSES    As communists, applying our specific ideology of Marxism,  Leninism, Maoism, and the thoughts of Gonzalo and reflecting  almost exclusively and intensely on these problems for the past  year, we have reached the following conclusions in the  preparation of a "concrete analysis of the concrete situation."    For more than 13 years, we have carried on a people's war as  the greatest social movement in Peruvian history. As a result,  Maoism has been defined as the third, new, and higher phase of  Marxism. The prestige and impact of the party has been raised to  the highest point. We have gained immense and mainly positive  experience in the service of the World Proletarian Revolution.  We have achieved this, like everything in life, through great  and heroic efforts and have had our successes and failures.  Nevertheless, we must look clearly and profoundly at the  situation which we face at present and its foreseeable  prospects. The facts show that the present government has made  objective progress in carrying out its tasks, especially since  the events of 5 April 1992, which clearly was necessary for the  Peruvian state to do. Thus, it has established foundations for  the economic process and has carried out adjustments in the  state. And, what applies to us more directly, it has prepared a  systematic, coherent, and well-developed strategy at different  levels, particularly in the field of intelligence, achieving  real successes, principally through the capture of cadres and  leaders, among them myself. Clearly, this is the most important  success achieved by the Peruvian state during the past 13 years  of war. In this way it has favorably prepared the course which  the present government is following.    Meanwhile, on our side real problems have been growing. New,  complex, and very serious problems have arisen in world  politics, in the situation in which the country finds itself,  and in the war which is unfolding. All of these questions have  raised fundamental leadership problems for the Peruvian  Communist Party. Nevertheless, the party has been dealt its  hardest blow in terms of its leadership. As proletarian  revolutionaries we know very well and must keep in mind the fact  that a people's war, starting from the realities facing it,  requires certain, essential conditions to succeed. It needs  proletarian leadership, a mass base, strategic centralization, a  prolonged war, a new type of army, and a favorable international  situation. It is clear that this last condition does not exist.  However, the first condition is the principal one and from it  flow the others. Therefore, a people's war is essentially a  question of political leadership. The question of leadership is  decisive. In our case this question cannot be resolved in a  timely way.    Consequently, the facts show that the prospects facing the  people's war are not its expansion but simply keeping it going.    On the basis of what has been said above and under the  present circumstances, the party and principally its leadership  are being faced with the need to make a new and great decision.  In the past we carried on our struggle by beginning a people's  war. Today, with equal firmness and determination we must fight  for a peace agreement as an unavoidable, historic necessity.  This also makes it necessary to suspend activities related to  the people's war, except those involving self defense. There is  a corresponding requirement that the Peruvian state suspend its  military activities and not make reprisals of any class or kind.  Once this previous question is resolved, we can proceed to  drafting a Peace Agreement, whose implementation will lead to  the end of the 13-year war which the country has been waging.  These are historic decisions which the party must make now,  particularly considering that peace has become a necessity for  the people, the nation, and Peruvian society as a whole. Peace  will serve to unite the people, for the people, notwithstanding  the differences among them, are united by a profound, common  interest.    We are taking this extremely important step in carrying out  our responsibilities. We are absolutely certain of the need for  doing this, as communists, as maoists, and as soldiers of the  proletariat, even committing ourselves to serve as one of the  parties guaranteeing the implementation of the peace agreement.    We call on all party comrades, and particularly on its  cadres  and leaders, on the fighters, on the masses, and principally on  the left wing of the party who seek, in close union with us, to  hold high and to apply this new, just, and correct decision. It  relates to the position of the proletariat and to the interests  of the working class and the people.    22 September 1993    PRESIDENT GONZALO    On Friday afternoon, 8 April, a videocassette and the  typewritten text of a document reached the editorial offices of  SI. According to those who sent it, this was the third letter of  Abimael Guzman Reynoso. This was the letter whose public  distribution was announced by President Alberto Fujimori on  several occasions shortly before the referendum of 31 October  1993. However, this letter was never published and nothing  further was said about it.    Some six months later in April 1994, sources identified as  relatives of Shining Path [SL] personnel held in prison sent to  certain publications, including SI, a document which, they  state, is a true copy of the third letter of Abimael Guzman  Reynoso.    The document, together with a video recording in which two  hooded SL members appear reading it, presents some problems in  terms of timing. The document is dated 22 September 1993, or  prior to the date of the second letter (6 October 1993). As this  is a typewritten document, there may have been a typographic  error. The first letter was dated 15 September 1993. As far as  the rest of the third letter is concerned, the contents appear  to be genuine.    If the letter is genuine, it would confirm that, in effect,  when the president let slip a remark concerning the possibility  that there was a third letter from the leader of SL, this letter  had already been written.    President Fujimori's clear objective at that time was to  make  the point that Abimael Guzman sent this third letter, not to  him, but rather to the SL forces. He wanted the leader of the  subversives specifically to admit in the letter that he had  surrendered and to call on his followers to lay down their arms.    As indicated from a reading of the letter, this third  communication from Abimael Guzman, which has now been made  public, did not include those conditions and did not satisfy the  demands of the president.    One of the SL family members said: "Therefore, President  Fujimori did not agree with it."    And, therefore, the president and the National Intelligence  Service (SIN) simply filed the letter.  <H5>  Summary of the Contents </H5>   In the third letter from Abimael Guzman the following, basic  ideas are contained:     -  It reaffirms and provides a basis for his proposal for a  peace agreement.    -  It reaffirms his Marxist, Leninist, Maoist ideology.    -  It seeks to vindicate the role played by 13 years of a  people's  war.    -  It recognizes that the government has made progress since 5  April 1992, particularly in the fight against subversion.    -  It points out serious problems on the world scene.    -  It describes the problem of proletarian leadership as  decisive.    -  It calls the proposed peace agreement a great decision and a  national need.    -  It confirms the fact that the SL movement is wholly committed  to the search for a peace agreement.        However, it says nothing about SL surrendering and laying  down its arms.    A Shining Path spokesman states that conversations with the  government have been broken off. It is known that they were cut  off after the referendum of 31 October 1993. The spokesman added  that the "representatives" of the SL leadership who were sent to  the leaders in prison have returned to the original places where  they were being held.    The SL spokesman said: "The government is going to continue  to do everything possible to prevent a peace agreement from  being drafted. A peace agreement does not suit its interests.  The idea was used for election purposes. However, we see it as a  necessity, not only for us, but for the country."    Everything seems to indicate that, after contacting its  leaders in prison, the supporters of Abimael Guzman in SL have  gone out into the streets. Outside the walls of the prisons the  most stubborn and recalcitrant elements of SL, who reject the  idea of a peace agreement, control most of the organization. The  Metropolitan Committee of SL [in Lima] holds a contrary view, as  do the higher leadership bodies, which are effectively  controlled by Comrade "Feliciano."    Family members of those in prison, trade union officials, or  isolated leaders outside the leadership bodies are distributing  the peace proposal. According to our SL informant, they are  finding a positive reception, particularly among the rank and  file members who have participated directly in the war. The  "intellectuals" are most opposed to a peace agreement. We asked  if this term refers to SL members in the universities. We were  told, "Yes."    The SL cadre seems to have a clear understanding of their  position.    He admitted: "The boss has been captured. The rest are easy  meat. The organization right now is like a boat without a  rudder. And to resume an active life again, there has to be  another person, equal to or more capable than the leader who is  in prison, to take over this responsibility." (He was referring  to "President Gonzalo.")    A family member who spoke in the metaphoric language of a SL  cadre stated: "The waters have to be constantly in motion. If  they quiet down, everything falls apart. We have to expand, but  now we are just keeping up the present level of activity." He  concluded: "The war has to be ended, because now it leads  nowhere."    Despite the fact that President Fujimori does not show the  same interest in a peace agreement as he did before the  referendum of 31 October 1993, fighting for this proposal (which  is too general) is a new contradiction which SL is discussing.</p>

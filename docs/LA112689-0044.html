			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR POOR AMERICAN CAR SALES  </P> <P> I believe your reporter, the market analysts and the auto industry are all  missing the real reason behind falling sales of American cars ("Rebates,  Production Cuts Blamed for 27.5% Drop in Auto Profits," Oct. 27).  </P> <P> The real reason for U.S. auto makers' problems is that they are simply losing  the competition with foreign car makers.  </P> <P> One auto industry expert, Brock Yates, blames management as well as labor in  his book, "The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry."  </P> <P> American buyers are not as naive as American car makers may think. Getting  rebates or long warranty periods are meaningless if you have a car that keeps  needing repair or just doesn't work right.  </P> <P> It would be truly refreshing if American cars actually performed as well as the  sexy advertisements.  </P> <P> Unless American car makers start making better cars and stop trying to fool  American car buyers, I think I, for one, will continue to buy foreign cars.  </P> <P> WILLIAM C. PATTERSON, TUSTIN  </P></p>

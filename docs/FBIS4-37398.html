			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night, the fire at the Mocha power station fuel  tanks was brought under control. The power station was the  target of a treacherous, cowardly raid by the treasonous, agent  secessionist gang's aircraft. Fire and security men exerted  great and continuous efforts for 26 hours with unparalleled zeal  and vigor to save this important, vital installation, which was  built with the blood and sweat of our militant Yemeni people. A  vile clique from the secessionist, apostate gang is trying to  destroy such installations, in keeping with its ignoble habit of  sowing death and destroying economic and vital installations.    The brother Ta'izz governor directly supervised the progress  of rescuing and evacuating the dead and wounded workers,  children, and women to hospitals. The brother governor also  directly supervised the fire fighting process until the fire was  brought under control, with the support of God and the efforts  of the efficient fire and security men.</p>

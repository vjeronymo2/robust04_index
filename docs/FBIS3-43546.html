			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Zambian Government is in crisis. Earlier this  week, Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga resigned and now Princess  Nakatindi Wina, the social affairs minister, and her husband,  Sikota, the deputy speaker of Parliament, have also quit. All  are members of the ruling MMD [Movement for Multiparty  Democracy] Party, and they say that they have resigned because  they want the government to be able to freely investigate  allegations that they were all involved in drug trafficking.  From Lusaka, Joy Mwinga sent this telex:    Announcing their resignation at a press conference this  morning, the Winas said that the Chiluba cabinet was ripe with  corruption and challenged seven ministers linked to the misuse  of donor funds to follow their example and resign. They accused  some cabinet ministers, in particular, of conspiring with the  donor community and the independent press to try and bring down  President Chiluba's two- year-old admnistration. The Winas'  resgination comes only five days after the resignation of  Foreign Affairs Minister Vernon Mwaanga, who had been hounded by  allegations of drug trafficking. He also claimed that the  Chiluba admnistration was infested with corrupt ministers who  had enriched themselves at the expense of the taxpayer.    President Chiluba has been under intense pressure to stamp  out widespread corruption and drug trafficking in his government  since the donor community threatened Zambia with a cut off of  aid, unless President Chiluba cleaned up his government. Mr.  Mwaanga and the Winas have been linked to the growing narcotic  [word indistinct] since the (Chaila) tribunal appointed by  former President Kenneth Kaunda to investigate drug trafficking  implicated them in 1985. Both Mr. Mwaanga and the Winas  dismissed the (Chaila) tribunal report as a piece of political  propaganda employed by former President Kaunda as a desperate  effort to discredit the opposition.    Sources close to President Chiluba say that he is likely to  dismiss several ministers over the next few days in response to  the concerns of the donor community, but for the while,  President Chiluba is facing ever increasing criticism.  Opposition parties as well as student groups have said that he  can no longer control his ministers and that he himself should  resign. Furthermore, there are signs that his cabinet is  splitting along tribal lines. The Winas accused several cabinet  ministers of hounding them out of office. They say that these  ministers are all from the Mambwe tribe from [word indistinct]  district who the Winas describe as the [words indistinct].</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Management: Bata takes a step back to its roots - Paternalism in flux / Bernard Simon talks to the chairman/founder of the world's largest shoe manufacturer about its trading policies with its former oppressors in Czechoslovakia and its hopes for consolidating its toehold in the Soviet Union Thomas Bata professes to be opposed to boycotts and sanctions. The company that bears his name made shoes in Rhodesia under Ian Smith, in Uganda under Idi Amin, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet. It withdrew from South Africa with the greatest reluctance. But when it comes to dealing with Communists, the forceful chairman of the world's biggest shoe manufacturer has different ideas. He decided against buying a Toshiba portable computer because, he says, the Japanese company sold submarine propellers to the Soviet Union. More significantly, Bata avoided doing business with his native Czechoslovakia for more than 30 years after the Communist government took over the family's factories and shops in the late 1940s. Now that the Communists are no longer in power in Czechoslovakia and those in the Soviet Union need all the help they can get, the energetic 76-year-old chairman of Bata Shoe Organisation has good reason to soften his approach. 'In North America and western Europe, shoes are coming out of people's ears,' says Bata, whose company sells more than 300m pairs a year, some 60 per cent of them made in its own factories. 'There is only one part of the world where there is a vacuum for footwear, and that is the Soviet Union.' In the case of Czechoslovakia, the tug is more sentimental. 'We were not willing to do business with the Communists because they treated some of our people in a most disgusting and inhumane manner,' he says. Now, however, 'we are anxious and willing to do something for the place where we have roots.' Although Bata denies it, events in eastern Europe have brought another big change in the family business. Despite Bata's huge presence in footwear, the public knows little about its far-flung operations. The family, operating the company privately, still declines to disclose details of revenues, profits or market share. But it has recently become much more open in discussing its business interests, especially those in Czechoslovakia. Bata owns 40 factories and 6,300 shoe shops in 69 countries, and has 70,000 employees. It has the franchise for Nike sneakers in Chile and for Adidas shoes in India. It also operates tanneries in 14 countries and a number of rubber-processing plants. 'The strength of our organisation is survival,' says Tom's soft-spoken but steely wife Sonja who, as a director of the company, has an office next to his at the company's modest headquarters in suburban Toronto. Bata's business in Uganda was twice taken over by the government and twice control was handed back to Bata. The company was forced to buy a vegetable-exporting farm in Zambia to provide foreign exchange for imported chemicals for its shoe factory. A cornerstone of Bata's strategy has been to locate its factories as far away as possible from big urban centres, thus holding down wage costs and discouraging trade union organisers. Its main North American manufacturing complex, in the company town of Batawa, named after the shoe company and started in 1939, is located in a rural area between Toronto and Ottawa. Tom Bata, who is still driven home for lunch most days with his wife when he is in Toronto, acknowledges that the company's management style, at least until recently, may best be described as paternalistic. But he insists that the schools and other amenities provided by the company were 'not done for the sake of paternalism.' It has a high proportion of illiterate people and women in its workforce, especially in the Third World, and Bata says it 'was all done for the sake of making people's work and their lives easier'. That management style and much else about Bata is now in flux. Although he remains an active chairman of the Bata Shoe Organisation, Tom Bata handed over the chief executive's job six years ago to his son, Thomas Jr. While father started his working life as an apprentice in a shoe factory in Zlin, the son is a graduate of Harvard Business School. With his less forceful son at the helm, the company's senior management is expected to have greater scope to tackle the business challenges of the 1990s. As a company, Bata is having to adjust to the realities of increasingly stiff competition from countries where it has little or no presence, notably China and Taiwan, and to a workforce more mobile (and thus less loyal) than it used to be. 'Today, our focus is on developing products ourselves and very often having other people make them for us,' Bata says. In the Third World, that has meant helping entrepreneurs set up small businesses to supply uppers and other shoe parts to Bata assembly plants. The company sent a Zambian manufacturer of tea kettles to Germany to learn how to make the high-quality steel toecaps needed for mining boots. In Europe and North America, the focus has shifted to retailing and specialised high-margin manufacturing. Many of the shoes Bata now sells are made by other manufacturers, especially in the Far East. Bata has no factories in the US, but owns 800 shops there. It operates four retail chains in France, each catering to a different segment of the market. But it is on eastern Europe that Tom Bata is focusing much of his energy. He is most expansive when the conversation turns to Czechoslovakia. Although he left Czechoslovakia in 1932, his emotional attachment to his homeland has clearly never flickered. Ten generations of Batas had made shoes in Czechoslovakia before Tom transferred the family business to Canada in the 1930s ahead of the Nazi occupation. He left behind one of the country's biggest industrial conglomerates which, besides its shoe factories and shops, included hosiery, tyre and synthetic fibre businesses, and even a small aircraft manufacturer. Before the overthrow of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia in 1989, Tom Bata broadcast regularly to his former countrymen over Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America. And when he returned to a hero's welcome in December 1989, his Learjet carried 10 fax machines ordered by Civic Forum. Bata says he is eager to help put the family's businesses, nationalised in the late 1940s by the Czech communist government, back on their feet. In the past year, some 15 Bata executives from other parts of the world have travelled to Czechoslovakia to provide technical and managerial help. The company has enrolled 150 of its Czechoslovak employees in basic business courses, and brought several others to its own corporate seminars in western Europe. He has lifted his self-imposed boycott and has started buying shoes from his former factories in Czechoslovakia again. But some sour notes have crept into the relationship between Prague and its best-known expatriate. Although the communists never paid any compensation for the assets they seized, the new government has so far been reluctant to return the factories and shops to Bata. The present Czech government is apparently concerned at the Canadian company's economic muscle, and has up to now insisted that Bata must bid for its former assets like any other interested investor. While the company is still hoping that Prague will soften its line, Bata, for his part, says the businesses have deteriorated more under a centrally-planned economy than he suspected a year ago. 'The managers had done a marvellous job in keeping the factories going under the most difficult circumstances,' he says. 'But I could recognise many parts of the plant as being exactly as I had left them, except that they were 50 years older. The production planning forms were exactly the same as they had been 50 years ago, except that in my day there would be one piece of paper. This time I counted seven pieces. 'The products were very pedestrian, much more like the products we would normally make in Africa or in our simpler Far East operations. They were mainly aimed at the Soviet market, where a shoe factory has to guarantee that a Russian can stand in melting snow for two hours without his feet getting wet. That is a requirement for the Soviet Union; it is not the type of requirement which the Czechs or Slovaks would normally want.' The dilemma for Bata as it seeks to expand its involvement in eastern Europe again is that the Czech factories will continue for the foreseeable future to depend heavily on eastbound exports. 'There are some parts of the business which are not going to survive, particularly if the Soviet market is lost,' Bata predicts. He is trying to consolidate his toehold in the Soviet Union, although he is under no illusions about the problems involved. Bata has started selling shoes to the Soviets from a factory in India. Using the same skills it has mastered in parts of Africa, it is also examining the feasibility of helping the Soviets lengthen the shelf life of the hides of animals slaughtered at remote abattoirs by siting tanneries close to the abattoirs. Despite the difficulties, Tom Bata is relaxed about long-term prospects for the shoe business in eastern Europe and elsewhere. 'From the point of view of the world economy, we're not that worried,' he says. 'People are not going to give up shoes the way they've given up hats.'</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Family affairs The sight of Rocco Forte taking over from his illustrious father as the executive chairman of the Forte hotel chain raises once again the question of whether it is worth backing anything other than the first generation of a dynasty. Despite the democratisation of British industry, there are still quite a few big companies where the family representation is often bigger than the residual family shareholding. Merchant banking is an obvious family business and the continuation of the family streak at the top of Barclays Bank has lasted for a surprisingly long time. Then, there are companies like GEC and Hanson where some big investors are nervous that Simon Weinstock and Robert Hanson may leapfrog their peers when the time comes to find a replacement for their fathers. However, it is easy to get carried away with the idea that family dynasties are a bad thing. A cursory glance at companies where families still play an active role shows that for every dud company there are just as many successes. In retailing, for instance, the stories of several generations of Sainsburys, Sieffs, Wolfsons and Morrisons far outweigh unfortunate sagas such as the Ratners. When families fail to deliver the goods they don't last long.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in  Portuguese on 12 June publishes on page 8 an unattributed  1,500-word article on the opinions of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  -- presidential candidate for the Workers Party, PT, and the  coalition of the Brazilian Socialist Party, the Communist Party  of Brazil, the Popular Socialist Party, the Unified Socialist  Workers Party, the Green Party, and the Brazilian Communist  Party -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- presidential candidate for  the Brazilian Social Democracy Party and the coalition of the  Liberal Front Party and the Brazilian Labor Party -- Orestes  Quercia -- presidential candidate for the Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party -- Esperidiao Amin -- presidential candidate for  the Progressive Renewal Party -- and Leonel Brizola --  presidential candidate for the Democratic Labor Party -- on the  importance of agrarian reform, what type of agrarian reform they  would implement if elected, and what they think of the Landless  People's Movement.    According to the article, Lula says that if Brazil had  implemented a good agrarian reform there would not have been  land occupation; good agrarian reform must begin with a survey  to determine the amount of unproductive land in each county and  grant subsidized credit, technical assistance, transportation,  and a guaranteed minimum price for produce. The article adds  that Lula believes the Landless People's Movement has done  important things in Brazil and that land occupied by the  landless farmers produces more than the average property.    The article reports Cardoso as believing that, within the  framework of production and the creation of jobs, agrarian  reform is a priority; that more should be done and less should  be said, particularly because such a reform must be complemented  by irrigation projects, electricity to rural areas, agricultural  credit, and technical assistance. He says his "administration  plans to irrigate 1.5 million hectares per year," and "the  landless farmers are victims of an unfair concentration of land  and the PT's radicalism, which prevented the approval during the  1988 Constituent Assembly of a modern and fair agrarian reform."    Quercia says: "Agrarian reform is an essential aspect of my  government plan; we will create agricultural colonies and towns  with a good transportation system nearby. Federal government  land as well as expropriated land will be used to settle the  landless farmers. Some 16,000 families are registered in the  Landless People's Movement. This is not too much, and their  problem can be solved fast. Therefore, politicization of the  movement is irrelevant because the problem is solved if the  landless farmers are given land."    Amin says: "An agricultural policy is a priority, and the  agrarian reform its result, but the requirements of such a  reform change in accordance with the region of the country in  which the reform is to be implemented. The main basis of this  policy is financing, which the farmer will pay for in grain. In  the north, northeast, and central-west regions the government  must implement settlement programs on unproductive land." The  article adds that in Amin's opinion, "the Landless People's  Movement is a result of the government decision to expropriate  land only after it is occupied, thus making people who want land  -- not only the landless farmers -- participate in the  occupations. This is why the movement ended up being linked to  the PT and the Sole Workers Center, which believe the government  only implements agrarian reform under pressure."    Brizola says: "A settlement program has always been a  priority for us. The Constitution only defines land as being  productive or unproductive. The issue, however, is more complex  and other aspects of it must be considered. If a lot of land is  used only for speculation, the government should expropriate it  and pay for it with agrarian debt certificates. The Landless  People's Movement has been manipulated for political-electoral  reasons by some PT groups and by some priests."</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Legal losses - Legal briefs Hundreds of UK law firms could go bust over the next three years according to a survey of law firm performance by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The accountants' annual survey of Law Firm Financial Management shows a general improvement in the performance of most firms - almost 60 per cent increased profits per partner last year. But 25-30 per cent of firms continued to report a further fall in profits coming on top of poor performances in 1991-92 and 1992-93. Coopers says these firms have become locked into a cycle of reduced profits, lower investment and an inability to recruit and retain quality staff. Many of them would not survive the next few years.</p>

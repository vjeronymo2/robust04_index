			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 9 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Milan Gvero,  deputy chief of the general staff of the army of the Srpska  republic, told TANJUG today that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] command in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina has informed him that  it will no longer tolerate the inspection of cargo carried by  humanitarian convoys. He made it clear that he had received  this message from General Angus Ramsey, UNPROFOR headquarters  commander.    Gvero interprets this decision as an increase in the various  pressures and threats aimed in recent days at the people of the  Srpska republic as well as its political leadership and army.  "Regrettably, it seems that this is being pursued by the  international institutions present in this area whose mission  should be of a peacemaking and unbiased nature," Gen. Gvero  said. "Today, Gen. Ramsey phoned me and said that UNPROFOR had  decided to refuse any inspection of their convoys," he said. "In  other words, they regard checking convoys as an infringement of  their freedom of movement."    Gvero, however, stresses that because of a large number of  attempts to abuse these convoys the Serb side cannot tolerate  their movement without checking their cargo. "We, just like the  entire civilized world, regard inspection as a method of  confidence-building rather than a curb on movement. No good  would come of pushing through, in this way, a decision to refuse  any inspection of their convoys," he said. "In other words, they  regard checking convoys as an infringement of their freedom of  movement."    Gvero also said that the Serb side has a report that UNHCR  staff have been ordered to leave their offices on the territory  of the Srpska republic. "We are checking this report and if it  is true we shall prevent them from fleeing our territory," he  said. "None of the measures taken by these institutions and  organizations have been caused in any way by our conduct or  actions."    "We do not accept ultimatums of any kind, while we are  ready,  just as we have been so far, for any kind of equitable and  civilized cooperation," Gen. Gvero said in conclusion.</p>

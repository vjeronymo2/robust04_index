Presidential Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik said on Tuesday  that  instead of allowing a presidential interview on every  anniversary of national and local press medias as now, the  president will grant an exclusive interview with a media only  once in three years.    "In the past, President Kim Yong-sam gave all anniversary  interviews requested, which means the president had to give  about 40 exclusive interviews a year," said Chu, adding that  when those given to the Chongwadae press corps are taken into  account, the number rises to about 50.    The reduced interviews will not affect President Kim's  monthly meetings with the Chongwadae press corps, Chu said.</p>

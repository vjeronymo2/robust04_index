			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin today called for special attention to agriculture and  state-owned enterprises so as to ensure stability and provide a  reliable guarantee for reform and development.    Jiang made the call during a week-long tour through east  China's Fujian Province.    Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party  Central Committee, stressed that as a big and the most populous  country in the world, China has to be self-sufficient or even  more so in grain supply.    He urged greater efforts to guarantee sufficient crop  growing  areas, grain output and reserves. He called special attention  to this problem in the developed coastal areas where the  industrial and service sectors are developing rapidly.    On state-owned enterprises, the president said that the  public sector is the mainstay of the national economy.  State-owned enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized  ones, have played a leading role in the development of a  socialist market economy, he said, adding that the current  difficulties are very complicated and they should not be made a  pretext of losing confidence in them or regarding them as a  "burden".    He urged all government departments to devote their main  energy to the development of the public sector of industry.  Although China is encouraging the development of the private  sector, including foreign-funded enterprises, he said, it is  after all playing a supplementary role in the national economy.    He warned that whatever reform measures are taken to deepen  the reform and transform the operational mechanism of the  state-owned enterprises, everything must be done to ensure that  state property maintains and increases its value. No loss of  state property should be allowed in the course of reform, Jiang  stressed.    Jiang stressed the necessity of the policy of letting part  of  the areas to get prosperous first while persisting in the goal  of common prosperity.    He encouraged the developed coastal areas to help with the  development in the central and western regions by strengthening  cooperation and providing advanced technology and management  experience so as to gradually achieve common prosperity, which,  he said, is an important condition for safeguarding social  security and consolidating national unity.    Jiang also urged Fujian Province to enhance economic and  trade ties with Taiwan and contribute more to the peaceful  reunification of the motherland.</p>

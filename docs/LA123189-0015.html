			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SOFTWARE SHOULD WORK ON OLD MACHINES  </P> <P> How much longer can the general public afford to keep up with computer vendors'  newest hardware and operating systems? In "Big-Name Manufacturers Give OS/2 a  Boost" (Computer File, Nov. 23), there is a perfect paradox between technology  for the minority and workability for the majority.  </P> <P> I applaud those vendors who are working together to produce "new programs" more  compatible and with better integration in comparison to older programs.  However, the masses will be content with their older machines and software  unless the price is affordable. It is time for those vendors who are making the  "newer" software easier to also make the "newer" software workable on the older  machines for the majority of us.  </P> <P> JOSHUA BIRD  </P> <P> Coronado  </P></p>

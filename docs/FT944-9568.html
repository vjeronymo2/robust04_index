			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys edges ahead after land sale An exceptional profit on the sale of land helped Wardle Storeys, the plastic sheeting, military parachute and marine safety and survival equipment manufacturer, report a modest 2 per cent increase in full year profits. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 8.04m to Pounds 8.2m in the year to August 31 bolstered by a Pounds 1.49m profit on disposals, including the sale of 9 acres of land adjoining the group's site in Brantham, Suffolk. The exceptional gain offset a decline in operating profits, which slipped to Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 5.84m) and a reduction in net interest income which fell to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 2.21m). Turnover, including a Pounds 727,000 contribution from acquisitions, grew by 2 per cent to Pounds 79.6m. Earnings per share increased by 10 per cent to 23.9p (21.7p) and an unchanged final dividend of 12.25p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 17.25p. The shares fell by 24p to 371p. Operating profits picked up sharply in the second half, when profits increased by 25 per cent over the first six months. The improvement came despite continued weakness of the lira, which affected the performance of the technical products division, and reorganisation costs in both the RFD inflatables and GQ Parachutes operations. Operating profits in the technical products division, which makes specialised plastic sheet and coated fabrics, increased slightly to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 2.49m) on turnover which grew modestly to Pounds 55.1m (Pounds 53.2m). The group said margins were under pressure due to increased raw material costs. Operating profits on the safety and survival equipment side fell from Pounds 3.34m to Pounds 2.72m on turnover of Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 24.8m). Within the division, GQ Parachutes, which makes specialised parachutes, reported operating profits of Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.84m) on sales of Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 8.1m). Profits were struck after a near-Pounds 300,000 charge to cover the cost of consolidating operations at the Blackmill site. RFD Inflatables reported profits of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.51m) on turnover of Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 16.7m). Net cash declined by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 27.3m at the year-end, mainly due to the cost of acquisitions, capital expenditure greater than depreciation and an increase in working capital, partly offset by receipt of part of the proceeds from the sale of the Brantham land. Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said the current year had started strongly.</p>

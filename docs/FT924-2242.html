			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Management: How to take a team into the premier division - Christopher Lorenz assesses a new study on improving corporate performance You may be on your way up the executive ladder, or have reached the top. You may be languishing in middle or junior management. You may be a technical specialist - or another type of 'professional' - with no managerial role at all. You may be on the shop floor or the service front line. Regardless of your job and status, you are almost certainly part of, or surrounded by, the most common organisational form in modern management  - a team. Or several. 'So what?' you may ask. Everyone, except a player of individual sports, knows that teamwork is the best way of motivating people and improving their performance. The objective may just be to cut costs and boost efficiency, or, more commonly these days, also to respond more quickly to customer needs and competitive challenges. It is no coincidence that most 'model organisations'  -whether they are christened 'horizontal', 'networked', 'non-hierarchical' or 'clustered' - are based fundamentally on teams. The trouble is that most so-called teams are not worthy of the name, and fail utterly to deliver the high performance levels of which real teams are capable. They are often either just working groups or task forces, which though usually seen as synonymous with teams, are actually very different animals. At best, they are a third type of species: potential teams, which try hard to improve their performance, but lack clarity about purpose, goals, or joint work-products, as well as the discipline to hammer out a common working approach. Nor have they established mutual accountability. At worst, they are pseudo teams: collections of people concerned about togetherness, not performance, and so distracted by their dealings with each other that their communal performance is less than the sum of their individual parts. The chart (left) shows the yawning gap between their output and that of high-performance teams, in which members are deeply committed not just to team performance (as in real teams), but also to each other's personal growth and success. These are just a handful of the conclusions from an unusually thorough study of teams - real and pseudo - which has just been published as a book, appropriately titled The Wisdom of Teams. As well as challenging much conventional wisdom about teams, the book is full of advice about how to organise proper - and properly effective - ones. It draws examples from manufacturing companies such as US General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Kodak, Motorola, and Procter &amp; Gamble, as well as from service organisations such as the Burlington Northern railroad, the Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting firm, Prudential Insurance of America and even a high school basketball team called The Killer Bees. The book also provides a plethora of case studies of team inadequacy - from slight to complete - although most of the company names have had to be disguised. In order to write the book, its co-authors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith, who are leading consultants at McKinsey &amp; Co in the US, studied the workings of more than 50 teams (actual and so-called) in 30 companies. Their findings include: Top teams are the most difficult to make effective. A demanding performance challenge, set within the sort of performance culture exemplified by Motorola, tends to create real teams far more effectively than do team-building exercises, special incentives, or team leaders with ideal profiles. The disciplined application of 'team basics', including size, purpose, goals, skills, approach and accountability is often overlooked. Hierarchy and teams go together much better than is appreciated by people who see teams as a replacement for hierarchy. Team performance opportunities exist in all parts of the organisation, rather than just a few, as most companies think. Most organisations prefer individual, over group or team, accountability. Teams naturally integrate short-term performance with longer-run learning. Katzenbach and Smith define real teams as more than just 'an extremely dedicated group of people working together to accomplish something of great importance to themselves'. That is the definition of a group, they argue. By contrast, a team should be thought of more precisely as 'a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable'. Each part of this definition - or what Katzenbach and Smith call 'this essential mode of discipline' - requires close attention, they say. For instance, 'complementary skills' covers three categories: technical or functional expertise; problem-solving and decision-making skills; and interpersonal skills. The duo stresses repeatedly that a focus on performance and accountability - not on chemistry, teamwork or good communications - 'is what makes teams happen'. * Published in US by Harvard Business School Press, price Dollars 24.95.

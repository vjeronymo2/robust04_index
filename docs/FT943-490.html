			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Analysts beg time to digest judgment - FT reporters analyse yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice which are expected to form a definitive framework under which employers and scheme trustees can provide equal pensions for men and women An 84-page court judgment takes a good while to come through the fax machine, let alone to digest. Many companies, trade unions, pension funds and associations therefore reserved comment yesterday. 'We have to study the document carefully,' was a typical remark. The European Commission was a prime example. It noted that several provisions of a July 1986 directive providing for equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes were now inoperable. As a result, the commission would propose certain changes. But beyond that Brussels declined to comment. The commission statement resorted to the time-honoured formula: officials would have to study the judgment in detail. A fuller response is only planned for next Monday. The private sector, even in the countries most affected by the court's ruling, was no more prepared. The benefits officer of one leading UK retailer admitted: 'I haven't even heard of it.' The London stock market was largely oblivious to the event. One retail analyst at an international investment bank described the whole subject as 'rather arcane'. He said it was only yesterday morning that any of the firm's equity salesmen had questioned him on the issue. That was in the UK, the European country with the most developed - and exposed - private pensions industry. Some other European countries responded to the European Court judgment with what amounted to indifference. The BDA employers association in Germany said the ruling would have less impact in Germany than in the UK. The French government and employers said the ruling would have little implication for their pension schemes, mainly because most pensions are covered by the state system. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs said that under existing pensions legislation there was no discrimination between part-time and full-time employees, nor between male and female retirement conditions. 'I do not see that these rulings will affect our existing system; it is not really a French issue,' said an official at the Patronat employers' federation. He said, however, that reforms of the state system aimed at enabling companies to create private pension schemes would have to take account of the rulings. The French government plans to reform the existing system to ease the burden on the current pay-as-you-go state scheme. But the reform has been delayed, partly because of political sensitivity. The legal change may not be a French issue, nor a German one, nor one for most Continental countries. Still, few could compete in ignorance or indifference with one UK retail analyst. European Court of Justice? Pensions ruling? He asked: 'What ruling?'</p>

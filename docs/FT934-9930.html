			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (10): Cautious view prevails  -Technology investment slow-down in the insurance industry AS THE general insurance market starts to be shaken up by new technology, older-established insurance companies in the UK are struggling to meet the challenge. A recent survey carried out for the Computer Management Group, CMG, concluded that many of them were lacking in innovation and complacent about customer service and competition. CMG's senior consultant Mr Ian Bowen says that their attitude left them exposed to an invasion of their market by banks and building societies as well as by foreign competitors. This view is supported by Ms Miranda Mayes, a senior business analyst at International Data Corporation, IDC. In a study of computers in finance, she found that insurance companies were putting relatively little investment into new technology, partly because of the high levels of claims in recent years caused by bad weather, increased crime and terrorism. IDC found that 40 per cent of insurance companies expected to increase their spending on computers this year, but only by 9.5 per cent on average. At the same time, 28 per cent of them intended to cut their spending by an average of 20.9 per cent. Insurance was the only area of finance in which spending on IT was expected to fall over the next three years. Many insurance firms saw profitability as a more important issue than maintaining and increasing market share, the survey shows. Also rather surprisingly, they put management information systems at the top of their priorities for new applications, ahead of claims systems. There are warning signs that they should be more concerned about market share. Royal Bank of Scotland's subsidiary, Direct Line, set up in 1985, has taken around 6 per cent of the private car insurance market in eight years and is now challenging firms such as Norwich Union, Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance for leadership in that field. It sells policies by phone, backed up by a powerful computer system and marketed by TV advertising. The success of the operation comes from giving customers a quick and easy way of getting cheap cover. The phone interview is based on a computer system which ensures that it takes no more than five minutes on average. Then the caller can be covered at once and a policy issued the next day. Callers are asked to give their name, house number and post code; addresses are then retrieved automatically to save time. Payment must be made by card, not by cheque, which maximises the number of processed calls. The range of insurables is limited somewhat arbitrarily but effectively to exclude most apparent potential risks: sports cars and pop musicians are not taken on. The system cuts out the middlemen, enabling the business to be run more efficiently and undercut its rivals. At the same time the culture of the business has changed to Direct Line's advantage; people are far more inclined to shop around for the best deal. In 1987 the company branched out into household policies and it is now in the top ten in that league. It has recently begun to diversify further into personal loans, using data from car and domestic policies to assess the risk. Direct Line's system is run on a Comparex mainframe at its head office in Croydon, claimed to be the largest online transaction processing operation in Europe. Mr Mike Flaherty, Direct Line's executive director, says that he and five colleagues wrote the software in six months, using Computer Associates' fourth generation language, Generol. It was based on IBM's CICS transaction processing system and on flat files rather than a relational database in order to get the highest possible speed of response. Direct Line's approach has been followed in recent years by several firms including Churchill Insurance, General Accident and Eagle Star. Mr Bowen expects that virtually all the main insurers will have set up direct companies within a year. The entry level cost for the computer system is probably around Pounds 500,000; a 200-user system might cost around Pounds 2m. New entrants are mainly buying UNIX-based machines from companies such as Pyramid and Sequent. Falling hardware prices have opened the business up to more competitors. The insurance industry is now asking itself how widely these techniques can be applied. There is no reason to doubt that computers could handle it, but would people accept it? Sceptics argue that the motor policy market is an exceptionally simple one and that what works there will not necessarily work in other fields. Domestic insurance policies can be managed over the phone, although they take slightly longer to set up than motor policies. But personal loans, mortgages, pensions and life assurance may be a different sort of business. Loans and mortgages, traditionally arranged by a half-hour chat with the local bank manager, could prove less amenable to the direct selling operation. People may be reluctant to take a decision which could affect the rest of their lives on the basis of a short telephone conversation with someone they have never met. Undaunted, however, Direct Line launched a direct system for personal loans in August, aimed at its 1.5m customers, after a successful pilot project earlier in the year. Interviews are expected to take only take eight minutes on average and a decision can be taken at the end of that time. Next spring it will test a new system for mortgages and after that will move on to a sickness benefit system.</p>

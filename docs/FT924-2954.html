			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Time to tempt fate - Political Notebook It would be too serious an affront to fate to state with confidence that the government has turned the corner. Too many things could yet go wrong - tomorrow's Edinburgh summit among them. Hard experience has taught ministers that the green shoots now re-appearing in parts of the economy are as likely to wither as flourish. And yet there has been a palpable lightening in the mood at Westminster. Conservative MPs are learning to smile again. Ministers are whispering that perhaps, just perhaps, the worst is over. A cabinet minister confessed this week that last Sunday was the first since September that he managed to spend in his garden. Labour MPs have lost some of the spring from their step. Some have taken to sniping at Mr John Smith instead of harrying the government. In part, the change is simply a reflection of the relative optimism in London's financial markets. It has been some time since ministers have woken up to headlines declaring that international investors are switching funds into sterling. Their City contacts tell them that the stockmarket's recent strength is well-founded. Conservative MPs have noticed also a change in their constituencies. Local party activists are still deeply gloomy about unemployment and house prices. But they detect a sense that things are no longer getting worse: there may be few visible signs of recovery but nor is their evidence that the economy is still sliding further into slump. The same sort of judgments are being made in the Treasury. For the first time in recent memory an economic forecast has survived a month. The prediction in the Autumn Statement of a slow and anaemic recovery next year remains credible. Ministers believe that the economic forecasters may have learnt their lesson and have erred on the side of pessimism. There are other straws in the wind. In the wake of the crises over sterling, the coal industry and Maastricht, the machinery of government froze. Political survival replaced governing the country. With ministers looking no more than two or three days ahead, their departments stopped producing the paperwork essential to decision-making. Crisis management replaced forward planning. That paralysis has lifted. Ministers have started to think ahead again. Downing Street has begun to set again the performance targets essential to kick-start the machine into life. Ministers have been told to come up with medium-term strategies for their departments. Mr Kenneth Clarke at the Home Office is promising the sort of radical reform of the police and prison services which he delivered at the health department. At education Mr John Patten is turning his mind from reading lists for 14-year-olds to a dramatic extension of technical education for 16-to-19-year-olds at further education colleges. More immediately, ministers have been asked to offer in the new year their contributions to Mr Michael Heseltine's commitment to ease the regulatory burden on business. Mr Stephen Dorrell, a bright young Treasury minister who carries little ideological baggage, has been charged with giving substance to the pledge of greater private sector involvement in big infrastructure projects. Behind the scenes there is evidence also that the government's acknowledgement that manufacturing industry counts will be translated into policy. Mr Heseltine is busy changing the institutional framework for the government's relations with industry. Downing Street says he has the prime minister's full backing. The aid package for industry unveiled in the Autumn Statement has produced the beginning of a cultural change in Whitehall. Business is no longer faced with a reflex accusation of whingeing when it asks for help. This does not add to a programme for government. Ministers are acutely conscious that after the horrors of the past few months Mr Major's administration lacks anything that could pass muster as a central ambition. Nor do they have much idea of how economic policy will operate over the medium term. The government can no longer promise even to cut taxes. Even a successful summit will not banish the arguments over Britain's place in Europe. Ratifying the Maastricht treaty will undoubtedly be a painful process for Mr Major. Failure to ratify would end his premiership. For now, Mr Major's colleagues believe it may be enough simply to have survived. Success these days is measured in strictly relative terms. A batch of bad economic indicators or a debacle in Edinburgh would shatter the calm. But maybe, just maybe, it is time to tempt fate.</p>

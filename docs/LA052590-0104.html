			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS TO NAME SCHULER;  </P> <P> NBA: FORMER TRAIL BLAZER COACH TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY AS CASEY'S REPLACEMENT.  </P> <P> The Clippers have called a news conference for today to introduce Mike Schuler  as their new coach, sources said Thursday.  </P> <P> An assistant with the Golden State Warriors the last 1 1/2 seasons, Schuler,  49, has long been a Clipper favorite. They interviewed him last year when the  job went to Don Casey, then the interim coach.  </P> <P> When Casey's option was not picked up after this season, Schuler became an  immediate candidate. He and Mike Fratello, formerly coach of the Atlanta Hawks,  were the only two who met with General Manager Elgin Baylor and owner Donald T.  Sterling. Both candidates made final visits this week.  </P> <P> The Clippers also were interested in K.C. Jones and Bernie Bickerstaff, both  with the Seattle SuperSonics; Jimmy Rodgers, recently fired as coach of the  Boston Celtics, and Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens. But in each case, the  Clippers were either refused permission by teams or told no thanks by the  individual.  </P> <P> A native of Portsmouth, Ohio, Schuler has been an assistant to three of the  biggest names in basketball: Bob Knight (at Army), Larry Brown (New Jersey  Nets) and Don Nelson (Milwaukee Bucks and Warriors). He has been head coach at  Virginia Military Institute, Rice University and, starting in 1986, with the  Portland Trail Blazers, where he built his current reputation.  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers went 127-83 (.605) with Schuler in charge, including the  49-33 finish that earned him the NBA's coach of the year award in 1987.  </P> <P> But he was fired in February of 1989 after ongoing personality conflicts with  players, it was reported. Some team members considered him too hard-driving,  and from there every problem was magnified.  </P> <P> Schuler never denied he had personality differences with players. But, he said,  the unhappy ones were in the minority -- and the loudest. At the forefront was  Clyde Drexler, the team's star.  </P> <P> So, a year after hiring Casey, who built his reputation as a motivator and a  player favorite, the Clippers will turn to someone who is looked upon, at least  by former players, as a disciplinarian.  </P> <P> Schuler could not be reached for comment, although he would not confirm or deny  the reports to Bay Area reporters. Baylor refused to answer any questions on  the subject.  </P> <P> Casey, who helped the Clippers to a 30-52 record last season, a nine-game  improvement from the previous season, interviewed Wednesday to become director  of basketball operations for the Denver Nuggets. He is also a candidate to  become an assistant on the staff of the Hawks' new coach, Bob Weiss.  </P></p>

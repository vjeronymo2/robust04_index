			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: 'Free' energy market is in reality controlled Sir, Your leader, 'A single EC energy market' (January 31), notes that only the UK remotely approaches the kind of free-market regime envisaged in Brussels, yet misses an important point about the British experience in creating 'free markets' for energy, particularly natural gas. The manner of last week's decision to allow gas imports makes it abundantly clear that the government has determined, and will continue to determine, the parties allowed to import, the volumes they are allowed to import, and the means by which they are allowed to import. As Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, noted in your columns (Monday Interview, December 16 1991): 'The thing I want to dispel is that we believe you can just leave these things to the free market. You can't. You have to create a free market if you want one.' Holding the UK up as a shining example simply reinforces energy industry suspicions that the single energy market is a means by which Brussels politicians and bureaucrats hope to gain control of important commercial decisions in the name of creating free markets.

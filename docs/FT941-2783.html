			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (4): Poverty stalks the losers Despite the irrefutable evidence of greater prosperity generated by a substantially transformed economy many Poles feel excluded from the benefits. Out of a population of 39m, nearly 9m are pensioners and almost 3m are registered as unemployed. More than 700,000 of the unemployed, those without jobs for over a year, are no longer eligible for unemployment pay and have to rely on other forms of social security, although many are able to supplement their small official incomes by part-time work and moonlighting. Sociologists believe children are the main sufferers from the poverty to which the abolition of food, housing and heating subsidies has exposed families of the unemployed or those on low incomes. They are most exposed to the high prices which have replaced the subsidised basics of the socialist past. By the end of 1993, the real incomes of Poland's 15m wage earners were still 2.9 per cent below the levels of December 1992, in spite of a 9 per cent rise in real average wages in December. For millions of workers and the unemployed real incomes remain well below 1989 levels, although the quality and variety of goods available is much higher than five years ago when imported or domestically-produced consumer goods were in short supply. In March the hated popiwek, or tax on public sector wage increases, is being abolished, as promised by the SLD during its election campaign, although it is being replaced by a similar wage restraining mechanism. The coalition government of former communists and peasant farmers is sensitive to the demands of its worker and peasant electorates for greater social security, more social spending and higher wages. But it is still probably true that the rapid growth of the private sector, which now accounts for around 60 per cent of total employment, holds out the main prospect for future job creation and wage gains. Rising labour productivity rather than labour militancy, holds out the best prospect for wage earners in 1994, especially when employment starts to rise again after four years of steep declines. Unemployment rose again last year, however, to reach nearly 2.9m, more than 15.7 per cent of the labour force at the start of the year, and could well top 3m before starting to fall. High unemployment reduces militancy and acts as a brake on wages growth. The trade unions have also lost much of their former political and economic clout. The unions are specially weak in the fragmented private sector of the economy, where employment is rising, but are also losing ground as the public sector, with its oversized factories, ageing mines and shipyards, restructures the best or closes the hopeless loss makers.</p>

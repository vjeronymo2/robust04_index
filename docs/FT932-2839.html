			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Rail union to ballot on action THE RMT railworkers' union yesterday rejected a 1.5 per cent offer from British Rail and said it would ballot its 65,000 members next month over possible industrial action. A strike looks unlikely following the members' rejection less than a month ago of the leadership's advice to continue industrial action over job cuts and the use of contract labour.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Brazil's new economic double-act: Two unknowns take centre stage A resounding Who? greeted last month's appointments of Mr Paulo Haddad and Mr Gustavo Krause, the new double-act controlling Brazil's battered economy. Unknown to much of Brazil, never mind the rest of the world, the two men are now preparing to present themselves on the international stage. Early next month, they will resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in talks long put on hold while the country was absorbed by the corruption scandal that brought down President Fernando Collor. Although Mr Krause holds the normally more important portfolio of finance, it is Mr Haddad, the new planning minister, who has clearly emerged as the one in charge of economic policy. He seems untroubled by the inevitable comparison of his provincial experience, as an economist and state planning secretary in Minas Gerais, with that of his internationally respected predecessor, Mr Marclio Marques Moreira. Nevertheless, Mr Haddad - the third economy minister in two years to begin battle with Brazilian inflation (now running at an annual 1,500 per cent) - admits his problems are daunting. Yesterday he was putting the final touches to the short-term economic programme which the new team will present to the IMF and which he believes will reassure doubtors of the government's commitment to modernisation. He feels people are being a little hard on the new team: 'We are up to date with payments to the World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank. Tomorrow we will pay almost Dollars 1bn in past-due interest to creditor banks. We have maintained the opening of the economy. Before the end of year we will carry out a big privatisation with the sale of National Steel. The facts speak for themselves.' He plans to avoid unorthodox measures such as freezing wages and prices or dollarisation. He says the much-mooted social pact is impossible because 'the co-operative spirit is very small as too many people are benefiting from the current situation.' Mr Haddad is betting everything on his fiscal reform package, through which he hopes to raise at least Dollars 8bn to begin amortising federal debt. He refuses to be worried by the lack of congressional enthusiasm for the package, but, he warns: 'If we don't pass it this year, the situation will be very dramatic, with sweeping cuts even in areas of social policy.' The privatisation programme will be maintained, but the rules will be altered for sectors yet to be touched - telecommunications, oil, electrical and nuclear energy. He says 'the aim is less to sell off assets and more to incorporate the private sector so the state still co-ordinates these strategic sectors.' He admits the government is struggling to formulate a policy on public sector tariffs. 'When we took office, state companies were all adjusting their prices in different ways. The electricity company, for example, was taking monthly monetary correction and adding 3 per cent. Nobody was looking at cost, efficiency or productivity but simply passing on waste to consumers.' He points out as an example that a hydroelectric project in Brazil costs more than twice as much as it does elsewhere. Mr Haddad hopes a new tariff policy and consolidation of the privatisation programme will encourage the return of foreign investors. These changes will also have to be incorporated into the IMF accord, which requires a 15-17 per cent real increase in tariffs by the end of 1993. Technical level talks with the IMF begin next week, to be followed by the mission led by Mr Haddad. He hopes that before his visit the Senate will have approved the termsheet for the restructuring of Brazil's Dollars 44bn commercial debt. The IMF is likely to ask some tough questions, given Brazil's poor record of the last decade of never progressing beyond the first instalment in an IMF loan agreement. But Mr Haddad says he expects a sympathetic reception: 'Such international institutions come under a lot of pressure from public opinion, and the fact that they had been negotiating with a corrupt government which had been wasting a lot of money will mean they will be eager to help the new administration.'</p>

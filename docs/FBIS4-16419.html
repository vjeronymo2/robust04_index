			<p>BFN     [Text] Men aged from 25 to 45 have been obliged not to  leave the republic and to undergo a three-month course of  military training. They can travel to places outside Armenia  only by special permit.    Military training is considered to be a forced measure,  caused by the complicated situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani  border.</p>

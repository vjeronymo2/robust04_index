			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bailey (1905) stated that the jaguar was once reported as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common in southern and eastern Texas but had become extremely rare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nowak (1975) believed that an established population once occurred in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dense thickets along the lower Nueces River and northeast to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guadalupe River. He suggested that jaguars probably continued to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wander from Mexico into the brush country of the southernmost part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State. However, brush clearing has possibly reduced chances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reestablishment of the species in Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Leopold (1959) believed the distribution of the jaguar in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mexico included the tropical forests of southeastern Mexico, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coastal plains to the mouth of the Rio Grande on the Gulf of Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> side, and the Sonoran foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pacific side. The highest densities of jaguars were found along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavily forested flatlands and foothills of southern Sinaloa, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> swamps of coastal Nayarit, the remaining uncut forests along the Gulf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coast as far east as central Campeche, and the great rain forests of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> northern Chiapas. He indicated that occasional wandering individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were found far from these areas; some followed tropical gorges far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into mountains. He believed that jaguars followed big rivers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their northern movements; they traveled up the Brazos, Pecos, Rio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grande, Gila, and Colorado Rivers. He mentioned a 1955 record of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar near the southern tip of the San Pedro Martir range, Baja  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. Leopold asserted that this individual was 500 miles from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly occupied jaguar habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Swank and Teer (1989) described the distribution of the jaguar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in North America as a broad belt from central Mexico to Central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> America. They found that the most northerly established populations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as reported by Mexican officials, were in southern Sinaloa and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> southern Tamaulipas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brown (1991) did not believe that the jaguar was extirpated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from northern Mexico. Although jaguars were considered relatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common in Sonora in the 1930s and 1940s, he cited the most northern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officially reported population as about 800 miles south of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States-Mexico border. However, Brown suggested that there may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more jaguars in Sonora than are officially reported. He mentioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports of two jaguars that were killed in central Sonora around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1970. He also discussed assertions by the local Indians that both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> male and female jaguars still occurred in the Sierra Bacatete. Brown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speculated that if a reproducing population of jaguars is still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in these mountains, it may be the source of individuals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> travel northward through the Sierra Libre and Sierra Madera until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they reach Arizona. Nowak (pers. comm., 1992) reiterated that as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> late as 1987 the species was still considered common in the Sierra  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bacatete near Guaymas, Sonora, which is about 200 miles south of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arizona.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brown (1989) reported that biologists from Mexico have stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that at least two jaguars have been killed in Chihuahua. In 1987,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nowak (pers. comm., 1992) claimed that jaguars were still regularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present along the Soto la Marina River of central Tamaulipas, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is about 150 miles from the southern tip of Texas. He also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hypothesized that jaguars may be entering Arizona from Mexico as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of habitat destruction in Sonora. Large stretches of natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forest have been cleared in central Tamaulipas. In Arizona, by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrast, jaguar prey populations have increased, and large tracts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brush and canyon woodland are still available to provide cover for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguars. Listing will provide protection for individuals, which may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead to recolonization of currently unoccupied habitat and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reestablishment of the species in portions of its historical Arizona  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clearing of habitat, destruction of riparian areas, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fragmentation or blocking of corridors may prevent jaguars from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recolonizing previously inhabited areas. Although there is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no known resident population of jaguars in the United States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wanderers from Mexico may cross the border and take up residency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or Educational Purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Arizona, the jaguar's gradual decline was concurrent with predator control associated with the settlement of land and the development of the cattle industry (Brown 1983, Service 1990). Lange (1960) summarized the jaguar records from Arizona known up to that time. Between 1885 and 1959, the reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisted of 45 jaguars killed, 6 sighted, and 2 recorded by sign.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brown (1991) related that the accumulation of all known records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated a minimum of 64 jaguars were killed in Arizona after 1900.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When plotted at ten-year intervals, records of jaguars reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> killed in Arizona and New Mexico between 1900 and 1980 demonstrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``a decline characteristic of an over-exploited resident population''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Brown 1983). Brown (1983) argued that if the jaguars killed during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this period originated in Mexico, the numbers of killings should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggest a pattern but should rather be irregular and erratic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bailey (1905) listed seven reports of jaguars killed in Texas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 1853 and 1903. Schmidly (1983) reported another jaguar shot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Mills County in 1904. Taylor (1947) mentioned a jaguar killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near Lyford, Willacy County, in 1912. Brown (1991) indicated jaguars  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were common in Texas until 1870. The last reports from Texas were of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals killed in 1946 (San Benito, Cameron County) and 1948  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Kleburg County). Nowak (1975) identified killing of jaguars for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial sale of their furs as a factor in the extermination of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial resident population in central Texas during the late 19th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> century.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the demand for jaguar pelts has diminished, it still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists along with the business of hunting jaguars. In 1992, AGFD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel infiltrated a ring of wildlife profiteers. That operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in the March, 1993, seizure of three jaguar specimens, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which was allegedly taken from the Dos Cabezas Mountains in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arizona in 1986. Two of the specimens had been covertly purchased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the suspects. During the investigation, several ties to Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar hunting were discovered. Hounds bred and trained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States were sold to Mexican nationals for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hunting jaguars. Also, Mexican nationals prosecuted by the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1989 for illegally importing jaguar pelts into the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were continuing the practice of providing jaguar hunts in Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Terry B. Johnson, Arizona Game and Fish Department,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

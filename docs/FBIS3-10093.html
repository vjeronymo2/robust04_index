			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan  Army has confirmed its support for President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio and the democratic process and asserts in a communique  released today that the head of state has preserved the  "apolitical nature" of the Armed Forces.    The Army denied that the president had intended to implicate  it in political-electoral activities, as General Jose Luis  Quilo, the dismissed chief of the General Staff of National  Defense, asserted on Friday. "No effort has been made to  manipulate the Army, and the president has not handed down  instructions to influence the Civil Defense Volunteer  Committees," the communique underscored.    Quilo accused de Leon of having asked Army commanders to  exert pressure on the civilian patrols so they would vote in  favor of the constitutional reforms during the popular  referendum on 30 January.    The president and Defense Minister General Mario Rene  Enriquez denied the allegations, and they both pointed out that  Quilo's remarks reflected his resentment at being dismissed from  his post. The Army says the general's assertions were distorted  and today confirmed its "total respect for the country's  institutionalism and its support for the current government."  The Armed Forces also urged every sector of the country to  intensify its efforts in favor of peace and national  reconciliation.    Meanwhile, the defense minister announced that if Quilo  insists on leveling accusations against the president and Army  he could be taken to court.</p>

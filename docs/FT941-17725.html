			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / US, N Korea 'progress' on arms The US and North Korea are reported to have made substantial progress in talks to defuse tension over the latter's nuclear arms programme, Jurek Martin writes from Washington. Reflecting guarded optimism in Washington, the State Department said the US had 'moved closer' to its goal of opening the North's nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection. He said progress had also been made on promoting a dialogue between the two Koreas on nuclear matters. The North Korean state news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry official in Pyongyang as having said the facilities would be made available for limited inspection shortly, with full access under negotiation. The official, who called fruit of the latest negotiations a 'breakthrough', also said the US was willing to end its annual joint military exercises with South Korea, known as Team Spirit, as the North has long demanded, and to improve diplomatic relations.</p>

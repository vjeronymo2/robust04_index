			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dissent resurfaces at Hoesch meeting SHAREHOLDERS in Hoesch, the Dortmund-based German steelmaker, yesterday bowed to the inevitable and gave the green light to their takeover by the rival Essen-based Fried. Krupp group. Yet it was not without angry criticism of the whole 'shotgun wedding' from the floor at yesterday's seven-hour annual meeting. The 850 shareholders in attendance voted by a large majority to do away with the company rule that a single shareholder can only exercise a maximum voting right of 15 per cent. That allowed Fried. Krupp, led by Mr Gerhard Cromme, the chief executive who plotted the whole campaign, to use the full 62 per cent of the capital it has acquired, since launching the 'forced merger' bid last October. Mr Cromme and three other Krupp executives were elected to the Hoesch supervisory board, and Mr Cromme was expected to be elected chairman last night. The resistance to the merger came especially from Hoesch employee-shareholders, according to the VWD news agency, after they gave notice of no fewer than 90 contrary resolutions to the proposals of the Hoesch supervisory board. Accusations from the floor were directed at both Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive of Hoesch, and Dr Herbert Zapp of Deutsche Bank, the chairman of the supervisory board. There was also anger that Mr Neukirchen, only appointed as Hoesch chief executive last year, will still receive more than DM6m, the full remaining value of his five-year contract, if he leaves the company early after the merger, the agency reported. Mr Neukirchen result standing DM80m (Dollars 50.6m) above the same period of 1991. In 1991, Hoesch made a profit of just DM126.8m on turnover of DM13.1bn.</p>

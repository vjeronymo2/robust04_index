			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Men without vision and no particular place to go That rattling you heard over the weekend was the sound of pea-sized ideas shaking about in the brainboxes of our politicians. There is no new song. There is only the rhythm of maracas. This is not our leaders' fault. They strive to think big, but are obliged by circumstance and their own intrinsic qualities to think small. Mr John Major is the puppet of events. He does well to stand straight when fate pulls his strings. Mr John Smith is constrained by the antiquated mechanisms of the Labour party. He could point it in a more auspicious direction, if he knew what that was. Whether it would then move forwards is, shall we say, open to doubt. We must not deride these well-meaning souls for their inability to create new visions. The prime minister was not elected to the post of visionary-in-chief, nor is he suited to such a post. The leader of the official opposition is not a philosopher. He is a Scottish lawyer. On the basis of his track record since last summer, he has become the uninspiring manager of a decaying party of the left. The hard truth is that, while both Mr Major and Mr Smith are 'nice', neither is extraordinary. Ordinary men have no option but to make the best they can of small-print politics, and the roll of the dice. It would surprise us all if either of them emerged as the progenitor of a grand new mission for Britain. In any case, the intellectual climate is not conducive to such a project. Before the 1980s, it was respectable to argue that society could be restructured by a reforming government. The left talked of 'building socialism'. Progress was assumed to be inevitable. The establishment of the welfare state after 1945 was seen, correctly, as a permanent improvement in the British polity. Other wheezes were harmful. Nationalisation was the consequence of a postwar delusion about the efficacy of planning by officials. Nonsense about a permanent and irreversible shift of power to the working classes was seriously debated. All politicians promised peace, prosperity, full employment and the warm embrace of welfare. The voters, poor suckers, believed them. The then Mrs Margaret Thatcher was history's corrective mechanism. The mission she discerned in 1979 seems obvious in 1993. She denationalised industries, rolled back the frontiers of the state, crunched the trade unions and, most memorably, insisted that public enterprises keep proper books. 'Value for money' may be a tired slogan, but it is the most precious legacy of the Thatcher years. Before the former prime minister came along, public sector managers could not count pennies. It did not occur to them that they should. To instil in their heads the idea that they must tailor expenditure to income was a worthy project. Today there is nothing on offer as striking as the revolutionary idealism of the 1960s or the counter-revolution of the 1980s. Until Black Wednesday, when sterling was withdrawn from the European exchange rate mechanism, both Mr Major and Mr Smith rested on the proposition that Britain's mission was to be a successful European state. Their attitude to this was bipartisan. Our governing purpose was to become 'the best in Europe'. Only the social charter divided the parties. The ERM and, by implication, monetary union were the lodestars. Thus guided, we would achieve non-inflationary growth. The European project still has merit, but it will no longer serve as a theoretical underpinning to justify the careers of the Conservative or Labour leaders. As such, it was blown out of the water on September 16. The weekend's deliberations by the two main parties were therefore less than elevated. The principal concern was how to win votes. Designing a blueprint for a better society was not on the agenda. In Labour's case, the greatest heat was reserved for an argument about whether the official opposition should stay as it is, and lose a fifth election in a row, or learn the lesson of US President-elect Bill Clinton's appeal to the middle classes. Taken to its logical conclusion, an emulation of the new Democrats' transatlantic success would place Labour alongside or slightly to the right of Mr Major's Conservatives. Don't scoff. That could be Mr Smith's only hope. I was not present at, nor did I bug, the private conversations between Mr Major and the Conservative chairman, Sir Norman Fowler, at Chequers on Sunday and yesterday. The prime minister's staff is reported as saying that the talks were about improving choice, opportunity, responsibility and enhanced ownership. The agenda included the promotion of business and enterprise, particularly through de-regulation; health and education reforms, especially widening opportunities for 16 to 19-year-olds; the Citizen's Charter; and tackling crime. Meanwhile the Treasury's parallel meeting discussed how to get out of the fiscal hole into which the government has dug itself. Wonderful stuff, but it hardly replaces the empire, or the heart of Europe, or zero inflation. Great themes do exist, but only in the abstract. It is possible to put constitutional reform at the head of the agenda. The Liberal Democrats have done so; Labour might. There is plenty to say about the dangers of one-party rule, the systematic destruction of local government, the emergence of the patronage state as powerful appointed bodies proliferate and, indeed, Celtic nationalisms. I suspect that little of this would win many votes in England. A slightly more electorally profitable approach might be to debate the effect of growth on the environment, and environmental protection on growth. The new Clinton administration will probably lead the way. It is bound to be green, and bound to promote growth. When prosperity returns, green politics will again become fashionable, as Mr Major's Conservatives know well. But their immediate ob-jective is to recover from a terrible autumn. Their medium-term mission is to win again. The consequence is clear. Britain is destined to be governed as what it is - a middling country muddling along, with no particular place to go.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Kashmir gunmen kidnap Britons Two Britons, including the 16-year-old son of a former Financial Times correspondent, have been kidnapped in Indian-held Kashmir by Moslem militants demanding the release of three jailed guerrillas. The gunmen set upon Mr David Housego, former New Delhi correspondent of the FT and now a Delhi-based businessman, his wife Jenny and younger son Kim as they were trekking on Monday with Mr David Mackie, a British video director. Kim Housego and Mr Mackie, who is 36, were abducted. Mr and Mrs Housego yesterday returned to Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, and contacted the authorities. The Indian army was alerted and photographs of the captives distributed. However, there was no indication of any contact between the Indian authorities and the militants. Mr Housego said the captors appeared to be mostly Pathans who spoke both Pashto and Urdu, suggesting that at least some of them were from Pakistan. He was given a note in Urdu demanding the release of three men who are known to be members of the Harkatul Ansar militant group, including its leader, Mr Mohammed Sajjad. All are in Indian custody. Some Pathans, who live in north-western Pakistan and Afghanistan, have joined Kashmiri Moslems in their rebellion against Indian rule in Kashmir, where most of the population are Moslems. Thousands of people, including many civilians, have died in fighting over the past four years. The Foreign Office, which was last night monitoring the situation, said the British High Commission in Delhi was planning to send an official to Srinagar. Mr Housego left the FT in 1992 to establish a Delhi-based textile manufacturing and export business.</p>

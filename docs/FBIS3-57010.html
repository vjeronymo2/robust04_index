It might seem that this is  not such a long stretch of time. However, looking back and  analyzing the path that has been covered, one can see with  particular clarity not only all of our achievements, but also  problems and shortcomings. I would like to consider some of  them separately.    We inherited a considerable military formation from the  former Soviet Army. However, in terms of structure and military  equipment, it did not conform to those tasks that arose before  Ukraine with regard to ensuring its own defense capability. At  the first stage, we tried to reform those Union army forces into  Ukraine's Armed Forces. However, later, it became clear that  Ukraine needs an army that would not be a successor to any other  army, that would possess characteristics reflecting the  historical and national traditions, would be based upon its own  infrastructure, and would take into account our states's  specific geostrategic situation and other characteristics. As a  consequence, we became convinced that it is not reforms that we  must occupy ourselves with, but the building of our own Armed  Forces. Of course, one cannot avoid problems in this demanding  work.    Among the problems that I am particularly concerned with,  the  problem of the personnel occupies the primary position. In  those decisive months when Ukraine was acquiring the status and  the characteristics of an independent state, some people who did  not really care about the state's sovereignty, but only wanted  to keep their "cushy jobs," benefits enjoyed by the  nomenklatura, and so on managed to get into the leadership of  the Defense Ministry. Of course, they did not really bother to  build the Ukrainian Army in the best possible way. We can now  see the consequences of such work particularly well. We have  been gradually ridding ourselves of the services of such people  over the entire period of existence of Ukraine's Armed Forces  and are still removing them.    We must adhere to one criterion: The serviceman's high  military professionalism based upon the highest level of general  and special training, his way of life, spiritual state, way of  thinking, and activity. Competence, responsibility for the  assigned task, and loyalty to Ukraine are those qualities that  we must take as a basis for distinguishing a military  professional from a time-serving dilettante.    The general public knows how many emotions erupted, in  particular around the question of reforming military education.  The Ministry of Defense and the head of the military education  administration in person were criticized in the press for the  errors, shortcomings, and distortions in that work. In many  cases, that criticism was justified. Therefore, we need to put  in much effort to rectify the situation. However, in my  opinion, a new, more experienced and better qualified person  must head this work and the main administration for educational  work.    Many people remember the controversial reaction to the  Ukrainian presidential edict on unifying the Air Force and Air  Defense into Air Defense Troops. There were radically opposed  opinions, and there was a real battle in the press. It was for  a good reason. Today, it must be admitted that this step was  untimely. Even despite the fact that, with the exception of  Russia, China, and Romania, all other states of the world have  these types of armed forces unified. I am sure that Ukraine  must proceed to such unification gradually, in a balanced  manner, and without haste, in order to avoid impairing our  defense capability.    Well, for the time being, our Air Force and Air Defense  function separately. The only acute problem that bothers them  is the shortage of fuel.    Thus, the reform in military education, the attempt to  hastily create Air Defense Troops, and the difficulties with  building our own Naval Forces -- these and a number of other  objective and subjective factors could but hamper the processes  of building Ukraine's Armed Forces. The insufficiently skilled  personnel and the shortage of money have further intensified the  problem. Nor can one refrain from putting blame upon members of  the Defense Ministry Military Board, deputy ministers, chiefs of  administration, or commanders of the Armed Forces and military  districts.    Yet another acute problem is the fact that we have not had a  defense budget for two years. Precisely its absence has become  one of the main reasons for neglecting such constituents upon  which the state's defense capability is based: science, the  military-industrial complex, and the army.    Today, those scientists who must work for defense are in a  difficult situation -- they must think of how to survive,  instead of creating something new.    The situation at Ukraine's defense enterprises is not much  better: Some of them stand completely idle, while at others,  individual workshops and technological lines with most  up-to-date equipment do not work. There are no state orders and  no money. As a result, highly skilled specialists are leaving  en masse. I could see that with my own eyes during numerous  visits to enterprises of the military-industrial complex.    World experience indicates that armed forces must be built  on  the basis of the achievements of military science and the most  expedient utilization of the possibilities of defense  enterprises.    It is clear that for this we need funding. A separate fund  for science, a separate one for the military industrial complex,  and again a separate fund for maintaining the army. Of course,  this will come up to quite a large figure, but we cannot do  without large outlays if we want to be reliably protected.    Several variants of the defense budget have already been  elaborated by corresponding specialists. The documents have now  been submitted to the Ukrainian president. It is possible that  Ukraine's Supreme Council will discuss and approve the best of  them in the second half of January. It is true, though, that  Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is already  insisting that the defense budget be reduced.    One often hears complaints about the numerical strength of  Ukraine's Armed Forces. Some people say that the Army could be  smaller and would, in that case, require much less money. At  present, the Ukrainian Army has 533,000 servicemen. In  accordance with world norms, the variant in which 1 percent of  the state's population serves in the army is considered optimal.  Therefore, all grumbling about the size of the Army is  groundless. However, notwithstanding this, we are planning to  reduce the Army to between 300,000 and 350,000 servicemen by the  year 2000. This cannot be done in one go, as it is necessary to  provide those servicemen who are demobilized with housing and  work. Incidentally, many people are now willing to leave the  Army. They are not satisfied with low salaries, delays with  payments, problems with obtaining uniforms, and the absence of  housing.... In 1994, the Army will be reduced by 90,000 persons.    The problem of introducing the Ukrainian language in our  troops is not simple. This problem is further aggravated by the  relatively small number of officers with a command of the  language and by the absence of special military literature in  the state language. It is only with the help of a sufficient  financing of the instruction process and with a deep conviction  on the part of our soldiers that they need to master the  Ukrainian language that we will be able to get rid of the  shortcomings fast and with good results.    It is necessary for every serviceman to be deeply convinced  that he needs to study the language and the glorious history of  Ukraine, its customs, traditions, and culture not only for his  own general and spiritual development, but also in order to be  proud of being the son of this land, of having grown on it and  nurtured by it, for which he must ardently love it. The main  thing is that he must be aware of the high honor of defending  Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity with weapons.    Our army has recently been reproached for remaining aloof  with regard to political activity. I must point out that this  is not my own invention or whim. Ukraine's legislation has  determined that total departmentalization of the Armed Forces is  one of the main principles of building them. The Army is a  state structure and, like in any law-governed state, it must  adhere to the government's political line and not meander among  the positions of various parties and movements. Isn't this  right?    Many people are presently concerned about such serious  problems as the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine and about  the division of the Black Sea Fleet among Ukraine and Russia.  It looks as if, this year, the question of strategic weapons  will finally be resolved based upon the tripartite agreement  between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. Compensation  has been promised to us for the tactical weapons withdrawn from  Ukraine back in 1992.    As regards the Black Sea Fleet, the settlement of this  problem is in the interests of both Ukraine and Russia. That is  why this question must not be resolved through confrontation or  by way of grabbing as much as possible, when economic and  political difficulties are taken advantage of, but with mutual  respect and through interaction and cooperation in this region  between our two states.    In conclusion, I want to gladden the hearts of those parents  whose sons will serve in our army: The restoration by the  Supreme Council of the two-year long army service that led to a  wave of misunderstanding among the civilian population is a  temporary measure. This step was due to the complication that  emerged last fall as a result of the simultaneous dismissal to  the reserve of two categories of conscripts -- both those who  had served two years and those who served one and one-half  years. Incidentally, even after the Supreme Council decision,  the period of service will be between 18 and 20 months, and not  a full two years.    One more thing: During meetings with the civilian  population, I often have to answer questions on whether the  Ukrainian people may now sleep peacefully. I assure you with  all responsibility -- our Armed Forces are capable of defending  their people and Ukraine's independence.</p>

Our sources  in the south reported that a resistance group launched a  lightening attack against al-'Amarah governor's headquarters in  al-Mashtal using medium-caliber machine guns and RPG-7's,  causing damage to the building.    The sources said that a large number of the regime's  henchmen  and officials of his organs of repression were present in the  building at the time of the attack. Ambulances and  fire-fighting teams were seen hurrying to the destroyed  headquarters and spent many hours pulling out the dead bodies of  the regime's henchmen.    Our sources later learned that the al-'Amarah governor was  away in Baghdad at the time of the assault.    The regime placed its forces on alert, adopted emergency  measures in al-'Amarah, and conducted an extensive search  operation that included arrests of citizens.    Another group of the Islamic resistance forces attacked a  military command vehicle belonging to the tyrant Saddam's forces  in Mid-January while it was traveling in al-Kahla' district in  al-'Amarah Maysan Governorate. Our sources said that the  vehicle was completely destroyed and the occupants killed  included a major, a lieutenant, and the driver. Following the  attack, the tyrant Saddam's forces conducted extensive patrols  and set up checkpoints manned by security personnel to search,  arrest, and interrogate citizens.    Kurdish opposition sources reported that an explosion has  occurred in the Border Guard headquarters which is adjacent to  the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. They said the  evacuation of those killed or wounded by the blast lasted for  two hours.    The same sources said that another military building used by  the Special Forces in Baghdad Governorate was the target of a  machine-gun attack in mid-January, killing army captain Sabri  Yasin al-Rawi and three other mercenaries.    According to our sources, the headquarters of al-Hindiyah's  district officer, a man known for his criminal behavior, was the  target of a lightning attack by five mujahidin.    Our mujahidin in Karbala' Governorate earlier attacked the  car of Kazim Marhun, a tribal chief in the area, forced him to  get out of the car, and then shot him. They then left behind  leaflets warning all those who terrorize our people to stop such  actions or they would meet the same fate.    Our heroic mujahidin inflicted just retribution on the  criminal Sattar 'Adday Taha in al-Jurn in al-Kaba'ish District  because he had perpetrated treasonous acts against our people in  that area. He had received several warnings to stop  implementing the tyrant Saddam's orders and to learn from the  death of his brother Samir 'Adday, who used to spy on our people  and who later received his just retribution at the hands of our  mujahidin.</p>

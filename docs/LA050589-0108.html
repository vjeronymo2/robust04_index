			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 67 ORANGE COUNTY TRANSIT BUSES ARE SIDELINED  </P> <P> Orange County officials pulled 67 buses from service Thursday as a  precautionary measure after mechanics found cracks that caused the rear  suspension on two buses to collapse last week, dropping coaches onto the rear  axles.  </P> <P> The removal, the largest in the history of the Orange County Transit District,  will lead to some delays in service, officials said. The buses withdrawn from  service represent more than 15% of the fleet.  </P> <P> Each of the suspect buses was equipped with a hydraulic lift to accommodate  wheelchair-bound patrons. Transit officials said lift-equipped vans will be  dispatched if regular buses cannot accommodate those seeking service.  </P> <P> No one was injured in either incident in which suspensions collapsed, officials  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Regulators Seize Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank: The Office of Thrift Supervision  placed long-struggling Rancho Bernardo Savings Bank in receivership and created  a new federally chartered S&amp;L that will assume many of the failed  institution's assets and liabilities.  </P> <P> The regulatory action dashed a planned recapitalization by Orange County thrift  consultant Jim Gough. The savings bank had $119 million in assets and about  5,000 depositors. Most of its $4.8 million in losses the past two years were  linked to a troubled real estate development in Escondido.  </P></p>

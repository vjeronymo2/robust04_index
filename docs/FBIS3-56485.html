			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoly Gordeyev] </F>   [Text] Kiev January 16 TASS -- Ukraine's political and  public forces are not unanimous in assessing the results of the  U.S.- Russian-Ukrainian summit in Moscow.    The Ukrainian parliament expects to discuss next week the  agreement signed at the tripartite meeting. However, some  opposition deputies, largely representing parties and movements  of radical nationalist orientation, have already denounced the  agreement reached by the three presidents and labelled the  results of the Moscow meeting as "betrayal of independent  Ukraine's interests."    Yuriy Kosenko, head of Ukraine's parliamentary commission  for  nuclear disarmament, also gave his view on the matter speaking  on Sunday in the radio programme "Ukraine and the World." He  said he would like to read the texts of the documents before  coming up with any legal conclusions about their lawfulness or  unlawfulness. This view was supported by Anton Buteyko, chief  of the presidential international service, who spoke in the same  programme. He emphasised that some ukrainian leaders had  rejected the document they had never seen, since it was of a  purely confidential character.    Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaly Radetskyy told reporters  that the main issue to be addressed at present was deactivation  of the nuclear weapons, which calls for immediate solution  because the time of warheads safe keeping was expiring.  According to Radetskyy, nuclear disarmament is not to affect in  any way the level of defence capability of the Ukrainian armed  forces. Moreover, security guarantees and Ukraine's territorial  integrity and independence which to be ensured by the leading  nuclear powers are designed to guarantee the republic's economic  revival and integration into the European and World markets, as  well as its recognition as an equal partner in cooperation for  peace.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Creditanstalt to sell most holdings after recovery CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, has achieved a substantial recovery in profit in the first half and plans to sell off most of its industrial holdings. In last year's group balance sheet, its investment portfolio was valued at Sch24.3bn (Dollars 2.02bn). Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman, said that the 77 per cent jump in first-half pre-tax profits to Sch2.3bn was due mainly to very good trading results, cost-cutting and the weak result in the first half of last year. He promised at least a partial restoration of its annual dividend after last year's 60 per cent cut. The bank, which was the subject of an unfriendly takeover bid last spring, hoped that at least some of the Austrian government's controlling shareholding could soon be placed with institutional investors. Creditanstalt shares have been among the strongest and most active on the Vienna bourse this year. The chairman said that following the sell-off of industrial holdings, the bank would retain only minority stakes of strategic value. Mr Peter Szopo, head of equity research at GiroCredit Bank in Vienna, estimated that the unstated surplus value in Creditanstalt's industrial portfolio was about Sch4bn. He suspected that the disposals would take at least five years, with some sales raising concern about foreign participation. At the end of 1992, Creditanstalt held, among other things, 74.3 per cent of Semperit, tyre maker; 71.2 per cent of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, motor group; 72.5 per cent of Treibacher Chemische Werke; 63.8 per cent of Universale-Bau, construction group and 59.4 per cent of Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the building materials group. The bank said its net interest and fee income grew only 8 per cent in the first half to Sch5.6bn as the margin on schilling business was by and large unchanged. However, operating expenses grew only 1.1 per cent to Sch4.4bn. Mr Schmidt-Chiari was confident that the operating result for the year would be considerably higher, thanks to the rise on the stock market and improving interest spreads. He cautioned that provisions for bad loans, while notably lower than last year's Sch5.66bn, would weigh on performance. The bank said the dividend for 1993 could be increased from last year's 6 per cent.</p>

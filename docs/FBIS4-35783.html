			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, Jun 3 (CNA) -- Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)  foreign ministers, who met in Cairo, expressed regret on Friday  [3 June] that the recent UN efforts to clinch an agreement on a  package of confidence building measures in Cyprus have ended in  failure because the Turkish side lacked political will.    The ministers also urged the UN Security Council to consider  alternative ways to promote the implementation of its  resolutions on Cyprus and recalled the idea of holding an  international conference on the problem.    Moreover they reiterated their support for the sovereignty,  independence, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned  status of the Republic of Cyprus.    The final document, adopted by the conference, which ended  on  Friday in the Egyptian capital, expressed the ministers' "regret  that the recent initiative for the implementation of a package  of confidence building measures has failed because the Turkish  side has not shown the necessary political will, as has been  reflected in the report of the UN secretary-general, just  published."    The UN-led talks on the measures, which included the  re-opening of Nicosia International Airport under UN control and  the delivery of part of the Turkish-occupied town of Varosha to  UN administration, ended in failure this week, nearly a year  after they started.    Calling for the intensification of efforts towards finding a  just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem, the ministers  "stressed the importance of securing compliance with all UN  resolutions on Cyprus" and "urged the UN Security Council to act  accordingly."    The four-day meeting called for "the withdrawal of foreign  troops and settlers" from Cyprus.    Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops  invaded and occupied the island's northern third. Turkey has  repeatedly refused to comply with numerous UN resolutions  calling for the withdrawal of its occupation forces.    The NAM document considered the present status quo in Cyprus  as "unacceptable" and expressed "deep regret and disappointment  that so far no solution had been found."    The ministers "welcomed the proposal by President of Cyprus  Glavkos Kliridhis for the demilitarisation of the Republic of  Cyprus."    The extract on Cyprus has been described as a "huge success"  because it contains many positions on the Cyprus issue that go  far beyond any previous NAM decisions, a statement issued here  on Friday said.    Cyprus Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis led an  eight-member delegation to the meeting, during which he had  separate meeting with 30 NAM foreign ministers.</p>

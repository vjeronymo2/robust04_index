			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Closer to the customers Deutsche Bank's huge branch network in Germany is undergoing one of the most fundamental transformations since the bank was broken into regions after the second world war. The slowly-growing competition for customers among German banks has forced it to re-think how services are delivered. Deutsche recognised the need to give customers at its 1,500 branches a more personal and effective service - and thus have a better chance of keeping them - in 1990. It started pushing authority down to local branch managers, and away from its head and regional offices four years ago. Not satisfied with the results, it is now trying to inject urgency into the process and involve staff more closely, with the introduction of Projekt Kundennahe (getting close to the customers). It involves visits to branches by board members, and training for staff. Mr Michael Endres, a member of the managing board, says it will boost the confidence of the 55,000 domestic employees. 'This has to reinvigorate our activities in Germany. There is also the question of motivation. The blows we have received this year have had some repercussions on our people.' Deutsche is keen to enhance links with the customer and strengthen a service mentality for which Germany is not exactly famed. The bank also plans to develop advisory skills. It wants staff to give financial advice to customers, and persuade them to buy a wider range of products. 'You have to find a way of opening up the bank more fully for the client,' says Mr Hilmar Kopper, the chairman. This is in line with efforts by banks in other European countries to sell more products such as residential mortgage loans and life insurance to customers. German customers have traditionally been as conservative as banks, but they are beginning to shop around for better deals. 'Three or four years ago, banks found it hard to compete with one another because customers were not price-sensitive, but there has been an attitudinal change,' says Mr Chris Williams, analyst at the broker Fox-Pitt Kelton. Banks now offer more products such as money market investment funds. They are also starting to charge companies for products and services that used to be included in lending margins before they were eroded. 'Banks are beginning to re-think, and they will attach price tags to individual services,' says Mr Hans-Peter Ferslev, head of Deutsche's strategy unit. Deutsche has tried to remove administrative responsibilities from middle managers, to give them more time to focus on lending and giving advice. Paper processing is being taken out of branches and done in regional centres, while personnel issues are being handled from head office. The aim is not simply to increase income, but to reduce the number of poor lending decisions. Mr Endres says the sharp rise in bad debt provisions on lending to small- and medium-sized companies last year was partly because managers had not devoted enough time to their customers. 'We saw in recent years, especially in our business with smaller and medium-sized companies, that we didn't take enough care of our clients,' says Mr Endres. He estimates that productivity (measured in profit per employee) has risen by about 30 per cent since reforms started in 1990. To reinforce the idea of personal responsibility, Deutsche has introduced performance-related pay at the level of branch director, and wants to extend it throughout the bank. 'Everybody can be drawn at his nose if something goes wrong. He cannot say that it is someone else's fault,' says Mr Endres. Deutsche has become a harsher place to work in other ways. Staff numbers fell by 2,800 in the domestic bank last year, with many middle managers taking early retirement. The impact of the changes in west Germany was partly cushioned by Deutsche's expansion into branch banking in the east. Mr Endres says that a change in attitudes is the most vital aspect of reforms. 'It is not just a matter of drawing lines and boxes on a chart, it is important that everyone knows that his role has changed,' he says. As competition grows in German banking, this will become increasingly apparent.</p>

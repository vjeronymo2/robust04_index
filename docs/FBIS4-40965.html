			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Navy regards as unacceptable the powers of  the Federal Atomic Surveillance Committee to control naval  nuclear power installations.    The Committee's Spokesman Yuriy Rogozhin told Interfax, his  office received a letter from the Navy Commander, Admiral Felix  Gromov, proposing interdepartmental inspection over nuclear  safety in the navy.    He said the committee is currently empowered to license army  units for running their nuclear or radioactive facilities and  inspect them. These powers were backed up by a decree issued by  the president on November 12, 1992.    The committee believes interdepartmental inspection instead  of state control could lead to incidents at naval nuclear sites.</p>

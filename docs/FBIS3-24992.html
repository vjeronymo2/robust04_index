Mr. Helder Proenca, member  of the political bureau of the African Party For the  Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, the ruling party,  reported this on 4 February in Lisbon.    Helder Proenca, who tackled issues relating to the ongoing  electoral process in his country with Portuguese authorities,  said that the possible delay in their preparation cannot justify  the postponement of the election for the end of the year.    The Portuguese newspaper PUBLICO wrote on 4 February that  the  president of the Republic, Joao Bernardo Vieira, candidate in  the presidential election, wishes to maintain the date of 27  March despite the "technical imposssibility" of the organization  of the election already recognized by the National Electoral  Commission and in which all legalized political parties are  represented.    Six candidates have already been registered but they have  not  officially presented their candidacy because the date of the  census of voters has not yet been set, the daily said, recalling  that only registered voters on electoral lists are eligible.</p>

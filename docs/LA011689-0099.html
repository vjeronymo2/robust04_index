			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STRANGE GAINS 2-STROKE WIN OVER FLOYD  </P> <P> Curtis Strange overcame blustery winds and agonizingly slow greens for a  1-over-par 73 Sunday and a 2-stroke victory over Raymond Floyd in the $525,000  Daikyo Palm Meadows golf tournament at Gold Coast, Australia.  </P> <P> Strange, the 1988 U.S. Open champion, finished with a 72-hole total of  8-under-par 280 and earned $92,000.  </P> <P> Last year, Strange won the nearby Sanctuary Cove tournament and went on to  become the first player to earn more than $1 million in a year on the PGA Tour.  </P> <P> Floyd shot a 73 for 282 and earned $55,080, and Terry Price had a 74 for 283  and collected $35,190 -- the biggest of his career.  </P> <P> Price, who last year failed in a bid to gain a U.S. Tour players' card, had to  go through qualifying rounds to get into the tournament, one of the richest on  the Australian circuit.  </P> <P> The players had difficulty reading the tricky greens because of the windy  conditions.  </P> <P> Australian Peter Fowler finished fourth at 284 after a final-round 74, while  Japan's Isao Aoki (75), American qualifier Jeff Maggert (73) and Australian  George Serhan (72) shared fifth at 285.  </P> <P> "The winds made it difficult for all of us and I found it almost impossible to  judge my putts," Aoki said.  </P> <P> Strange said a 10-foot par putt at the par-4 10th turned his game around after  the double bogey at nine.  </P> <P> "That made the difference," he said. "Golf is a mental game, and if Raymond had  got even with me there, no telling what he might have done."  </P> <P> Floyd trailed Strange by only one shot at the 10th, but dropped shots at the  16th and 17th before finishing with a birdie to take second place.  </P> <P> Strange described his performance over the final nine holes as a "game of  patience."  </P> <P> "The course was difficult," he said. "The greens got hard overnight but didn't  play any faster, and some of the pin placings were tricky.  </P> <P> "Winning is always a pleasure, and it is particularly gratifying to beat a  top-class field like the one here. ... This is a nice start."  </P> <P> Only 4 of the 62 players bettered par Sunday -- and none was among the leaders.  </P> <P> Betsy King shot a 1-under-par 70 to win the inaugural $500,000 LPGA Jamaica  tournament by 6 strokes over Nancy Lopez at Sandy Bay, Jamaica.  </P> <P> King, who led the entire way in the first LPGA event of the year, finished with  an 11-under total of 202 for 54 holes. Lopez shot a final-round 69 and was  second at 208, followed by Lori Garbacz and Martha Nause, each at 210.  </P> <P> King, who shot an opening-round 64, began the day with a 7-shot lead over Lopez  and started the round with a birdie.  </P></p>

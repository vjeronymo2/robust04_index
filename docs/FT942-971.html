			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Management: The pen is mightier than the bonus Have you received a hand-written note of appreciation from your boss recently? I haven't; and I am prepared to bet neither have you. The question was put to several hundred managers at the Institute of Directors the other day by motivational guru Stuart Levine. It met a sea of blank faces. Most executives are too insecure themselves to offer genuine praise to others. Those who have been told to praise their underlings usually mutter a few clumsy words, or send an E-mail message. According to Levine, who runs the mighty self-improvement company Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates in the US, a note is better than the spoken or the electronic word. You can put it on your mantelpiece or show it to your family. I see his point. I can just imagine how nice it would be to receive such a letter, how hard it would make me work, and how fine it would look in my sitting room. Yet on closer inspection, these notes may not be such a good idea. Levine never leaves home without a stack of cards in his pocket ready to dash off one to anyone who does something right. I fear he may be in danger of devaluing his own currency: there is only room for so many sincere notes of appreciation on the mantelpiece. Moreover, herograms suffer from the same short-comings as other rewards. If you do not get one you may feel as though you've been punished, and if some people are being singled out for gold stars the others may feel mutinous. In any case praise is only glorious if the person it comes from is suitably senior and well respected. There are some people from whom a letter of congratulation might be more likely to find its way into the dustbin than on to the mantelpiece. Whatever the shortcomings of herograms, they are better - and a lot cheaper  -than letting money do all the talking. Nearly every company in the western world believes that money motivates people, despite a growing weight of evidence to the contrary. They feel that if only they can come up with the perfect performance-related pay scheme and share bonuses, they will have a tip-top management team, and a gung-ho workforce. But take that argument to its extreme, and you get the kind of sum that has just been awarded to Jim Fifield, Thorn EMI's music chief. His recently announced Pounds 13.5m package is made up of every kind of bonus, option, free share deal and all the other gimmicks so highly recommended by pay consultants. I wonder how many millions the company could have saved by simply writing to this man and telling him he was doing a great job. Which brings me to the perfect solution to the rail strike. The cost of settling it is about Pounds 3.4m a year (based on a 5.7 per cent rise for 4,600 signalmen now earning about Pounds 13,000). As neither Railtrack nor the government feel like paying that, Britain seems destined to more commuting nightmares. Unless, that is, another source can be found for the money. I would like to volunteer Fifield as the answer to a prayer. He could foot the whole bill, become a national hero, and still have Pounds 10m left over for himself. The Financial Times, like other go-ahead 1990s organisations, has introduced a suggestions box scheme to tap the latent creativity of its staff. Here is my idea for making the newspaper more profitable - ration it. Let it be known that newsagents can sell no more than one copy per buyer. The fact that nobody in their right mind would want more than one copy is beside the point: the scarcity is bound to cause a stampede. The idea is not as fanciful as it sounds: it is exactly what Louis Vuitton is doing with its handbags. Last week it casually let slip that demand for its products was so strong that customers were being restricted to one or at most two items each. I find it hard to imagine why anyone, even the most label-conscious Japanese tourist, would want to make multiple purchases of Pounds 400 handbags. However, if there really is a shortage, I can't understand why Louis Vuitton does not go for the classic free market solution and raise its prices. Almost as clever is Vauxhall's latest marketing wheeze. The car company is promising to hand over a cheque for Pounds 500 to every buyer of a new Vauxhall Cavalier. I consider myself financially literate, I know what a discounted cash flow is, and am not frightened of derivatives. But I am as silly about money as the next person: I would rather have a cheque for Pounds 500 having paid full price for the car, than pay Pounds 500 less in the first place. There must be another idea for the FT suggestions box. While other newspapers are dropping their prices, we should raise ours to Pounds 1, and offer readers 35p cash back with every purchase.</p>

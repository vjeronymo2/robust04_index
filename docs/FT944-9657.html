			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Nirex dump 'in earthquake zone' A proposed nuclear waste dump in Cumbria should be abandoned because it is in an earthquake zone, says Greenpeace, the environmental campaign group. It said the safety risk at the underground Nirex site at Sellafield was being ignored by the government and nuclear industry, which had chosen the site for political, not geological reasons. Nirex dismissed the claim as 'nonsense'. A decision on planning permission is at least four years away.</p>

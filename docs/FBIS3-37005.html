			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Report by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoi and others]    [Text] A spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Grigoriy  Karasin, said at Thursday's [10 February] briefing in Moscow  that the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, in his  capacity of chairman of the CIS Foreign Ministers Council, had  requested the UN Secretary-General to include in the agenda of  the 48th General Assembly session the issue of granting the CIS  the status of observer at the General Assembly.    According to Kozyrev, the status of observer at the General  Assembly would make it possible to strengthen interaction  between the CIS and the UN in real terms.    Karasin also said that UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali will be on a visit in Moscow between the 1st and  the 5th of April.    During his visit he will discuss the ways to strengthen  cooperation between Russia and the UN with a view to raising the  effectiveness of the UN, and building up its potential in  securing peace, stability and international cooperation, Karasin  said.    Sensations or "historic breakthroughs" can hardly be  expected  from the official visit to Russia to be paid by the British  Prime Minister, John Major, on February 14-16, Karasin said.    According to him, Moscow believes that the talks between  President Boris Yeltsin and John Major will consolidate Russian-  British partnership.    Britain is one of the Western powers particularly active and  consistent in their efforts to support economic reforms in  Russia, promote free-market relations and implement extensive  social programs in our country, Karasin noted.    Besides Moscow, the British prime minister will visit Nizhny  Novgorod, a major center of reviving Russian entrepreneurship,  he said.    Karasin also said that Russia's Foreign Ministry prepared  and  submitted to the State Duma a list of international treaties and  agreements to be ratified by Russia's Federal Assembly.    International agreements and treaties to be given top  priority in the process of ratification are singled out in the  105-point list. They include documents regulating Russia's  relations with such countries as Austria, Azerbaijan, Armenia,  Belarus, Germany, Greece, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Korea,  Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Slovakia, the USA,  Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Czechia, Estonia, and others. "Some of  the documents included in the list concern disarmament issues  (chemical arms, START-II), confidence-building measures (open  skies), and Russia's joining a number of international  conventions and protocols," Karasin said.    According to him, the Foreign Ministry has also submitted to  the State Duma its proposals on working out over 20 draft bills,  including those on international agreements, on diplomatic  service, on procedures connected with Russia's participation in  peacekeeping activity sponsored by the UN, the CSCE, and the  CIS, and others.</p>

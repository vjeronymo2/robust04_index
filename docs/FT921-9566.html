			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Wakeham lobbies for coal contracts MR John Wakeham, the energy secretary, has been lobbying regional electricity companies in an attempt to win contracts for British Coal and to achieve lower electricity prices before the election. His intervention appears to contradict earlier assurances that the government would play no role in negotiations between British Coal and the electricity companies. Senior executives of regional companies say Mr Wakeham asked them at a recent meeting to consider signing contracts to buy coal-fired electricity from National Power and PowerGen, the two generators. This would put pressure on the generators to agree a deal to buy coal from British Coal, paving the way for the privatisation of the company. Mr Wakeham also wanted the regional companies, which buy power from the generators and sell it to customers, to press the generators to seek low prices on their British Coal contracts. This would allow him to announce lower prices for electricity consumers before the election. 'Mr Wakeham's got it into his head he might just get a deal before the election,' the commercial director of one regional company said yesterday. 'I'm not surprised the government has got involved, but it puzzles me why they are in such a hurry,' the chairman of another company said. Mr Wakeham had told the companies that he wanted the privatisation of British Coal to succeed and to get a good deal for the customer and taxpayer. The Department of Energy said yesterday: 'Of course the secretary of state meets people from the industry from time to time. We are letting the companies get on with commercial negotiations.' The electricity industry is British Coal's main customer, and contracts between the two are vital if British Coal is to be successfully privatised. So far, talks between British Coal and its direct customers, National Power and PowerGen, have made little progress. This, some regional companies believe, is the reason Mr Wakeham has appealed to them. 'They have been very naive at times. At one point they asked why we didn't all band together and ask the generators to sell us coal at low prices. But we don't operate in an administered market any more,' the managing director of one regional company said. 'They are very worried that the bad PR of closing down British Coal pits can only be offset by the financial quid pro quo of lower electricity prices.' Another chairman stressed that even if National Power and PowerGen succeeded in buying British coal at the lower prices they want, they were under no obligation to pass on the benefits to consumers via the regional companies.</p>

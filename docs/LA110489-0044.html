			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'PROFESSOR'S' CHANNING DARINGLY COMIC ON KCET  </P> <P> Judge Reinhold is "The Sad Professor," the title character in the fourth  installment of this season's KCET comedy series "Trying Times" (Sunday at 8  p.m. and Tuesday at 10 p.m. on Channel 28).  </P> <P> This professor starts crying at unexpected moments. Although barely 30, he's  going through a premature mid-life crisis. He's tired of his perfectly  supportive wife (Linda Purl). Suddenly his salvation becomes clear in a dream  -- he casts his eye on an English department colleague, the slatternly Hilde  Bundt (Stockard Channing). Call him crazy, but he falls for her.  </P> <P> The half-hour, written by Richard Greenberg and directed by Christopher Guest,  is most notable for Channing's bitter, blowzy Hilda, a daringly comic  performance. Reinhold and Purl are fine, but the writing doesn't have the  resonance of the opening two episodes of this year's "Trying Times."  </P> <P> Still, it's an improvement over last week's episode, Albert Innaurato's "Death  and Taxes," a laborious fantasy about an orthopedic-shoe salesman (Peter  Scolari) who runs into trouble with the IRS.

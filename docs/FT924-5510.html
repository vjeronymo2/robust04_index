			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: North West Water ahead 5.7% to Pounds 130m COST CUTTING and price rises helped North West Water, the Warrington-based water and sewerage company, lift interim profits by 5.7 per cent. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 123.7m to Pounds 130.7m in the six months to September 30. Mr Bob Thian, chief executive, said full year growth would continue at a similar rate. 'This was a good, safe performance,' he said. Turnover increased 13.1 per cent to Pounds 421.7m helped by average price rises of 9.3 per cent in the company's 'core' regulated business and by acquisitions. Turnover from measured water usage, which covers businesses and new homes, also increased 13.1 per cent, suggesting the company continued to weather recession well. Operating costs were held back to a 10.7 per cent increase to Pounds 261.6m while restructuring costs were similar at Pounds 12m (Pounds 12.4m). The company's headcount has fallen by more than 700 people in the last year to just over 8,000, leading to a 10 per cent fall in labour costs. Interest costs increased sharply from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 18.6m as investment programmes and acquisitions pushed net borrowings up from Pounds 146m to Pounds 388m. Gearing rose from 17 per cent at the year end to 21.6 per cent and is expected to rise to about 25 per cent this year. Depreciation increased to Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 21.5m) and capital investment, which last year totalled Pounds 512m, is expected to be higher this time. The tax charge increased from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 9.6m. North West's tax bill was incurred on irrecoverable ACT and overseas tax. Among non-core businesses, the process engineering division increased turnover 40 per cent to Pounds 75.8m while operating profits were 64 per cent higher at Pounds 5.9m. Most of the increase was due to acquisitions made last year which inclu- ded Wallace &amp; Tiernan in the US. Mr Thian said the division faced recession in its markets but remained an important part of group strategy. North West is the only water and sewage company to have resisted calls from Ofwat, the water regulator, to limit price increases next year. The company complained it could not afford the price cuts because it has an extra Pounds 430m of spending, mainly to improve coastlines and the Mersey estuary, to carry out in the next two years. Ofwat is expected to rule on the matter in December. Mr Thian said relations between the company and the regulator remained good. Earnings increased 4.6 per cent to 34p and the interim dividend is raised 9 per cent to 7.13p. See Lex</p>

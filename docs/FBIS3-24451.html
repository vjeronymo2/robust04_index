Can This Commandment of the Beekeeper Become a Commandment for  the Tax Police?"]    [Text] The Russian tax police is now two years old.  Our interlocutor, Tax Police Lieutenant General Yuriy  Vasilyevich Chichelov, deputy director of the Department of the  Tax Police (DNP) of the Russian Federation, was among those who  initiated the creation of this new law enforcement  structure.    [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, what caused your service to be  created?    [Chichelov] To understand the situation, let us mentally go  back about two years and try to look at our reality through the  eyes of the main enforcer of the law in the area of  taxation--the tax inspector. These positions in state tax  inspectorates were mainly held by women.    What did it mean for the tax inspector to go and check out a  so-called "commercial" or private company? It was quite an  ordeal. Tax legislation was violated every step of the way, and  then not in trifling ways but to the tune of millions or even  billions concealed from taxation. Two ways for circumventing the  law became the most common. The first was to bribe the tax  inspector. The second was to intimidate the inspector. There  were a great many scenarios for carrying out either one.    It became obvious that the new system of taxation could not  function effectively in the absence of a compact, well-equipped  structure with the powers of a law enforcement organ that would  be capable of putting an end to the rampage of crime in the  sphere of tax legislation, offer protection to tax inspectors in  the line of official duty, and prevent corruption in the tax  organs. All of these tasks were entrusted to us. By now, we can  say with complete confidence that the creation of the tax police  was a farsighted and timely step.    [Sas] However, Yuriy Vasilyevich, the number of violations  of  law in the area of tax legislation is growing....    [Chichelov] Unfortunately, this trend is gaining strength,  which seriously concerns us.    Nonetheless, the current situation is fundamentally  different  from the one that existed two years ago. At that time we just  had to state the facts and throw up our hands. At present, both  the criminal business and just dishonest taxpayers are forced to  reckon with the fact of the existence of the tax police. It has  already made its presence known as a major force.    Look at the results of the operation of the federal organs  of  the tax police last year, for example. These organs,  independently or jointly with the State Tax Service, uncovered  and put an end to more than 32,000 violations of tax  legislation. More than 600 criminal cases were initiated in  conjunction with the concealment of income on both a large and  particularly large scale. More than 1,000 enterprises and  organizations were uncovered which were not even registered with  the tax inspectorates, to say nothing about the payment of  taxes. About 1 trillion rubles [R] was assessed for collection  by the state budget, with the foreign exchange equivalent  included, based on the results of independent audits and those  carried out jointly with the State Tax Service.    As of now, the tax police has 88 territorial organs of the  tax police with more than 11,000 employees; in keeping with a  decree of the government, this number will come to about 40,000  by the end of the year.    [Sas] Not a whole lot for a country like Russia. In some  Siberian rayon-seat town they will perhaps learn about the  existence of the tax police only from the newspapers. Meanwhile,  the situation needs to be controlled there, too.    [Chichelov] You are right in that we indeed will not have an  opportunity to establish our local organs in each rayon seat.  However, this is not at all to say that no attention will be  paid to the Russian backwaters.    Now that you have touched on Siberia, I will also explain  this by using an actual example. In Kemerovo Oblast there is the  city of Berezovskiy. The operation of the local tax inspectorate  there was actually paralyzed by October of last year by several  criminal groups that controlled local commercial structures. The  employees of the inspectorate were literally terrorized by  continual threats. Seeing that they were getting away with  everything, the criminals began to act on their threats. Setting  fire to the apartment of the chief of the Berezovskiy GNI [State  Tax Inspectorate] became the high point of the activity of the  local mafia clan.    For this reason, the DNP Directorate for Kemerovo Oblast,  jointly with the Directorate for Combating Organized Crime of  the Oblast Internal Affairs Administration, developed and  executed an operation to normalize the situation in Berezovskiy  with their own resources. The operations team also included the  best trained employees of the State Automotive Inspectorate and  GNI of the oblast. As a result, they succeeded in more than just  straightening out the situation in the city. The operation that  was carried out had a great preventive impact in other rayons of  the oblast.    I am driving at a simple truth: Crime should be combated by  skill rather than by numbers. We bet here on two things--the  supreme professionalism of our employees and the closest  possible cooperation with the State Tax Service and other law  enforcement organs.    [Sas] Where do you get such professionals, given that, to my  knowledge, nobody trains them in Russia to this day?    [Chichelov] Complaints have already been voiced in some  quarters about the department supposedly "luring away" the best  cadres from other ministries and departments. However, this is  not happening, and it never has. At the very beginning, small  quotas for specialists on temporary assignment from the  organizations of the former Ministry of Security and Ministry of  Internal Affairs totaling about 1,000 people were given to us on  instructions from the government. The Ministry of Defense  detached to us more than 3,000 people. We did not set any  conditions for anyone; we just took the people who were given to  us. Later, we professionally trained them ourselves. The  leadership of the department was the first to sit at the  training desk. Take a look--here is my certificate of graduation  from a special course of the Instruction and Information Center  of the State Tax Inspectorate of the city of Moscow.    [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, I see that you even had to take a  test in accounting....    [Chichelov] The complexity of it is in the fact that the  profession of tax policeman requires a combination of the most  varied skills. As a rule, he should know finance, the credit  system, and monetary circulation well in order to be head and  shoulders above any accountant, if you will. On the other hand,  he is a functionary of the law enforcement organs; he cannot do  without substantial legal training. There are virtually no such  ready-made professionals. This is why we have to train people.  Naturally, former employees of "coercive" departments come here.  We also hire experienced financiers and lawyers from among the  civilian population.    Of course, this is not to say that our doors are open to  all.  It is equally important for us that these are people with a high  safety margin as far as morality goes.    There have been new developments that are particularly  pleasant for us: Not long ago it was resolved to open the Tax  Police Institute using the facilities of the Finance Academy of  the Russian Federation Government; classes will begin as early  as this September.    We are also opening our own center for training and  retraining newly hired employees with a college education.    [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, the tax police needs incorruptible  people. However, at present the popular view is that there are  no such people, and the amount given is all that matters....    [Chichelov] Such cynicism is characteristic only of those  who  recognize no values other than money and wealth. Luckily people  are still around for whom the notions of duty, honor, and  conscience are not the least important ones. There is no dearth  of relevant examples.    Last year, only four criminal cases were instituted against  the employees of the tax police for having taken bribes.  Naturally, the continuation of service with us is out of the  question for these individuals.    [Sas] What is your assessment of the current tax  legislation?  What is necessary in order to change the situation?    [Chichelov] An entire set of measures of an economic, legal,  and organizational nature which would eliminate the very grounds  for tax crimes and violations of law is necessary.    The main trouble with tax legislation is that thus far it  does not give incentives to the manufacturers of merchandise and  services, and renders their efforts unprofitable. It is no  accident that this was noted in the message of the Russian  Federation president to the Federal Assembly. I recall a story  by Agranovskiy Senior in which an old beekeeper applied the  wisdom of beekeeping at the level of state policy. The first  commandment of the beekeeper and the architect of state alike  should be: Do not take too much away from the bee. Take as much  as will motivate the beehive to labor, and not the other way  around. At a difficult time, he should incur expenses himself  but should feed the bee family. If he gets greedy, he will be  left not only without honey but also without bees. The basket of  the beekeeper whose bees prosper is always full.</p>

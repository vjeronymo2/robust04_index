			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: TI offering 5p cash for each outstanding Usborne share TI, a private food and commodity company, yesterday offered 5p in cash for the shares it does not already own in Usborne, the grain trading and pig production concern. Shares in Usborne were suspended on April 18 at 19 1/2 p after the group had warned of substantial interim losses following pig production problems. The offer values Usborne at about Pounds 4.59m. Last week Usborne said that Mr David Frame, its chief executive, had agreed to sell a 36 per cent stake in the company for 5p a share to Mr David Thompson, a shareholder. As a result TI, owned by Mr Thompson and members of his immediate family, now has just under 36 per cent of the shares, while Mr Thompson has a further 14.09 per cent. If acceptance of the offer prejudices Usborne's listing, TI aims to place enough shares with third parties to retain the listing. Usborne has told TI that it will publish the results for the six months to end-December as soon as practicable. TI had net assets of Pounds 24.5m as at March 31 1993.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Brain surgery for Arafat THE chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Mr Yassir Arafat, underwent a 90-minute operation yesterday to remove a cerebral blood clot caused in the impact of an aircraft crash in April, Reuter reports from Amman. Major General Youssef Qussous, a director at Jordan's King Hussein Medical Centre, said the PLO leader's condition was good after the operation there. Mr Arafat, 62, was operated on after entering hospital complaining of severe headaches. He is expected to be released in three or four days. Gen Qussous, a senior cardiologist, said the blood clot was caused by the impact of the crash. The PLO leader's aircraft crash-landed deep in the Sahara desert during a sandstorm, killing three crew members. Mr Arafat was back at work six days after the crash.</p>

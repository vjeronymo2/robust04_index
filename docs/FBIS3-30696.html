He added that his offer stands but the talks will  start as scheduled on Feb. 4 regardless of the union's decision.    Speaking at a news conference in Warsaw, Baczkowski said  that  the trade unions were invited to take part in "major structural  negotiations on issues which are fundamental to the living  standards of the society and aimed at working out social  guarantees for the coming years." The deputy labour minister  said it is "sad and incomprehensible" that the talks will have  to be held without Solidarity.    Responding to one of the demands of Solidarity to start  enterprise pact-guaranteed negotiations between the government,  trade unions and employers, Baczkowski said that the talks could  begin only when the labour code has been amended as farmers'  trade unions and local governments are not named as partners in  the negotiations.    Member of the Presidium of the Solidarity National  Commission  Jerzy Ostrouch said that in the light of Baczkowski's  statements, the union's decision not to join the talks was right.    He claimed that "one has to do something with the budget  first" and then talk about social guarantees for future.</p>

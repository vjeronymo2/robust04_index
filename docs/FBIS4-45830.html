			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the  Shanghai ships' sewage treatment plant, financed largely by a  grant from a United Nations fund for global environmental  protection and loans from the World Bank, has just started.    Local officials said Friday [27 May] that the project will  cost 120 million yuan (about 13.79 million U.S. dollars), of  which 4.31 million U.S. dollars will be covered by donated money  from the U.N. fund and another 6.23 million U.S. dollars will be  covered by World Bank loans.    The plant will be built and managed by the Shanghai Maritime  Transport (Group) Co. The plant at Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, will  have a 300m waterfront, with a dock to handle ships with 35,000  dead weight tonnages. It will be equipped with modern greasy  dirt and sewage treatment facilities.    The whole project is expected to be finished in 1995. By  then, the plant will help treat 400,000 tons of greasy dirt and  sewage and 100,000 tons of water polluted by chemicals a year.    Construction of similar environmental protection projects  has  also started in five other port cities: Dalian, Tianjin,  Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou.    The building of the projects in these six ports will involve  use of a total of 30 million U.S. dollars of donated money from  the U.N. fund and 15 million U.S. dollars of loans from the  World Bank.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Money laundering in property feared Three-quarters of property professionals and their advisers have acted in deals which raised suspicions of money laundering, according to a survey for solicitors Herbert Smith. A third of those questioned said their clients included companies whose dealings were slightly doubtful. Most suspicious transactions involved buyers transferringfunds offshore. Buyers willing to pay over the market rate for a property or pay in cash were also seen as suspicious. The Criminal Justice Act 1993 and subsequent money laundering regulations make it a criminal offence to fail to report suspicions of laundering involving drug-trafficking or terrorist activity. Surveyors or estate agents could face up to five years in prison if they harbour suspicions about a transaction and do not report it to the authorities.</p>

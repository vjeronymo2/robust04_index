			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: BancOne posts loss on securities holdings BancOne, one of the biggest US banks, yesterday announced a one-off after-tax loss of Dollars 170m on its securities holdings, showing the damage done to some banks' earnings from the rise in US interest rates since February. The bank said the loss stemmed from the sale of Dollars 5.7bn of fixed income securities which have an average maturity of three years. The Columbus, Ohio-based bank had been one of the most aggressive in its use of fixed-rate instruments to lift earnings. BancOne had used bonds and interest rate swaps to increase its fixed-income earnings, while keeping a large portion of its liabilities tied to floating interest rates. The policy enabled it to report one of the best net interest margins of any US bank last year, but led to a contraction in earnings as rates moved against it. Shortly before US rates began to rise in February, BancOne estimated that a gradual 1 percentage point increase in short-term rates over the following 12 months would reduce its earnings by 3.3 per cent. In the event, rates have risen 2 1/2 percentage points since the first increase engineered by the Federal Reserve on February 4. Doubts about the wisdom of BancOne's interest rate policy have hung over its share price for more than a year. Yesterday, Mr John McCoy, chairman, said: 'We are determined to take the necessary steps in 1994 to put the issue of interest rate sensitivity behind us.' In addition, the bank said it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 65m to reflect restructuring costs. The bank indicated it expected to cut 4,300 jobs by the end of next year. Last week PNC, a regional bank based in Pittsburgh, said a faster-than-expected rise in interest rates would reduce its net interest income by about 7 per cent in the final three months of this year, and 15 per cent next year.</p>

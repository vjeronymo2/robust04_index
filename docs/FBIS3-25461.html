But as a large party, no one can  prevent us from analyzing the present situation and preparing  for the future. If the prime minister's position nevertheless  becomes vacant, we will put forward our own candidate in  consultation with our partners in the opposition," Albert  M'Peti, the PDSC [Democratic and Social Christian Party]  representative in Belgium, said in an interview with DE  STANDAARD.    For some time, things have not been going well between the  two main partners in the Zairian opposition, the UDPS [Union for  Democracy and Social Progress] of Prime Minister Tshisekedi and  Joseph Ileo's PDSC. In the local press and at meetings of party  activists, the Christian Democrats are being blamed for dropping  Tshisekedi and even looking to lead the government themselves.  They would prefer to put forward their deputy chairman Gustave  Malumba Mbangula.    The UDPS leader made it clear again yesterday that he is not  planning to step down. He called the politicians who claim the  prime ministership "an insult to the intelligence of the Zairian  people" and emphasized expressly that "the prime minister's  position is not empty."    "We also think that," M'Peti replied. "We continue to  support Tshisekedi. But should things have another outcome,  then we will put forward our own candidate, fully in accordance  with the wishes and decisions of the CNS [Sovereign National  Conference] and the HCR/PT [High Council of the  Republic/Transitional Parliament].    This stipulates that the prime minister of the new  transitional government must come from the opposition and that  he will be free to form his own government. In important  portfolios like home and foreign affairs, defense and energy,  each opposition minister will be given a deputy minister from  presidential circles and vice versa.    This week a full meeting of the HCR/PT is to assess the  results of various committees. As soon as the new transitional  constitution is approved, the high meeting must appoint a new  prime minister. The government program remains that which was  drawn up by the CNS in the past. It first provides for a  referendum on the new constitution and free parliamentary and  presidential elections within 15 months.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [ADS report: "Foreign Trade Decreased by 5.9 Percent in the </F> First Quarter"]    [Text] Russia's foreign trade in the first quarter of 1994  declined 5.9 percent in comparison with January-March last year,  to 13 billion dollars, according to the current data of the  State Committee for Statistics. The decline in January-February  in comparison with the same period last year was 8.8 percent.  The improvement of the quarterly indicator, according to Deputy  Chief Vladimir Kiselev of the Main Economic Administration of  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, was due to the  continued growth of exports and the slight deceleration of the  decline of imports. The positive balance for the quarter was 5.2  billion dollars (2.2 billion in January-February).

Exports in March increased  to 3.5 billion dollars, as compared to 3 billion in February and  2.5 billion in January. Shipments to industrially developed  countries in comparison with the first quarter of 1993 displayed  an increase of 8.4 percent and reached 5.5 billion dollars (2.2  billion in March), and exports to developing countries increased  by 5.6 percent to 1.2 billion dollars. Exports to all other  countries decreased by 2.3 percent, declining to 2.4 billion  dollars.

In terms  of cost, however, exports of crude oil and petroleum products  decreased by 17 percent and 20 percent respectively--because of  the drop in world prices in 1993. Exports of nickel and aluminum  more than doubled. As Mr. Kiselev pointed out, the increase in  exports of primary aluminum was accompanied by an even larger  increase (2.7-fold) in imports of aluminum ores and  concentrates, much of which come here as part of "tolling"  operations (ore imports paid for with finished metal products).

Imports of machines, equipment, and vehicles  decreased by 10 percent to 1.31 billion dollars (33 percent of  all Russian imports from distant foreign countries).    Imports of the main foodstuffs continued to decrease.  Imports  of grain were 87.6 percent below the figure for January-March  1993, declining to 372,000 tonnes. Furthermore, as Mr. Kiselev  reported, there were virtually no shipments of grain in March,  and all incoming shipments in January-February were made in line  with 1993 contracts. No contracts with the main foreign  suppliers of grain were signed in the first quarter. There were  decreases of 54 percent in imports of meat, 83 percent in sugar  imports (including 95 percent for raw sugar), 30 percent in  imports of vegetable oil, and 91 percent in imports of noodles  in comparison with January-March 1993.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHINING DODGERS NOT WINNING OVER FANS  </P> <P> I found your article, "Dodgers Sprung in Spring" (June 26), absolutely  nauseating.  </P> <P> It's sickening to listen to grown men playing baseball whine about the  shortened spring training causing their injuries. What, they don't have enough  time during the off-season to get/stay in shape? I suppose when you make only a  half a million or so dollars during baseball season, you have to spend your  off-season pumping gas to make ends meet.  </P> <P> Considering the amount of money you make, if you are not in top condition by  the time spring training rolls around, it's nobody's fault but your own. So  stop sniveling or get a job.  </P> <P> DONALD BRUNSON  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SNYDER: LIVING -- AND DYING -- FOR THE CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS  </P> <P> Several years ago, I decided I could no longer report on Mitch Snyder's  activities. Life is too short and compromising to spend much energy trying to  be skeptical about someone risking his death and devoting his life to people  living in the street. Snyder liked to point out that, in his previous careers  as a car thief, hot-check artist and Manhattan business consultant, he had been  called corrupt, consumed and greedy -- but never crazy. That, he insisted, only  began when he turned his life over to what has become known as the cause of the  homeless. A cause he lived for until his death on Thursday.  </P> <P> A day before the 1984 elections, he ended a 51-day fast when the Reagan  Administration agreed to donate an old federal building for a shelter -- the  same shelter he hanged himself in. He told reporters after that fast, as he was  being wheeled into a hospital emergency room, "What can I say? You all look  like hamburgers to me." One could not doubt it.  </P> <P> To official Washington, that part of the city that seems to live by the corner  office, the power tie and the official car, Snyder presented himself with  irritating calculation as a man who dressed in donated army-surplus clothes and  spent nights sleeping on steam grates. He urged reporters to spend a night  beside him on the street -- "Don't write about it, just do it," he urged us,  "understand it."  </P> <P> He would point out, like a man showing features of his hometown that only he  knew to strangers, how a whole other city stirred into being during the small  hours after midnight: Men and women slumbering in shrouds of cloth scraps on  the staircase of the Lincoln Memorial; children being soothed to sleep by their  mothers inside of cardboard cartons, set up like subdivisions near the State  Department.  </P> <P> Snyder's most unsettling tactic was to go without food, in a city where catered  shrimp on the buffet table is part of the corporate diet. Years ago, we had a  dull argument when I asked if his fasts weren't imitative and coercive.  </P> <P> "Look," he said, "if I ran into a house on fire to rescue someone who was  trapped, would you call that coercive? A fast is a way of trying to rescue  someone who could die if no one cares enough to risk his life."  </P> <P> In recent years, when I would spend a few hours trying to help cook and serve  holiday dinners in the downtown shelter, you practically had to make a  reservation to scrub a pan. Tourists, concerned suburbanites, students and  confirmed volunteers would crowd the kitchen, desperate to cut carrots. Rather  like a Hollywood restaurant, servers would rush back through swinging doors,  saying, "Cher! I saw her! And Martin Sheen, too!"  </P> <P> "Sorry I didn't call ahead," I told him this past Christmas. He said, only half  joking, "Don't worry. You're always welcome."  </P> <P> The shelter he helped create downtown is often overcrowded in the winter,  sweltering and perilous in the summer and a dangerous place to sleep in any  season. People often curl the two or three things they care most in the world  about under their arms at night -- a radio, some shoes, a picture -- and try to  fall asleep while clenched like a fist. People wheeze with the sickness they  have picked up from the streets. Drugs and drunkenness have been more difficult  to keep out than the cold. Snyder had been increasingly worried about that,  wondering if his shelter was only helping the city to slide homeless people  onto a separate shelf.  </P> <P> This spring, he refused to admit census takers into the shelter. His opposition  to what seemed a decently intentioned step to understand the depth of  homelessness surprised some of his supporters, but he told them the shelter was  a home. People living in Potomac River suburbs wouldn't look up from their beds  at night to see census takers counting the number of noses between their  sheets. People living at the shelter deserved the same dignity.  </P> <P> Snyder's sometimes aggravating activism brought homelessness into focus for  millions of Americans. But during the past 10 years, it seems to have passed  from being a moral scandal into a feature of American life. Last Christmas, he  was enthusiastic that the prospects for peace in the world would make greater  devotion to homeless people here possible. But by this spring, he had seen the  promise swallowed by the threat of the federal deficit, by the political appeal  of aid to Eastern Europe and by malingering indifference. Last month the  Washington City Council voted to reduce the city's obligation to provide  shelter for every citizen. Snyder seemed to read it as a sign that a decade of  the most dramatic stunts and risks to make us care about those who lived in our  streets had still failed to create a constituency for the homeless.  </P> <P> In a time when much in our politics and culture was urging Americans to be rid  of guilt, Mitch Snyder was asking us to listen to voices that made us twitch  with discomfort for being fortunate. "Thanks for coming," he would often say  when you left the shelter. "You can go home and take a hot shower. The people  still outside can't." He was a hard friend that way, annoying and boorish and,  damn him, bless him, always much too right.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLSTATE'S DROPPING OF SMALL GROUP HEALTH COVERAGE STINGS MANY  </P> <P> Facing a liver transplant operation that will cost at least $140,000 and  possibly much more, Grayce Aul, a Canoga Park housewife, has lost her regular  health insurance policy, one that would have given her nearly full coverage.  </P> <P> All she has been able to obtain in replacement is a conversion policy that  provides bare-bones coverage, including a basic $100-a-day hospital benefit and  a maximum surgical benefit of a little more than $1,000.  </P> <P> It was not her illness that led to Aul losing her regular policy. The loss was  due to a decision by Allstate Life Insurance Co. to stop selling health  insurance to 14,000 small groups, averaging just three people each, including  the one to which Aul belonged. The consequences of that decision were that Aul,  along with others in these groups who were very ill with continuing diseases,  could not obtain any other adequate insurance.  </P> <P> The case illustrates the plight that critically ill people can fall into  through no doing of their own, and of one of the many gaps that exist in  American health insurance.  </P> <P> The facts of the Aul case were confirmed by Aul herself, her physician, Stephen  A. Borowsky of Northridge, and by executives of Allstate Life who were  interviewed at company headquarters in Northbrook, Ill. They add up to what may  be a choice between an early death or poverty for a woman and her husband who,  in their 50s, are financially well off now.  </P> <P> Aul and Dr. Borowsky are both active in the United Liver Assn., a Southern  California support group for victims of liver disease. Its officers report that  insurance problems plague many of those facing high expenses as a result of  required operations and recuperative drugs and procedures.  </P> <P> "They're facing the fact they have an incurable illness, their ways of living  have changed, and they have all these physical and psychological stresses, and  added to them are the insurance problems," said Kathleen Memel, a Beverly Hills  psychotherapist who moderates support groups for the association and is a  member of its board. "We hear about them constantly."  </P> <P> Aul agreed to have her name used and her situation checked with her doctor and  her insurer.  </P> <P> "I just don't think it's fair to pull the rug from under me," she explained.  "We paid high premiums for years before this happened and so have thousands of  others. I'm not alone. There must  </P> <P> be many others wondering just as I am today what's going to happen to them."  </P> <P> Aul had been insured since 1981 under a small group policy carried through her  husband's business, Aul Pipe &amp; Tubing Inc. of Vernon. The policy benefits  were generous, the coverage comprehensive and there was originally no limit on  the amount the insurer would pay during the policyholder's lifetime. Nine  people were covered under Aul Pipe &amp; Tubing's group plan, and premiums last  year ran a total $5,345 a month.  </P> <P> But on Feb. 17, the Aul firm received a 90-day notice of termination from  Allstate.  </P> <P> "The group insurance industry has experienced rapid changes over the last few  years, principal among those changes being the development of managed health  care programs," said Allstate's letter. "We do not currently have a managed  care program to offer to our group insurance customers, nor does our volume of  business warrant the extensive investment that would be required in order for  us to develop an effective program. We have, therefore, regretfully decided to  withdraw from the group insurance market. In order to effect this withdrawal,  we are terminating existing policies."  </P> <P> One of those covered under the Aul firm's policy died of cancer before the  policy's cancellation date, and another person covered has diabetes. Six others  covered were generally healthy and were quickly able to obtain another  comprehensive health insurance policy. Mrs. Aul represents the ninth person who  was covered under the plan.  </P> <P> But Aul -- who has been ill with primary biliary cirrhosis for seven years and,  according to her doctor, would have about five years life expectancy without an  eventual transplant -- said she and the other women with pre-existing disease  could find no company willing to sell them comprehensive coverage. They had to  settle for the conversion policy Allstate was required to offer by law.  </P> <P> On May 8, Aul received another letter from Allstate. "Congratulations!" it  began. "Your request for conversion of your Group Health Insurance has been  approved with an effective date of May 1, 1989." Her premium was $1,520 a year.  </P> <P> Aul purchased the coverage.  </P> <P> "But this policy was almost nothing," she told The Times. "Its hospital benefit  of $100 a day (for a maximum 70 days) is only a tiny fraction of what a daily  hospital stay costs. And it leaves almost all the cost of a transplant to me."  </P> <P> "The actual average of a single transplant is about $140,000 or $150,000," said  Dr. Borowsky. "Sometimes it doesn't take, and the patient needs to go for  another one. And then there may be complications. I've heard of a total price  of $380,000. And then there is post-care for 10 or 15 years."  </P> <P> Post-operative medication alone would cost Aul at least $1,000 a month.  </P> <P> Under these circumstances, Borowsky said, "I don't think anyone will sell her a  (comprehensive) policy."  </P> <P> Allstate officials wouldn't, as they made clear in comments that were  considerably more pointed than the language of the Feb. 17 termination letter.  </P> <P> "People who are insurable will not take conversion policies," said David  McPherson, executive vice president for administration at Allstate Life. "Only  the uninsurable will, and the cost of insuring them is enormous. To keep the  price down, the states have decided the minimum package is all that is  required. The policy we offered Mrs. Aul complied with state law.  </P> <P> "We recognize that people like Mrs. Aul have a problem, but we can't offer her  more than other people in her class."  </P> <P> McPherson and Robert Seiler, senior vice president and general counsel of  Allstate Life, said that Allstate decided to drop its small group policies as  part of a general move out of the health insurance business.  </P> <P> Rapidly escalating medical costs, and a continuing inability to control them,  as well as a general assessment that the federal government is apt to create a  national health insurance system sooner or later, helped convince the company  to sell all its group policies, they said.  </P> <P> They did not say that Allstate had been losing money on the policies, but they  said future trends were not promising.  </P> <P> "We realistically don't know if there's any way you can control costs short of  national health insurance," Seiler said. He said it would have cost anywhere  from $100 million to $300 million for Allstate to have established a HMO, a  managed care program, and even that might not have worked to successfully  control costs.  </P> <P> So, the executives explained, Allstate sold all its large group policies to  Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. But, they said, Metropolitan was not interested  in buying the 14,000 separate small group policies. Allstate was left with  those.  </P> <P> "We decided to exit, terminate our (small group) contracts," McPherson said.  "And the law requires that you treat everybody the same."  </P> <P> Sensitive, however, to the plight of Aul and other uninsurables, the Allstate  officials said, they and other insurers have been supporting creation of an  "uninsurables pool" under which a state or federal mechanism would spread the  risk of insuring such people to the insurance industry as a whole.  </P> <P> "Sixteen states have authorized such pools," McPherson said. "In California,  the enabling legislation was introduced but not approved."  </P> <P> In Sacramento, legislative consultants said that in 1986 and 1988 bills were  actually passed that would have established such a pool, but that in both  instances they were vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian on grounds that the  benefits were too extensive and could be a drain on state tax funds.  </P> <P> New legislation is pending this year and, this time, the consultants said,  Deukmejian aides have suggested certain cost safeguards that, if adopted, would  result in Deukmejian signing a bill creating such a pool.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F> unidentified correspondent on 19 January; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] There were reports in the media  about your address at the conference of CIS and Baltic  ambassadors, in which you said that the threat to Russia comes  from the former Soviet republics. Is that true?    [Kozyrev] What I said was that we face dangers from the  former USSR territories, which is demonstrated by the bloody  conflicts regrettably developing in some of these republics,  where we are forced to act as intermediaries and peacekeepers.  However, prospects are probably even better for solving many  issues, including those connected with protection of the Russian  and the Russian-speaking population as well as the development  of economic, historic, cultural, and other ties.    [Correspondent] In other words, the media has dramatized the  danger?    [Kozyrev] Well, this is shifting the emphasis somewhat, but  I repeat that, indeed, not only the danger but also enormous  opportunities come from those territories. This is the  objective reality because we do have millions of refugees from  the conflict zones, and we see these conflicts on TV every day.  These conflicts destabilize the situation close to the Russian  borders, and it would be strange if we did not notice it and did  not talk about this danger.    Another issue is that a completely artificial campaign has  been launched in Latvia -- and in Latvia it is on the official  level -- and in some of the media in other Baltic countries,  where they deliberately distort what I say, apparently so that  they can have the opportunity to make yet another appeal for  help and again invite sympathy from their Western partners.    In this respect the statement of the Latvian officials that  they are to make an immediate appeal to Washington is very  symptomatic. The hasty, inappropriate, and unbalanced reaction  of the U.S. State Department representative which was not based  on real facts -- and which I had an opportunity to point out to  the American ambassador today -- is, of course, no less  surprising. I do think that our partnership merits having the  State Department spokesman get it right before criticizing  Russia's foreign minister.    As for the Baltic situation, the core of the matter there is  this: If the Baltic states want to be civilized states, perhaps  Latvia, rather than raise this artificial and absolutely  unfounded screaming, should concentrate on drawing up agreements  on the conditions for withdrawal...[pauses] To have it on the  basis of an agreement, because an agreement basis means an equal  basis, you will not join a treaty that violates your prestige,  sovereignty, or interests...[pauses] to build good-neighborly  relations and to guarantee geopolitical interests.    Russia's special interests, Russia's special role lie in the  fact that we are forced to bear a special, perhaps a larger,  burden compared with our partners in the Commonwealth, in  peace-making operations. It is Russian troops who are defending  the common border at present. This is reflected in CIS  documents. This is not our interpretation. This is a common  interpretation.    We cannot leave Tajikistan to fate. It is impossible for us  not to participate in the mediation efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh,  for example. It is impossible for us not to participate in the  mediation efforts in Georgia, for example, if we are asked to.    At the same time, we are not sending tanks to suppress these  republics. That is, our special role means exactly that we are  against extremes: either complete indifference and withdrawal,  or just the opposite, an imperial dictate. It is a role that  must be performed day by day, fulfilling one's responsibilities  and respecting one's neighbors and their sovereignty, and  strengthening the CIS.    This fully applies to the Baltic states. As soon as  Lithuania demonstrated its readiness to sign a package of  agreements with us, the relations immediately improved. The  troops have been withdrawn, and prospects for the future are  excellent.    The same applies to Latvia. As soon as an approach toward  signing agreements prevails there, inter alia on withdrawal of  troops and other matters, instead of these propaganda campaigns  or recent provocative actions, Russia will be ready -- we are  ready -- to continue, in spite of all these campaigns.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Telecom liberalisation debate reopens in EC: Brussels proposals, along with German privatisation talks, bring competition issue to the fore DEBATES taking place over the future of telecommunications monopolies in a number of European Community countries are likely to be heightened by a plan under consideration at the EC Commission which would liberalise the market for all domestic and international telephone calls. Talks on the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the German state telephone monopoly, reopen today between Germany's coalition government and the opposition. Deutsche Telekom yesterday welcomed 'the competition promoted by the European Community as long as all companies in the sector face equal and fair conditions for competition'. The company has argued that privatisation is the only way to ensure it can compete globally and has urged the Bonn government to push it through as rapidly as possible. The government will today present an eight point document which plans to turn Deutsche Telekom into a shareholder company and sell part of its equity. The document also foresees that a monopoly will be maintained for the next five years and possibly an additional three years. But a fierce discussion is expected between the government and the opposition Social Democrats who oppose outright privatisation. The agreement of the opposition is needed in order to change the constitution and allow privatisation to go ahead. The European Commission will meanwhile finish nearly six months of consultations with the industry, consumers, regulators and member states at the end of this month. According to senior Brussels telecoms officials, the mood of the industry is gradually changing towards opening all domestic and international telephone calls to competition, albeit in a number of phases introduced over a period as long as 10 years. The highly sensitive decision on whether to press for full liberalisation and harmonisation of 'voice telephony' in the EC will be up to the 17 commissioners, prompted by Mr Martin Bangemann, EC commissioner for industry and telecommunications, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition. A report approved by the Commission in October laid out four options for the next wave of legislation, ranging from doing nothing to full liberalisation. At that stage, commissioners favoured a cautious approach, opening cross-border calls within the EC to competition as a first step. If the Commission chooses a more ambitious programme, culminating in open competition across the whole European network, it will set the scene for a fierce political debate between member states on the pace and extent of liberalisation. The German negotiations broke down last December with the opposition flatly rejecting the government plan. But both sides today, led by Mr Wolfgang Botsch, posts and telecommunications minister since January, and by a new negotiating team for the Social Democrats, say they are willing to find a compromise. The Social Democrats claim a private telecoms monopoly could renege on the current obligation to service all parts of the country. They have also been representing the powerful post and telecoms trade union which fears for the special privileges of its members, who have the job security and pension rights of civil servants, if privatisation goes through. They are instead proposing that Deutsche Telekom becomes an Anstalt des offentlichen Rechts, or public law corporation, a special legal status enjoyed only by some regional banks and television channels in Germany. Such a corporation would initially offer non-tradable certificates to private buyers. Deutsche Telekom says it urgently needs to expand its capital base through outright privatisation in order to help finance a DM60bn investment programme in east Germany. Whenever the Commission has rolled out new proposals for telecommunications deregulation in recent years one of the loudest voices of dissent has been France Telecom, the giant telecommunications group which is arguably the flagship of France's public sector. On opening up the market for domestic and international telephone calls, France Telecom said yesterday that it would wait until it received a clear indication of the EC's proposals before assessing its own position. However, it stressed that it considered the question of deregulating the voice telephony market - which still represents around 80 per cent of the turnover of most European telecommunications companies - as one of 'great sensitivity' with 'economic and social implications for the whole industry'. One of France Telecom's chief concerns is the need to ensure that the standard of telecommunications networks is sufficiently high across the Community. A traditional objection to complete deregulation has been the poor state of the networks in southern Europe. In Spain, the chief obstacle to rapid liberalisation of telecommunications, especially voice traffic, is government reluctance to allow domestic call charges to rise rapidly. Domestic telephone charges are low and are subsidised by expensive trunk charges and other service tariffs. The government is allowing the operating monopoly, Telefonica, slowly to correct its tariff imbalances but insists that the increase must remain just below inflation. Telefonica has, at least in theory, reconciled itself to a totally liberalised market. A company official says: 'There is no point opposing liberalisation. It is just a question of time until the Bundespost starts offering services to big German companies in Spain.' The Spanish company is already starting to explore opportunities in Portugal and the UK. Italy's position is coloured by the need to restructure the telecoms sector. Currently spread among a number of companies and state agencies, telecommunications come under the umbrella of Stet, itself controlled by the IRI state holding group. Stet would have no objection to full competition, subject to the proviso that all the major European utilities first agree on co-ordinating their tariffs. Subsequently, charges could diverge, based on competitiveness and efficiency.</p>

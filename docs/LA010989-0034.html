			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union will upgrade the status of the Israeli consular mission in  Moscow and view it as an "address for political activities," Israeli Foreign  Minister Moshe Arens said. He added in an interview with Israel Radio that he  was informed of the decision by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze  during a meeting in Paris, where both are attending a conference on chemical  weapons. He said the Israeli consular mission will be allowed to move from the  Dutch Embassy in Moscow to the Israeli Embassy, which has been unused since the  Kremlin broke diplomatic relations in 1967.  </P></p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / US electronics pioneer dies Avery Fisher, the electronics industry pioneer and philanthropist, died on Saturday at the age of 87, writes AP from New York. Fisher's love of music prompted him to build his own radios and phonographs to improve sound quality, but by 1937 he had become so adept that he founded Philharmonic Radio. He sold the company in 1945 and formed Fisher Radio, hiring audio technicians away from Europe.</p>

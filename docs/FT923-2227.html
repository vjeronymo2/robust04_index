			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Swiss safe haven draws another issue THE safe haven attraction of the Swiss currency during the current turbulence in the European Monetary System prompted another borrower to tap the Euro-Swiss franc bond market yesterday. Bankers said the Electricite de France SFr100m offering was aggressively priced for an issue with a 6 5/8 per cent coupon at 102, to yield 6.413 per cent, but that this was not surprising since the French utility is a top-quality borrower. What was more unusual was the 15-year duration of the bond. The issue was being quoted at about 2 1/2 points below its issue price, yielding 6.65 per cent in late afternoon trading, just inside the lead manager's fees. Some bankers also thought that the coupon was very low at 6 5/8 per cent, even though coupons have fallen from the 7 1/4 per cent on Swiss Franc bond issues earlier in the week. Lead managers UBS said switching by investors from the short end to the long end of the Euro-Swiss franc bond market made this the ideal time to launch a bond with a long maturity. The bank added that it was having no problems in placing the bond. Elsewhere, joint lead manager JP Morgan Securities announced that the pricing of Kingdom of Spain's Dollars 1.5bn seven-year Eurobond, launched on Wednesday, had been deferred until next Tuesday. The market was not unduly surprised by the decision, following the failure to attract investor interest in the light of upheaval in European financial markets. The credit rating of Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK group, was cut by two notches by Moody's Investor Service yesterday in reaction to its planned demerger. ICI's rating tumbled from Aa3 to A2, affecting around Dollars 3bn of debt outstanding. The decision reflected Moody's belief that the planned demerger of the group's biosciences business would proceed, leading to a significant shift in the group's risk profile at a difficult time for the basic chemical industry.</p>

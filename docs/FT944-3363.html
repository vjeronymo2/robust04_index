			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Foreign aid in US under attack Leaders of the new Republican majority in Congress are lining up to slash many foreign aid programmes, long a favourite target for US budget cutters. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will head the Senate subcommittee that governs foreign aid spending, this week proposed a bill which would radically overhaul the US's aid apparatus and concentrate money on strategic priorities in the Middle East, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, at the expense of Africa and elsewhere. Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the extreme right-winger who will chair the Senate foreign relations committee, has separately proposed eliminating all funding for the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The two proposals are likely to be the opening shots in a battle over US foreign aid, already by far the lowest of any major industrialised country as a proportion of gross domestic product. Under Mr McConnell's plan, which would slightly increase aid to the Middle East and cut funds to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by 9 per cent but slash most other programmes by 20 per cent, the total US aid budget would drop from Dollars 13.7bn in the current fiscal year to around Dollars 12.5bn. Others expect Mr McConnell's proposal will represent something of a ceiling for next year's foreign aid bill. The Kentucky senator is more willing than many of his Republican colleagues to consider foreign aid a useful foreign policy tool, but says it is unrealistic to expect aid will be spared when domestic spending is being cut. One area left blank in Mr McConnell's bill is funding for US contributions to the multilateral development banks, which Mr Helms would eliminate or slash. The Treasury has already started a campaign to argue that money invested in these banks is a cost-effective way of multiplying the US's aid money, and administration officials say their credibility in pressing for institutional reforms has been greatly enhanced by last year's aid bill, which provided some money to reduce US arrears to banks such as the Asian Development Bank.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Better tidings from Main St than Wall St - JP Morgan/US banks Predicting the quarterly profits of banks which trade heavily in the financial markets has become a hazardous business. After the upheaval in bond and stock markets - and a profits warning from Salomon last week - JP Morgan's third-quarter figures will be approached with caution on Thursday. During the record 1993, Morgan's income from trading averaged Dollars 514m a quarter. In the first six months of this year, that average fell to Dollars 292m - roughly the level most analysts expect for the latest period. Largely as a result, earnings per share at the New York-based bank are generally expected to fall from Dollars 2.29 a year ago to the Dollars 1.50-Dollars 1.60 range. For most other big US commercial banks, whose results come in the following days, the news from the third quarter is likely to be far more predictable: continuing declines in bad debt provisions, a slight depression in lending margins as interest rates rise, and accelerating loan growth in some areas should underpin solid (if unspectacular) earnings gains. Average earnings per share growth is put at about 10-12 per cent. Solid earnings per share improvements are expected from BankAmerica (up to Dollars 1.37 from Dollars 1.18 a year before,) Citicorp (Dollars 1.30, compared with 97 cents) and NationsBank (up to Dollars 1.55 from Dollars 1.32), among others.</p>

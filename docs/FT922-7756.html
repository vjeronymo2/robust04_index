			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 4 per cent on O &amp; Y news THE Nikkei average plunged 4 per cent yesterday as news that Olympia and York Developments, the Canadian property developer, had filed for protection under the insolvency laws prompted investors to take their profits, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 730.33 to 18,074.27, down 1.6 per cent on the week. Arbitrage-related selling and position-squaring ahead of the weekend also depressed the index. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 18,762.75 and fell to the day's low of 18,034.02 just before the close. Volume fell to 350m shares from 438m. Losers overwhelmed gainers by 1,003 to 75, with 72 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 47.91 to 1,348.82 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.23 to 1,073.47. Equities were weak during the morning session, moving in a tight range on light profit-taking and buying by foreigners. However, afternoon reports of O &amp; Y's move sparked heavy selling. The Nikkei futures index closed down by its daily limit of 610 points to 18,360, prompting arbitrage-unwinding and index-linked selling. Traders said that while there was no panic, investors had become cautious in view of the Nikkei's rapid rise over the past week. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that while Japanese investors tended to over-react to overseas news, they were worried about the effect of the news on financial markets in London and New York. Investors sold banks and real estate issues on concerns about bad loans. The outstanding balance of 14 Japanese banks' lending to O &amp; Y is estimated at Y2bn. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which is believed to have the largest direct exposure to O &amp; Y, fell Y170 to Y1,250, while Sumitomo Bank lost Y120 to Y1,400. Mitsui Fudosan fell Y70 to Y1,060 and Mitsubishi Estate lost Y71 to Y920. Speculative issues, which had been pushed up by dealers earlier in the week, lost ground as positions were closed ahead of the weekend. Japan Metals &amp; Chemicals fell Y24 to Y725 and Okamoto Industries lost Y60 to Y1,440. High-technology blue chips were also fell on profit-taking, with Hitachi down Y26 to Y805 and Sony losing Y80 to Y4,290. In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 633.32 to 20,795.31 in volume of 18.6m shares. Profit-taking depressed share prices across the board. Nintendo, the video game maker, however, rose Y100 to Y10,600 on good results. Roundup AUSTRALIA apart, markets in the region were not inclined to match, or even approach the overnight declines seen in the US and Japan. Bombay was closed after police froze the bank accounts and shareholdings of Mr Harshad Mehta. AUSTRALIA, like Japan, blamed a 1.1 per cent fall on the day on the Olympia &amp; York news from Canada. The All Ordinaries index fell 19.0 to 1,660.7, fractionally down on the week. Foster's Brewing ended 7 cents higher at ADollars 1.90 after ADollars 1.93, and SA Brewing 12 cents lower at ADollars 3.07 on reports of a merger which was made official after the close. BANGKOK's SET index ended 4.93 higher at 732.89, unchanged on the week, in low turnover of Bt2.44bn. Selling slowed, while some investors entered the market to buy in the belief that this weekend's anti-government rallies would be free of violence. MANILA was flat on the day, the composite index adding just 1.02 at 1,338.37, but 8.4 per cent up on a week encouraged by the relatively quiet conclusion to the presidential elections. NEW ZEALAND, similarly, saw the NZSE-40 index up 0.70 on the day but 4.1 per cent better on the week, the latter on falling domestic interest rates and optimism about a batch of company profit reports due over the next few weeks.</p>

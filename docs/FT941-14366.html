			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tremors in gas sector The oil and gas areas lagged behind the rest of the market and also provided one of the market's most heavily traded stocks in British Gas, which recovered only partially from heavy selling pressure early in the session. The early selling was triggered by bearish stories said to have emanated from a lunch on Tuesday at Smith New Court, the securities house, which hosted Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the new director general of Ofgas, the gas industry watchdog, and a number of investment institutions. Smith declined to comment but sector specialists said the institutions appeared notably more cautious towards British Gas following the lunch. 'There are perceptions that the new regulatory regime could well prove tougher than expected,' said one analyst, who pointed out that Gas shares are approaching a three-year relative low. British Gas shares underperformed the wider market all day but managed to edge ahead to finish a net 4 1/2 higher at 342p. Turnover reached a heavy 13m shares.</p>

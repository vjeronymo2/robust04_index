			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Observer: Betting bachelors A veritable connoisseur of pocket-burning days at the races, Observer could tell the University of Salford a thing or two about the economics of gambling. But the dons, whose colleagues in the English faculty recently added Jackie Collins to the syllabus, seem to want input of a rather more sophisticated nature. Advertising in this week's Economist, Salford is looking for a director for its new Centre for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming. The aim, apparently, is to develop a degree in 'economics with gambling studies' as well as to research this 'relatively underdeveloped' by-way of the dismal science. The fund-raising part, at any rate, should be a cinch; the vice-chancellor will no doubt be hovering by his phone on Wednesday, ready to offer felicitations to whichever consortium is named to run the National Lottery.</p>

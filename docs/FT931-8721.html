			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Rescue of NY Post in doubt THE RESCUE of the New York Post, the smallest and most sensational of New York's three big tabloids, could be in jeopardy following a legal victory by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a company con-trolled by Mr Steve Hoffenberg, the newspaper's prospective buyer. Towers Financial, Mr Hoffenberg's debt collection and factoring business, has consented to the SEC's demand for control over the company; it has agreed to the appointment of a trustee and to limits on expenditures as requested in a lawsuit by the SEC. The SEC alleged that Mr Hoffenberg's company had fraudulently sold Dollars 215m (Pounds 151.4m) of notes and overstated its assets by more than double. Towers Financial was described by the SEC as insolvent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Alverta Avila] </F>   [Text] Political parties such as the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], the National Action Party [PAN], and  the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] have condemned the  violent incidents in Chiapas.    The opposition is asking that these events not to be used as  a pretext for unleashing a witch hunt or persecution campaign or  for prolonging political uncertainty.    The political parties agree that the armed uprising in some  Chiapas municipalities is a desperate reaction to a situation of  severe dissatisfaction by the Indian communities, which have  subjected to discrimination, poverty, and plunder for several  decades.    PRI, PAN, and PRD leaders made and urgent call to the  government not to attempt a military solution for what is an  economic and social conflict.    Rene Bejarano, PRD president in Mexico City, said that a  massacre in Chiapas must be avoided at all costs and that the  events must not be used to initiate a witch hunt or persecution  campaign or to create more political uncertainty.    [Begin Bejarano recording] Because in-depth political  reforms were postponed for the sake of alleged economic reforms,  the chain broke at its weakest link. In that respect, to carry  out a military incursion without seeking a negotiated solution  would only cause a massacre. [end recording]    At the same time, Cecilia Romero, PAN assistant secretary  general, did not reject the possibility that there could be a  political group or party with their own specific interests  behind the Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN]. The PAN  leader demanded a decisive position from the government to  prevent the problem from spreading and to deter other political  forces from manipulating the incidents for their own benefit as  social peace is at risk.    [Begin Romero recording] This could lead to some type of  election manipulation [words indistinct] at this time. On the  other hand, the concerns expressed are understandable, but it  would be very serious for us to fall into sensationalism. I  believe this situation will be controlled. [Interior Secretary]  Mr. Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido must know quite well what is  happening since he was Chiapas governor at one time. I believe  he is still Chiapas governor on special leave. [end recording]    PRI Leader Demetrio Sodi criticized the fact that reports  disclosed last May related to the presence of guerrilla groups  in Chiapas had been disregarded. Sodi indicated that instead  of assigning blame, it is necessary to find out what really took  place and why the conflict reached such dimensions.    [Begin Sodi recording] ... blame someone, we would first  have to find out what really happened. In other words, if we  recall that last May several newspaper reports and interviews  indicated that a guerrilla movement was rising in the region.  Our contacts with social groups revealed that there were groups  obtaining weapons and preparing a spectacular political blow  such as what took place yesterday. [end recording]</p>

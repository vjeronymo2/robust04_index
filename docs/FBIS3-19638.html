			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F> Dietmar Timm; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Timm] There have often been some signs of peace  in Bosnia. How serious are these signs this weekend [19-20  March], in your view?    [Kinkel] There is, at least, a small ray of hope.  Everything you mentioned before indicates the small but  important steps forward have been possible, in particular the  signing of the agreement between the Croats and the Bosnian  Muslims in Washington last Thursday and Friday, which I  attended. This was a first, important agreement between two of  the three parties to the conflict, and the decisive thing now is  -- and all participants agreed on that -- to include the third  party, the Serbs. I hope this will be possible.    [Timm] How are the Serbs to be included? Serbian leader  Karadzic has announced conditions -- the most important of them  probably is the lifting of the UN sanctions so that, as he said,  the Serbs can sit at the negotiating table with equal rights.  Is this a condition that can be fulfilled?    [Kinkel] First of all, there are already talks. Of course,  now it will be decisive how much influence the Russians can  exert on the Serbian side in this connection. The basis of the  Washington agreement was the European action plan, which, for  its part, was based on the Kinkel-Juppe initiative, which, in  the end, envisaged that the Serbian side would be promised a  suspension of the sanctions -- not a lifting of the sanctions,  but a suspension --if specific steps toward peace are taken  beforehand.    The question of sanctions -- this is also something that we,  as the European Union troika, extensively discussed with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and with all other foreign  ministers present in Washington on Friday -- will now have to  make a decisive contribution to whether progress is made.  However, cautious action will be necessary in this respect. As  I said, first the Serbian side must do something and only then  can there be a suspension of very specific sanctions.    [Timm] The lifting of the blockade of the roads into Maglaj  by the Serbs yesterday -- is this a concession that would be  expected?    [Kinkel] In any case, it is a gratifying sign. Maglaj has  been in a very, very difficult situation for months. You saw  the pictures on television, how these convoys were received with  joy. I can only say: Now, after the partial solution that has  been achieved for Sarajevo -- we do not yet have a definite  political solution there -- we must now try to extinguish the  other sources of fire, so to speak, one after the other. This  includes Maglaj. It also includes other towns that are besieged  and difficult areas.    In addition to the political process, which now requires in  particular the inclusion of the Serbs, we must try to come to  grips with these other sources of fire in practice and, above  all, gradually bring the humanitarian relief convoys to all  those places where there is still terrible suffering.    [Timm] What role do the Europeans still play in this peace  process? After all, one gets the impression that progress is  mainly achieved through the mediation of the United States and  Russia.    [Kinkel] This is certainly correct. It was very important  that the Americans got more closely involved. However, the  basis of the agreement achieved last weekend was the preparatory  work done by the Europeans and also --something that is easily  forgotten -- the preparatory work done by Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg. This means we are still massively involved in the  process.    Above all, it will be necessary for the Europeans to be very  closely involved in the implementation of a peace treaty.  Therefore, on Friday we also talked about the fact that  administration by the European Union is envisaged for Mostar,  and we, the Germans, want to provide an administrator there. I  discussed the matter once again with Mr. Tudjman and Mr.  Izetbegovic on Friday. They are both still very much in favor of  having the matter done in this way.    [Timm] Americans and Russians are also playing a similar  role in the peace process in the Middle East. They are also  godfathers of that peace process. Israel and the PLO have been  talking to each other again since yesterday. The resumption of  the official talks seems to be imminent. What are the prospects  for peace like there? And here, too, the question: Which role  can the Europeans play in this process?    [Kinkel] First of all, the Russians are not playing any  decisive role in the Middle East process. It is, indeed, the  Americans who are doing that. On 18 March the UN Security  Council adopted a resolution on the terrible massacre in Hebron  after more than three weeks of deliberations -- a resolution  that contains a condemnation, an appeal to Israel to disarm the  settlers, and a call on Israel to take measures to protect  Palestinian civilians, including the international presence. In  this connection, we, Europeans, will also participate.    However, in particular we also have the task of providing  economic aid there. We have done that in the past and we are  now doing that very strongly with our involvement in the  occupied territories, bilaterally as Germans and, above all,  also as the European Union. Large amounts of money have been  provided. Now help must be provided in Gaza and in Jericho.  That is, the Europeans are facing quite a lot there.    [Timm] Mr. Kinkel, there are prospects for peace in Bosnia  -- even though they are vague -- and in the Middle East. Another  hotbed of crisis brought itself to people's attention on the  weekend, namely North Korea. The U.S. secretary of state now  wants to come to trade sanctions in the UN Security Council.  How explosive is the situation there, in your view?    [Kinkel] Well, what has happened there over the past few  days is unpleasant. It is true that North Korea is not at all  willing to join the Nonproliferation Treaty. On the contrary,  threats have been voiced. This is alarming. It would be  important that, above all, the Chinese, who have the greatest  possibility to exert influence, get involved there strongly. Of  course, it is also important that the UN Security Council  discuss how the events that are on the horizon in this  connection can be contained. I do not want to start speaking of  the devil, but the development is quite certainly not gratifying.    [Timm] Mr. Kinkel, in conclusion one more question to the  chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP].  Yesterday there were local elections in Schleswig-Holstein.  Once again, the FDP stayed below the 5-percent threshold at the  land level -- it achieved 4.4 percent. A week ago, after the  Landtag elections in Lower Saxony, you said that the FDP must  simply get better. Does it have to get even better as a result  of yesterday's elections?    [Kinkel] First of all, the result is not gratifying. There  is no reason to whitewash anything. However, one must not  overestimate local elections. One must understand that the free  voters' associations have not achieved bad results there, as far  as I can tell by the first reports. If one looks at the entire  picture, we were able to stop a trend to a certain extent, which  is doubtlessly not working for us at the moment. However, once  again, this is not a gratifying result, but one must not  overestimate it.    I am certain that the FDP will catch up again. We must do  everything and roll up our sleeves so that this happens in  practice. We will discuss this matter in the Presidium later  today. I repeat that one must not lose one's calm and deviate  from one's course now. At the moment we simply have problems  also because everything that is not working in this country is  blamed on those who are in the government in Bonn and we have to  take the blame for some difficulties that exist objectively.    We will get out of this negative trend and will manage it. I  am sure of that and, I say once again, one needs good nerves for  that. On the weekend I attended two party congresses. Things  will start moving upward again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Democratic Alliance leader </F> Ferdinando Adornato by Maurizio Caprara in Rome; date not given:  "`We Also Risk Becoming Transformist'"]    [Text] Rome -- "If he stands up against an agreement with  the League, [Italian Popular Party leader] Mino Martinazzoli  will become the champion of antitransformism in this country.  Yes, we have now reached the point where we can give this title  to the secretary of what was once the most associationist party,  the DC [Christian Democratic Party]," AD [Democratic Alliance]  founder Ferdinando Adornato said. Adornato was, in fact, among  the first to accuse [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni and the  League of transformism because of the agreement they reached the  day before yesterday.    Up to a few months ago, Adornato and Segni -- two of the new  faces brought into the limelight by the Italian crisis and the  rapid collapse of parties and traditions -- were in tune with  each other. When they drew up the document uniting democratic  allies and "pro-reform People's [Popular] Party members" on 15  July last, both stressed that AD must constitute an alternative  to the League. But one of the two has now joined the enemy.  "The usual old transformism," Adornato started by saying, "is  today favored by objective factors. The first is the confusion  of party acronyms resulting from the new electoral law. In  order to win, approximately 35 percent is needed in each  constituency. Therefore, disparate forces must be joined. On  the other hand, whereas the majority system forces parties into  alliances, the proportional quota encourages each party to act  individually. It is not surprising that each alliance looks  like a ragbag. However....    [Caprara] However, Mr. Adornato....    [Adornato] However, this agreement between Segni and the  League makes me see red. I am not only angry; I am also  worried: Those responsible for a transformist operation are  precisely the protagonists of two different types of renewal. I  have never liked [League Secretary] Bossi. Yet it cannot be  denied that both he and Segni express the need for renewal in  two different ways. This is why Martinazzoli may become the  champion of antitransformism, despite being the secretary of a  party from which theoretically we might expect the opposite."    [Caprara] If it has happened, it means something is uniting  Segni and the League.    [Adornato] It is disheartening. I am tempted to move to  Switzerland. They were blackmailed into reaching an agreement  by a publisher, a sort of Texan tycoon who does not want to give  up his TV networks [Berlusconi].    [Caprara] Communist Renewal decided to join the progressive  coalition in a congress in which 70 percent of the delegates  were in favor and 30 percent against. Do you regard this also  as transformism?    [Adornato] I am very much aware that the electoral system  entails the risk of transformism for us too. I observed  Communist Renewal held a very moderate congress. They were born  criticizing the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] for their  government platform, and then realized that they had messed up.  But they never said they were sorry, for example, for having  voted "no" in the electoral referendum.    [Caprara] However, AD will be going into the elections with  Communist Renewal. Is this not transformism too?    [Adornato] Yes, there are risks involved for us too.  However, this is precisely why we are striving to ensure that,  within the electoral coalition, a more homogeneous group of  forces puts forward a single government platform, a prime  minister and a single parliamentary group.    [Caprara] [Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta does not  seem  to agree.    [Adornato] Communist Renewal and others are free to say on  which points they agree and on which they do not. Openly. But  I must add something. We do not have a center-right, but a  somewhat uncouth right. Segni and Bossi will also reach an  agreement with [Italian Social Movement, MSI, Secretary] Fini so  as not to step on each other's toes. Since 1989, however, it is  not the Cossacks who have been the problem. It is the right.  Can you imagine the effects that an Italy governed by the right  would have on Germany or Bosnia?    [Caprara] Mr. Adornato, at one point you argued that the  League and AD were the sole new forces in the country. Does it  follow from this that you will stand as a candidate in Lombardy,  and that you will do so in some constituency against a League  candidate?    [Adornato] Me? The logic of the majority system entails that  if I stand as a candidate I should do so in my own town, Rome,  where I have lived since I was one year old.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "a.z.": "NATO Officer as Wire-Puller in </F> Cocaine Scene"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Dragan B. has been exposed as  a cocaine dealer. He repeatedly smuggled cocaine from Belgium  and Colombia to Austria. During his last coup he was caught in  Dusseldorf by the German police, which had been alerted by the  Austrians. He had 4 kg of cocaine on him with a street value of  7.5 million schillings. One kilogram of cocaine from previous  deliveries was found in the possession of eight gang members,  among whom it had been distributed.    In Belgium, the Vienna police has now established the  identity of a high-ranking Belgian NATO officer who had supplied  the cocaine. The Belgian authorities, however, have so far  ignored the Austrian investigations: Not only has the arrest  warrant not been executed, and the suspect, who has been  incriminated by several witnesses, has not only not been  extradited, the Belgians have not even arrested the man. "This  man is somehow untouchable," police sources said.    Eight individuals have been arrested, while complaints  against another 25 have been filed. [passage omitted]</p>

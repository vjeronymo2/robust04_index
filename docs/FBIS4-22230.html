			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Republic President Yuriy Meshkov by </F> LITERATURNAYA GAZETA columnist Oleg Moroz; place and date not  given: "Catastrophe in Yellow and Blue"]    [Text]    [Moroz] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, before coming to see you I  chatted with people here in the veche square. I am happy to say  that you still enjoy the confidence of the people.    [Meshkov] Does that surprise you?    [Moroz] I am simply asserting a fact. After all, we all know  that following an election, as soon as a person begins work and  gets down to real business, disillusionment sets in. Some people  do not like one aspect, others another...    [Meshkov] This is natural. You have to be ready for this,  but  all the same you do not want to lose too much too quickly.  Still, the situation is a great deal worse than is apparent from  a distance. I am referring to the state of the economy, the  state of law enforcement organs... Everything is so neglected...    [Moroz] It has already been reported repeatedly in the press  that you have abandoned a number of promises you made in the  preelection period, the most important of these being  reunification of Crimea with Russia. Do you agree with these  reports and the accompanying reproach?    [Meshkov] No, I do not. My preelection program did not refer  to the reunification of Crimea with Russia. It referred to the  restoration of a single economic space, cultural space,  information space. All the rest will follow automatically.    [Moroz] Will a survey take place on the state status of  Crimea?    [Meshkov] Yes, on 27 March.    [Moroz] But Kravchuk rescinded your decision to conduct it.    [Meshkov] Nonetheless, there will be a survey.    [Moroz] What will the consequences be?    [Meshkov] Crimea will take it into consideration. But what  the consequences will be for Ukraine--is difficult to predict.  Although according to sociological survey data, quite a definite  situation is taking shape there with respect to candidates for  the office of president of Ukraine.    [Moroz] But what question will be asked on the survey? The  question--"Are you in favor of an independent Republic of Crimea  in a union with other CIS states?" that was proposed? (this  sounds somewhat tautological)    [Meshkov] Several other questions will be presented, more  specific and more definite questions. They concern the  preservation of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea  and Ukraine, citizenship of the Republic of Crimea, and the  right to dual citizenship--those provisions that were determined  by the Constitution adopted 6 May 1992. These same provisions  were amended 25 September of the same year in the grossest  violations of legislation.    [Moroz] Do you expect any measures of confrontation on the  part of Kiev other than the threatening warnings which  constantly resound? How do you view the recent warning of  Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhalchenko, who stated that it  would be better to repulse "Crimean separatism" now than find  themselves up against the need to resort to military force later?    [Meshkov] As we know, the toughest traffic policemen are the  sergeants. The higher the rank, the more lenient they are. It is  just about the same way in the state apparatus. What  confrontation measures do we expect? In my opinion they have  already been taken...    [Moroz] Well, what will you do if, for example, Kiev decides  to introduce a state of emergency?    [Meshkov] (Laughing) In politics it is difficult to predict  all the alternatives when you use the conditional mood--"if..."  That is the first thing. Secondly, there are no premises for  introduction of a state of emergency. Everything is proceeding  normally, everything is being done within the framework of the  law, including within the framework of Ukrainian law. I can only  express my sympathy to the esteemed president of Ukraine for the  fact that his legal advisers did not very thoroughly work  through the legal documents concerning the survey.    [Moroz] Did you speak to him about this after he prohibited  the survey?    [Meshkov] (Laughing) As you know, it is the senior who has  the right to address the junior, and not vice versa.    [Moroz] Are you not afraid that Crimea will find itself in  the situation of Karabakh, the Dniester, Abkhazia, or even  Yugoslavia? Some people believe that such a development of  events is entirely likely.    [Meshkov] I can only express astonishment at such an  opinion.    [Moroz] Why? Prior to the outbreak of the war in Yugoslavia,  practically no one believed it would happen.    [Meshkov] You cannot equate two entirely different  situations. What is applicable in Yugoslavia has nothing  whatever to do with Crimea. We have no interreligious or  interethnic tension here... Here no nationalists at all are  taking root or acquiring influence. People who live here are  individualists to a greater extent than anywhere else in the  territory of the former Soviet Union.    [Moroz] Perhaps you do not see the analogy with Yugoslavia,  but the analogy with Abkhazia is more directly apparent. The  "Georgia-Abkhazia"--"Ukraine-Crimea" similarity is fairly great.  And Russia is involved in both...    [Meshkov] No, I see no analogy here either. Both before 1954  and after, we were a part of the people of Russia. And we remain  so today.    [Moroz] What political forces in Ukraine do you consider to  be your main enemies? And which ones--your allies?    [Meshkov] My enemies are nationalists of every shade. My  allies--those who stand up for normal mutual relations, for a  normal economy.    [Moroz] And what are the forces in Russia with whom you  support good relations?    [Meshkov] With everyone.    [Moroz] You do not see any differences between them?    [Meshkov] The differences are quite significant. But even in  view of all the differences, all factions of the State Duma, for  example, are interested in the processes that are underway in  the Republic of Crimea and around it. We are trying to use this  interest.    [Moroz] Some people believe you have a very good  relationship  with Zhirinovskiy.    [Meshkov] (Laughing) I do not know what facts such  conclusions are based on. I have stated before and will state  again that my relationship with Vladimir Volfovich is primarily  that of a schoolmate--we both completed studies at the law  faculty of Moscow University. Above that, he is without a doubt  a talented individual. As for the rest... In my opinion,  journalists do not penetrate deeply enough into the reality that  Vladimir Volfovich represents. It seems to me they are guilty of  onesidedness and evaluate him exclusively according to his  manner of communicating. In actuality, Zhirinovskiy is far more  serious than the way he is presented in the mass media.    [Moroz] What is your attitude towards Zhirinovskiy's  political views?    [Meshkov] I do not really fell like talking about this, but  since you ask... He is without a doubt, I say again, a talented  individual. Beyond this, every politician, as we know, contains  within himself the qualities of the snake, the tiger, and the  monkey, but people often perceive only the qualities of the  latter of the living creatures I have enumerated, not noticing  the qualities of the other two. The outward behavior,  statements, and gestures of Mr. Zhirinovskiy conceal his human  essence, I believe. In actuality, this is a powerful intellect  who is presented on the level of a side-show barker. He is the  only individual of all those now in the State Duma who correctly  determined the feelings, aspirations, and hopes of a mighty  people. Not everyone can see this.    [Moroz] You state that Zhirinovskiy divined the aspirations  of the people. But just imagine that two years of your  presidency have gone by, you have encountered heavy interference  over this entire period in your attempts to improve the economic  situation, the people continue to suffer as before, and now this  "powerful intellect" springs up who "divines" the feelings of  the people. He points to you and says: "He is guilty of  everything! Down with him!" In actuality, of course, no such  great intellect is needed for your local Crimean Zhirinovskiy to  emerge and, on a wave of discontent with Meshkov who "failed to  vindicate himself," get 25 percent of the votes...    [Meshkov] If I encounter heavy interference, I will attempt  to put up heavy resistance. That is the first thing. Secondly,  we are not talking about finding the most scathing slogans. This  is well within the power of the provincial journalist who  devises a garish headline. We are talking about far more serious  things, with respect to which entire scientific research centers  have been engaged in analysis. And then we see the result that  was obtained by these centers upon their analysis of the  situation in Russia on the eve of the 12 December elections as  not coinciding with reality--in catastrophic fashion.    [Moroz] It seems to me you are gravely mistaken in your  evaluation of Zhirinovskiy. Which I greatly regret.    [Meshkov] Is he more dangerous, or less intelligent?    [Moroz] In my opinion--both.    [Meshkov] As far as the former is concerned, perhaps I could  agree with you. With respect to the latter--no.    [Moroz] But think about this. There is no "powerful  intellect" there. There just cannot be. Zhirinovskiy does not  even have an ordinary sound intellect. As far as my regret of  your evaluation of this figure is concerned... I hope you are  not indifferent to the sympathies of sound-thinking Russian  society--the Russian intelligentsia, in particular. (My  utterance of these last words for some reason caused my partner  in conversation to become extremely agitated. He rose from his  chair and began to speak heatedly and emotionally--O.M.).    [Meshkov] There is no use in talking about this! There is no  sense in it! Of course I value the favor of the intelligentsia.  But an inaccurate evaluation leads to inaccurate conclusions.  Instead of analyzing the causes, you analyze the consequences.  This is the dangerous part! You will recall how people once  related to the corporal. How they laughed, how they caricatured  him. Superficial treatment overall. This is what I am talking  about.    [Moroz] Well, there are still other compliments you have  made  regarding this figure.    [Meshkov] I do not agree that this is a compliment. It is an  orientation on reality. And it is precisely what should compel  us to treat Zhirinovskiy quite seriously. We must not depict him  through caricatures. That is too superficial. But my attitude  towards Zhirinovskiy is not complimentary. God forbid!    [Moroz] What do you expect from the elections in Ukraine?  Will the situation there become more favorable for you? Will  there not be increased pressure from Kiev on the Republic of  Crimea?    [Meshkov] Realistic preconditions are presently in place for  a change in the situation in Ukraine--the former nomenklatura  personalities, who managed to become nationalists, will depart  the political arena. They will be replaced by practical people,  pragmatists who will decide all matters first and foremost in  the interests of the economy, not nationalism.    [Moroz] Are you satisfied with your "team"? How do you  select  your people?    [Meshkov] According to the principle of professionalism and  ability to function in an extreme environment.    [Moroz] But does not your enlistment of Saburov, an  individual "from outside," someone from another country no  less--does this not imply that you are experiencing a severe  personnel shortage?    [Meshkov] No, it does not. Saburov is not "from outside." He  is 100 percent Crimean, born in Yalta. But I am not even  referring to that. I am not talking about the space defined by  the borders of Crimea, but rather the space defined by the  borders of Russia. We do not perceive borders as a norm or as a  natural condition. Everything not in conformance with objective  economic laws, everything that contradicts common sense--is  nonviable. On the contrary, we could follow Hegel: Everything  rational is real. Everything is standardized and fit into a  norm. As far as a shortage of personnel is concerned, the  Ukrainian Government might well wish it could boast of  specialists in the class, on the level and with the  qualifications of Mr. Saburov.    [Moroz] Some people see a certain external resemblance  between the two of you...    [Meshkov] (Laughing) In any case, it was not based on any  resemblance to me that I invited him to assume the post of  deputy prime minister. That is a fact.    [Moroz] What are the main tasks you have set for him?    [Meshkov] To do everything that can be done at this time and  in this place to improve the economic situation.    [Moroz] How do you assess this situation?    [Meshkov] It is a catastrophe. A catastrophe colored yellow  and blue.    [Moroz] (A small illustration of the president's words with  respect to the catastrophic situation in the economy. A cleaning  lady in a Simferopol hotel, at which a "CIS-er" [Commonwealth of  Independent States] is fleeced to the tune of R40,000 per day  for an average room, receives less than R9,000 a month. A civil  aviation pilot who retires gets R18,000 in pension. The Crimean  president himself, I was told by one of his aides, receives a  salary of 1,900,000 karbovantsy. Despite the large number of  zeros, this comes to just R82,610 as of the moment of my  departure from Crimea last Saturday. Today it is reduced still  more, since the coupon/ruble rate keeps falling and  falling...--O.M.) You have stated that you intend to return  Crimea to the ruble zone.    [Meshkov] I intend to. For us the ruble is a more acceptable  means of payment, since our main flow of tourists--people who  spend money in Crimea--are citizens of Russia. To provide them  normal services, if you will, is one of the most important tasks  of our oblast economy. And we will accomplish this task.    [Moroz] But there is no border between Crimea and Ukraine.  It  would be practically impossible to introduce a currency here  different from that used in Ukraine...    [Meshkov] What is going on right now is impossible. Our  reality of today is impossible. We are striving to return to a  normal condition.    [Moroz] The way I understand it, to do this you would have  to  violate the laws of Ukraine?    [Meshkov] The laws of Ukraine constitute one of the factors  leading to the current economic situation. The results are  before you, as they say.    [Moroz] What do you see as the primary cause of the  catastrophic situation that has arisen in Ukraine and rushed  towards you in a wave?    [Meshkov] The situation is even more desperate than you  think. But the primary cause is encroachment, the way they  perceive it, upon the sense of national dignity of some  nationalists of Western Ukraine, which has led to a general  economic collapse of the gigantic European state Ukraine  comprises. This is the price that was paid for the realization  of nationalist slogans. And it was effected with the full  composure, indifference, and silent encouragement of Europe and  the United States. The United States became alarmed only when  the nationalists put their finger on the nuclear button. While  it was clear from the very beginning that this would happen. But  now they are saying a Russian nationalist has come to power in  Crimea. Where does such delusion come from? The dignified  magazine ECONOMIST (Paris) publishes an article entitled "The  Second Crimean War."    [Moroz] A month and a half has elapsed now since you were  elected president. What has this time brought you as leader of  the Republic of Crimea? Have there been any unexpected  revelations?    [Meshkov] Yes. First of all--the attitude of previous state  officials. This is open sabotage. It is nothing obscure or  secretive, but rather open and defiant.    [Moroz] You were hoping for something different?    [Meshkov] No, I was not hoping for their assistance, but  neither did I expect defiance. I did not expect that it would be  so aggressive, clearly anti-people, irrational... And criminal,  in the final analysis. That is one thing I did not expect. A  second thing was the revelation as to what extent our law  enforcement organs are infected with the disease called  corruption.    [Moroz] Incidentally, you were forced to leave your position  as procuracy investigator for attempting to bring charges  against members of the party and administration nomenklatura  caught in embezzlement. Do you still have this motivating drive  to fight for justice?    [Meshkov] I still have the drive, and my capacities have  grown immeasurably.    [Moroz] How do you intend to fight crime? Do you have a  specific, precisely defined program?    [Meshkov] Implementation of the program to fight crime runs  headlong into a personnel problem, unfortunately. There are  insufficient personnel capable of carrying on this fight.    [Moroz] During your time in office have you managed to  establish any personal contacts with the leaders of Ukraine and  Russia?    [Meshkov] With the leaders of Ukraine--no. Only on the  official level. The situation with respect to Russia is directly  the reverse.    [Moroz] What do you consider yourself--a Russian or a  Ukrainian (your father being Russian and your mother Ukrainian)?    [Meshkov] (Laughing) I consider myself a Don Cossack.    [Moroz] Do you know Ukrainian?    [Meshkov] Yes, I understand it.    [Moroz] Do you read with a dictionary?    [Meshkov] No, I do not need a dictionary. My reading is  fluent. But my speaking... I am not about to assert that I speak  correct literary language. I speak on the everyday, colloquial  level.    [Moroz] What place in your plans of presidential activity is  occupied by facilitating resolution of the Black Sea Fleet  problem? We know that Russia and Ukraine are resolving it. They  are trying to resolve it. However, except for the seamen  themselves, it is Crimeans who suffer more than anyone else from  a failure to resolve this issue.    [Meshkov] This problem is essentially resolved. The only  question is to what extent conditions of the agreement will be  conscientiously observed. A readiness to do so is manifest on  Russia's part, as far as I am aware. This is not true with  respect to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet. This  is natural. It is economically feasible. All the rest will  depend on the rational or irrational actions of the other side.  For us the presence of the Black Sea Fleet is a benefit that  would be a sin not to take advantage of.    [Moroz] How is your intention to take Ukrainian armed  formations out of Crimea being executed?    [Meshkov] I requested the Ukrainian leadership to remove  first of all those troops that were introduced in violation of  agreement and the existing order (troops may be introduced only  with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea). The presence  of these forces does not contribute toward normalization of  relations between Crimea and Ukraine. In addition, they are  occupying a fairly large amount of territory which could be used  for economic purposes. Finally, they represent a certain threat  to the ecology.    [Moroz] What is the numerical strength of these troops?    [Meshkov] They are fairly large units, unfortunately.    [Moroz] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported about 60,000.    [Meshkov] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA rarely errs in these matters. They  have reliable sources.    [Moroz] It is apparent that Crimean Tatars followed the  appeals of their leaders and voted against you. Many of them do  not recognize you as president. Do you hope to be able to  shatter their negative attitude towards you?    [Meshkov] It is incorrect to assert that the Crimean Tatars  do not recognize the president. It would be more accurate to  state that the leadership of one wing of the national movement  of Crimean Tatars entered into alliance with my political  opponent and supported him. And when he lost, they declared they  did not agree with the one who won. This is not politics. This  is not on the political level. It is on the mundane level. It is  simply undignified to resolve political problems on the mundane  level. As far as support from ordinary citizens of the Republic  of Crimea is concerned, a million or more of their votes is more  than sufficient to be able to calmly sit down in this chair. And  among that million are a great many citizens of Crimean Tatar  nationality.    [Moroz] Do you intend to repeal the quota of 14 seats for  Crimean Tatars in the parliament, as you promised?    [Meshkov] I did not say I intended to repeal the quota. I  said that I do not accept the principle of endowment of  political rights according to nationality. I opposed this as a  deputy and as candidate for president. And I now oppose it as  president. It is a flagrant violation of international law and  universal standards. But I have no intention of repealing what  has already come about.    [Moroz] Do you sense any action on the part of the special  services? Are they watching you?    [Meshkov] (Laughing) Well, beginning from a certain time and  at a certain level of political and state activity, this is  inevitable.    [Moroz] How do you evaluate Khrushchev's unforgettable  decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine?    [Meshkov] One in a series of delirious inventions and  decisions. It has nothing to do with common sense or with man's  treatment of his fellow man. But from the legal and judicial  point of view, the issue is decided. The acts of 1954 were  declared invalid as of the moment of their adoption. Thus,  everything is normal in this aspect. The only thing that remains  is to return to common sense and universal concepts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Yuan Hsiu-hsien (5913 </F> 4423 6343): "Guangzhou Quickens the Pace of `Conceding Markets,  Profits, and Ownership Right' of State-Owned Enterprises to  Foreign Businessmen"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 9 Mar--This year Guangzhou City will  quicken the pace of changing the operational mechanism of  state-owned enterprises, refrain from helping out money-losing  enterprises, and accelerate the "concession of markets, profits,  and ownership right" to foreign businesses. Guangzhou Executive  Vice Mayor Chen Kaizhi and Wu Liang made the these remarks at a  news conference of the city people's congress today.    Chen said: The city started exploring the change of  operation mechanism in state-owned enterprises last year. The  authorities will change the traditional methods of granting  loans and so on to money-losing enterprises and will not help  them out so they can thoroughly remold themselves. With regard  to existing enterprises, especially young and lively  enterprises, it is necessary to quicken the pace of changing  their mechanisms. We should take advantage of their adolescent  years to help them find "mothers-in-law" and marry them off to  establish a modern enterprise system.    Wu Liang said: Last year, Guangzhou boldly "conceded  markets, profits, and ownership right" to foreign businesses,  and it will accelerate this process this year. Various  enterprises, whether newly-established, profit-making, or good  old ones, also should be sold. We are even ready to sell whole  factories. Some tertiary industries, including commerce and  retail and catering businesses, as well as tunnels and bridges,  will also be sold in a planned and restrained manner. However,  there should be coordination with the central government on  certain items. Wu said: By selling shares we can use the funds  for more necessary construction projects in Guangzhou, including  the construction of underground railways and roads.    Speaking on excessive price rises last year, Wu said: We  shall adopt feasible measures to keep down prices. These  measures include the establishment of a fund for keeping down  prices and the establishment of a reserve system for important  nonstable food; the implementation of a system of putting on  record price increases for important commodities; tighter  management of collection of administrative and service charges  and adoption of macroeconomic regulation and control measures  over the sales of commodities that can yield exorbitant profits;  and acceleration of the "shopping basket" project in an effort  to keep the rise in retail price index to within 15 percent this  year.</p>

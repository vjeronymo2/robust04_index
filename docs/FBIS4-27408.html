			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (YONHAP) -- Despite the current  stalemate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  North Korea has reportedly said it would do its best to solve  the problem through talks with the United States by guaranteeing  the transparency of its nuclear program.    China's official XINHUA News Agency on Sunday quoted a North  Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Saturday [28 May]  his country and the IAEA met May 25-27 to negotiate technical  matters related to removing fuel rods from the 5-megawatt  reactor at Yongbyon, revealing that Pyongyang would continue  independent discharge of the spent fuel.    During the negotiations, North Korea reportedly proposed  that  under IAEA supervision it would independently replace and store  the fuel rods, which would later be measured by the agency,  after the preparation of a package deal between Washington and  Pyongyang.    In response, the IAEA asked Pyongyang to submit the proposal  in writing for further examination, the news agency said.    XINHUA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that  Pyongyang was ready to continue the negotiations whenever the  IAEA offers to meet, even though a final agreement was yet to be  made between the two sides.    North Korea has been discharging nuclear fuel rods faster  than expected, virtually blocking the IAEA's plan to take  samples. The agency wishes to conduct direct tests of the  discharged fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has  diverted plutonium, the key element in manufacturing atomic  bomb, for other purposes.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (30): A delightfully provincial city - City profiles, La Paz and Cochabamba Even world-weary travellers should respond to the charm of the 400-year-old city of La Paz and its 1.1m inhabitants squeezed into a natural bowl beneath snow-capped Illimani. The residential order is the reverse in La Paz to that of many 'up-and-down' cities: the poorest live in the inhospitable satellite town of El Alto ('The Heights') at 4,100m above sea level. The business centre and hotels are located centrally (at 3,600m), where the main Spanish colonial city stood. And the wealthy, in recent years, have withdrawn to the lower slopes, where breathing is easier. Fortunately, in view of the altitude, doing business in La Paz is physically undemanding: most government offices and corporate headquarters are within easy walking distance of the main street, El Prado. The westernised occupants of these offices look, think, act and dress differently from the Bolivian man and woman in the street. Compared to most Latin American cities, La Paz is delightfully provincial in its manners and the honesty of its inhabitants. Shared taxis are the preferred form of transport for the pacenos and one of the few places where the social classes mingle and exchange political chit-chat. Bolivians are flexible about punctuality for social appointments; less so for business. Bear in mind what Mr Victor Hugo Cardenas, the vice-president who is himself an Aymara Indian - says of his indigenous fellow countrymen, the majority in Bolivia: 'They never say yes or no; always maybe. They are never excessively happy or disappointed; never over-optimistic and never over-fatalistic. Balance in all things is the wisdom of the Andes.' Arriving in La Paz need not be as unpleasant as you have been told. True, at 4,000m above sea level, El Alto is the world's highest big airport - but altitude is 50 per cent in the mind. You may experience slight breathlessness or light-headedness at first until your body adjusts. Follow the advice recently given by his personal physician to a 74-year-old former UN secretary-general, returning to the 'Altiplano' after years of soft, sea-level living: 'Walk slowly; eat little; sleep alone'. Most important: make no business appointments for the first day, while your red corpuscles are building up. Drink abundant liquids (but not alcohol) and avoid over-hot baths. A mate de coca (coca tea) on arrival may help stave off soroche (altitude sickness). Business travellers from most European and North American destinations will not require visas. Customs formalities are relaxed and airport staff helpful. A taxi into town (about 30 minutes) costs less than Dollars 10. Cabs have no meters. Don't expect taxi drivers to speak English; they are, however, honest and reliable. A Dollars 20 exit tax is payable on departure. Hotels: Status-conscious businessmen frequent the Radisson (the remodelled former Sheraton), the Plaza or the Presidente, all of which are well up to international standards. The discriminating traveller may prefer the cosier atmosphere of the newly-inaugurated Rey Palace where suites are huge and half the price. Restaurants: Thanks to the expense accounts of a continuing procession of international functionaries, development experts and ubiquitous consultants showing Bolivia the way to 'modernity', La Paz's range of eating-houses is expanding. The Utama sky-room restaurant in the Plaza hotel (excellent salad bar) has an established and well-deserved reputation. For a quiet business lunch or dinner, choose between Juliano's and La Quebecoise, both in former private houses. Even more intimate is the Restaurant de la Paz, where the tables are set with the owner's own solid silver cutlery. Newly fashionable among carnivorous Bolivians is the Brazilian-style meat restaurant Brasargent (fixed price; all the meat you can eat). The Casa del Corregidor (Swiss management but Bolivian chef) offers Bolivian folk music and local and international dishes in a colonial setting. If you have time, the Oberland (through the 'Valley of the Moon') is a pleasant lunch spot. And when you need a coffee, opposite the central post office is the legendary Cafe La Paz where old-time conspirators planned their coups. Typical dishes and drinks: Saltenas - a spicy meat or chicken turnover traditionally eaten before lunch always with a cold drink, never coffee or tea. Chairo - the soup of La Paz, meat-based with at least 10 spices, made with dried potato flour (chuno). Picante mixto - as a main dish. In its complete version, it includes jerky, rabbit, tripe and tongue. Chuflay - a mixture of singani (a locally-distilled spirit made of grapes), lemon juice and Seven-Up. Concepcion - a breakthrough in Bolivian wine. Could be Chilean. Communications: Picking up a pre-capitalisation Bolivian telephone can be a nightmare; getting through, locally and internationally, is time-consuming. Picking up the Bolivian Times, the country's only English-language newspaper, is a more agreeable experience. The one-year-old weekly appears on Fridays. Cochabamba: Half and hour's flight from La Paz, this 'city of eternal spring', at 2,600m above sea level, has lost some of its former architectural charm in the aftermath of the 1980s coca boom down the road to the Chapare. It remains a pleasant and relaxed, but well-developed, business centre. Stay at the deceptively gracious, recently-refurbished Gran Hotel Cochabamba. Built adjacent to a small church, some rooms permit participation in services next door. Round the corner is the new Hotel Portales, not to be confused with the Patino mansion (now a cultural centre and art gallery) in the same block. Both hotels have swimming pools. The Gran Hotel restaurant is considered the best in town.</p>

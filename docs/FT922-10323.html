			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Austrian trucks accord The final obstacle to the signature on Saturday of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, creating a 19-country single market, was removed yesterday when the EC reached agreement with Austria on truck traffic crossing the latter's territory, David Buchan reports from Brussels. The transit of EC trucks through the Alps was a problem for Switzerland and Austria. The latter has now conceded that EC trucks can make 1.264m trips across its territory a year. The treaty will, after a transition period for certain sensitive sectors in Efta states, permit a free flow of goods, capital, services, and labour among the signatory countries. Negotiations for the EEA, which effectively make Efta states economic but not political members of the EC, have been plagued by institutional problems that may well be raised when the treaty comes up for ratification in various legislatures.</p>

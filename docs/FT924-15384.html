			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Linx print group heads for market via placing LINX Printing Technologies, the Cambridge-based maker of ink-jet printers, is to make its stock market debut on October 15. Linx will be introduced through a placing by Morgan Grenfell and is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 20m. It is unlikely that the prospective price/earnings ratio will be any lower than that of its larger rival, Domino, at about 16 times. After the placing the nine-member board will hold more than 50 per cent of the shares. The company will publish a pathfinder prospectus tomorrow showing an 87 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.64m for the year to June 30. Sales were 62 per cent higher at Pounds 10.5m. Earnings per share of about 9.07p compare with 5.14p last time. A strong position in the more recession-resistant foods and pharmaceuticals sectors helped UK profits increase by 80 per cent last year, according to managing director Mr Michael Keeling. Mr Keeling, one of the company's founders, said Linx intended to use the placing proceeds for acquisitions. Linx plans to expand its presence in the production line application of ink jet process. For example, in identifying stocks held in warehouses or incoming supplies. The company believed worldwide sales of continuous ink jet printers would grow by 10 per cent per annum over the next few years.</p>

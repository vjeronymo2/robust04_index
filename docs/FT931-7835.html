			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ameritech unveils restructuring AMERITECH, the Chicago-based 'Baby Bell' telephone company, yesterday announced a sweeping internal reorganisation and unveiled a radical plan for introducing competition into the US local telecommunications market. Its initiative is an important contribution to the growing US debate over the future of the nation's local telecommunications industry in general, and the seven regional 'Baby Bell' companies in particular. The local telecommunications market remains monopolistic, divided up between the 'Baby Bells' and independent service companies, such as GTE. However, these monopolies are coming under increasing threat, due to regulatory and technological change, and the regional companies have been looking for new strategies to respond to the competition posed by wholesale telecommunications companies, cellular companies and cable television businesses with telephone ambitions. Ameritech's plan for local competition is believed to be the first such proposal by a 'Baby Bell' company, although New York's independent Rochester Telephone also unveiled a ground-breaking scheme this month. The move by Ameritech, which provides telecommunications services to 12m customers in the mid-west, has two distinct parts. First, it intends to create 12 new market-focused business units, each bearing the holding company's name, rather than organising itself around Bell operating companies in each of the states where it operates. Eleven of the units will be organised around a specific type of service to the customer - for example, small business services or pay phone services. The 12th will run the telecommunications network. Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said it was 'dramatically simplifying' the way customers dealt with the company by putting its marketing initiatives and services under a single brand name. He also stressed the restructuring was not a 'resizing process' - a euphemism for job cuts. The second part of the initiative is more dramatic in scope, but less likely to materialise in the near term, as it would entail wholesale changes to the US telecommunications industry framework, involving a multiplicity of federal and local regulatory agencies. Ameritech says it will file next month with the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which regulates the communications industry, a plan to open up its local telephone network to competition by separating its transport services from switching services, which direct telephone calls. It says this would provide US consumers with the same kind of options in picking local telephone services which they have today in choosing their long-distance service carrier. The long-distance market has been fully competitive since the 1984 anti-trust break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which left the rump AT&amp;T in the long-distance market and created the seven 'Baby Bell' local monopolies. Other service providers in the mid-west would be able to buy components of Ameritech's network to repackage with their own services for resale. However, in return for this, Ameritech said it would be seeking some drastic changes in its operating environment, including the ability to provide long-distance services. At present, all the 'Baby Bells' are prohibited from entering the long-distance market, under the terms of the 1984 anti-trust settlement, though all are demanding to be allowed into this field as their monopolies erode. Ameritech wants the current regulation of its earnings by state commissions to be replaced by a regime of price regulation, and it is asking for flexibility in the pricing of new and competitive services.</p>

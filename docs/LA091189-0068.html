			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> TEST QUANTIFIES RISK OF CANCER RECURRENCE  </P> <P> A new test appears effective at identifying early breast cancer patients at  greatest risk for suffering a life-threatening recurrence of the disease,  researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said last week. In  a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers  reported that breast cancer patients who test positively for a protein called  Hpr have nearly four times the chances that their cancer will come back,  indicating that they may be candidates for the strongest cancer-fighting drugs  initially.  </P> <P> The researchers tested cancer tissue samples from 70 women diagnosed with Stage  1 and Stage 2 breast cancer from 1977 through 1985. Those who tested positively  for Hpr had nearly four times the risk of suffering a recurrence compared to  those who did not in the 11 years after diagnosis, the researchers found.  Although they are not sure how Hpr, or haptoglobin-related protein, would  influence the chances of having a recurrence, scientists suspect that the  protein may play a role in the cancer's ability to spread.

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: How to gain real US expertise - Robert Powell considers American mutual funds THE OLD world has long regarded the US as a land of opportunity and riches. The US certainly has the most sophisticated financial markets in the world. But how does a non-American gain access to the expertise of US fund managers? The American equivalent of the unit trust industry is the mutual fund sector, which has been phenomenally successful in attracting US private investors. One in every four American households owns shares of a mutual fund, and during the past decade, the number of funds has grown from 665 to 3,570. However, for the overseas investor, buying into a mutual fund is neither an easy nor a tax-less task. The non-US investor must first open - if they can - a deposit account in the US or locate a European or an offshore financial services company which will establish an account in the US for them. After going through all that, they will learn that Uncle Sam will treat them worse - at least if they invest in a money market or bond fund, than if they had invested their funds in a unit trust domiciled outside the US, but which also invested in US securities. That is because under current US securities law, mutual funds are required to distribute interest income and realised capital gains each year. Under the same law, mutual funds must convert the interest, income and capital gains realised and distributed into 'dividends'. The non-US investor's 'dividend' is then subject to a US withholding tax that ranges from 15 per cent to 30 per cent depending on whether a treaty exists with the US. (In some countries, Germany for instance, the non-US investor can recover that withholding tax by declaring it on their home country tax form.) Catherine Heron, of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group in Washington DC, says lawmakers in Congress may pass a bill that has bipartisan support this year that will remove the hurdles that now make it difficult for non-US investors to buy US mutual fund shares. The law would enable US firms to distribute interest and income and short-term capital gains to non-US investors free from withholding tax. It would also enable US companies to create special mutual funds for non-US investors that would not be required to distribute income or gains annually. In the meantime, non-US investors may be better placed investing in a fund that is domiciled in an 'offshore' centre such as Luxembourg, Ireland or the Bahamas. That way they can benefit from the expertise of a big US fund manager such as Fidelity or Putnam, without incurring a tax penalty. Robert Pozen, general counsel for Fidelity Investments in Boston, says offshore funds are not very different from those that an investor might buy directly in the US. And in fact there may be certain advantages. For starters, those funds usually invest in the very same securities that managers of US funds do. And as a result, the performance of those funds will be similar. For instance, Bill McBride of Lipper Analytical Services, a mutual fund research firm in New York, said the average offshore fund that invested in US securities rose 39.04 per cent over the five years ended June 1992. By contrast, the average US equity fund rose in US dollars terms 47.74 per cent. (The non-US investor would have faced a withholding tax on part of that gain). The top-performing offshore funds over that 5 year period were Global Asset Management Selection Inc, up 133.85 per cent, Fidelity's Sterling American Fund, up 127.87 per cent, and Putnam's Emerging Health Sciences Trust SA, up 105.12 per cent. Meanwhile, the average offshore fund that invested in US equities rose 11.34 per cent over the year ended June, while the average US equity fund rose 13.01 per cent. (The top performing offshore funds over the past year were Thornton American Opportunities Trust Income, up 19.85 per cent and Ermitage Selz Fund Ltd, up 18.52 per cent). McBride attributed the better performance of US-based over offshore funds to the former's concentration in small stocks and not to superior investment talent. However, offshore funds are not without drawbacks, according to McBride. For a start, the private investor does not have as many choices as in the US domestic market. True, the number of funds that invest in US equities has grown from 60 five years ago to 124 today, of which around 32 are managed by US fund managers. But that still pales in comparison to the number of US funds and firms. According to McBride, there is some Dollars 4.2bn invested in the 124 offshore funds that invest in US equities. But there is an estimated Dollars 500 billion invested in the more than 1,200 US based equity funds. In addition the non-US investor may not be able to put his money in a fund managed by a superstar as Americans were able to do with Peter Lynch, the now retired manager of Fidelity. In addition, offshore funds are more costly to operate than US-based funds, and as a result, investors may face higher charges. On average, the investor in the US-domiciled equity fund will usually pay the manager 1.4 per cent of assets under management for expenses. By contrast, McBride and others estimated that an investor in a non-US based funds can expect to pay an additional 0.5 of a percentage point or more in expenses each year - and thus, all things being equal, could expect to see a lower rate of return. Non-US investors will also have to pay a initial charge of about 5 to 6 per cent to buy an offshore fund that invests in US securities. Such a charge can significantly reduce the investor's return. By contrast, many US domiciled funds have no initial charge. These so-called 'no-load' funds are sold directly to the public without the intervention of a stockbroker, banker, insurance salesman, or financial planner. There is a further option for non-US investors - 'cross border' funds. For example, the Boston-based Pioneer fund, which was founded in the late 1920s, was registered for sale in Germany in the late 1960s. German shareholders of that fund, which is exactly the same as the fund offered for sale in the US, are treated in the same way as if they had invested in a German-domiciled fund. But while experts say Pioneer has succeed in gaining market share in Germany, they note that other US firms - because of cultural and distribution differences - have had limited success registering US-domiciled funds overseas.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Setback for Hongkong Bank share trading LONDON-BASED marketmakers yesterday backed out of quoting sterling prices on the largest portion of shares in HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Although marketmakers will trade UK-registered shares, most HSBC stock will continue to be traded in Hong Kong. The decision could affect the company's weighting in UK stock indices. Trading in the new sterling-denominated shares in HSBC is set to go ahead at 2.30pm today, after its Pounds 3.6bn offer for Midland Bank goes unconditional. Plans to quote a sterling price in Hong Kong-registered shares were abandoned yesterday, when marketmakers decided there was insufficient business to warrant a marketmaking commitment. The decision has scuppered plans to use a SEAQ-listed quote in Hong Kong-registered shares in the compilation of the FT-SE 100 share index. That would have created a 'sensible weighting', reflecting the size of the company, said Mr John Brumwell, a director of Prudential Portfolio Managers, who sits on the FT-SE 100 Steering Committee. The committee meets this morning to decide how to weight HSBC. The move has raised fears among traders that the company will end up without its full weighting. If all shares in the company are included, the company would have a weighting of about 1 1/2 per cent in the index, compared with only  1/2 per cent, if only UK-registered shares are included, analysts said. There are two classes of shares in the company: 800m ordinary 75p shares, and 1,600m HKDollars 10 shares. 'A change in the expected composition of the index will alter the way index funds behave,' said one equity analyst. A fund manager who tracks the FT-SE index may buy the corresponding proportion of shares, and some investors could decide they can stay away from the stock altogether, if it represents only a small portion of the index, one dealer said. HKDollars-denominated Hong Kong registered shares will continue however to be listed on SEAQ International, the Stock Exchange's international quotation system, but these shares are unlikely to be actively traded, according to dealers.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Investors seek advice in United Newspapers row A ROW has erupted over the treatment of investors in a United Newspapers issue of convertible preference shares. Some investors, who lost payment of the annual dividend on the shares, are currently taking legal advice on the matter. The Pounds 105m issue, which was exchangeable into ordinary shares in Reuters Holdings, was called for early redemption by the issuer last December. The decision to call the issue forced investors still holding the preference shares to convert into Reuters shares. By doing so, they forfeited payment of the fixed 8 per cent dividend due on the preference shares, but, because of the timing, they also missed receiving payment of the Reuters share dividend. There are just seven days each year when the issuer can take advantage of the documentation to redeem the bonds without paying the dividend. Investors claim that this is a loophole which has saved United Newspapers an estimated Pounds 8.1m in dividend payments at their expense. 'We believe that this sort of action is bad market practice, misleading investors who do not read the small print,' said one investor in the issue. However, an official at United Newspapers said that the company had taken every care to follow correct procedure. 'Before we called the issue, we made sure we understood the the terms of the issue required, and then followed the terms of the issue precisely,' he said. There is similar wording on an Pounds 80m Smith &amp; Nephew issue of convertible preference shares due 2004. Officials at Smith &amp; Nephew declined to comment on the issue.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eastern bloc metal shipments 'to remain high' NET EXPORTS of aluminium, copper, lead and zinc from the former eastern bloc countries to the west are forecast to remain high by the Economist Intelligence Unit. In its latest World Commodity Outlook report it says western metals producers are unlikely to get much relief from the turmoil and low prices caused by eastern bloc exports. 'There is a case for arguing that over the next few years Soviet exports are more likely to rise than to subside,' it adds. The report suggests that the fall in production in the former Soviet Union, which has released more metal for export at a time when the republics are desperate for foreign currency, has nothing to do with market mechanisms. It is taken to be the effect of 'growing dislocation, both political and economic'. It adds: 'The influences that pushed up Soviet metal exports in 1991 are likely to lift them further in 1992, which is seen as another year of sharp economic decline'. Looking farther ahead than it usually does, the report predicts that net exports of copper from the former Soviet Union are expected to rise to 325,000 tonnes in 1994, those of lead to 130,000 tonnes and those of zinc to 144,000 tonnes. It says: 'This conclusion might seem out of place in a volume of short-term forecasts, but the question of whether Soviet exports rise from their disruptive 1991 levels or fall back to something more digestible is surely germane to the decisions producers have to take now about whether to cut production or not. We do not believe that relief is just around the corner'. In the circumstances, the EIU does not see the London Metal Exchange three-month price for copper averaging more than 97 cents a lb in 1992, compared with 106.6 cents last year, though it should rise towards the end of the year as a sustained recovery in prices gets under way. Aluminium's price is predicted to average Dollars 1,100 a tonne, down from Dollars 1,333 last year. 'In real terms, Dollars 1,100 would be the lowest annual average aluminium price in recent history and possibly of all time, well below the level reached in 1986,' the report points out. Other LME-traded metals are forecast to show higher average prices this year compared with 1991: lead at 26.3 cents a lb (25.3 cents); nickel Dollars 4.20 a lb (Dollars 3.90); tin Dollars 3.66 a lb (Dollars 2.54) and zinc 52.5 cents a lb (50.7 cents). The report also argues that prospects for traded metals should not be judged solely in the light of the dim outlook for economic growth in the OECD countries. The much better growth prospects in the leading developing countries need to be taken into account too. Between 1973 and 1990 these countries lifted their share of consumption outside the eastern bloc from 8 to 18 per cent for aluminium, from 7 to 18 per cent for copper, from 12 to 22 per cent for lead, from 12 to 25 per cent for zinc and from 11 to 24 per cent for primary tin. Even for nickel their share rose from 2 to 12 per cent. The EIU suggests the developing countries will continue to outpace the OECD countries this year and predicts the combined growth of South Korea, Taiwan, India, Turkey, Mexico and Brazil will be 4.9 per cent compared with 2.6 per cent for the developed countries. Russia's Norilsk nickel production consortium is cutting exports, but denies reports that it is planning to close one of its three smelters, reports Reuter from Moscow. 'We are not satisfied with world prices for nickel, so we decided to bring down the volume of nickel exports from our consortium,' said Mr Boris Kazakov, Norilsk's first deputy chairman. The consortium is responsible for about 80 per cent of nickel production in the former Soviet Union. 'We are not actually planning to shut down the whole complex but we decided now was the moment to modernise and re-equip some of our smelting facilities. This will of course result in a decrease of our production levels,' he said.

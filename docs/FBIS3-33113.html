			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Mexican elections  scheduled for 21 August 1994.    Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the  Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, led a meeting in Mexico  City to discuss his campaign funding. PRI President Fernando  Ortis Arana swore in the members of the party's national and  state funding commissions. Colosio told the commission members  that "the people are right to reject waste, mismanagement, and  the splurging of money, as they offend the people, given the  current social situation." The party plans to spend less than  the government- imposed ceiling of 134 million new pesos and  will not use public funds or property. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 9 Feb 94)    Colosio has proposed a five-point program to rescue Indians  throughout the country from the neglect and discrimination they  have always suffered.

Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate,  walked the final laps with party members. He said the solution  to the Chiapas conflict lies in "the land distribution system.  To ensure a long lasting solution, the country's peasants must  be sure they have the right to claim and posses land of their  own." He added that certain principles must be included in the  Constitution "to recognize the individual political, social, and  economic rights of the peasant communities and their  inhabitants.

In a 30-minute speech in a low income neighborhood in Mexico  City, he rejected the use of punishment votes and criticized  those who vote out of fear. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television  Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 14 Feb 94)    Diego Fernandez de Cevallos met on Tuesday 15 February with  Iberoamerican University students in Mexico City in a packed  auditorium.

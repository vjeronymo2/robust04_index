			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / White rule comes to an end in Africa today: Patti Waldmeir reports on a multi-racial transitional government in Cape Town Nearly 350 years of white domination in South Africa will formally end today in Cape Town when blacks take their seats on a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council charged with overseeing government until all-race elections in April next year. Ironically, the first meeting of the 20-party TEC will be held on the premises of the President's Council, a body set up by the hardline then-President P. W. Botha in the 1980s to ensure that whites could always overrule deputies classified coloured (mixed-race) and Indian in the tricameral parliament from which blacks were excluded. The similarity ends there: for contrary to the government's original plans for the TEC, it is likely to find it hard to veto decisions of the council. Though President F. W. de Klerk continues to insist that the TEC will not be able to bypass the government, political realities could dictate differently. The government will find it extremely difficult to ignore TEC decisions, and with most of its potential allies refusing to join the council, it has little hope of out-voting the African National Congress bloc. The TEC's remit, set out in legislation passed last September, is so vague as to be either meaningless or limitless. It is charged with 'levelling the political playing field' and creating the conditions for free and fair elections on April 27. As ANC officials point out, with elections dominating South Africa's political life, virtually any government action could be interpreted as coming within the TEC's authority. Still, the council is unlikely to have the time, the personnel or the experience to intervene in any but the most crucial decisions. Overall, its powers are more negative than positive: it can stop certain things from happening, but cannot initiate action. But some of these 'negative' powers are important: it can veto the deployment of army units to combat political unrest; its assent is necessary to declare a state of emergency; and no foreign loans can be raised without its approval. The TEC will have seven sub-councils, covering law and order, defence, intelligence, finance, regional and local government, foreign affairs, and the status of women. The first three are likely to prove the most important, providing for limited joint control of the security forces in the volatile period before the elections. No state of emergency or period of martial law can be declared without its support, though the Police Board and the Special Electoral Court, respectively, can overrule it in these matters. The TEC itself will comprise one member from each political party or government which participated in the multi-party talks which last month adopted a new constitution. The Afrikaner Volksunie, the right-wing white party has refused to participate in the TEC. So has Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom party who has said that the government of the KwaZulu black homeland, which he heads, will not respect the TEC's authority. Last-minute efforts were made yesterday to get Inkatha and other right-wing parties to accept the new constitution and join the TEC before parliament adopts the constitution finally, sometime before Christmas. But they seem unlikely to do so, raising the prospect of further bloodshed when the TEC tries to impose its authority in homeland areas. The TEC will take decisions by consensus, or by a 75 per cent majority where that fails. Sub-councils will require either a two-thirds majority (finance) or three-quarters (defence, law and order). It is likely to prove a test of the system of consensus decision-making which Mr De Klerk's National party is counting on to prevail in the government of national unity which is due to take office after the elections. The government, virtually isolated on its councils, will be unable to block decisions taken by the majority bloc. The TEC is likely to be dominated by two men: Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ANC, and Mr Roelf Meyer, minister of constitutional development. They know each other well, having met almost daily for months to negotiate the new constitution. Delegates from the South African Communist party, the liberal Democratic party, the ruling National party (which has a separate delegation) and a host of other small black parties will also be represented. The council will sit only until the elections in April.</p>

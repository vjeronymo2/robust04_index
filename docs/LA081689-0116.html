			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Court for American Continental Case: U.S. District Judge Charles Hardy  agreed to oversee portions of American Continental Corp.'s bankruptcy, citing a  conflict in federal laws were the case to have been left wholly with the  Bankruptcy Court. The conflict stems from the issue of whether Chapter 11 laws  under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code supersede or are subject to Title 12 laws, which  govern banking institutions, said Phillip Mitchell, an attorney for several  secured creditors. Hardy's decision moves the bankruptcy cases involving the  Phoenix-based holding company and 11 subsidiaries of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  in Irvine to federal court from Bankruptcy Court.  </P></p>

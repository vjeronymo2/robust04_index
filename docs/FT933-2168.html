			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / National Bank of Yugoslavia to issue 10bn dinar note The National Bank of Yugoslavia is to issue a 10bn dinar note to replace currency made almost worthless by a devastating daily inflation rate of 20 per cent, Reuter reports from Belgrade. The new white, black and red note will be issued today, the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug quoted central bank officials as saying. It is worth Dollars 6 on Belgrade's foreign currency black market. This will be the third new banknote issued in a month, each with more and more zeroes to it. In mid-August the bank issued a 500m dinar note then worth Dollars 3.50 and now worth 30 US cents.</p>

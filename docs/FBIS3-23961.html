			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA correspondent Vladimir </F> Androsenko: "The Moscow Chokehold Around Kolyma's Neck"]    [Text] Magadan--It turns out that there has not been,  nor is there now in our government, anyone more preoccupied with  ideas of social fairness than Ye. Gaydar, leader of Russia's  Choice, and his team. The gap in incomes has made life  unbearable for them. So they wanted to make everyone equal.    True, the excessive wealth detected by the worthy  reformers was not at all in the possession of the latter-day  nouveaux riches, but in the possession  of...Northerners--doctors, teachers, librarians, and  pensioners--who are supposedly receiving enormous sums for  nothing. And they propose only one way of eliminating this  "crying injustice": to take away the northern and regional  coefficients and to make everyone equally indigent.    Yes, it was this very topic that was discussed on 15  December  of last year by Yu. Yarov, E. Pamfilova, and others who had  gathered at Ye. Gaydar's office. In the draft edict of the  president, hastily put together in the bowels of the Ministry of  Finance on instructions from the high-level gathering, this is  directly stated: "The existing system of benefits and  compensations (for Northerners) levels the measures taken by the  president and the Government of the Russian Federation on social  protection of the needy and insufficiently provided-for strata  of society, and it increases the inequality of citizens who are  living in the same climatic conditions and receiving benefits  for the discomfort of their living conditions. A significant  disproportion in incomes of separate strata of the population  has become apparent in the payment of regional coefficients and  percentage wage increases in the regions of the Far North, and  in localities and regions of equal status, where regional  coefficients have been established by legislation currently in  force."    Further, the Council of Ministers is given the instruction:  "In one month's time, prepare the appropriate decision, meaning  the revocation of baseless benefits and compensations, and the  elimination of disproportions in the incomes of separate strata  of the population due to paid benefits and compensations and the  limiting of the total size of payments of regional coefficients  and percentage wage increases to six times the amount of the  minimum monthly wage."    In the regular draft law on the North that is affixed to the  edict, many of the compensations won by the working people have  been revoked (for instance, paid fare to a vacation place once  every two years), and the previous law, which had been worked  out with such assiduity and adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the  Russian Federation, has been, to all practical purposes,  liquidated.    But we shall see what the measures proposed by Ye. Gaydar,  B.  Fedorov, and company (I speak of these people advisedly, for  despite the formal exit of these gentlemen from the government,  it is precisely now that their drafts are being intensively  "forced through") will bring the Far North and its inhabitants.  The edict will concern primarily workers paid from the budget  and workers in subsidized sectors. And to a greater degree,  even, than proposed by the rosy-cheeked fighters for justice.  The point is that in the packet of affixed documents, the  guarantees and compensations are called state ones, although  their carrying out is entrusted to enterprises and  organizations, and also to local budgets. Considering their  disastrous position, it is possible to say straight out:  Compensations will inevitably be curtailed, with the exception,  perhaps, of payments of the above-mentioned sixfold minimum  wages. Will they cover the real needs of northerners?    Today the total sum of the regional coefficients and  northern  supplements in regions of the Far North fluctuate between 150  percent and 200 percent. That is, with the payment of a base  salary of 100,000 rubles [R], the worker is entitled to another  R150,000 or R200,000. Is this a lot or a little?    The cost of food products in Kolyma is seven or eight times  higher than in Moscow, and four times higher than in the Far  East. A loaf of bread, for example, costs R1,500 here; a liter  of milk, R3,000; 10 eggs, R4,000; and a kilogram of meat,  R15,000. The basket of physiological survival--of the minimum  selection of food products capable just barely of sustaining  life--cost R70,000 in Magadan in December, and in the backwoods  of the oblast it cost R120,000.    But after all, a person wants not only to survive, but to  live--to eat, drink, clothe himself, and support his family in  normal fashion. Until now, workers paid from the budget, thanks  to a contrasting replacement of coefficients, have been able to  maintain their not very substantial existence. At the end of  last year their average salary in Chukotka amounted to  R150,000-R180,000, which is already higher than the level that  the Gaydarites propose to establish. But in fact since the new  year, prices, running ahead of the wage increase promised by the  president, surged sharply higher.    The cost of electricity, heating, and hot and cold water is  going up by a factor of five; apartment rents are going up  10-fold. By May, specialists predict an increase in the price of  a liter of milk to R5,000 in Magadan and to R8,000 in Kolyma,  and the price of 10 eggs, to R6,000-R9,000. These prognoses,  without a doubt, will prove justified, for a lack of fodder has  compelled the slaughter of cows and hens--their numbers now  amount to a third of what they were before the reforms. This  means that in the near future we must expect a four- or fivefold  increase in the cost of living, at a minimum.    The rottenest thing about it is that the northerner has  nowhere to go from this hopeless situation. He can no longer go  anywhere from here. Just one ticket, for instance, from Susuman  to Novosibirsk costs half a million rubles. And with all one's  household things--R3-4 million. Whereas according to the latest  government decree, a person moving away from Kolyma can receive  for his vacated housing only 10 minimum wages for every year  worked. That is, for 20 years of northern work, a person is  entitled to an amount that is insufficient even to pay for his  freight.    And such a "good life" brings down on northerners the  accusation of extravagance. Oh Lord, what is it that makes those  in power hate their own people so?    The Magadan association of trade unions called on the  citizens of Kolyma actively to oppose the adoption of these  acts. "The main thing here is not to allow the signing by the  president of the draft edict prepared by the Ministry of  Finance," says the chairman of the association, A. Makhankov.  "The draft law must be discussed in the Federal Assembly, where  it will inevitably be voted down. But the edict, having become a  fait accompli, will make the defense of northerners' vital  interests immeasurably more difficult."    And that is why rallies are being held at enterprises in the  oblast, and an appeal is being drafted to the government and the  president, protesting against the new infringement of the rights  of northerners.    A fundamentally different attitude toward these events is  being expressed by the oblast administration. "Inflaming popular  opinion, the trade unions are pursuing their own political  ends," believes its head, V. Mikhaylov. "No one has come to  discuss these documents with us by the official channels, and  therefore we cannot believe just any conjecturings." In other  words, the administration considers what is happening to be  merely provocation on the part of the trade unions, resting on  no real grounds.    The administration is playing games. The trade unions  provided it with copies of the documents put "into production"  by the Gaydarites.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Bingham calls for more appeal judges Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, told the Bar conference in London over the weekend that more judges were urgently needed in the Appeal Court to tackle the 'serious ills of expense and delay' which dog the civil justice system. England's most senior civil court judge said six more appeal court judges were needed immediately 'otherwise delays (in hearing civil appeals) will become quite unacceptable'. Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the Bar, attacked the government for delay in setting up the new independent review body on miscarriages of justice recommended by last year's Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.</p>

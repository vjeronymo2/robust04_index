			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Royal Foods reveals fresh details of Del Monte deal ROYAL Foods, the South African foods group, has published further information about its planned Pounds 360m (Dollars 565.2m) acquisition of Del Monte Foods International (DMFI), the canned fruit and juices company, following criticism in the South African media about poor disclosure. The funding requirement of about R2.4bn (Dollars 827m) will be raised by the issue of new shares in Royal Foods (Royfood), in its parent Royal Corp and in its ultimate holding company Royal Group Holding - known as Royhold. The new shares will be placed with the shareholders of Royhold. These are the Imerman Control Consortium (ICC), which has committed a minimum of R30m, Anglo American Corporation, which has committed R400m and institutional shareholders. ICC, which is the family vehicle for Mr Vivian Imerman, executive chairman of Royal Corp and driving force behind the acquisition, and Anglo have agreed they will each hold 30 per cent of Royhold - ICC previously held 77 per cent. Royhold and Royal Corp shares are being placed at 950 cents per share and Royfood at 925 cents. Their last traded price prior to the announcement were 900, 950 and 875 cents respectively. Although some local analysts believe the Pounds 360m price to be steep, local institutions are expected to support the share placing because, with assets and earnings in hard currencies, DMFI offers a much sought after rand hedge element to South African investors. Royal Foodshas reported a 58 per cent rise in earnings per share for the 12 months to end-August. Earnings rose to 36.2 cents from 22.9 cents in the 18 months to end-August 1991. Earnings for the six months to end-August 1992 were 32 per cent higher than for the same period in 1991.</p>

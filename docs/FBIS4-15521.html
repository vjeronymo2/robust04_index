			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldovan Deputy Defense Minister Brigadier General  Tudor Dabija told INTERFAX that Russia would never be allowed to  have army bases in Moldova. In Dabija's view, Yeltsin's decision  to create army bases in Commonwealth republics was out of  keeping with the Moldovan military doctrine.    The Moldovan and Russian military could negotiate only one  issue, Dabija said, the full withdrawal of Russia's 14th Army  from Moldovan soil.    On 7 April, however, the eighth round of Russian-Moldovan  negotiations was held in Kishinev [Chisinau]. A draft agreement  was initialled on the legal status and reciprocal legal aid in  cases related to the temporary presence of Russian Army units on  Moldovan territory.    The Moldovan and Russian delegations signed a few other  documents to decide how they would schedule Russian troop  withdrawal and the removal of Russian army property from Moldova.    They failed to agree on deadlines for the Russian troop  withdrawal, but agreed to meet again in May.</p>

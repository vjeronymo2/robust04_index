			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No large illegal movement of Bangladeshis Sir, Thank you for your survey on Bangladesh (May 9) focusing on Bangladesh's march towards the 21st century and for Sheila Jones's article, 'When the Ganges runs dry', on the 'life-and death crisis' of Bangladesh trying to get its share of the Ganges water denied it by its big neighbour, India. However, I would point out one slip in this article. Without attributing any sources, Sheila Jones writes that 'the only pressure on Delhi is the illegal movement of about 10m Bangladeshis across the border in the past 20 years'. This is not correct. We emphatically say that there has not been any illegal movement of people, not to mention the huge number of people Sheila Jones suggests were moving to India to 'escape poverty in Bangladesh'. The unilateral withdrawal of Ganges water by India has brought about drought, ecological imbalance and demographic changes in Bangladesh causing misery to millions of people. Shehabuddin Ahmed, Minister (press), High Commission for the People's Republic of Bangladesh, 28 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW7 5JA</p>

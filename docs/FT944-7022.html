			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rothmans ahead of City forecasts with 18% rise A recovery in French cigarette prices and fast growth in Asia helped Rothmans International beat City forecasts with an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 233.4m to Pounds 275.9m for the six months to September 30. Its European market share was down marginally, continuing a long-term decline because of dependence on local brands and Virginia blend cigarettes rather than international brands and American blends. Lord Swaythling, chairman, said market share was beginning to stabilise thanks in part to the success of Golden America, an American blend cigarette launched in several countries over the past two years. European operating profits rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 70m (Pounds 48.7m) on sales up 6 per cent at Pounds 539.9m. After a price war in France last year, prices and demand improved in the latest period. UK sales rose from the previous year which had been distorted by two Budgets. The first costs savings from a European rationalisation programme announced in June were only just beginning to flow through by the close of the period, analysts estimated. Profits from the Americas, predominantly Canada, fell from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 49.8m although they had grown in local currency terms. Asian profits rose to Pounds 59.6m (Pounds 46.1m) while Pacific profits fell to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 29.3m) because of a price war in Australian and New Zealand and increased marketing costs. Rothmans' worldwide cigarette volumes rose slightly. The main gains were in Japan and the UK. Sales revenue rose by 4.3 per cent to Pounds 1.27bn. The interim dividend of 7.5p per unit will reduce net cash generated to Pounds 86.1m (Pounds 184.5m). Last time it paid no dividend because of payments associated with the capital restructuring of Rothmans and Dunhill, its sister company. Earnings per unit were 19.7p (17.2p). Lord Swaythling reiterated the board's commitment to invest only cash generated in tobacco and in due course to give any surplus to shareholders. The largest is the Rupert family with a 61 per cent stake. The units rose 17p to 440p. COMMENT Rothmans' caution on buying brands in emerging markets such as eastern Europe have made it look conservative compared with Philip Morris and BAT Industries. Its willingness to invest, preferably in greenfield projects and Asia, is not in doubt but will take years to pay off. Meanwhile, the bottom line will benefit from the fruits of European cost cutting. Full-year profits of about Pounds 555m are possible for earnings of 39p and a prospective p/e of 11. This rates the shares slightly above BAT and Morris but there is the attraction long term of a big pay-out to shareholders.</p>

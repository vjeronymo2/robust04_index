			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 14 April  1994 carries on page 2 under the headline "Russia Has a Neutron  Bomb the Size of a Small Ball, British TV Reporters Claim" a  250-word REUTER report, which begins as follows: "Journalists  from Britain's Channel 4 Television have carried out an  investigation and concluded that Russian scientists have  invented a miniature neutron bomb the size of a baseball. The  device was developed using so-called `red mercury.'" The report  goes on to give further details and concludes with the following  note "from the Editorial Office":    "IZVESTIYA's correspondent Nikolay Burbyga turned for an  explanation to ministries and departments involved with  armaments. "`Needless to say, we have some secret developments  [razrabotki],' the Russian Defense Ministry reported, `but what  the British TV reporters are claiming is completely absurd -- it  is shameful to even comment on it.'    "Equally categorical answers were obtained at the Kurchatov  Institute. Specialists connected with future scientific arms  developments claimed: `People have been talking about "red  mercury" for a long time. But nobody has even seen it or  "touched" it, because substances with these characteristics  simply do not exist in nature....'"    Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0956 GMT on 15 April, in a  Mirniy (Arkhangelsk region)-datelined report by ITAR-TASS  correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin, adds: "Reports about a `new  Russian miniature bomb', allegedly developed with the use of  `red mercury', are absolutely groundless," ITAR-TASS was told  today by Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the state  testing ground of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces. "Russia  is not making or testing new types of nuclear weapons," he  stressed.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ATOMIC PLAYBOYS IN THE LAND OF DISENCHANTMENT  </P> <P> Opening a show with Led Zep-pelin's classic "Communication Breakdown" can be  heard either as an act of bravery (it ain't easy takin' on the Mighty Zep) or a  means of setting an appropriate tone (we're gonna thrash this sucker) for the  evening. In the strange case of Steve Stevens Atomic Playboys' show at the Roxy  on Wednesday, all it proved was that the former Billy Idol  guitarslinger-turned-frontman can put together a unit that's at least as good  as any other bar band.  </P> <P> Padded with a spectacularly ill-chosen James Brown selection ("It's a Man's  Man's Man's World") and an OK version of the Sweet's glamrocka "Action" (the  latter also found on the quintet's recent album debut), the hour-plus set slid  slickly into the Land of Disenchantment. Stevens spewed up hot licks like a  malevolent rock 'n' roll Cuisinart, but none of 'em connected into anything  resembling an indelible melody or a memorable song.  </P> <P> Having a charisma-free vocalist is no help, either. Interestingly, the one song  that Stevens himself sang -- in a rough-hewn, offhanded but not unprofessional  manner -- lent one of the few glimmers of personality to the proceedings.

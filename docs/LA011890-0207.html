			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION PLAN RUNS INTO DELAY;  </P> <P> PLANNED PARENTHOOD: ORGANIZATION CAN'T FIND DOCTORS TO PERFORM THE SERVICES IT  WANTS TO PROVIDE TO ITS CLIENTS.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood, which three weeks ago announced plans to begin offering  abortions in Orange County, cannot find a local physician to perform them and  now has extended its search beyond the county's borders, officials said.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood plans to offer abortions, probably in its Santa Ana  facility, as soon as the group's leaders are able to hire doctors to perform  them.  </P> <P> However, the organization has had difficulty finding local doctors to both  perform abortions and provide prenatal care to expectant mothers, Margie Fites  Seigle, executive director of Planned Parenthood in Orange County, said in an  interview Wednesday.  </P> <P> She emphasized that the new abortion service is not the sole reason for the  difficult search.  </P> <P> "We're having a hard time finding physicians to do both services," Seigle said.  </P> <P> Part of the problem in recruiting doctors is that physicians are reluctant to  be regarded as representatives of a high-profile advocacy organization, she  said.  </P> <P> "Doctors basically become advocates when they work at Planned Parenthood. Not  all physicians choose to be advocates," Seigle said.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood's unsuccessful search does not mean that abortion services  are becoming less available in Orange County, Seigle said.  </P> <P> "We have not heard of people having a problem in getting an abortion in Orange  County. There are a number of clinics that provide them and a number of doctors  who perform them in the county," Seigle said.  </P> <P> But a spokeswoman for an anti-abortion organization took heart in Planned  Parenthood's difficult search.  </P> <P> "I hope their lack of success (in recruiting physicians) means that Orange  County doctors respect life too much to be paid to kill unborn life," said Beth  Cielnicky, president of Crusade for Life, an anti-abortion organization based  in Anaheim.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman from Operation Rescue in Southern California, an anti-abortion  activist group, said the organization has not heard of doctors in Orange County  dropping abortion services because of protests.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, doctors may be less keen to perform abortions in light of highly  visible protests by anti-abortion groups that have picketed clinics providing  such a service, said Dr. Roger Schlesinger, president of the Obstetrics and  Gynecology Society of Orange County. Schlesinger does not perform abortions in  his own practice.  </P> <P> Physicians are concerned that if they perform abortions in clinics, they can  potentially lose patients in their private practice, Schlesinger said. He added  that doctors worry about how they will be viewed by patients or doctors with  opposing views on abortion.  </P> <P> "Performing abortions is alienating. It's not a procedure that is tasteful. You  can't make a career out of doing abortions," Schlesinger said.  </P> <P> According to the most recent statistics gathered by the Alan Guttmacher  Institute, which surveys clinics and hospitals in the United States that  perform abortions, more than 30,000 abortions were performed in Orange County  in 1985.  </P></p>

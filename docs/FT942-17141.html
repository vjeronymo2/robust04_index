			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (10): Victim of its own beauty  -Tourism Lulworth Cove symbolises the pressures of tourism on Dorset. The weird geological formations caused by the sea have made it a magnet for visitors. In consequence, the tidal erosion is matched by tourist erosion. Almost all of Dorset's coastline is designated a heritage coast, and 1,300 sq km of the county are areas of outstanding natural beauty. The seaside resorts, the associations with Thomas Hardy and Lawrence of Arabia, the historic sites such as Corfe Castle, draw 3.4m visitors a year. Many enjoy the county so much that they return again and again. Eighty per cent of visitors to Dorset arrive by car and the dangers are clear. Improved roads to the east make it possible for Londoners to visit on a day trip. Of the estimated 9m day trippers a year, half of them come to the Isle of Purbeck. 'It is only a matter of time before the Isle of Purbeck becomes the victim of its own beauty - unless something is done to save it,' according to Mr Colin Bonsey, chairman of the Purbeck heritage committee which is co-ordinating projects to manage tourism at, for example, Lulworth Cove. The county council gave a similar warning in its tourism strategy for 1993-1995: 'Excessive tourist activity or insensitive development will damage the quality of life for Dorset's residents and will compromise the very real qualities which attract its many visitors.' Yet the industry is vital to the county, employing about 24,000 people. As elsewhere, the recession has had its impact and spending has suffered. Room occupancy in hotels fell from an average of 51 per cent during 1991 to 49 per cent in 1992, although self-catering flats and cottages saw a rise from 51 per cent to 55 per cent. In all, tourism is worth about Pounds 540m a year to the county. Staying visitors generate a much higher proportion of that income than the day trippers. While the latter add to congestion on the roads, their average daily expenditure was only Pounds 11 a head in 1992, compared with Pounds 26 for those who stay for one night or more. Yet the traditional staying visitor, enjoying a fortnight's summer holiday, will inevitably become a scarcer breed in the resorts of Bournemouth, Poole, Weymouth, Swanage and Lyme Regis. One answer is to have more all-weather attractions to extend the season. An example is Poole Pottery, with its new factory shop, pottery tour and restaurant with a harbour view. Bovington tank museum, which has 300 armoured vehicles, will be one of the places where there will be a plethora of activities this summer to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-day. Events such as these, and the tall ships race starting from Weymouth this year, help to stimulate tourism. But it is the higher spenders which Dorset needs to woo if it is to maintain its income without increasing the pressures. A handicap in winning such trade has been that the promotion of Dorset was fragmented, with councils developing their own policies and the county split between two separate tourist boards; Southern and West Country. To improve co-ordination and marketing, the county council set up a Dorset Tourism unit, and a data project has been collating the information to develop strategy. Mr Barry Wilbraham, county tourism officer, believes Dorset needs to encourage a different type of tourist - one who wants to stay in the county and look at the heritage (which includes more than 30 hill forts and nearly 2,000 barrows). He wants more 'green', activity-based, special interest and short-break tourism inland away from the congested coast. He points out that there are 34 golf courses and planning consents for more. And, he adds, 'What is coming through loud and clear is that growth in income can come from overseas markets.' Dorset, despite its direct ferry links with France and relative closeness to the international gateway of London, fails to see many foreigners. Of staying visitors, only 5.8 per cent come from European countries and 2.2 per cent from countries outside Europe, mainly North America and Australia. Mr Wilbraham adds: 'I want to be able to offer a truly international destination where people want to come because of our rich heritage.' A Destination Dorset committee is targeting more travellers from continental Europe, and has identified Scandinavia as offering the highest potential. One imaginative scheme to raise the international profile is a Sea Gardens project in Bournemouth. This is envisaged as a series of gardens and pavilions with shops and restaurants, linked by monorail for 2.4km along the sea front as a permanent world trade exhibition, sponsored by participating nations. Cheshire Robbins, the project's design group, says confidently: 'Sea Gardens will provide one of the largest weather-protected landscaped environments in the UK.' An existing asset for encouraging international and business travel is Bournemouth's conference centre, which has done much to extend the town's season. The resort has a quarter of the county's hotels and more than 30,000 beds. The centre, opened in 1984 and enlarged in 1990, is in direct competition with Brighton, Blackpool and Harrogate for business. A Pounds 400,000 project this year will result in more meeting rooms. During the recession, the centre has managed to maintain the number of events at between 46 and 52 a year - including the Conservative party conference this autumn - but it has seen fewer delegates. Mrs Susan Davies, exhibitions manager, says: 'I don't see the trend changing  -companies want to get value for money. But we have found organisers are introducing more features to make them interesting - they are investing more in the conferences to attract decision-makers.' The centre has acted as a stimulus for other conference and seminar venues - 26 hotels with in-house facilities have set up a group called Conference Bournemouth. The trade could be encouraged further if Bournemouth airport's new scheduled services are successful. Mrs Davies, pointing out that the average delegate spends Pounds 76 a day in the town, says: 'The effect on the local economy of the conference trade cannot be overestimated.'</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEX AND SINGING  </P> <P> Why, in his positive review of the Lisa Stansfield concert (May 26), does Chris  Willman include the comments she "can't dance to save her life" and she doesn't  have "overwhelming" sex appeal.  </P> <P> Stansfield's performance isn't built around dancing -- so what? She chose a  neutral outfit that doesn't distract from her explosive vocal performance -- so  what? Such comments only serve to perpetuate the destructive cliche --  engendered by MTV -- that a female singer must wrap her talent in cheap  sexuality and innuendo.  </P> <P> BARBARA L. GALLEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown steps up efforts for constitutional reform - Liberal Democrats MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday stepped up his efforts to change Britain's political system - saying reforms would be 'at the heart' of the party's election strategy. Launching a campaign intended to raise the constitution as an issue, Mr Ashdown emphasised that if Liberal Democrats were to form a post-election pact in a hung parliament it would have to involve two parties working 'in government'. This was Mr Ashdown's strongest hint yet that his party is seeking at least one ministerial post. He believes two parties working together would change the culture of British politics and be popular with voters. Liberal Democrats are also proposing home rule for Scotland, a bill of rights and a freedom of information act. Mr Ashdown confirmed that in all 'foreseeable circumstances' he would vote against a government on the Queen's speech - which sets out legislation for the new parliament - if it did not back a fairer election system. That could trigger a second general election. He also wants agreement on a four-year programme of government. Party strategists have deliberately not specified which ministerial posts they would want, possibly reflecting a fear that too much speculation about tactics would distract from main campaign themes. However, the party has decided to make clear its basic position for a hung parliament. Mr Ashdown would not commit himself to voting automatically against a government that did not support proportional representation - in case external factors meant it would not be in the national interest. He also made clear that Liberal Democrats would be prepared to negotiate with other parties on some of their demands, saying he should be allowed at the time to decide 'what stroke to play'.</p>

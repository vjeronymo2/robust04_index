			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: URGENT TIMES FOR EMERGENCY CENTERS  </P> <P> Have you ever been to an emergency-medicine center? The answer for many of us  is yes. We may have been there when we became ill after our doctor's office  closed, when we broke a bone, were in a car accident or had a heart attack.  </P> <P> Most of us assume that when we need such care it will be available. Aren't  emergency services a public obligation?  </P> <P> It seems, however, that the public is not paying enough attention to the  emergency-care system nationally, and serious cracks are now evident. Recent  articles in the New York Times have spotlighted efforts to unclog overcrowded  emercency centers. And reports in the Wall Street Journal have examined  hospital "dumping" practices: Each year, 250,000 emergency patients are  transferred to other hospitals for economic, not medical, reasons.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times chronicled a series of permanent and temporary shutdowns  of county emergency centers here. This sent paramedic units scurrying from one  hospital to another. The cause is the inability of hospitals to absorb the  costs of treating indigent patients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greater Effect on Elderly  </P> <P> The strains on emergency-care facilities may jeopardize the health of anyone in  need of urgent attention. One group that should be of special concern is older  persons. The elderly represent a greater percentage of the population than at  any time in history, and emergency centers are treating more older adults. The  elderly are at risk because they often have multiple illnesses that interact  and complicate treatment.  </P> <P> Moreover, older patients do not always seek care even when they have major  symptoms. This delay may lead to late diagnosis and poor outcomes, according to  Dr. Richard Besdine of the University of Connecticut.  </P> <P> Despite increasing numbers of elders, the system is not yet accommodating  itself to this reality. Most emergency nurses, physicians and trauma  technicians have little training in geriatrics. A survey of three  paramedic-training centers in Los Angeles found that only one school offered  any geriatric content -- a one-hour lecture.  </P> <P> While there are myriad issues facing emergency medical care, one is how to  better care for the growing number of older persons who will make use of the  emergency system.  </P> <P> Question: My wife and I retired and moved to an adults-only condominium in  Florida in 1980. We have nothing against children, but prefer to live with  adults who have similar interests. A rumor is sweeping our complex that a new  law will allow families with young children to live here. Can you tell us about  it?  </P> <P> Answer: In mid-March, legislation went into effect that may have an impact on  communities such as yours. The new law, an amendment to the federal Fair  Housing Act, seeks to prevent most communities from banning children. The law  applies to rental units and condominiums, and is sure to raise legal challenges  across the country.  </P> <P> According to the new law, children can be barred from a development under two  provisions: if all the residents are 62 years of age or older, or if at least  80% of the units are occupied by one person 55 years or older and the property  has special facilities for older people.  </P> <P> There is sure to be an increase in lawsuits over the legislation. Your  homeowners association should explore the new law with a lawyer.  </P> <P> Q: My parents moved to Hilton Head, S.C., in 1976, when my father retired from  a Massachusetts advertising firm. They made friends in their new-found home and  pursued bridge and golf.  </P> <P> My father died three years ago and my mother maintained her home and life style  with dignity. Recently, she decided to return to Massachusetts and spend the  rest of her life near her family. How will she readjust to living in the  Northeast?  </P> <P> A: According to data from the Census Bureau, researchers at the University of  Florida believe that the migration of older people to Southern states may have  peaked. In the period when your parents retired (between 1975 and 1980), more  than 3% of all elderly Northeast residents who moved headed south. This fell to  2% between 1980 and 1985.  </P> <P> Many of these people moved to take advantage of the relatively inexpensive cost  of living the South offers and the agreeable climate. Many have grown old in  their new homes, and states such as Florida consequently have a significant  percentage of people 75 years and older.  </P> <P> On the other hand, your mother is not alone in seeking to return. A number of  people, particularly widows and widowers, choose to live near loved ones. Your  mother sounds as if she is active, and you should anticipate no major traumas,  particularly since this is her choice.  </P> <P> We suggest your mother look for an apartment that has the advantages of modern  technology, no stairs and a location near public transportation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Send questions about growing older to On Aging, P.O.

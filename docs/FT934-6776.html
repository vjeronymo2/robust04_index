			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens plans share issue Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to bolster its balance sheet through a Fl 373.5m (Dollars 196.5m) issue of new shares, expanding the loss-making company's capital base by 37 per cent. The transaction involves a series of offers to Dutch and foreign institutions, retail investors and the Dutch state, which will take up nearly a third of the new shares. After the closure of the offers, which are being lead-managed by ABN Amro and SG Warburg Securities, the Dutch government's stake in Hoogovens will rise to around 17.1 per cent from 12.3 per cent currently. However, Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, noted that this will bring ownership of Hoogovens by public authorities back to the level that prevailed until July, when the City of Amsterdam sold off its 5 per cent stake to domestic and foreign institutional investors. Mr van Veen said Hoogovens had decided against holding a rights issue because it wanted to raise the maximum amount possible. If it had opted for a rights issue, it would have had to offer a discount to the market price. The price of the new shares, to be fixed by December 3, is expected to be roughly equal to the company's price on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of Fl 45, the issue would be worth Fl 373.5m. Yesterday, Hoogovens' shares fell by Fl 2.50 to Fl 42.50. Hoogovens' share price has doubled since March, helped by keen interest from foreign investors and foreign stockbroking firms.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> TRASH STUDY APPROVED  </P> <P> Faced with the annual disposal of 140,000 tons of trash and the uncertainty of  the continued use of Scholl Canyon Landfill in Glendale, the Board of Directors  on Tuesday approved spending $50,000 to study whether a solid waste transfer  station should be built in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Such stations exist in 63 locales in Los Angeles County. Refuse is transferred  from garbage trucks to semitrailers or rail cars for trips to distant  landfills. The study will analyze the amount of land needed, possible sites,  alternatives and costs. In addition, the study will address combining a  transfer station with on-site separation of recyclable waste.  </P></p>

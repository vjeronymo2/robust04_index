			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / IG Metall's chief comes out fighting GERMANY'S engineering workers at the weekend set themselves on a collision course with their employers, as the new leader of IG Metall, the country's largest trade union, ordered his members to prepare for a strike next year. Mr Klaus Zwickel, confirmed in the most powerful union position in the land, picked up the gauntlet thrown down by the engineering employers last week when they unilaterally served notice of termination of current pay and holiday contracts in the 4m-strong industry. 'Agitation is now our first responsibility,' he declared to the extraordinary union congress, summoned to elect a successor to Mr Franz Steinkuhler, who resigned over allegations of insider dealing. 'We must prepare immediately for strikes and lockouts in any form.' And yet the union response to the employers appears to be dictated more in sorrow than anger, as top officials made it clear they did not want open confrontation at a time of recession and drastic job cuts. They accused Gesamtmetall, the employers' organisation, of bowing to the aggressive instincts of their small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, who are being squeezed by rising costs and falling order books. Mr Zwickel rejected a call by employers for preliminary talks on the forthcoming wage round, even before formal claims have been submitted in each region. He warned that the union would be 'mercilessly tough' if employers insisted on pressing for real cuts in pay and holiday bonuses. 'Gesamtmetall has determined on a course of confrontation,' he said. 'Their termination of the wage contracts makes a mockery of the social state.' Yet at the same time his address was a passionate defence of the German tradition of social partnership and consensus, suggesting an understanding of the sharp downturn in the country's engineering, electrical and motor industries, and a willingness to seek a common union-management response. Job security was the union's highest priority, Mr Zwickel said, and he called for a national moratorium on further job cuts. The union was not intending to seek any pay rise beyond the likely increase in prices and productivity in 1994. He agreed that short-time working, and any other forms of voluntary cuts in working hours, should be used to protect jobs. The 3.25m-strong engineering workers' union - still reeling from the shock resignation of Mr Steinkuhler, job losses in the sector running at 30,000 a month, and a 10 per cent loss in its membership since 1991 - closed ranks at the congress, with more than 90 per cent supporting Mr Zwickel's election. His deputy, Mr Walter Riester, the Stuttgart regional union leader responsible for negotiating the final wage deal in the industry for the past three years, won 88.5 per cent. The one moment of anxiety for the leadership came when a delegate from Wuppertal sought to nominate Mr Steinkuhler as leader once again, insisting his resignation should not have been accepted. Mr Steinkuhler strode up to the rostrum and graciously declined to accept the nomination, to the relief of the entire platform and a good part of the delegates. 'History cannot be turned back,' he said. See Observer</p>

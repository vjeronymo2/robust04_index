			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L CLEANUP ESTIMATE RISES TO $500 BILLION  </P> <P> The economic slowdown is likely to increase the bill for cleaning up the  savings and loan mess to about $500 billion, the head of the General Accounting  Office said Thursday.  </P> <P> Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general and head of the congressional watchdog  agency, cited the growing threat of a recession and the collapse of the junk  bond market in offering his sober assessment of the likely cost to taxpayers.  </P> <P> Last spring, Bowsher had estimated that there was an outside chance that the  costs would reach the half-trillion-dollar level. Thursday, for the first time,  he said that figure is the likely final bill for the cleanup.  </P> <P> "The recession and the junk bond collapse are both contributing to the fact  that the costs keep creeping up on you," Bowsher told reporters after appearing  before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> Bowsher also joined a growing chorus of experts both in and out of government  who have called on federal regulators to move more quickly to sell off the real  estate and other properties held by the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency that  has taken on the assets of hundreds of failed thrifts bailed out by the  government.  </P> <P> Bowsher warned that if the federal government tries to hold on to some real  estate to avoid flooding the market at a time of depressed prices, the  properties held by the RTC will deteriorate and rapidly lose even more of their  value.  </P> <P> "If you don't move these assets, the costs will keep getting higher," he said.  </P> <P> The economic slump not only will make it more difficult for the government to  sell off properties held by the RTC, but also could lead to more S&amp;L  failures.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the collapse of the junk bond market will also increase the  government's costs because many of the non-real estate assets held by the RTC  are junk bonds bought by failed S&amp;Ls. Those assets will now be worth even  less than federal regulators initially had expected.  </P></p>

Two people were killed in Microryan district, the scene of  some of the worst fighting last week, sources said, while others  reported that fighting also resumed around noon Sunday (0730  GMT) in Kabul's volatile southeastern districts.    The fresh fighting ended an exodus of civilians from the  capital who had been taking advantage of a 24-hour ceasefire  which officially expired at 6.00 a.m. but had held for several  more hours, sources said.    It also came as some 65 diplomats, United Nations personnel  and some foreign nationals reached the northwestern Pakistani  city of Peshawar from Kabul.    The diplomats include Iranians, Libyans, Indians, Turkish,  Somalians and Palestinians who temporarily closed their missions  in the Afghan capital.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BODYBUILDERS OF YESTERDAY SALUTE FIRST SITE OF FAMED MUSCLE BEACH  </P> <P> Muscle men of yore joined younger acrobats Sunday on the sands of Santa Monica  to dedicate a plaque marking the original site of Muscle Beach, hailed by some  as the birthplace of today's physical fitness fanaticism. Bodybuilders started  working out on a platform just south of the Santa Monica Pier in the mid-1940s,  but the site was closed 30 years ago.  </P> <P> While Venice now lays claim to the title of Muscle Beach, a group of the  ever-faithful -- including exercise guru Jack LaLanne and Steve (Hercules)  Reeves -- fought to have the Santa Monica site remembered. The Muscle Beach  Alumni Assn. sought and obtained approval for the 2-by-3-foot sign erected  Sunday. Among those on hand were LaLanne, flexing his muscles, and George  Sunby, with microphone.  </P> <P> "Muscle Beach was like a Roman holiday," said George Eiferman, a former Mr.  America who was one of a group of muscle men who joined Mae West in a Las Vegas  review in the 1950s. "We'll never have that again."  </P></p>

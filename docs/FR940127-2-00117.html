			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 17A of the Act provides that a clearing agency must be organized and its rules designed to assure the safeguarding of funds and securities which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  As discussed below, the Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with these objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC's proposal responds to the events surrounding the default of an OCC clearing member on October 13, 1989. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The defaulting clearing member carried in a combined market-makers' account the positions of an associated market-maker and the positions of approximately 160 unaffiliated market-makers. One person owned 100% of both the defaulting clearing member and the associated market-maker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed discussion of the events surrounding the clearing member default, refer to Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989, A Report by the Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (December 1990), 158&hyph;60 and 164&hyph;66.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the precipitous decline in the markets on Friday, October 13, 1987, OCC issued an intraday margin call to the defaulting clearing member whose settlement bank informed OCC that it would neither honor OCC's intraday margin call nor extend further credit to the defaulting clearing member. In an effort to cure the default, OCC directed the defaulting clearing member to transfer the positions in its accounts, particularly positions that were carried for unaffiliated market-makers and customers, to another OCC clearing member. Because the associated market-maker's positions were commingled with those of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account, OCC was unable to distinguish the collateral relating to the associated market-maker's positions from the collateral relating to the unaffiliated market-makers' positions in the account. Consequently, OCC was required to direct the defaulting clearing member to transfer all of the positions in its combined market-makers' account. Although this did not preclude the transfer, it did make the transfer of the non-proprietary positions more difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that OCC's proposal will enhance OCC's clearing member monitoring and risk management capabilities in several respects. As an initial matter, the Commission notes that OCC's current market-maker account structure permits clearing members to mask proprietary activity by forming associated market-makers and combining the positions of such market-makers with those of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account. Although OCC can separate the positions of the associated market-makers from those of unaffiliated market-makers, the present account structure can complicate OCC's monitoring of clearing member positions. Currently, before OCC can assess the positions under a clearing member's control, OCC must separate associated market-makers' positions from unaffiliated market-makers' positions and then must combine the associated market-makers' positions with the clearing member's positions. By requiring the associated market-makers' positions to be maintained apart from the unaffiliated market-makers' positions, OCC's proposal should enhance its ability to monitor the positions of its clearing members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also should enhance OCC's risk management capabilities by providing OCC with a more accurate representation of clearing members' financial condition. Generally, there are two levels of capital supporting the trading and positions of a clearing member's market-maker. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  However, as the above-described clearing member default illustrates, this may not be the case when a clearing member carriers the account of an associated market-maker because the clearing member and the associated market-maker may be relying on the same sources of financing to support their trading activities. Thus, by requiring that associated market-maker hold their positions either in a separate account or is a proprietary market-maker's account, OCC's proposal should provide OCC with a more accurate picture of its sources of exposure and the financial ability of a particular firm to cover such exposure in the event of a clearing member default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> I.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , the capital of the clearing member and the capital of the market-makers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal also should enhance OCC's ability to administer a clearing member's account in the event of the clearing member's default. If the financial or operational condition of a clearing member makes it necessary or advisable for the protection of OCC or other clearing members, OCC has the authority to direct a clearing member to transfer some or all of its accounts to another clearing member. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  However, if associated market-maker's positions are held with the positions of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account, as in the situation described above, OCC may experience difficulty in separating the collateral supporting the associated market-maker's positions from the collateral supporting the positions of the unaffiliated market-makers' positions thereby making the transfer of unaffiliated market-makers' positions difficult if not impossible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> OCC Rule 305.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to Section 19(b) (2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;90&hyph;11) be, and hereby is, approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1676 Filed 1&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

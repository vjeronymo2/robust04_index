			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Ex-wife's right to money upheld The Court of Appeal yesterday paved the way to dividing personal pension rights on divorce when it rejected an appeal brought by a husband, Mr Brooks, to prevent some of his pension being transferred to his former wife. Mr Norman Russell of Paisner &amp; Co, solicitors acting for the ex-wife, said that the decision went further than a High Court judgment in April 1993 which upheld a district judge's order to vary Mr Brooks' pension fund as a result of his divorce after 12 years of marriage. The High Court judgment maintained that Mr Brooks' pension fund fell within the definition of a 'post-nuptial settlement'. Divorce law gives courts the power to vary the terms of a post-nuptial settlement, therefore allowing Mr Brooks' pension to be varied in his ex-wife's favour. The High Court decision was widely regarded as applicable only in circumstances similar to those of the case, which involved a self-administered pension scheme with a surplus. Yesterday's decision appeared to have much wider application, although the Court of Appeal's ruling that a pension could not be varied if a third party is involved eliminates application of the judgment to company schemes. The appeal was rejected in a 2-1 decision in which Lord Justices Neill and Waite rejected the appeal while Lord Justice Hoffmann upheld it. Lord Waite said that, because private pensions 'are too numerous and too varied to be treated empirically as a class', courts should examine arrangements to decide whether the act of a spouse joining a scheme involved creation of a post-nuptial settlement and whether the scheme should be varied by the court. No one at Girling, Mr Brooks' solicitors, was available for comment but an appeal to the House of Lords is thought likely. Mr Robin Ellison of Hammond Suddards, pension solicitors, and a member of the pensions and divorce working group of the Pensions Management Institute, said: 'If it is upheld in the House of Lords it will make personal pensions a less attractive bet for husbands than company schemes.'</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Clinton supports Mideast bank President Bill Clinton has committed the US to support the creation of a Middle East development bank and announced fresh US aid, as part of an increasing programme of financial support intended to underwrite Arab-Israeli peace. The US president yesterday also pledged to maintain the level of US economic and military aid to Israel at Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) a year, and continue helping the Jewish state keep a strategic military edge over its neighbours to 'build a peace that will bring with it the safety and security Israel deserves'. In a speech to the Jordanian parliament, Mr Clinton gave his administration's first public backing to the creation of a regional development bank to channel new investment to projects. Mr Clinton pledged his government would take the lead in consultations with regional and other governments to ensure that the development bank, which will probably start with a capital base of Dollars 10bn, was properly structured. Israeli officials promoting the idea of a regional bank said yesterday Mr Clinton's remarks would guarantee its creation and, in effect, over-ruled objections raised by the US Treasury which had put forward an alternative proposal for creation of a special 'window' in the World Bank for Middle East regional projects. Israel wants the US, Europe and Japan to provide 60 per cent of the capital base of the regional development bank with proportional representation on the board of directors and expects a US citizen to be the bank's first president. Mr Clinton also announced that his government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation is establishing a Dollars 75m regional fund to encourage US private-sector investment in joint projects between Israel and Jordan. The US was committed to help Middle East peace makers 'write a real practical future of hope', and ensure that peace delivered real economic benefits to the citizens of the region, he added. 'If people do not feel these benefits, if poverty persists, breeding despair and killing hope, then the purveyors of fear will find fertile ground.' An Israeli official said Mr Clinton's economic announcements showed the US President understood the political rather than purely economic imperative behind creating regional financial institutions. Mr Clinton has underlined during his Middle East tour the vital economic role the US is playing in the peace process. The US, Jordan and Israel have set up an economic commission which has produced a plan to develop the Israel-Jordan rift valley into a 'Valley of Peace' with projects in energy, desalination, tourism, transport, environment and industry. In Jordan, Mr Clinton promised 'actively to pursue practical means of expanding trade and investment'. His administration would develop a bilateral investment treaty, he declared. Washington has already begun writing off Dollars 700m of debt owed by Jordan to the US. Mr Clinton said in Amman he had pledged to forgive all Jordan's US debts. He had called on Jordan's other creditors to follow his lead.</p>

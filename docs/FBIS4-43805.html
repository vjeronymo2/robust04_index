			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Meng: "Uranium Export to Russia </F> Stopped"]    [Text] Wiesbaden, 20 Jun -- Siemens has temporarily  stopped the export of uranium material from the fuel element  factory in Hanau to Tomsk, Russia. On Monday [21 June] Siemens  spokesman Rainer Jend confirmed that the company has declared  its readiness to temporarily renounce any further transports  until "uncertainties" of the German supervisory authorities have  been clarified. Siemens has thus anticipated an order by Hesse  Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens), who intended to  prohibit further deliveries to Tomsk effective immediately.    In May 1993, a contract was concluded with the Russian  company, Tekhsnabexport, for the delivery of 140 tonnes of  "slightly contaminated manufacturing remains" from the  production of uranium-containing fuel elements in the factory in  Hanau. In the past this "uranium scrap" was cleaned in Hanau  itself. Since an explosion in late 1990, this has no longer  been possible. The material, which has accumulated since then,  was now supposed to be reprocessed in Tomsk. Jend said that the  return to Germany of 70 tonnes of reusable enriched uranium  hexafluoride as well as residue suitable for final storage was  envisaged.    In five transports, 49 tonnes of uranium material has  already  been delivered to Russia with the permission of federal  authorities. So far, the Hesse Environment Ministry had, in  vain, demanded detailed information about whether the  reprocessing in the facility in Tomsk, which is suffering from  safety defects, according to German environmentalists, "is done  without detrimental effect on the basis of German law."    A ban by Hesse (without immediate implementation) against  the  so far last transport on 30 May was nullified juridically by a  complaint to the Administrative Court by Siemens. After Hesse  had presented new arguments regarding the composition of the  uranium material to Bonn, the Federal Environment Ministry for  the first time permitted immediate implementation by Hesse in  early June, if Siemens did not voluntarily renounce further  transports for the time being.</p>

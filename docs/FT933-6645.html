			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: CarnaudMetalbox salehits half-year outcome  -Building a new MB-Caradon INTERIM RESULTS from MB-Caradon were hit by the sale for Pounds 467m net of tax and expenses of its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox in April and by competitive trading conditions in some of its markets. However, translation of overseas profits at lower sterling exchange rates boosted pre-tax profits, which, excluding exceptional items, were 2 per cent lower at Pounds 59.5m. Operating profits, which ignore the affect of the CMB sale, rose 20.5 per cent to Pounds 51.2m. Earnings per share fell from 7.6p to 7.2p, excluding exceptional items, because of the dilution from the sale of the CMB stake. Including exceptionals earnings were 24.5p. The interim dividend goes up 3 per cent to 2.83p (2.75p). The CMB stake contributed Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 20.6m) in associate income during the half year to end-June, and the proceeds of the sale reversed an interest charge of Pounds 2.5m to interest receivable of Pounds 3.1m. It also produced an exceptional profit of Pounds 100.3m, against which a Pounds 7m provision was set relating to the restructuring of the UK cheque printing operation. The group, which is changing its name to Caradon, increased turnover by 13.5 per cent to Pounds 368.4m, including Pounds 2.9m of sales from the US Checks in the Mail business bought at the end of May. Turnover from the UK building products division increased 10 per cent to Pounds 205.4m, with volumes up 11 per cent and prices down 1 per cent. Operating profits fell 3 per cent to Pounds 17.3m. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said that pricing was particularly competitive in bathroom products. He said signs of recovery were mixed but this was normal at this stage of the cycle and the group was fairly confident. Overseas building products, largely continental Europe, increased turnover by 18 per cent to Pounds 63.4m, but in local currency terms turnover was static with volumes down 3 per cent and prices up 3 per cent. Operating profits rose 33 per cent to Pounds 10m, again boosted by currency translation. Mr Jansen said business on the Continent held up relatively well, with the German construction industry benefiting from changing social needs. Security printing turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds 99.6m, though in dollar terms the US business increased sales 1 per cent, with volumes up 5 per cent and prices down 4 per cent. Operating profits were 40 per cent higher at Pounds 23.9m, including a Pounds 600,000 contribution from Checks in the Mail.</p>

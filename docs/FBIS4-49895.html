			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev said on Friday [6 May] that he will outline  Russia's new approaches to the "partnership for peace" program  in Brussels on May 24.    At a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry,  Grachev  stressed that Russia should put forth its own idea of  partnership.    A special team of Russian experts is to draw up proposals on  this score before May 15, the minister said, adding that the  proposals will be discussed by the Russian Security Council.    If approved, the new idea will be read out by Grachev before  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defense ministers  at the NATO headquarters in Brussels.    The minister told reporters that he had discussed the new  Russian proposals concerning the "partnership for peace" program  with President Boris Yeltsin.    He stressed that some provisions of the NATO's program do  not  suit Russia. "The role of NATO and the West European Union is  growing in Europe, but they have no right to...overlook the  interests of Russia," the minister pointed out.    At the news conference, Grachev also noted that the planned  joint Russian-U.S. peace-making exercises on the Totsk testing  ground near Orenburg should take place. He disagrees with the  Russian state Duma's view that they should be cancelled.    Touching upon Russia's armed forces, the minister said they  are confronted with three main problems which must be solved.  The problems include the financing of the military  establishment, the army's manning status and the accommodation  of troops withdrawn from abroad.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 27 May on  pages 1 and 2 carries a 1,000-word "bog, jam"-signed report on  the 26 May meeting of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic [NRSR], most of which was taken up by the debate on a  no-confidence motion in Milan Janicina, minister for the  administration and privatization of national property, which had  been initiated by opposition deputies. According to the SME  report, "in a secret ballot, NRSR deputies decided not to  express no-confidence in Minister Milan Janicina. Of the 144  ballots cast, 139 were valid. A total of 71 deputies voted in  favor of the vote of no-confidence being passed, 65 deputies  were against, and 3 abstained. A total of 76 votes would have  been necessary for the vote of no-confidence to be passed."    On the same day, on page 2, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries  a 400-word interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of  the Democratic Left [SDL], by Maria Hluchanova entitled "We  Simply Harmonized Coalition Views." As the interviewer points  out, the fact that 71 deputies were in favor of Janicina's  dismissal "raised doubts in the NRSR lobbies about the SDL  deputies' support for Milan Janicina in the secret ballot." She  therefore asks Weiss "to confirm or deny conjectures that part  of the SDL Club of Deputies had voted for Janicina's dismissal."    Weiss replies: "All kinds of things can be heard in  parliamentary lobbies, including that the dismissal was  supported by a part of Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement,  Coexistence, and centrist deputies. The voting was secret and  engaging in speculation is pointless. It has never been  customary in our Club of Deputies to look one's colleagues over  the shoulder. The SDL Club of Deputies decided to vote against  Milan Janicina's dismissal." Weiss emphasizes that "the SDL is  interested in the coalition working and in all debates about  privatization being conducted on an expert level and not on an  ideological level." He also confirms that coalition talks were  held prior to the vote on Minister Janicina, at which the  coalition partners "harmonized coalition views" on the issue.    Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 27 May on page 2,  under the headline "Cracks in Coalition?," carries a series of  brief interviews with representatives of coalition parties,  totalling 350- words, on their voting on Minister Janicina. The  interviews are preceded by the following introduction: "The  outcome of the secret ballot on trust in Minister Milan Janicina  (National Democratic Party) revealed that some coalition  deputies had supported the opposition's call for his dismissal.  In this context, we asked coalition partners whether this  problem would be taken up by the Coalition Council and whether  they can rule out that their own deputies had supported the  no-confidence vote in the minister of privatization." In their  brief replies, all interviewees voice the conviction that their  own deputies had not violated the agreement to support Janicina.  They agree, however, that it would be pointless to raise this  issue within the framework of the coalition because it is  impossible to ascertain how individual deputies had actually  voted.</p>

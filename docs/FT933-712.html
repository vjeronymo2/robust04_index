			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Pounds 100m aid urged for bus operators THE MOTOR industry yesterday urged the government to commit up to Pounds 100m a year to help operators modernise the UK's 30,000 large city buses. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the move would reduce traffic congestion and substantially improve air quality through low-pollution 'green' buses. The Confederation of British Industry estimates that congestion costs the UK Pounds 15bn a year. The SMMT said in a pre-Budget submission to the Department of Transport and the chancellor that bus operators were no longer earning enough to replace buses. The number of passenger seats available was therefore continuing to decline and the existing bus fleet was deteriorating. If current trends continued, by the end of the decade the number of bus seats available would fall by 35 per cent, only 21 per cent of buses would meet even minimum EC exhaust emissions standards and more than half of buses would be 15 years or more old. The submission calls for 100 per cent first-year capital allowances on new vehicles, a subsidy of up to 15 per cent on the price of new buses meeting latest environmental standards, and an extra allowance of up to 10 per cent of the price if an old bus was scrapped.</p>

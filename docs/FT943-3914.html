			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Media Futures: BBC and Channel 4 move to exploit rights Two British broadcasters, the BBC and Channel 4, are about to launch significant initiatives which emphasise the importance of the acquisition and exploitation of film and programme rights in the increasingly competitive broadcasting market. Channel 4 will this evening launch its first video label and plans to release at least 24 titles a year under its own name. The channel is also interested in a joint venture in cinema distribution in the UK, apart from keeping the UK video rights of future feature films it invests in under the Film on 4 banner. The aim is to have a greater participation in future in the exploitation of films such as the current international hit - Four Weddings and a Funeral. The BBC, which has been given active encouragement by the government to develop an international commercial business, is joining two private investors in a new television rights acquisition company called Delta. The BBC is expected to have a 20 per cent stake in the new venture which will be run by Ann Harris, at present the director of co-production in London of the Italian-owned RCS Films and Television. The other two backers of Delta are Gartmore, the UK investment fund, and Media Ventures, which has stakes in Teletext, ITV and UK Talk Radio, the new national commercial station launching next year. Colin Leventhal, head of Channel 4 International and managing director of Channel 4 Video, hopes that video sales will double Channel 4 International's turnover over the next three years. Last year the channel had revenues of Pounds 11m and profits of Pounds 4m on its sales operations. The video business will begin with the launch of five titles, retailing at Pounds 12.99 each. They range from three Equinox programmes, Fly Navy, Spitfire and Space Shuttle Discovery to two comedy titles, The Most Unpleasant World of Penn &amp; Teller and Totally Bill Hicks, a compilation of the Channel 4 tribute and his last live performance in the UK. For the Christmas market Channel 4 will launch a video of Brookside, its regular soap opera - nearly half of which will be new material. In every case the channel says it will be working closely with independent producers who provide most of its programmes. In the past Channel 4 has sold video rights on request to other companies but only about half a dozen titles were released. Leventhal says he is confident that the new venture 'will be a welcome addition to the services we offer our viewers, while at the same time generating significant revenues for Channel 4.' It will also take him into head-on competition with the BBC - usually after Disney the leading video 'sell-through', as opposed to rental label, in the UK.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey pays Pounds 2.2m for Swedish purchase Johnson Matthey, already the world's biggest producer of automotive emission catalysts, has taken another step towards its goal of becoming a substantial global supplier of diesel autocatalysts by taking a controlling interest in Svenska Emissionsteknik, writes Kenneth Gooding. Until now Emissionsteknik, which operates from a laboratory in Gothenburg, has been backed financially by Fond Vast, one of Sweden's national pension funds. JM is to pay Sk22.64m (about Pounds 2.17m) for 51 per cent and has an option to buy the rest. Taking up this option and proposed capital and development expenditure is expected to take JM's total investment to Pounds 10m over the next three years. JM said that by combining JM and Emissionsteknik technology it would be able to treat emissions from all types of mobile and stationary petrol and diesel engines.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has come under  fire from another formerly staunch supporter. Zimbabwe's  biggest daily newspaper, THE HERALD, has warned that other  African states may follow Tanzania's lead. Tanzania this week  barred the PAC from using its Dar es Salaam headquarters as a  launching pad for violence attacks against South Africa. As  Lawrence Bartlett reports, THE HERALD newspaper often reflects  the thinking of President Robert Mugabe's government:    THE HERALD's criticism of the PAC is especially significant  because Mugabe and Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African  National Union -- Patriotic Front] party have historically had  closer links to the PAC than to the ANC [African National  Congress]. THE HERALD takes the line that what is calls the  PAC's senseless violence threatens to disrupt South Africa's  move toward democracy at a time when the goal of the liberation  movements is within their grasp. It accuses the PAC of a  misguided attempt to gain lost ground against the ANC in the run  up to the election in April, saying its actions put it on much  the same level as the militant extreme right wing in South  Africa. The newspaper calls on the PAC to choose the ballot and  not the bullet, or face the possibility of other former friends  also taking action against it.</p>

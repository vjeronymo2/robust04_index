			<p>BFN     [Text] Repairs on the second unit of the Loviisa nuclear  power station [on the Finnish south coast] are expected to take  four days. It was decided to shut down the second unit of the  nuclear power station when a leak was discovered in the  reactor's cooling circuit. Slightly radioactive evaporating  water is dripping through the cooling circuit's valve casing.  The valve cannot be separated and repaired while the power  station is running so the unit will be frozen for the duration  of repairs on the valve. The leak was discovered in the early  hours of this morning when the station's operators noticed that  the insulation in the valve casing had become moist. The Center  for Radiation and Nuclear Safety was informed of the fault in  the morning. The reason for the leak is not known.</p>

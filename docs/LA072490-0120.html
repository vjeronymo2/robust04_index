			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury sold $9 billion of new three-month bills at an  average discount rate of 7.49%, down from 7.62% last week.  </P> <P> Another $9 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate  of 7.40%, down from 7.52% last week. The rates were the lowest since  three-month bills sold for 7.37% on Oct. 16, 1989, and six-month bills averaged  7.30% on Dec. 4, 1989. The new discount rates understate the actual return to  investors -- 7.74% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for  $9,810.70, and 7.79% for a six-month bill selling for $9,625.90. The discount  rate reflects the price discount received when government securities are  purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

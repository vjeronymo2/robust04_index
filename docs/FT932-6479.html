			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Scott big match lacks punch IT WAS SUPPOSED to be the day Lord Justice Scott's investigation into the arms to Iraq affair burst into life. A hastily convened session, the first appearance of a cabinet minister, and the charge that he, while attorney-general, had tried to dissuade Sir Hal Miller, the former conservative MP, from producing evidence in court for fear it would have embarrassed the government. In the event, those who had reserved seats for the spectacle - some arrived a full hour before the start of proceedings - were treated to a complex verbal exchange that always looked like falling well short of delivering a knock-out blow. It was difficult not to be aware that the real drama of the day was taking place not far away in another part of Westminster. The government witness, Sir Patrick Mayhew, is well known as a safe pair of hands. And so he proved. He arrived several minutes early and, flanked by three minders, outsmarted the television crews by heading for the front door of the Buckingham Gate building instead of the side entrance. Taking a seat, and after having been addressed by Lord Justice Scott, Sir Patrick read from a seven-page statement his staff had prepared over the last two days in between dealing with the Anglo-Irish negotiations. He did not wish to challenge Sir Hal's good faith, of course, but on the central issue of whether he put pressure on him not to produce documents in court he disagreed with him. Perhaps there had been some misunderstanding, for the crucial conversation had taken place in a crowded and noisy lobby - the Conservative majority in the last parliament being rather large, Sir Patrick noted. Lord Justice Scott and counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale started their questioning fairly aggressively but as the session wore on the three lawyers lost most of their audience as the focus of attention moved away from Sir Hal's allegations, so forcibly denied in the early moments, to the powers of the attorney-general and other matters of law. Much of the debate centred on degrees of emphasis. Was the chairman of Customs 'pushing very hard' for prosecutions in the supergun case to go ahead, as Miss Baxendale believed he was, or was he simply 'probing a point', as Sir Patrick maintained, during meetings between the two men in November 1990? As the Scott inquiry takes a two-week break, the government appears to have survived its stiffest test so far. But this affair has a habit of springing surprises. It is far from over yet.</p>

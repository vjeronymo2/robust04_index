			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDLY PARTY AFTER THE 'WAR'  </P> <P> "The War of the Roses," one of the Christmas season's first big film releases,  had its premiere Monday night at 20th Century Fox studios. The movie, directed  by and starring Danny DeVito, with co-stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen  Turner, screened in two theaters and was followed by a party on the lot.  </P> <P> Guests filed through a facade and mock-up of the house featured in the movie,  where most of the nasty divorce "war" takes place. But only good moods  prevailed this night, as well-wishers greeted DeVito and congratulated him on a  job well done. The elegant cocktail party atmosphere was carried out with a  string quartet playing classical music and food that included champagne and  caviar, pasta and desserts.  </P> <P> Among the 1,000 people at the party were Michael Douglas and father Kirk;  Turner; "War" producer Jim Brooks; Chevy Chase; Marlee Matlin; Albert Brooks;  Timothy Busfield; Christian Slater; Jane Seymour; Olivia Newton-John; Courteney  Cox; Arnold Schwarzenegger; Shirley MacLaine; Jennifer Tilly; Lakers coach Pat  Riley and DeVito's wife Rhea Perlman.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As UKRINFORM's correspondent in Sevastopol, Crimea,  reported on Wednesday [16 March] the Ukrainian Navy's press  center refuted a report by the Black Sea Fleet's press center  about an alleged seizure by the Ukrainian naval personnel of a  naval hospital in Ochakov. As the Ukrainian statement says, the  hospital's personnel took an oath of allegiance to Ukraine and  appealed to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and Navy command to  enroll them as the Ukrainian Navy servicemen. Since then, the  hospital has been strictly guarded, as when a similar situation  evolved once in Nikolayev. The Black Sea Fleet command  attempted to take away medical equipment and drugs from the  local naval hospital, the statement explains.</p>

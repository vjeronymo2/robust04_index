			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa in Gotabanken bid TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurance group, has attempted to crush rumours about the stability of Gotabanken, Sweden's fourth largest commercial bank, by making an offer to buy all the outstanding shares in Gota. The bid, representing a premium of about 54 per cent over the April 10 market price of Gota's shares, was made after a week in which many small savers in Gota withdrew money from the bank. Trygg-Hansa's non-cash bid has the support of the Gota board. Trygg-Hansa already owns 43.5 per cent of the shares and 48.3 per cent of the voting rights in Gota. The Trygg bid is the latest development in Sweden's banking crisis. Last autumn the government was forced to make a large capital injection into Nordbanken, the country's third-largest bank in which the state has a dominant shareholding. The government also has had to organise a rescue for Fvrsta Sparbanken, the Stockholm regional savings bank. Gota made a SKr2.13bn (Dollars 359m) operating loss in 1991, when loan loss provisions jumped from SKr982m in 1990 to SKr3.7bn last year, equal to about 4.6 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees. The bank also had a SKr11bn portfolio of loans which were either non-performing or on which the terms had been modified to lower interest payments. Trygg-Hansa had earlier promised to subscribe to a new share issue by Gota in order to maintain confidence in the bank. This issue has now been postponed. Trygg said the merger with Gota will turn Trygg-Hansa SPP into a financial group with a complete range of services in banking and insurance. The group has premium income of about SKr42bn, including two mutual life assurance companies, Trygg-Hansa Life and SPP.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Anti-Inflationary Policy of </F> the Republic Party -- A Social-Economic Fund Is Sufficient"]    [Text] The consolidation of banks, begun by the current  government, would be followed by an acceptable pace of  privatization mainly from 1995. Accordingly, the Republic Party  urges the influx of foreign capital, instead of a redistribution  of stocks. The Republic Party recently described its monetary  and fiscal policy and its effect on inflation. According to  Republic Party Deputy Chairman Laszlo Fodor, it is still  possible to cope with a budget deficit of 5 percent of the GDP.  It is essential that Hungary fulfills its debt-repayment  obligations. If a new government takes power after the  elections, the Republic Party will play a role in this  government and will assert its view that Hungary still needs a  basically strict monetary and fiscal policy for quite a while.    The Republic Party urges the development of a banking  environment more interested in financing the economic players  than in investing in state bonds. The program of the Republic  Party includes an interest policy and system that lead to  interest rates encouraging savings. Laszlo Fodor mentioned the  fact that the party thinks that the program of the current  government in financing the exports and imports is worth  continuing, and it is necessary to set up a relevant bank for  this, as well as a stock company to provide export guarantees.  It is already certain that, if they get into the government,  the Republic Party will submit a supplementary budget by the  second half of this year. They will immediately eliminate the  system of separated state funds; instead, they will set up a  single such institution. This social-economic fund would  replace the current 100 or more funds and it would finance  projects on the basis of a uniform, strict and throughly  controlled system of criteria. According to Laszlo Fodor,  everything that is happening with these funds in Parliament  today is only helping a wasteful economy, because the current  law allows these funds to give loans to each other in exchange  for interest.    The Republic Party thinks that income from privatization can  be the source of reducing the state debts and, therefore, the  party wants to allocate more funds for this, and would  recirculate the remaining funds into the economy. The economic  program of the Republic Party finds its unrealistic to achieve a  one-digit inflation in a short time, but it is certain that  inflation can be maintained much below 20 percent. The party  does not intend to bring elements that increase the inflationary  pressure in the economy. In case it gets into power, the  Republic Party will guarantee the indexation of pensions,  minimum wages, and public employees' salaries every three  months, in order to adjust them to the rate of inflation. Thus,  the party could achieve an increase in purchasing power. The  party wants to achieve a similar agreement between the employees  and the employers.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Health warning for smokers BARONESS Cumberlege, a junior health minister, yesterday said that the government had no objections to doctors withholding treatment from patients who ignored advice to stop smoking. She told the BBC's Today programme: 'If they feel that people they are treating are less likely to recover than other people on the waiting list, then that must be a judgment for them.' Consultants at Manchester's Wythenshawe and Leicester's Groby Road hospitals last week said they refused non-urgent heart bypass surgery on heavy smokers and they believed other doctors did the same.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Jordan hopes for Dollars 350m aid JORDAN is hoping to secure up to Dollars 350m (Pounds 230m) from donor countries meeting in Paris today to make up projected deficits in the kingdom's balance of payments for 1933. The aid, most likely to take the form of credits and sector-linked protocols, is required to fulfil strictures set by the International Monetary Fund as part of the economic adjustment programme for 1992-8. The meeting, to be held under the auspices of the IMF and the World Bank, is due to be attended by 24 donor countries including members of the EC and Japan. The Jordanian delegation, led by Finance Minister Basel Jardaneh and Planning Minister Zayad Fareez, is said to be optimistic that the kingdom's needs will be met. The annual cost of servicing external debt of about Dollars 6.6bn is estimated to be about Dollars 1.1m, 49 per cent of which is due to be paid this year under the IMF programme, Mr Fahed Fanek, an economist, says. The Finance Ministry says the request for Dollars 350m is required to meet this payment in full. Jordan boasts an impressive economic record since the adjustment programme began.</p>

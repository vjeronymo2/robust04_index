The group discussed the issues  of legalization of transit regulations.    The group made a conclusion that common regulations on the  dangerous and military transit through Lithuanian territory for  all the countries should be established in accordance with the  international conventions. They decided to form a group of  experts which would draft a law on dangerous and military  transit through Lithuanian territory.    The working group also got acquainted with the draft on  transit presented by Russia and decided that it could be  considered just after Seimas [parliament] enacted the law on  transit.</p>

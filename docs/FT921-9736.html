			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / MEPs likely to back plan to ban tobacco advertising THE European Parliament is expected to back a European Commission plan to ban all tobacco advertising, except at the point of sale, when it votes on the draft directive in Strasbourg today. However, the measure is likely to encounter serious opposition at the next meeting of EC health ministers in May. Ministers from a blocking minority of member states, including the UK and Germany, have already voiced their objections to the directive. Parliament's vote on the issue was delayed for procedural reasons following a full debate in Strasbourg last month. Some MEPs argued successfully that the legal basis of the legislation should be re-examined. Parliament's legal affairs committee has since decided that Brussels was right to put forward the directive as a single market measure which only requires approval from a weighted majority of member states. Nearly 30 amendments have been tabled, including proposals to change the legal basis of the directive and to overturn the legislation altogether. There is still a possibility that that the directive might be talked off the parliamentary agenda. The Commission's plan seems sure of approval by MEPs in spite of heavy lobbying by tobacco companies. In the UK, the Tobacco Advisory Council at the weekend launched another national advertising campaign opposing the EC proposals. It said the campaign focuses on 'Brussels' intransigence' in pursuing the ban in spite of a lack of evidence to support claims that it would reduce smoking. Mr Christopher Bullock, the TAC's director of public affairs, said: Brussels has simply ignored the facts  .. preferring instead to listen to the special pleading of the anti-smoking lobby.' The European Commission is considering separate proposals for co-ordinating its legislation on advertising through a single department. Advertisers and agencies have objected that disparate measures - including those on tobacco and comparative advertising - have emerged recently from different parts of the Brussels bureaucracy, without consultation. Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market commissioner, said yesterday that he intended to produce a Commission paper on advertising and the single market which would try to resolve the problem. '(The current proposals on advertising) are too dotted about - they deal with single topics but aren't based on general considerations,' he said. 'That's why we must have real European legislation with a systematic structure.'</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise hints A generally weak oil sector, depressed by the recent slippage in oil prices as the Iraq/Kuwait border worries receded, was featured by a sudden bout of selling pressure in Enterprise Oil after rumours that it was about to launch an Pounds 800m-plus all-paper bid for Ampolex, the Australian oil group. Enterprise said it never commented on market rumours but sources close to Enterprise described the story as 'without foundation'. The stories swept the market in midsession. Enterprise shares opened around 385p but fell away to close a net 8 lower at 377p on unremarkable turnover of 1.5m. Oil specialists said a bid seemed unlikely but would fulfil many of the objectives evident when Enterprise unsuccessfully bid for Lasmo earlier tbis year, citing Ampol's strongly rising production profile and good assets. British Petroleum fell 7 1/2 to 414p on 6.6m traded, while Shell Transport receded 8 to 722p. Revived worries about British Gas's dividend policy, which were thought to have been laid to rest at the company's strategy meeting with analysts and institutions at the end of September, came back to haunt Gas shares, which relinquished 5 1/2 at 286p.</p>

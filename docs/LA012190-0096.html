			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO AVOID PAYING TAXES WHEN SELLING HOME  </P> <P> Virtually every homeowner has heard that there is a way to avoid paying taxes  when selling the principal residence at a profit.  </P> <P> However, the details are often elusive and misunderstood. One costly mistake,  and the tax you thought you were avoiding can become due.  </P> <P> Internal Revenue Code 1034, the "roll-over residence replacement rule," is  quite simple. It says a home seller must defer paying tax on the sale profit if  a replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost is bought and  occupied within 24 months before or after the sale.  </P> <P> This tax benefit is available to home sellers of any age. It can be used over  and over without limit. However, it cannot be used more often than once every  24 months. But this rule can be used again within less than 24 months if the  home sale involves a job location change that qualifies for the moving-expense  deduction.  </P> <P> Sharp homeowners will readily see that they can use IRC 1034 to pyramid their  wealth, starting out with a small home such as a cottage, selling it and buying  a more expensive home, and then selling that home and buying a mansion, all  without paying tax on the profit.  </P> <P> All that matters are your old residence's net sales price (in tax talk it's  called "adjusted sales price") and the replacement home's adjusted cost basis,  which includes most closing costs.  </P> <P> For example, if your old home sells for $108,000, but you only receive $100,000  after paying the real estate sales commission, transfer fees and closing costs,  then $100,000 is your adjusted, or net, sales price. To defer the tax on your  sale profit, you must buy a replacement home costing at least $100,000,  including closing costs paid on the purchase.  </P> <P> However, if you acquire a less expensive replacement home, such as one for  $90,000, in this example you would owe tax on up to $10,000 of your sale  profit. But tax on any remaining profit is deferred. However, if you add at  least $10,000 of capital improvements to your new $90,000-home within the  24-month replacement period, thus bringing your total purchase cost over  $100,000, then you can defer tax on all your profit.  </P> <P> Please notice the rules say nothing about mortgages or about cash down  payments. If you want to take tax-free cash out of the sale and replacement,  the best way to do so is to sell your old home for cash and buy the replacement  home for nothing down, such as with a VA mortgage. You can spend the tax-free  cash as you wish.  </P> <P> This roll-over residence replacement rule is a very generous tax break. It  allows home sellers to put tax-free cash into their pocket as they move up to  nicer homes. However, this tax deferral rule has several pitfalls to anticipate  and avoid:  </P> <P> 1 -- If either the old or new home is not your principal residence, IRC 1034  does not apply. Vacation or second homes and rental houses are not eligible. If  you own a rental house that you would like to qualify, before selling it, move  into that house as your principal residence. The tax law does not specify any  minimum occupancy time but most tax advisers suggest a minimum six to 12  months, preferably filing your income tax returns for at least one tax year  from that address.  </P> <P> 2 -- A currently owned home cannot qualify because it is not purchased within  24 months before or after the sale of the old home. For example, if you own a  summer home that you want to winterize and move into as your principal  residence, it won't qualify unless you bought it within 24 months before or  after selling your principal residence.  </P> <P> 3 -- There is no provision in this tax law for extension of the 24-month  replacement period. If you have not purchased your replacement home within 24  months after selling your old home, you will owe tax on your sale profit. The  only exceptions occur if you are on active military duty or if you are residing  overseas; then the time limits can be extended if you qualify.  </P> <P> 4 -- If your old or replacement home is outside the United States, you can  still defer your profit tax because IRC 1034 sets no geographical limits.  </P> <P> 5 -- If you live in one apartment of a multiunit building that you own, the tax  deferral only applies to the profitable sale of your personal residence  apartment, and you will owe tax on the sale profit on the rental apartments.  Similarly, if you are acquiring an apartment building, only the value of the  apartment where you will reside counts as the replacement home's cost, not the  value of the entire property.  </P> <P> 6 -- When April 15 arrives and your 1989 income tax returns are due, if you  have not yet purchased your replacement home you can still defer your profit  tax on the 1989 sale of your old home. Just report the sale on IRS form 2119  and indicate that you plan to buy a qualifying replacement principal residence.  However, if you do not buy a home within 24 months after the sale, you will owe  the tax plus interest.  </P> <P> For most taxpayers, the roll-over residence replacement rule is the most  generous tax-saving rule available. While IRC 1034 is simple, your tax adviser  should be consulted so you don't make a costly mistake.  </P></p>

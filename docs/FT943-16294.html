			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: CE Heath to sell Australian offshoot CE Heath, the insurance broker, has reached a conditional agreement to sell its underwriting subsidiary, Heath Australia, for ADollars 1m (Pounds 400,000) after increasing reserves against further losses by more than Pounds 8m. The deal is designed to draw a line under the losses from Australian underwriting operations which have marred results recently. It will reduce pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 1994 to Pounds 3.84m, compared with a preliminary figure announced last month of Pounds 11.8m. But Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, said 'shareholders will be far better served by the elimination of any further exposure to losses. The additional exceptional loss of Pounds 8m is considered to be a a worthwhile cost of achieving certainty.' Heath Australia, which is no longer underwriting new business, is to be acquired by CE Heath International Holdings, an independently listed group in which Heath owns a 23 per cent stake.</p>

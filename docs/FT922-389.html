			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Concentrating on back pain Sir, Despite some sensible advice Dr McGannon (Management: 'How back pain can make you lose your marbles', June 17) seems to underestimate the preventative benefits of correctly applied manipulation. Just as a badly tuned motor-car will eventually stop running, no matter how carefully you drive it, an incorrectly functioning spine develops areas of overwork which can cause regular episodes of pain, commonly at the base of the spine or the lower neck, radiating to the shoulders. This pain can lead to reduced concentration and working efficiency - and thus more stresses - in order to cope with the existing work load. Correcting the variation in spinal joint movement means that the back is more able to cope with the external stresses of working life applied to it. Combining this approach with sensible, long-term advice will reduce the need for time-consuming and costly bed rest, as well as improving individual working efficiency.

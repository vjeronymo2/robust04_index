			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUBWAY BILL UNDER FIRE  </P> <P> Governor Deukmejian should veto Senate Bill 1263, the Robbins Subway Bill.  </P> <P> This bill would benefit only a very vocal minority in the San Fernando Valley.  The tremendous cost of this type of project compared to other forms of rail  transit would be an unwarranted tax burden on the general public.  </P> <P> Sen. Robbins is totally out of touch with reality in this matter. The advisory  vote confirms this. Only 10% of the vote went for the subway.  </P> <P> DON WHITTINGHILL  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rambahadur Ray: "Pakistan Intends to Spread </F> Religious and Communal Violence in India"]    [Text] New Delhi, 11 February -- A regular task force is  working in Pakistan since 1990 for operation K-2 to spread  religious and ethnic violence in India. This task force was  composed of Brigadier Mohammed Salim, Brigadier Javed, and Major  Haider. A special research council is assisting this task force.  It is composed of high military and ISI [Inter-Service  Intelligence of Pakistan] officers. It decides how to provide  aid to various active groups in India. The Indian Government has  not yet made any plans to foil the Pakistani conspiracy. It is  wasting time in other, unnecessary efforts.    Pakistan's Operation K-2 is a decisive effort. It was  launched in order to acquire Kashmir. The main battle under it  is being fought in Kashmir. In order to strengthen their  position, small groups are being incited to spread separatism  and violence throughout the country. The Indian Government is  aware that Major Haider has been managing this front in the  Kashmir Valley since 1991. After establishing his control over  all Kashmiri groups, Major Haider entered the valley. This is an  example of fighting against India right on its soil. He is  working closely with terrorist organizations.    A U. S. Congress committee report has details of this  operation. In December 1991, Major Haider called a meeting of  representatives of Ikhvanul Musalmin, the Allah Tigers, Hizbul,  and mujaheddin organizations. The decision to start a combined  campaign was made in this meeting. This also affected the other,  smaller organizations. At present, about 150 organizations are  active there. This has helped the religious terrorists come  under one umbrella. In response, the ISI increased its aid to  them. In light of the activities of 1991, Major Haider went to  the Kashmir valley to supervise this campaign. We can understand  this because of the terrible fighting that occurred at that  time. This was a very difficult period for Indian security  forces. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has repeatedly said  that Pakistan is fighting a shadow war in Kashmir. This is only  half true. It is not a shadow war anymore, now that Major Haider  has arrived there. During that period, the Kashmiri terrorists  fought the security forces face to face. This is a great  achievement for any terrorist group, and it is still going on in  the Kashmir Valley.    The next year, in the summer of 1992, a large number of  Pakistani-trained terrorists entered Kashmir. According to one  estimate, they had 20,000 AK-47 and AK-56 rifles. During those  days, the terrorists attacked security forces on a daily basis.  The ones that were killed in these skirmishes included, in  addition to trained terrorists, the Afghan mujaheddin. According  to one estimate, between 1990 and 1992, 20,000 Kashmiri youths  received training across the border. Brigadier Mohammed Salim  led this training effort. These training camps were operated as  a joint project of the ISI and the army. There are 15 permanent  training camps in Azad Kashmir, the portion of Kashmir that is  controlled by Pakistan. There are an additional 30 temporary  camps. These new training centers were built for religious  terrorists in 1992. Brigadier Javed was made their director. He  had all kinds of experiences, through the CIA, in working for  the ISI and the mujaheddin during the Afghan War.    Training camps were opened for religious terrorists in  Gohad,  Larkana, Sangli, Sargodha, Cuttock, Murree, Sialkot, and Lahore.  One of these camps was operated with Iran's help. The suicide  brigades were trained there. After that, in addition to Kashmir,  efforts to spread terrorism across different parts of India were  accelerated. Now they have opened centers in many places. The  bomb blast on Palam Airport on 25 June 1991 attracted attention  to these agencies. A bomb was found in an Air India plane on 1  December 1991. That plane was leaving New Delhi for London. The  Janbaz Force took responsibility for it. After that, there were  bomb blasts in Delhi and many other cities. In August 1992, two  Pakistanis were arrested 30 kilometers from Madras. They were  trying to blow up a train. Police agencies have collected a lot  of evidence from these groups. Pakistani agents were also  involved in blowing up the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]  office in Madras. They were conspiring to transform the  religious tension there into a lava of violence.    Who is helping the Pakistani agents? The Indian Government  is  in the dark about this. The little information that has been  collected mentions SIMI (Student Islamic Movement of India)  repeatedly. According to the U. S. Congress committee report,  the religious terrorists trust this group. The central  investigation bureau learned about a terrorist named Surjeet  while investigating Dr. Jalis Ansari. It was learned that he was  working with Abdullah Shiragi. Abdullah Shiragi is a well-known  Kashmiri terrorist. He attended the SIMI conference in 1991.    The Kashmiri active organization, Jamaat-i Tulba, was given  the duty of sending its members to accept asylum in various  parts of India. Its agents have taken different routes to go to  India and Nepal. Jamal Alvi of Lucknow was their special agent.  He was working for Dr. Jalis Ansari and Hilal Beg. Dr. Habib of  Raibareilly is also considered a member of this group.    The central and state governments' intelligence agencies  could not understand the network that Jamaat-i Tulba had spread.  The government is not sure how much it hurt the Pakistani  conspiracy in its recent arrests. The only estimates it could  make from these arrests were related to what kind of tricks  Pakistan was using in the war on Kashmir. It appears to be  establishing small groups in different places that can be  activated at its instruction when the time comes. After the  Bombay blasts, the government was wrong to consider that the  Memon group was operating alone. That group had finished, to an  extent. The recent arrests has created only the scene of the  "seed of blood." The Indian Government will not be able to  totally destroy it with its weak efforts.    Before the last Independence Day, General K. V. Krishan Rao,  the Jammu-Kashmir governor, admitted that Pakistan was planning  to infiltrate India with a large number of soldiers. He reported  that 10,000 Afghan mercenary soldiers were ready for it. This  statement is also supported by a U. S. Congress committee  report. According to the report, Pakistan has been using Afghan  mercenary soldiers in Kashmir since 1992. During the summer of  that year, 200 mercenary soldiers were working with the  terrorists, and another 300 mercenary soldiers have been waiting  since 1992. Last summer, 200 mercenary soldiers were sent into  Kashmir. According to this report, the Kashmiri terrorists  informed that 300 additional Afghan mercenary soldiers were  waiting to enter since 1992. It is clear now that when CIA  Director Robert Gates came to India in 1990, he pressured the  Pakistani president to close the bases in Lahore.  *</p>

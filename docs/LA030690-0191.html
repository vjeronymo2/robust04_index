			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: REMICK ENDURES DESPITE PERSONAL ORDEAL;  </P> <P> PROFILE: ACTRESS WAGED A 'DRASTIC AND HORRIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL' FIGHT AGAINST  KIDNEY CANCER. NOW, SHE PREPARES FOR A ROLE IN THE MINISERIES 'THE YOUNG  CATHERINE.'  </P> <P> Lee Remick made an unforgettable film debut as the sexy drum majorette who  marries the power-corrupted Andy Griffith in Elia Kazan's "A Face in the Crowd"  in 1957. Her lithe, blue-eyed beauty and her disturbing blend of youthful  innocence and grown-up sensuality raised the movie's temperature several  degrees.  </P> <P> She was 22 and, as history was to show, launching an impressive acting career  that next saw her as Anthony Franciosa's wife in "The Long Hot Summer," based  on some William Faulkner stories. There was an Oscar nomination for "Days of  Wine and Roses," opposite Jack Lemmon, with whom she co-starred again in  "Tribute" in 1980. She was a Henry James heroine in "The Europeans" and Winston  Churchill's mother in television's "Jenny."  </P> <P> Remick has done stage, screen and television, her presence a kind of seal of  quality, and she's rarely been idle, here or in England where she lived for  many years with her second husband, Kip Gowans. He was a first assistant  director when they married in 1970. He is now a producer in Hollywood, and they  divide their time between Los Angeles and a home on Cape Cod. (Remick was born  in nearby Quincy, Mass.)  </P> <P> Then, eight months ago, Remick was found to have kidney cancer. The treatments,  mostly at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, were "drastic and  horrible and successful," she says, "and now I'm back." She shows no signs of  the ordeal.  </P> <P> "I learned a lot. I learned what matters, and what doesn't. I learned it  doesn't make sense to let little things get you down. Or to choose the little  things that you want to matter to you."  </P> <P> She is about to go back to work, having signed to play the mother of the  teen-age German princess who married the Grand Duke Peter and in time became  Catherine the Great of Russia. A miniseries for Ted Turner, "The Young  Catherine," will commence shooting in Leningrad in mid-April.  </P> <P> "I'm very manipulative, something of a stage mother," Remick says. Vanessa  Redgrave will play the Empress, Maximilian Schell Frederick the Great in the  four-hour, two-part series written by Chris Bryant and to be directed by  Michael Anderson.  </P> <P> Remick was almost inevitably a performer. Her mother, Patricia, was an actress.  Possibly more important, her great-grandmother, Eliza Duffield, was an  English-born preacher who had a congregation in Round Hill, N.Y. Remick recalls  being taken as a very small child to see and hear her great-grandmother.  </P> <P> "She was 4-feet-nothing but she had a huge, booming voice and a British accent  and she sang hymns while she accompanied herself. She ruled her family and  everybody around her with an iron hand. People quaked in her presence."  </P> <P> Remick set out to be a dancer, is glad for the training and glad she didn't  make it as a dancer. "I wouldn't have been that good, and what's the sense of  trying to do something you're not good enough at. Things work out the way  they're supposed to, and they did for me. But the training was wonderful and  the discipline you have to have as a dancer has been of endless value  throughout my life -- to say nothing of being able to work through pain, and,  boy, do you work through pain as a dancer."  </P> <P> She was 16 and attending the fashionable Miss Hewitt's School in Manhattan when  someone saw her and cast her in a Broadway play called "Act Your Age." It  bombed out quickly but not before she knew that she'd found her calling.  </P> <P> She did summer stock, toured with Rudy Vallee in "Jenny Kissed Me" and began to  appear in live television dramas. In 1964 she was cast, along with Angela  Lansbury, in Stephen Sondheim's first musical, "Anyone Can Whistle."  </P> <P> "It was magical because of Stephen's score," she says, "but even those who  loved it agreed it was ahead of its time." It had a short life, but it  continues to resonate in the memories of those who know the music.  </P> <P> "I did a couple of Playhouse 90s," Remick says, "and Robert Montgomerys and  Krafts and Armstrongs" (a litany of the hour and the 90-minute dramas that were  the glory of television before it learned to tape). Kazan saw her in one of the  dramas; Remick is not sure which one.  </P> <P> The day after it aired, "I was out and about and I called my answering service.  No machines in those days, at least I didn't have one. There was a slew of  messages and I didn't have anything to write with. So I could only remember the  last number and call it.  </P> <P> "It turned out to be Kazan's assistant, wanting me to come in." It was to read  for "A Face in the Crowd," which Budd Schulberg scripted from one of his own  stories. The film was shot entirely in Pickett, Ark., and New York, but  Hollywood was the next step.  </P> <P> Remick has two children by her first marriage to television producer Bill  Colleran, a daughter 31, who has just been married, and a son, 28. Neither  wants to act. Her daughter writes, the son is in post-production sound. Remick  is not sorry.  </P> <P> "It's probably just as well. It's so much more difficult now. You're either  instantly successful or you flounder around. And of course we're all just  asking for rejection. We keep hoping it won't happen because it's so painful,  but of course it does. It comes to absolutely every one of us. And it's your  whole entire self that's being rejected, no matter what they say. You stand  there and you get it right between eyes."  </P> <P> It's Oscar time and Remick remembers the Monday night she and Lemmon attended  the ceremonies when both were nominated for "Days of Wine and Roses."  </P> <P> "I was sitting on the aisle, as you do if you're a nominee, and Jack and  Felicia (Farr, his wife) were sitting a few rows ahead. He saw me and came back  and kissed me and I said, 'Good luck tonight,' and he grinned and said, 'No, I  don't think so either.' "  </P> <P> The honors that year went to Gregory Peck for "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Anne  Bancroft for "The Miracle Worker."  </P> <P> Remick shockingly confessed to an interviewer once that she was a terrible  interview. It's nonsense, and she is a wonderfully engaging talker. At a recent  lunch she was remembering becoming aware of a woman who was walking back and  forth, observing her closely, getting up nerve. At last the woman approached  her and said, "You're Lee Remick, aren't you?"  </P> <P> "Yes," Remick confessed; "I'm Lee Remick."  </P> <P> "I thought so," the woman said with satisfaction. "You look so much like her,  and she's so pretty."  </P> <P> "It was almost mystical, metaphysical," Remick said the other day. "Then I  realized that she was separating the me she saw on the screen from the me she  was seeing in person."  </P> <P> She also remembers a night at a London theater when she had her then very young  son along. The usher was flustered to meet her and very solicitous. Would she  like a child's seat for the boy? "I said that would be terribly nice, and she  said, 'I'll bring it as soon as I almost can.' "  </P> <P> Then again, Lee Remick can have that effect on almost anyone. It may be the  blue eyes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 24 Apr (INA) -- An Iraqi political writer  has said that the new world order adopted by the United States  cannot last.    In an article published in BABIL today, Amir al-Hilu cast  doubt about the ability of the United States to continue its  hegemony as the sole international power that wants to control  the world's resources after the disintegration of the Soviet  Union and the socialist bloc states.    He emphasized that the world cannot be run by a single power  because this conflicts with the interests of countries, whether  on their national level, or the level of the international blocs.    He said the negative impact of the U.S. policy of hegemony  and undisputed domination has become clear. This policy, which  depends on the logic of force, has a negative impact on the  interests of other countries, as demonstrated in its domination  of the United Nations and the Security Council and the adoption  of resolutions that serve the U.S. politician without any  considerations for the interests of other countries. This has  happened and is happening now, represented in its insistence on  maintaining the siege against Iraq, the threat to use force  against Japan, and the intervention in Somali affairs.    The article emphasized that political and economic  developments in today's world, which the U.S. Administration  said will be stable and secure under the umbrella of its new  world order, reflect the falseness of these claims because it is  a chaotic world in which wars and military interventions prevail.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> HOW TO EASE TAXING TRAFFIC  </P> <P> Two members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors have their priorities  straight. They support an effort to put an important transportation measure  back on the ballot in November and clear off other revenue issues to give it  the best chance possible of passing. One other supervisor is leaning in their  direction, and we hope he joins them in a majority.  </P> <P> The measure, likely to be called Measure M, would increase the county's sales  taxes by half-a-cent for freeway and rail improvements. It failed 53% to 47%  last November, short of the majority needed. But the vote indicated a growing  support for a local tax to help alleviate the county's serious traffic  congestion problems. Hoping to play on that strength, Supervisors Thomas F.  Riley and Don R. Roth said this week that they wanted another vote this fall.  The transportation issue is so important that the board seems to agree that  bond issues for sorely needed jail and court construction and open space  purchases may have to wait.  </P> <P> While also agreeing that Measure M is vital, Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and  Roger R. Stanton want to wait until 1992 to put it back on the ballot. But that  seems too long; congestion is uppermost on people's minds. The swing vote  appears to be Gaddi H. Vasquez, who favors Measure M but is not sure of the  timing.  </P> <P> The board will decide Measure M's fate on Aug. 7. Whenever it goes on the  ballot, it faces an uphill battle.  </P> <P> Never has the county's traffic been worse. The passage in June of two statewide  propositions, 108 and 111, will pump added gas-tax money into some projects,  but much of that comes only if matched locally. That puts Orange County at a  disadvantage as the only urban county in the state without a sales tax  designated for transportation. So, make the tough decisions and strike while  the iron is hot.  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Libel action declined by HK lawyers THE integrity of Hong Kong's legal profession has been cast into doubt after nine of the colony's leading firms of solicitors declined to represent two elected Hong Kong politicians in a libel action. Mr Martin Lee and Mr Szeto Wah, the two senior members of the United Democrats, a pro-democracy party, claim that Mr Simon Li, a former Appeal Court judge, defamed them recently when he alleged they promoted a run on mainland Chinese banks in response to the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing in mid-1989. Ten days ago the two politicians said they would sue Mr Li for his remarks which they said were false. Mr Li is an 'adviser' to Beijing on Hong Kong affairs and was recently appointed to a high-level Sino-Hong Kong committee. Most of the firms have cited conflict of interest in declining to represent the two politicians because Mr Li sits on the board of a company for which they act. Some of the firms themselves have threatened legal action if their identities are disclosed.</p>

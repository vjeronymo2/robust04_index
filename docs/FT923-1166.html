			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Decline of the shop steward THE SHOP STEWARD could soon be consigned, like the strike, to the museum of industrial relations history. According to the semi-official 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, published yesterday, only 38 per cent of UK workplaces now have a shop steward - or senior staff representative - down from 54 per cent in 1984. The survey, which has taken two years to be processed, is the most authoritative analysis of UK industrial relations, based on 5,000 interviews with managers and employee representatives. The decline of the shop steward is seen as part of a broader decline in union influence which the survey attributes to changes in the law and the nature of the workplace. It reveals a reluctance among staff to take on the role, with a growing number of uncontested elections for stewards. In the larger workplaces surveyed - those with more than 25 employees - companies' recognition of unions for collective bargaining had slipped to 53 per cent by 1990, down from 66 per cent in 1984. However, this is put down to the closure of unionised plants rather than to derecognition. The survey's authors see no other system of industrial relations arising in the growing non-union sector, although 45 per cent of workplaces have introduced new employee involvement initiatives since 1984. There is also little evidence of the growth in 'non-standard' employment although part-time work has risen from 16 per cent to 18 per cent between 1984 and 1990. Where collective bargaining still exists, the survey finds little evidence of a trend towards plant-level bargaining, except in the private manufacturing sector. Nor is there evidence that unions are placing training and equal opportunities on the agenda. Although union power has been reduced it has not been wiped out and the nature of collective bargaining is comparatively unchanged where it exists. The number of non-redundancy dismissals has risen from nine per 1,000 in 1984 to 15 per 1,000 in 1990 but employees in unionised workplaces are two and a half times less likely to be dismissed. They are also less likely to be low paid - defined as paid less than Pounds 3.28 an hour - with 32 per cent of non-union companies having low-paid employees compared with 19 per cent of unionised.

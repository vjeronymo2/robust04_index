			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / China calls for summit over entry into world trade body China said yesterday that its negotiations to become a founder member of the World Trade Organisation next January faced stalemate unless government leaders in Beijing and Washington intervened directly. Speaking before a meeting in Jakarta today between President Bill Clinton of the US and President Jiang Zemin of China, Mr Long Yong Tu, Beijing's chief trade negotiator, said the talks had become so difficult that ministers and officials could not complete them on their own. He accused Washington of holding up the talks by making arbitrary and frequently changing demands. Although China offered what Mr Long called 'very important' concessions - including a sharp increase in the number of Chinese cities open to foreign banks - the US had not responded positively, he said. Mr Long also appeared cool towards recent US and EU suggestions that they would be ready, if necessary, to extend the talks beyond the end of this year. 'We are really at the end of our patience,' he said. He hinted that Beijing might even walk away from the talks if no further progress was made soon. 'We know China can do very well without Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).' However, Mr Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's trade representative, insisted that progress in the talks depended on China. He said after a meeting with Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, that most countries on the Gatt committee dealing with China's application agreed that Beijing had not moved far enough to open its market. Mr Long did not rule out making more concessions in talks with the US next month. However, he complained that every time China had sought to meet US demands, Washington had responded by asking for more. He also accused the US of 'double standards' in pursuing aggressive unilateral trade policies while claiming to uphold the world trade system. 'They never take Gatt seriously.'

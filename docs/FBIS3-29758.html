Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other Cabinet  members vowed to move forward with the policy. But the prime  minister said only major arms deals, not small ones, should be  subject to the barter trade policy. He said other government  agencies, not only the military, would also be required to  consider the possibility of barter trade negotiations.    Wichit, a non-MP and non-partisan member of the Chuan  Cabinet, claimed that "politics" was behind the show of  dissatisfaction by the generals over the trade policy. But the  defence minister would not elaborate.    "I don't want to talk about it," Wichit said when asked what  he thought had prompted the top brass to come out to attack the  government over the policy. "Even a neutral guy like me has  taken so much blame over this. This has been politicized. I am  working for the people's interest and the policy is a good one  which will benefit the country's economy."    On Monday, Army Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit  strongly criticized the Defence Ministry for having allegedly  failed to coordinate government and military discussions about  the counter trade policy.    "All the problems and confusion should be referred to the  permanent secretary for defence or the defence minister," Wimon  said. "I want to know how they interpret the government's  policy and whether they can explain it."    Last week, following a meeting of the Defence Council, a  policy-making body of military agencies, several top brass came  out to attack the policy as "impractical". They said the policy  would severely affect the armed forces plan to modernize their  weapons and delay arms purchases. The country's interest would  eventually be affected if the prices went up after the delay,  they said. They said no arms dealers would be interested in  bartering their weapons for Thai commodities. But government  leaders said the generals misunderstood the policy. The  government wanted only that the armed forces keep the Commerce  Ministry informed about their planned arms purchases. The  ministry and other agencies concerned could then try to  negotiate with the governments of the arms dealers to buy Thai  agricultural products in return.    Wichit said the policy should not be called "barter trade"  as  it would bring about confusion.    "The Nov 2 Cabinet resolution is clear-cut," Wichit said.  "They just want the armed forces to help government agencies  concerned to negotiate with the arms-selling countries to buy  our agriculture products."    Wimon and several generals have complained that their main  duty was to defend the country, not to conduct trade  negotiations. But Wichit said yesterday it should pose no  problem for the armed forces to help other government agencies  concerned in the negotiations.    "I've told the Cabinet that the Defence Ministry is not good  at trade negotiation. But I am also obliged to respond to the  need of other ministries concerned. We can help the ministries  carry out the negotiations in the first place because the armed  forces could tell the arms suppliers that their country should  buy some Thai products too," Wichit said    He said he had explained the government's policy to chiefs  of  staff of all the armed forces, and there should be no problem or  misunderstanding.    He said military attaches to Thai embassies in foreign  countries could also help in the counter trade negotiations.    Wimon had complained on Monday that all army purchase plans  had "bounced back".    Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa quoted Wichit as  telling the Cabinet that he wanted all arms purchases to be  carried out in line with the food-for-arms policy. But Chuan  told reporters yesterday the government wanted only major arms  purchases to be carried out in line with the counter trade  policy.    "If they want to buy only 100 to 200 rounds of cannon  ammunition, they don't have to negotiate for the counter trade,"  Chuan said.    "The defence minister has offered to consider by himself  which deals should be conducted under the counter trade policy.  So, the final decision on which deals should be subject to the  counter trade policy will depend on the minister. But if a deal  is only Bt1 or 2 million worth, no negations are needed."    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday  that the Air Force plan to purchase G-222 transport planes from  Alenia, an Italian firm, had to be further delayed. He said the  Thai government had to wait until Italy has a new government  before sending representatives to negotiate with the country to  buy Thai agriculture products in return for the plane purchase.    "The negotiation may take place next month or in April,"  Suphachai said. "The Air Force will not be affected because we  will at least be able to buy the planes on the same quotation."    The deputy prime minister said the government only wanted to  help farmers with its barter trade policy.</p>

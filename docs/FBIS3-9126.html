			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Zoran Vaskovic report] </F>   [Text] A total of 128 deputies supported the government by  a show of hands, 77 were against, while 30 deputies refrained  from voting. At the end of the marathon debate, just before the  vote was taken, Prime Minister-designate Mirko Marjanovic  addressed the assembly.    [Begin Marjanovic recording] This long debate has  strengthened my conviction and my resolve to adhere to the main  course of the program and the stable dinar. We do not see an  alternative to this program, because by establishing monetary  sovereignty and macroeconomic stabilization, it paves the way  toward a modern market economy which is the only thing that will  lead to a lasting increase of the national revenue, employment,  and the citizens' living standard. We are aware of all the  difficulties. Do not expect us to conduct a policy which would  take us back into hyperinflation or into an administrative  economy and society. We believe that this year, the policy of a  stable dinar will motivate and economically compel a great  number of companies to be more successful despite the sanctions.  It is a good omen that the business community itself is now  displaying more optimism and is announcing an increase in  orders, production, greater use of equipment, and an increase in  export. We anticipate that all this, accompanied by a  successful agricultural year, will give us the chance to see --  after a hiatus of several years -- a rise in the national  revenue, in stable, therefore, not inflatory conditions. As far  as our resolve to insist on a stable dinar is concerned, this  government will do its part of the job and will cooperate  closely with the Federal Government, the Montenegrin Government,  and, of course, with the Yugoslav National Bank regarding all  issues that fall within their respective domains. The  government will treat every failure connected to the program as  its personal failure. We shall organize ourselves in such a way  that we will be able to follow the implementation of the program  on a daily basis and make the necessary adjustments. We shall  regularly inform you of this. We accept all criticism and  suggestions that can help the implementation of the program.  [end recording]    In addition to the prime minister, the new republican  government comprises five deputy prime ministers, 20 ministers,  and another four ministers without portfolio.</p>

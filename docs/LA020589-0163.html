			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LEFTY DRIESELL IS BACK DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST  </P> <P> In about every way possible, Lefty Driesell is back. He's back coaching, two  years after being forced out at Maryland; he's back building a home, and  rebuilding a team at an obscure basketball school; he's back in the area for  two games this week, beginning Wednesday night at Navy.  </P> <P> As he eventually did at Davidson, as he quickly did at Maryland, the Lefthander  has James Madison aflutter with anticipation. Three terrific teams did the  school proud several years ago but few beyond the campus gave much notice; the  new coach, with his fresh start, brings national attention simply by being  himself.  </P> <P> To some, Driesell is seen as a sad figure forced to salvage a reputation at a  fairly advanced age (57) in a second-level conference. History would have been  very kind to him, with that 70-plus winning percentage in 748 games, had he  stayed inactive. Also, each time Maryland retreats under Bob Wade, Driesell's  tarnished image gets cleaner.  </P> <P> To many (me included), Driesell's step was just short of noble, assuming he  still cares deeply about athletics and athletes and brings to this job the  intensity and integrity he did at Davidson and most of his years at Maryland.  </P> <P> Driesell is "having fun," he said over the phone the other day, "with a great  bunch of kids who have exceeded expectations." Reality could be sweet, that 3-4  record in the Colonial Athletic Association something special had fate been  more helpful and the foul shooting not so crooked. Two of those CAA losses were  in overtime, the others by a total of seven points.  </P> <P> Because he delivered so grandly at Davidson and so soon at Maryland, Driesell  is supposed to boost James Madison into a conference champion and top-25  contender nationally in another couple of years.  </P> <P> JMU's immediate future has names. Two of them are William Davis, a freshman  guard averaging about 15 points per game, and Jeff Chambers, a 6-foot-8 recruit  from Maryland's Eastern Shore about whom Driesell gushes: "He'll be a super  player."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Driesell, times are not the same these days in college  basketball as they were when he was lifting Davidson, in the early '60s, and  Maryland, in the early '70s. New rules, many of them very good, conspire  against underdog programs such as JMU's.  </P> <P> "When I was at Davidson," he said, "I could see a kid any time I wanted. Take  him out to eat. Get to know him. It was a pain (because of so much travel), but  a way to get to know a kid personally and for him and his parents to get to  know me.  </P> <P> "I'd get a Fred Hetzel (from the Washington area) by shooting around with him.  By taking his parents to dinner. By being around enough to get him to say: 'Why  don't I sign with this guy?' ;;  </P> <P> Those were the days when a workaholic such as Driesell could rise to the top  almost on sheer energy. A former assistant at Boston College, for instance, saw  a prospect two dozen times -- and never offered him a scholarship; Moses Malone  and some other high school sensations visited so many colleges they became  known as "America's Guests."  </P> <P> Then came reform. Too much change, naturally enough, to suit Driesell in his  present position. Too many restrictions, on the recruiters and on those being  recruited.  </P> <P> "I can only watch a player at certain times," Driesell said. "Some of those  times I can't even speak to him, or to his parents sitting in the stands. I can  visit only so many times in the home.  </P> <P> "I can only have 15 kids (per season) visit campus. My first year at Maryland  there were something like 40 visits. People were curious. I only have seven  visits left; I have three or four scholarships left. Which means I've got to  sign one kid for every two that visits."  </P> <P> Another quirk in recruiting is this: If JMU signee Chambers wants to watch JMU  play at Navy Wednesday night, he must buy a ticket. Or Navy must be the team to  leave him a freebie.  </P> <P> "I told (Navy Coach) Pete Herrmann if he left one (for Chambers), I'd do the  same when he signed somebody (close to JMU)," Driesell said.  </P> <P> To become nationally prominent, James Madison must attract at least a few of  the players who might otherwise gravitate to one of the traditional powers. Or  do a superior job of coaching overlooked prospects with potential.  </P> <P> Intense basketball watchers know that Driesell at JMU actually has a fairly  tough act to emulate, if not immediately follow. Before leaving for California  after the 1985 season, Lou Campanelli had a string of NCAA tournament teams.  One beat Georgetown (in 1981); another lost to eventual-champion North Carolina  (in 1982).  </P> <P> That plays on Driesell's mind. Knowing at least three terrific players will  come flying ontothe scene next season is a comfort. Still, he recalls JMU's  strong, though mostly ignored, performance in the early '80s and says, quietly:  "So we have to get back there."  </P></p>

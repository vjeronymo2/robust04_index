			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Data surprise rouses Treasuries The US Treasury market was shaken out of its holiday slumber yesterday by two stronger-than-expected readings on the economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 9/32 to 98 3/4 , with the yield rising to 6.339 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  3/32 to 99 31/32 , to yield 4.25 per cent. Dealers said the downward trend was not indicative of any fundamental shift in sentiment, as the day's economic news merely reinforced a well-established view of the economy's fourth-quarter performance. The extent of the price erosion was more a reflection of the thin level of trading. Nevertheless, after two days of shrugging off unfavourable news, the market reacted sharply to the Commerce Department's news on new-home sales. These had surged in November to their highest annual level in more than seven years. The Labor Department, meanwhile, said claims for unemployment benefit had fallen sharply last week, confounding expectations of no change. The index-linked sector provided the main focus of attention in the UK government bond market yesterday, as the Bank of England announced a further Pounds 750m of index-linked stock available for sale today. The four taps are: Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked treasury stock due 2001; Pounds 250m of 4 3/8 per cent index-linked treasury stock due 2004; Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked treasury stock due 2013; and Pounds 200m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked treasury stock due 2030. The sector was firm early in the day, gaining about  3/8 of a point. 'There's good demand for index-linkers at the moment because of continued optimism that real rates will fall further,' said one gilt market specialist. French government bond futures climbed to new highs, buoyed by a firm franc and expectations of an easing in interest rates early in the new year. The March 10-year bond futures contract broke through the 131.00 level to reach a high of 131.04, but ended the day at 130.94, up 0.12 in quite thin trade. The announcement yesterday of poor unemployment figures had little impact on the market, dealers said. The jobless rate was unchanged at 12 per cent.</p>

Special messages from His Majesty the King of Cambodia and  the Secretary General of the United Nations were addressed to  the meeting.  <H5>  I. Situation in Cambodia </H5>   1. The participants welcomed the establishment of the Royal  Government of Cambodia in accordance with the Constitution  adopted by the Constituent Assembly, whose members were chosen  through the elections of May 1993, all in strict conformity with  the agreements on a comprehensive political settlement of the  Cambodia conflict. They paid high and respective tribute to His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, for his eminent  leadership in successfully completing the peace process. They  expressed their most sincere wishes for his rapid recovery and  his return to his people as soon as possible.    2. The participants unanimously expressed their full support  to the only legitimate government of Cambodia and to its two  prime ministers, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh and  his Excellency Mr. Hun Sen, in their joint efforts for national  reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. They expressed their hope  that through these efforts Cambodia will fully recover its  stability, prosperity and security throughout its territory.  <H5>  II. Necessity for Enhanced International Assistance </H5>   3. The participants paid respectful attention to His Majesty  the King's message addressed to the meeting and fully took note  of the priority sectors and activities mentioned in his message.    4. The participants shared the view that the reconstruction  of the devastated national economy is the chief and  indispensable component for achieving peace, stability and  national reconstruction, and thus, constitutes an integral part  of the implementation of the Paris peace accords. The  international community which has fully committed itself to the  peace process should strengthen its assistance to the  reconstruction of Cambodia in order to consolidate the fruits of  the peace process.    5. The participants welcomed the reports by the Cambodian  delegation and the international organizations on the progress  in Cambodia's economic reform policy. They particularly took  note of the further progress in transition to market economy and  trade liberalization as well as the enhanced tax revenue and the  reduction of monetary financing of the budget which resulted in  improved macroeconomic stability, namely reduced inflation rates  and stable exchange rates. They shared the view that such  determined and substantial adjustment efforts should continue  and deserve strengthened international assistance.    6. The main source of Cambodia's medium-term economic growth  and reduction of poverty resides in the agricultural sector.  Particular emphasis should be put on the development of this  sector as well as on the improvement of the infrastructure,  especially the transport and water infrastructure, which will  create a greater capacity for economic growth. This will also  enable the benefits of growth to spread throughout the country.    In this connection, with a view to promoting the  development of human resources, the participants stressed the  need to formulate long-term policies for sustainable development  of the basic social sectors, giving priority to health and  education, while at the same time meeting the most pressing  requirements. They concurred that well-targeted and  well-coordinated international assistance, taking fully into  account these priorities, and implemented with the participation  of the beneficiaries, is called for.    The participants stressed the vulnerable position of women  in  their double roles as mothers and income-providers and that  these double roles have to be taken into account both in  formulating development strategies and in the implementation of  projects.    7. In this respect, the participants recognized that  capacity building involving equal attention to the contributions  of women is of crucial importance in achieving market-oriented  reforms, in pursuing the goal of reconstruction in a coordinated  manner and in effectively absorbing international aid. In this  regard, they commended the continuing efforts of the ADB and the  UNDP in the implementation, in close association with the IMF,  of the technical assistance for strengthening marco-economic  management. They reaffirmed that this is an area requiring full  and sustained international assistance, particularly technical  assistance.    8. The participants noted with satisfaction the joint  statement by the UN resident coordinator on behalf of all UN  agencies resident in Cambodia as it demonstrates the  increasingly coordinated approach adopted by these agencies in  support of Cambodia's reconstruction and development efforts.  <H5>  III. Financial Requirements of Cambodia </H5>   9. The participants highly appreciated the government's  efforts for preparing its strategy document entitled "The  National Program To Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia."    10. The participants commended the World Bank for its  intensive efforts to harmonize its economic work with the need  for support to ICORC, in particular by preparing a comprehensive  report on the economic situation in Cambodia describing priority  projects and programs in all the sectors of Cambodia's  development and reconstruction, and by assisting the chair in  compiling pledges made by the participants.    11. The donors expressed their full and clear support to the  ambitious economic and social development and reform program  elaborated by the Cambodian authorities and pledged a total  amount of approximately 486 million U.S. dollars of aid  projects and programs for 1994.    12. The participants welcomed the progress in the  discussions between the IMF and the Cambodian Government on a  policy framework paper leading to a loan program under an ESAF  [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] arrangement of  approximately 120 million dollars over 1994-1996. They also  welcomed the intention of the World Bank to extend a new  structural adjustment lending of approximately 60 million  dollars provided that an agreement is reached on the medium-term  reform policy. They also noted the ADB's operational program  which envisages a lending level for the medium- term (1994-1997)  amounting to about 266 million dollars.  <H5>  IV. Specific Issues </H5>   13. The participants acknowledged that mines are one of the  serious obstacles to the reconstruction efforts of Cambodia.  They recognized the urgency of demining to free land for the  resettlement of refugees for the expansion of agriculture and  for the reduction of mine casualties. They acknowledged that  the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) continued to need  international assistance and support through funding and/or  provision of experts. They strongly condemned any laying of new  mines.    Based on this recognition, an amount of 5.4 million dollars  had already been deposited in the UNDP Trust Fund. New pledges  of approximately 15 million dollars have been announced as  assistance to CMAC through various channels including the UNDP  Trust Fund or NGO [nongovernmental organization] projects. In  addition the UNDP is financing a capacity building program from  its own resources amounting to 800,000 dollars. Some countries  announced plans to dispatch experts. It is expected that a  total of 30 technical advisers will be in the field.    14. The participants shared the view that the international  community, in the spirit of Rio declaration and acting in  conformity with the recent International Action Plans and  Agreements on the Environment, including Agenda 21 and Framework  Convention on Climate Change, should cooperate and strengthen  aspects of environment protection in their assistance program.  They welcomed the first participation of Cambodia in the Ninth  Session of International Negotiating Committee for a Framework  Convention on Climate Change in February.    They encouraged the Mekong Secretariat and other bilateral  and multilateral agencies to continue and enhance their present  efforts in the environmental sector. Particular attention  should be paid to the conservation of the water, flora and fauna  of the Tonle-Sap Lake and its surroundings as well as to the  proper management of the tropical forests in Cambodia. In this  regard they welcomed the intention of the Government of Cambodia  to become a member of the International Tropical Timber  Organization (ITTO).    15. The participants welcomed the appointment of a special  representative of the secretary general of the United Nations  pursuant to Resolution 1993/6 of the Commission of Human Rights.  They shared the view that the establishment of the Cambodia  field office of the United Nations Human Rights Center, with the  agreement of the Cambodian Government, was important, in the  present juncture, and that it should be properly funded in order  to enhance respect for human rights as well as for the rule of  law.    16. The participants congratulated the NGO's, both foreign  and Cambodian, on their important role in the development of  Cambodia in the past and expressed the hope that this would  continue and expand in the future.  <H5>  V. Next meeting </H5>   17. The participants agreed that the next ICORC meeting will  be held in Paris, hosted by France next year.    The participants underlined the importance of ICORC as a  gathering to give political impetus to the international  assistance to Cambodia.    The participants also urged the World Bank to bring, in  connection with the other international agencies, a strong  technical support to reinforce the effectiveness of the  international assistance, having in mind the constitution, in  due course, of a consultative group.</p>

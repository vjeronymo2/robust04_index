			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: SOVIET RIDERS BACK IN THE SADDLE -- IN U.S.  </P> <P> Gennadi Moiseev showed that Soviet motocross was competitive when he won three  world 250cc championships in 1974, '77 and '78 and led his team to the  Motocross des Nations world championship in 1978.  </P> <P> Moiseev rode a KTM, an Austrian make, but when friction developed between the  KTM factory and the Soviet cycling federation in 1979, Soviet racing took a  nosedive.  </P> <P> "The interest in motocross has been there, and the desire, but without new  equipment or new parts for the old equipment, there was nothing we could do,"  Moiseev said Wednesday through interpreter Anna Borjeson.  </P> <P> "I won my last Grand Prix in 1979 in Bulgaria, but the trouble started right  after that between KTM and the federation."  </P> <P> Moiseev, who won 14 world championship motos, remains a national sports hero in  the Soviet Union. When he rode in his final Grand Prix in his hometown of  Leningrad, the event drew more than 200,000 spectators.  </P> <P> Now, as a result of glasnost and perestroika, Moiseev is in Southern California  with two of the Soviet Union's leading riders, Viesturs Gaushis of Latvia and  Andres Krestinov of Estonia, who are entered in the 500cc Motul U.S. Grand Prix  of Motocross Aug. 25-26 at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. They will ride  Hondas provided by the U. S. distributor.  </P> <P> Roger DeCoster, former five-time world champion and promoter of the 500cc  event, is also coach of the American Honda team, which includes Supercross  champion Jeff Stanton and former multinational champion Rick Johnson.  </P> <P> Gaushis, a lookalike for tennis star Boris Becker, won the Soviet championship  in 1987 but was not permitted to ride internationally because he was from  Latvia.  </P> <P> "No riders from the Baltic States were selected to ride on the Soviet national  team the last few years," said George Mazo, who with Moiseev has formed an  organization called Cross to promote and develop Soviet motocross, both amateur  and professional. Moiseev is chairman of the board, Mazo the managing director.  </P> <P> "Our first objective is to get some good equipment and establish a relationship  with the Japanese manufacturers," Mazo said. "Motocross is the No. 1 sport in  the western Soviet Union, especially the Baltic States, where there are cycle  clubs in every little town. Most people ride a motorcycle as their  transportation, so they enjoy racing them, too.  </P> <P> "The citizens in that region are also influenced by TV from Finland, which  shows many European motorcycle events. There are thousands of potential racers,  if only we could get something worth riding."  </P> <P> Most Soviets ride a Czechoslovakian-made CZ, which was DeCoster's bike when he  first began racing in his native Belgium. But the evolution of Japanese bikes  such as Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki in the past 20 years has made the CZ  all but obsolete in competition. The last time a non-Japanese bike won the  500cc championship was 1974, when Heikki Mikkola of Finland rode a Husqvarna.  </P> <P> "We are hoping that the race here will give our two best riders a taste of  Grand Prix racing and start getting them ready to race the full season next  year," Moiseev said. "We want to return the Soviet Union to the world  championship circuit and plan to bid for a race in 1992 for Leningrad."  </P> <P> Moiseev has ridden twice in the United States, in world 250cc Grand Prix events  at Unadilla, N.Y., finishing sixth and third, but did not ride in the 500cc  races in Carlsbad, where the world championship was contested between 1973 and  '86.  </P> <P> Even though the world has been opened up for Soviet riders, it is still  difficult for them to travel aboard.  </P> <P> "Moiseev and the riders could not purchase tickets to Los Angeles because there  was no way to do it," explained Arne Larsson, a Swedish businessman who is  acting as liaison between Cross and American race officials and cycle  manufacturers. "The tickets had to be purchased here and sent to them in the  Soviet Union. Even so, they could not fly direct. It took 30 hours and four  changes of planes, first from Moscow to Ireland, then Ireland to Cuba and Cuba  to Mexico City and Mexico City to Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Gaushis and Krestinov, both 27, will work out on new Honda bikes at the  factory's training track in Simi Valley until next Thursday, when they will  test the 2,030-meter track laid out by DeCoster in Glen Helen Park.  </P> <P> Eric Geboers, who clinched his fifth world championship two weeks ago on his  home course in Namur, Belgium, will head the 40-rider field. Geboers, who won  125cc championships in 1982 and '83, the 250cc in '87 and his first 500cc in  '88, also won the U. S. Grand Prix two years ago when it was held at Hollister,  Calif.  </P> <P> The riders will practice on Aug. 25, with the first moto at 1 p.m. the  following day.  </P> <P> SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Shawn Moran led three U.S. riders into the World Finals when  he won the Intercontinental Final last Sunday in Denmark. World champion Hans  Nielsen of Denmark finished third, with U.S. riders Rick Miller fifth and  Ronnie Correy tied for sixth. The World Finals will be on Sept. 1 at Bradford,  England.  </P> <P> Gary Hicks of Riverside, who has been riding for Kings Lynn in the British  Speedway League, returned home to ride tonight at Ascot Park's South Bay  Stadium and Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- U.S. Auto Club midgets and three-quarter midgets will share the  program Saturday night at Ventura Raceway. The TQ will feature Gary Schroeder  of Burbank, who became the winningest TQ rider in USAC history when he won his  14th main event at Ascot last month; Scott Hansen of Simi Valley, winner of the  last USAC race at Ventura, and Jay Drake of Val Verde, the series leader.  Sleepy Tripp, winner of seven of 28 races, is favored in the full midget 30-lap  main event.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- California Racing Assn. cars and drivers will have a busy  weekend with a 30-lap main event Friday night at Bakersfield Speedway in  Oildale and another one Saturday night at Santa Maria Speedway. When Bob Meli  won last Saturday night, it was the Temple City veteran's first victory at  Ascot since 1979. . . . Mitch Culp of Rowland Heights is recuperating in Harbor  General Hospital after surgery Monday for a broken back suffered during last  week's Ascot time trials.  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLES -- The final TT steeplechase of Ascot Park's long history of  American Motorcyclist Assn. events will be held Saturday night for amateurs and  professionals on the infield course. . . .

The featured car will be the British Allard, which won at Pebble Beach  in 1951 and '52. Seven races will be held on both Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- Marcus Mallett took a big step toward becoming Ascot Park's first  black track champion with a come-from-behind victory last week, his seventh of  the season. Sunday night, he will be back for another Winston Racing Series pro  stock main event. . . .

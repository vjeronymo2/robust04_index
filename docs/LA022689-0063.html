			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> TALKING TOMBSTONES and Other Tales of the Media Age by Gary Gumpert (Oxford  University Press: $7.95)  </P> <P>  "Each medium of communication leaves its mark by altering our institutions and  personal attitudes and values," writes Gary Gumpert in this lively collection  of essays.  </P> <P> Gumpert illustrates how technological advances distort values and ethics. Does  the instant replay during a ballgame mark the end of sportsmanship or mar "the  wisdom and accuracy" of referees or officials? Is truth represented when "  'on-the-spot' coverage involves fragmenting an incident and restructuring the  pieces into a television event"?  </P> <P> "We as individuals are not in control of the technological environment in which  we find ourselves," Gumpert concludes. But in "Talking Tombstones," he hopes to  jar readers to question the media technology that surrounds us.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION IS THE KEY  </P> <P> Orange County leaders would do well to carefully study the results of a recent  survey of the county's Latino community. While many areas of concern were  examined, including housing, employment and health, the bottom line was this:  Education is the most important way to bring the Latino community into the  county's economic and political mainstream.  </P> <P> At the same time, the survey outlined severe shortcomings -- ranging from  language problems in elementary schools to student-dropout rates -- in  providing the know-how Latinos need to compete in this area's ever more  technological marketplace. The failure to adequately address these educational  problems affects not only the Latino community but all of Orange County.  </P> <P> The comprehensive two-year study, the first of its kind in the county, was  conducted by the nonprofit Tomas Rivera Center in Claremont. In all, 400  residents and 120 Latino leaders were interviewed. Finally, groups of leaders  participated in "focus groups" aimed at assessing the needs and priorities of  the county's Latinos. The findings are expected to be used as a resource by 200  county public and private policy-setting agencies in dealing with the county's  440,000 Latinos.  </P> <P> The survey revealed some interesting findings. For example, it found that  discrimination was felt more strongly among Latinos who had spent more time in  the educational system, although no explanation was given for this. It noted  that, while the number of poor Latinos is extremely high, the county is also  home to some of the wealthiest Latinos in California -- a reflection of the  area's general affluence. And the survey found that traffic congestion, a  nearly obsessive concern among Orange Countians in general, was of minor import  to Latinos. They simply had more pressing things to think about.  </P> <P> But the most compelling results outlined by the survey touched on education.  Less than half of the Latinos in Orange County surveyed said they had completed  the 12th grade, while 7% indicated they have never attended school at all. On  the average, Latinos completed the freshman year in high school.  </P> <P> The survey also noted that many minority children are not prepared to enter  schools whose environment and language are foreign to them.  </P> <P> While calling upon additional help from government, charities and private  enterprise, the Latinos leaders surveyed looked to themselves as part of the  solution. They saw that more Latino representation on local school boards was  needed, as well as a continuing demand for teachers who are better prepared to  deal with a multi-ethnic school population.  </P> <P> Latino leaders also came up with many noteworthy recommendations, particularly  those that emphasized that educational intervention should take place in early  childhood. Specifically, they suggested increasing bilingual education,  starting dropout- prevention programs at the lower grade levels and increasing  early intervention programs designed to improve student achievement.  </P> <P> The survey is a thorough and serious look at the county's largest minority  population. It should be used as a guide for future programs aimed at opening  up opportunities to all of Orange County's residents.  </P></p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Robins returning to the president's lawn WHEN incumbent President Jimmy Carter lost the 1980 election, the Misery Index - the sum of inflation and unemployment  - had reached almost 20 per cent. It is now hovering around 10 per cent, suggesting that President George Bush has a much greater chance of retaining power in November. Mr Bush's campaign managers, however, would be the first to admit that the economy is a headache. On some measures, consumer confidence is languishing at its lowest level for 17 years. Real per capita incomes have not grown since Mr Bush was elected. Perhaps the most fertile source of economic discontent is a growing awareness that top earners creamed off much of the increase in national income during the past decade. Figures from the Congressional Budget Office show that the bottom four-fifths of the population received a meagre 6 per cent of the total increase in post-tax incomes between 1977 and 1989. The Bush team also must contend with a business cycle that has stubbornly defied its predictions. A year ago, Mr Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser, confidently forecast a sustained recovery beginning last spring. By now the economy was supposed to be growing at an annual rate of 3-4 per cent, giving voters renewed confidence in Republican economic management. Instead the recovery fizzled out last August, leaving the economy becalmed for two quarters. The good news, in the memorable words of Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, is that robins are back on the lawn again. Signs of recovery have proliferated in recent weeks. The most unexpected was last Friday's much better than expected employment report. Employment surged by 164,000 last month, compared with analysts' expectations of a gain of 10,000. Some of the gain was doubtful: the increase of 133,000 jobs in retailing may reflect faulty adjustments. Nevertheless, the overall increase in jobs - and in hours worked - suggests incomes and production are rising. The employment jump followed a surge in the Purchasing Managers' Index, a reliable barometer of industrial health. The index seems to have broken decisively through the 50 per cent level, which is the threshold for an expanding manufacturing economy. A broad leading employment index compiled by economists at Columbia University also rose sharply last month. The Commerce Department's composite index of leading indicators was up noticeably in January, after falling in the previous two months. Residential housing has shown definite signs of improvement. New home sales rose 12.9 per cent in January to an annual rate of 612,000, the highest level for nearly two years. Boosted by lower mortgage rates, home sales are running about 20 per cent higher than last summer. Housing starts and building permits are also up significantly. The evidence of recovery in other sectors is more tentative. Retail sales rose 0.6 per cent in January and were revised up in previous months. Encouraging reports from department stores suggest another increase last month. Car sales seemed to be improving early in February but lost momentum towards the end of the month. Many analysts are also cheered by more rapid growth of the money supply. Bank reserves and M1, the narrowest measure of money, are growing at double-digit rates. More important, M2, a broader aggregate that has a closer historical relationship with economic activity, has moved toward the centre of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range. These are encouraging signs. But there are many reasons to fear that any recovery will be lacklustre. The Federal Reserve is especially agitated by the fragility of confidence in the bond market - probably a reflection of deteriorating fiscal trends. In spite of falling inflation, long bond yields have risen since early January and are again only a whisker below 8 per cent. This has led to a fresh upward move in mortgage rates which is choking off the housing recovery - which, in any case, is much less robust than usual because of chronic overbuilding of offices, hotels and residential apartment blocks. Consumer fundamentals are also poor. Savings rates and confidence are low. Incomes are static. Debt burdens are still at historically high levels. Unlike in previous recessions, there will be no big lift from a loosening of fiscal policy. If tax cuts are agreed this year - which is still doubtful - they will be minuscule. The bottom line is that Mr Bush can probably reckon on a weak recovery in the second half of this year, with gross domestic product growing at an annual rate of 2-3 per cent. But such a recovery could fizzle out as happened last year. Even if it does not, it may seem feeble to an electorate reared on post-war recoveries that typically saw growth spurts of 6 per cent or more. The economic signs are thus positive but not sufficiently so to prevent the leading Democrats from capitalising on recent disappointments.</p>

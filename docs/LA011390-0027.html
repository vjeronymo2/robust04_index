			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> NELSON AND KRISTOFFERSON DRAW A 'PAIR OF ACES'  </P> <P> Gritty Willie Nelson and flinty Kris Kristofferson are the entitled "Pair of  Aces" in the CBS Sunday movie (8-10 p.m.). But the story is so lame and languid  that only staunch fans of the stars will find reason to keep tuned.  </P> <P> Nelson's down-home con man and Kristofferson's sturdy Texas Ranger are  reluctant comrades in the manhunt for a serial killer of high school  cheerleaders. That may sound lurid, but don't be deceived. The biggest thrill  in this show is watching Nelson slip out of handcuffs.  </P> <P> As a team hitched together like a ball and chain, the stars do rub off well  together, rumbling around the scenic woods and farmlands outside Austin, where  the film was shot. But the only excuse for this movie is the gnarly byplay  between ol' Willie and Kris. The plot lacks any other redeeming quality, and  that includes supporting actor Rip Torn, in a throwaway parody of a crusty  retired Ranger that Torn phones in.  </P> <P> Cliches in the script by Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright abound: among them, a  couple of cackling yahoos in a pickup, a pool hall full of rough bikers, a  corruptible D.A., a rebellious daughter -- even, in the movie's most dismaying  moment, a bunch of rangers at an outdoor barbecue sitting around singing songs  in the twilight, like an outtake from an Autry Western.  </P> <P> One moment, however, is indeed genuine. It occurs when the grizzled Nelson  takes Kristofferson's older, troubled daughter (Jane Cameron) and endearingly  whirls her around the room to a dance record. Director Aaron Lipstadt earns at  least half a stripe right there. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

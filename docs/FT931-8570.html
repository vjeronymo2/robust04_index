			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Higher volume lifts Teleglobe earnings 50% TELEGLOBE, Canada's fast-expanding international telecommunications group, earned CDollars 18m (USDollars 14m) or 34 cents a share in the final quarter of 1992, up 50 per cent from CDollars 12m or 26 cents a share a year earlier, on a revenue gain of 11 per cent to CDollars 143m. The gains came from rising telecommunications volume and lower financial charges. Operating profits for 1992 came to CDollars 30.6m or 72 cents a share up from CDollars 25.7m or 54 cents a share the year before, on revenues of CDollars 489m, up 12 per cent. But net restructuring charges of CDollars 81m brought attributable losses for the year of CDollars 50.6m or CDollars 1.19 a share. Newbridge Networks, a Canadian-based international telecommunications equipment producer, earned CDollars 34.5m or 96 cents a share in the nine months ended January 31, up from CDollars 5.1m or 15 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 207m, up from CDollars 129m, because of major contract deliveries. SHL Systemhouse, a big Canadian systems integrator, plans expansion in Mexico and other Latin American countries, besides the US and Europe. Norcen, an international energy group controlled by Edper-Hees, reports net profits of CDollars 38.9m for 1992 against CDollars 44.1m for 1991, on revenues of CDollars 1bn against CDollars 976m.</p>

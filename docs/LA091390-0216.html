			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STUDENTS DO WRITE THING FOR MARINES  </P> <P> For the student body of MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate School, the Persian  Gulf crisis has become a history lesson unfolding before their eyes.  </P> <P> But the students also have become personally involved by writing letters to  local Marines who have been sent to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 letters will be hand-delivered to the El Toro Marine Corps Air  Station on Friday afternoon by Principal Thomas Reasin and several student  government leaders. They will then be delivered overseas, Assistant Principal  Jane Russo said.  </P> <P> "This project makes current events come alive in the classroom," Russo said.  "These kids are going to know where the Persian Gulf is geographically and are  not going to forget where any of those countries are. They are going to know  the situation and understand it."  </P> <P> In addition to the letters, students will enclose pictures of themselves and  will provide the Marines with self-addressed, stamped envelopes and paper with  the hopes of establishing correspondence.  </P></p>

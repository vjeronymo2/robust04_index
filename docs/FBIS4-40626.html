			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "CIS" rubric: </F> "Russian Mass Media Favor Wrong Men. Konstantin Zatulin  Becomes Still Dearer to Sergey Shakhray"]    [Text] A press conference by Konstantin Zatulin, Duma CIS  Affairs Committee chairman, was devoted to presidential  elections in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus]. The last week  before them, the Duma man thought, will be decisive. In both  sovereign republics there are two main candidates for the lofty  position: Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Kuchma in Ukraine, and Mr.  Kebich and Mr. Lukashenko in Belorussia. Mr. Zatulin pointed  out the high probability that a second round of voting in both  countries may be required to determine the winners, whereas just  recently no one doubted the victory of Mr. Kuchma and Mr. Kebich.    From then on, however, the committee head remarked, it is  the  Russian mass media that played a negative role. For example,  the media resolutely sided with Leonid Kravchuk although, Mr.  Zatulin thought, "Ukraine's policy under this president has been  marked by craftiness and a lack of sincerity, and by the desire  to oppose Russia in things big and small, from the United  Nations, to NATO, to the CIS. Leonid Kuchma's program calling  for closer and friendlier links between an independent Ukraine  and Russia is liked much more by the Duma man. The latest  "pro-Kravchuk" publications in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and especially television's Channel One's  taking a program about Mr. Kuchma off the air, appear more than  strange to him.    Also obvious is Mr. Zatulin's Belorussian affection --  Vyacheslaw Kebich. Albeit he cannot understand a few things  there: Why should the Duma, on a cue from the Agrarian faction,  give the floor to the chief opponent of today's Belorussian  premier, that "local version of Gdlyan." The CIS Committee head  likened Aleksandr Lukashenko's report with the report of his  fellow committee chairman, Mr. Ilyukhin, head of the Security  Committee, during the reading of the Law on Combating  Corruption, referring to both as "a method of squaring accounts  with entrepreneurship." Mr. Lukashenko's victory would mean  compromising the idea of mending fences between Belorussia and  Russia, concluded Mr. Zatulin. He also pointed to the danger of  a polarization of the heretofore calm Belorussian society once  supporters of recent speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich and of  People's Front leader Zenon Poznyak unite on one flank.    In winding up, Konstantin Zatulin explained his quitting as  executive secretary of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  faction in the State Duma by his being too busy in the CIS  Committee, in the party, etc. He specially stressed the absence  of differences with Sergey Shakhray, and even pointed out the  now established harmony because resignations are something the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord has come to live with.</p>

China, he added, hoped  that the issue would not go to the UN Security Council.    While some difficulties had appeared in talks on this issue,  all the parties concerned should show patience and adopt a  constructive attitude and dialogue should be continued on a  basis of equality. Neither side should pressure the other as  this only aggravated the situation and would not help solve the  problem.    The maintenance of peace and stability in the Korean  peninsula was in conformity with the interests of the Korean  people and those of the other parties concerned. China would  not agree to any actions including military manoevres which  would harm peace and stability there.    China's consistent position, he said, was to hope for a  relaxation of the situation and stability in the Korean  peninsula. China was for the peninsula to be a nonnuclear region  and the solving of the nuclear inspection issue through  dialogue. China had, he added, made every effort for the  solution of this issue according to the above principles, but  its role was limited.</p>

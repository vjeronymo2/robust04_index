			<p>BFN     [Text] In compliance with the National Assembly Standing  Committee's system of coordination for periodic meetings between  state organs, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh and Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet co-chaired a meeting held on 9 May 1994 to  discuss implementing a resolution of the Ninth National  Assembly's fourth session on practicing thrift and fighting  wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling.    Present at the meeting were National Assembly vice-chairmen;  deputy prime ministers; the chief judge of the Supreme People's  Court; the procurator of the Supreme People's Organ of Control;  members of the National Assembly Standing Committee; and leading  cadres of various relevant ministries, departments, and sectors.    The meeting heard a report and exchanged views on the issue  of practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, and on a  question which was raised at a meeting held in April on how  various cases of corruption and smuggling have been dealt with.    As for efforts to discover various cases of corruption and  smuggling and the orientations for continually dealing with  various newly-discovered cases of corruption and smuggling,  especially cases of car and motorcycle smuggling in a number of  localities and units, and based on suggestions made at the  meeting and given the need to scrupulously implement the  National Assembly resolution in this domain, the chairman of the  National Assembly and the prime minister drew conclusions on the  following issues:    1. In compliance with the National Assembly resolution,  together with the administration at all levels and relevant  sectors, the government and law protection organs have in the  past made great efforts and taken positive measures to discover  and deal with cases of corruption and smuggling, thus helping  overcome the slow legal process against various cases. However,  what has been done so far are just initial efforts, and they are  still not enough to stop these bad practices. In the period  ahead, it is necessary to accelerate efforts to look into and  take legal action against those serious cases still left in the  backlog as well as those newly-discovered cases. To achieve  this aim, we must devote more time to scrutinizing, supervising,  and discovering such cases. We must promptly take legal action  against those cases which are already evident, continue to try  those cases whose legal procedures have not yet been completed,  and urgently enforce court sentences on those cases already  tried while paying appropriate attention to resolving complaints  and denunciations of citizens in this domain. And there must be  close cooperation between law enforcement organs themselves and  between central and local organs. It is necessary to continue  to study and come up with specific policies aimed at  satisfactorily implementing the National Assembly resolution and  other law stipulations and promptly reestablish order and  discipline in state and social management.    3. [number as heard] The meeting hailed various localities  and units for having drawn up and registered substantive plans  to implement the policy on the practice of thrift. They have  pledged to cut their total spending by at least 5 percent as  envisaged by the National Assembly in its resolution on the 1994  state budget estimate. The meeting also asked various sectors,  echelons, and units to work out specific plans to scrupulously  implement the National Assembly resolution and effectively use  the money they may save.    4. It is necessary to assign relevant organs the duty of  helping the government prepare a report which will be presented  before the National Assembly at its upcoming session on how the  National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and fighting  wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling has been carried  out.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARLIC STANDS GUARD  </P> <P> I noticed the long article (April 19) about aphids devouring everything in the  wake of malathion spraying.  </P> <P> Unless these aphids are a special breed, there is an easy and inexpensive way  to rid one's gardens, roses and vegetables alike, of them. Simply plant a row  of garlic alongside or ring the patch of ground with garlic and you'll get rid  of the aphids.  </P> <P> I lost a crop of broccoli to aphids, but the next season I put a ring of garlic  around the garden and didn't have an aphid, but plenty of broccoli to eat.  </P> <P> J.D.

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: SME ahead at L131bn for year SME, the Italian retail and catering group which the government is trying to privatise, increased group net profits last year to L131.6bn (Dollars 81.3m) from L127.2bn. Iri, the Italian state holding company, owns 62 per cent of SME. Iri has already sold off its interests in the group's food activities, including its main subsidiary Cirio Bertolli De Rica (CBD), but has yet to find buyers for its GS supermarket chain and its fast-food and motorway restaurants. In the last few weeks, Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the controversial Italian financier, has taken control of CBD from Fisvi, the Apulia farm co-operative. Excluding food activities, SME's turnover increased from L3,824bn to L4,067bn. Retailing sales improved by 6 per cent to L2,782bn, and there was a 9 per cent increase in restaurant and catering turnover to L1,210bn. The parent company pushed up profits to L131.9bn, against L93.2bn, to propose an unchanged dividend of L110 a share. The company said that the increase in parent company profit was due to a strong increase in operating profits, and unspecified extraordinary gains from the sale of smaller subsidiaries. Net cash increased by L42.6bn to L132.6bn. A consortium headed by Rinascente, the Italian retail chain, is reported to be favourite to buy the GS chain. However, there is speculation about the future of the motorway and fast-food restaurants. Candidates as diverse as McDonalds, the US fast-food group, and Forte, the UK catering and hotels company, could be interested, it has been suggested.</p>

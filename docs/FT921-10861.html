			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Singapore's growth slows Singapore's economy is suffering the effects of recession in the developed world and this year will be less successful than 1991, according to Mr Goh Chok Tong, prime minister, Reuter reports. 'Our manufacturing and financial sectors, which depend heavily on external demand, will be affected,' Mr Goh said in his message on the eve of the Chinese New Year. 'Fortunately this will be counter-balanced by the prosperity of our Asean neighbours, which will help us through tourism and trade.' The Association of South-East Asian Nations groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Mr Goh said Singapore was not in a recession but its economy was maturing and economic growth was moderating at a rate sustainable over the long term.</p>

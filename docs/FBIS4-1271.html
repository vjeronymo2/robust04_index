			<p>BFN     [Text] The attention of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] High Command  has been drawn to a front-page publication of the 25 April  edition of the INQUIRER newspaper, reporting that ULIMO fighters  loyal to General Roosevelt Johnson have taken over the Po River  Bridge.    ECOMOG says the publication was not only false but also  misleading and is capable of causing panic and giving the  general public a wrong impression of the [word indistinct]  situation at Po River Bridge.    According to the release, ECOMOG has been in control of the  Po River Bridge and is still in proper control of it. It is  obvious therefore that the INQUIRER reporter was not physically  present at the bridge to ascertain the full position of things  there.    Also on the observation of the ECOMOG High Command was a BBC  Focus on Africa news item aired recently, which alleged that an  ECOMOG tank was hit by a ULIMO RPG. The release also noted that  none of ECOMOG vehicles was hit by a shot from an RPG and is  therefore reiterating the need for constant consultation from  ECOMOG High Command on matters affecting its operations,  especially at this stage of the Liberian peace process.</p>

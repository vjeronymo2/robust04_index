			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Police work to be rated in league THE GOVERNMENT is to publish league tables comparing the performance of police forces in England and Wales, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said yesterday. The tables will be based on 17 performance indicators, which will be published for the first time in December 1994. The indicators will include detection rates for different crimes, the percentage of urgent incidents responded to within target times, the speed of response to 999 calls and the number of officers available for duty. The indicators have been devised by the Audit Commission, the public-spending watchdog, with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Mr Clarke accepted that the scores achieved by a police force might not always reflect its actual performance. He said it would be misleading to compare crime detection rates in rural Wales with those in greater Manchester, where many more offences took place. 'I do not think, however, that the ranking of police forces in a league table showing how they compare against one another should be put off the agenda for that reason alone,' he said. The home secretary expected the publication of indicators to 'excite public debate'. The publication of league tables of test results for seven-year-olds had been hugely popular and became 'a minor industry'. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, said it was important that the public had as much information as possible. He added: 'But we should not kid ourselves that the publication of information about policing is a substitute for a proper or coherent policy to fight crime - which is woefully lacking at present. 'We must get policing back into local communities so that we get the appalling level of crime down.'</p>

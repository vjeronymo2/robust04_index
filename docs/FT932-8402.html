			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Arts: The Showman - Theatre First the plaudits. You will seldom see a display of acting in London to match that of Alan Bates in The Showman at the Almeida in north London. For variety, for depth and, above all, for sheer stamina Bates deserves every prize. And although, on a rough reckoning, he has over 90 per cent of the lines, the rest of the cast deserve the fullest praise, too, for their unstinting support. Written by the Austrian Thomas Bernard, the play centres on an actor-writer-director who has aspirations to be Shakespeare, Verdi, Metternich and Wittgenstein, to name but a few. Voltaire, Napoleon, FD Roosevelt and Lady Churchill crop up as well. So do Hitler and Stalin. Bates in the lead role has them all in his imagination. The Showman, however, is really about Austria, which is a big subject, or at least was when Austria had an empire. Possibly, in a micro-way, the country has become psychologically more interesting now that it has not. Coming to terms with an imperial past and a more modest present is a problem not confined to Austria. Yet it is here that the reservations begin. This is the second Bernhard play to be performed in London in recent months. The first was Elisabeth II at the Gate. Both suggest a peculiar dislike of modern Austria, but what I find very hard to work out is whether this stems from a nostalgia for a glory that has gone or is a complaint about a failure to adjust to being a lesser, and democratic power. Probably The Showman is a subtle mixture of the two, though you would have to be an Austrian to fully appreciate it. My own view, seeing the play in English from an offshore island, is that it comes down firmly on the side of Metternich: relatively civilised authoritarianism with Austria running Europe rather than the great powers breaking it up. But I may be wrong. Apart from doubts about the play's intentions, the other reservation concerns the structure. Bernhard has a pronounced tendency to allow his central characters to rant. Not even John Osborne gave his leading figures such continuous spleen and invective. In Osborne someone usually interrupts; Bernhard scarcely ever stops. This creates an imbalance in the play. For example, the wife in The Showman does little more than cough: the grown-up children broadly kow-tow to their father. The only people not wholly submissive are the inn-keeper and his family, but they dissent largely in dignified silence and are tarnished (or perhaps blessed?) by having what looks like a water colour of Hitler on the wall. Again, the politics are obscure. Still, if you want a relentless, egocentric near-monologue, here it is. A few of the lines are very funny, such as Bates saying 'I wanted a genius for a son, and all I've got is a nice person'. The direction by Jonathan Kent, using the full depth and height of the Almeida stage, is  - like Bates's performance - sensationally good. For the record, Bernhard was born illegitimately close to a once little known place called Maastricht in 1931. His Austrian mother spent a year in a convent. He moved to Austria, established left-wing credentials and died in 1989. Yet it is a strange kind of socialism that comes out in The Showman; perhaps the German title is more suitable: Der Theatermacher. Obscurity belongs not only to Austrians. Gregory Motton's five-year-old A Message for the Broken Hearted has been revived in a Liverpool Playhouse production at the Battersea Arts. Motton still looks like an immensely promising dramatist writing about pain. It would help, however, to give some greater indication of context. And to pull the stage curtains every few minutes or so may give the indication of a hospital for the seriously disturbed, but it is an anti-theatrical device which holds up the action. (The real setting is in and around a suburban house in south London.) Motton's test will be at the Royal Court next month with his new play, The Terrible Voice of Satan. In fact, Motton would have fitted very well into the Springboards season of new work from the Royal National Theatre's Studio at the Cottelsoe. This is continuing with He Who Saw Everything, based on the ancient epic of Gilgamesh and thought to be the world's oldest play. It is close to the story of Noah's Ark and also Greek myth. Directed by Tim Supple, it is very well done with some appealing musical accompaniment. But obscurity seems to be the order of the week. It is unclear why Gilgamesh is played by several characters.</p>

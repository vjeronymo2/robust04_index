			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Nationalist Action Party [NAP] leader Alpaslan  Turkes has said that the condition imposed by the U.S. Senate on  aid to Turkey is tantamount to interference in our domestic  affairs.    Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Turkes recalled  that  the U.S. Senate put the condition that the aid to be extended to  Turkey cannot be used in domestic security. Noting that this  decision was made as a result of the influence of the Greek,  Serbian, and PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] lobbies in the  United States, Turkes said that it is humiliating.    [Begin Turkes recording] Our advise to our government is to  categorically reject this aid. The government should announce  that a conditional aid is unacceptable. [end recording]    Turkes noted that the blind eye turned by the Clinton  administration to this decision is construed by NAP as an  indirect support for the PKK. He added that if the government's  decision to reject the conditional aid is well presented to the  Turkish workers in Europe, the amount of the aid rejected can be  collected as donations from these workers. He concluded by  saying that his party will support such a move.</p>

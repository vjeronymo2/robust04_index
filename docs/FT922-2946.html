			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Building workers agree 2.5% rise CONSTRUCTION unions yesterday agreed to accept a 2.5 per cent rise for basic pay rates in negotiations covering 600,000 building and civil engineering workers, Diane Summers writes. The deal followed a warning by Ucatt, the main union in the talks, of a 'summer of discontent' on building sites if employers refused to withdraw their proposal for a pay freeze. The deal, which will take basic pay for craft operatives to Pounds 4.09 an hour and for labourers to Pounds 3.48, takes effect from June 29. These negotiated basic rates bear little relation to actual wages paid but do influence the scale of increases contractors are likely to pay. Separately, a survey of professional staff in the construction industry, conducted by Building magazine, indicates that more than half of construction companies will impose a pay freeze this year. Fifteen per cent of companies will give rises of 1 per cent to 4 per cent but just over a quarter expect to raise salaries between 5 per cent and 8 per cent after earlier pay freezes.</p>

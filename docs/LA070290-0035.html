			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOUNTIFUL 'AS YOU LIKE IT' OPENS OLD GLOBE SEASON  </P> <P> The Old Globe Theatre began its summer season with an end-of-summer staging of  "As You Like It."  </P> <P> Set in the alfresco Lowell Davies Festival Theatre, this "As You Like It" is  bountiful, well-spoken and without major surprises -- unless it's the fact that  the production's overriding melancholy is underplayed in the one character,  Jaques, where it's most needed.  </P> <P> The hints of incipient autumn are established by David Jenkins' set. In the  first scene, the apples have been harvested and are being pressed into cider.  The leaves are beginning to fall from the trees in the Forest of Arden. And  then there is the matter of the deer.  </P> <P> Director Julianne Boyd and Jenkins were not content to simply let us hear  Shakespeare's lines about Jaques' grief over a hunter's wounding of a deer in  the forest. In one of the first scenes, before we even enter the forest,  Rosalind and Celia play badminton against the backdrop of a formal garden that  includes a bush sculpted in the form of a stag.  </P> <P> As we near the end of the play, the banished duke's merry men not only sing a  bawdy little ditty in honor of the fellow who killed the deer, but they  actually bear the creature's headless corpse across the stage. The triumphant  young hunter smears his hands and face with the deer's blood. After the merry  men go on their way, leaving the deer on stage, Jaques comes forward and  touches the animal's neck in a moment of silent sympathy.  </P> <P> This scene effectively ends the notion of the forest as the halcyon retreat  that it might resemble in the spring. Instead, this is a bloody place, where  the food chain continues operating, where even those men who claim to love  nature don't hesitate to exert their dominion over it. In this world, the faux  deer (as sculpted in the garden) threatens to outlive the real thing.  </P> <P> Jaques more or less articulates this point of view throughout the play. But  this production's Jaques, Richard Kneeland, isn't the right man to embody it.  Kneeland speaks Jaques' lines, including those about the seven ages of man,  with grace and precision, but he doesn't look particularly glum. His eyes don't  appear haunted. He carries himself with a bearing not much different from his  stout-hearted comrades.  </P> <P> It's a curious lapse in an otherwise well-cast staging. The magnificently  wall-eyed Richard Easton is a superb Touchstone, suggesting the professional  fool's wit, his hauteur, his carnality. Robert Phalen plays both the bad duke  and his brother, the banished good duke, with conviction. The physical  resemblance between the dukes may help us swallow the bad duke's sudden  offstage conversion at the end of the play; they were cut of the same cloth,  right? Well. . . .  </P> <P> Any "As You Like It" hinges on its Rosalind, and Jayne Atkinson is spirited  enough to carry off the disguise as a man -- observe the gymnastic workout she  and Michel R. Gill's Orlando go through during her speech about the volatile  moods of married women -- yet she is also feminine enough to make us see the  studied aspect of her disguise. More important, in her private moments, we  believe both her cynicism and her lovesickness. We see the anxiety behind her  little charade: Will Orlando like her as she is? Will she like him? Will the  real romance work out, or even be as much fun, as the fake one? With Gill's  Orlando, this is an open question. He's perfectly handsome -- too perfect,  perhaps, for this Rosalind. There are no character lines on his face. He looks  several years younger and several dimensions shallower than Atkinson's  Rosalind.  </P> <P> As Celia, Katherine Leask elicits many of the play's chuckles, not only with  her insinuating glances and artificial smiles during Rosalind's byplay with  Orlando, but even with the simple statement that she's too tired to keep  walking. The performances in the pastoral roles are also little comic gems:  especially Pippa Pearthree as Phebe, Charley Lang as Silvius and M. Susan Peck  as Audrey. Ed Hall's Corin retains a degree of dignity in the face of the  supercilious Touchstone; Jonathan McMurtry is the noble old Adam.  </P> <P> Jonathan Nichols fares as well as can be expected as the villainous brother who  so thoroughly reforms. For his interrogation by the bad duke, the stage opens  up and he's escorted to and from his dungeon in a glare of light and a wave of  smoke. In a punitive environment like this, his knavery isn't hard to  understand. The program sets the play in the 1630s, possibly suggesting  Cromwellian repression to come.  </P> <P> The play's other Oliver, an itinerant parson played by Nicholas Martin, gets  more than his share of laughs with the assistance of a clever prop, and  Martin's lisping LeBeau gets his with the aid of an outlandish outfit devised  by Robert Wojewodski.  </P> <P> The costumes are lush, Conrad Susa's score is tuneful, and Peter Maradudin's  lights finally illuminate the forest behind the stage. In other words, this is  "As You Like It" as most of us like it -- but the image of that unfortunate  deer will linger, bringing us back down to earth.  </P> <P>  At the Simon Edison Centre in Balboa Park Tuesdays through Sundays at 8:30  p.m., through July 29. $24 to $27.50; (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> 'AS YOU LIKE IT'  </P> <P> By William Shakespeare.

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nova turns in strong result at nine months NOVA, western Canada's most conspicuous corporate turnround of the recession, reported a strong result for the first nine months of 1993. The company said capital spending would rise substantially to handle growing demand for capacity in its natural gas pipeline system. Nova, which is concentrating on building its core pipeline and petrochemical businesses after a brush with failure two years ago, has put its Novalta Resources gas production unit out to tender. It expects firm bids later this month. Analysts value the unit at CDollars 200m or more. Nine-month net profit was CDollars 159m (USDollars 121m), or 37 cents a share, up 43 per cent from CDollars 111m, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.4bn, an increase of 9 per cent. Third-quarter profit was CDollars 45m, or 10 cents, down 4 per cent from CDollars 47m, or 11 cents, on revenues of CDollars 828m, up 10 per cent. The decline was due to a lower regulated rate of return on pipeline operations.</p>

Some 150 Chinese and American securities experts,  accountants  and lawyers attended the one-day seminar, which was jointly  sponsored by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the  Bank of New York of the United States.    Fu Fengxiang, vice-chairman of the China Securities  Regulatory Commission, said at the seminar that China's  securities market has experienced fast development since the  country started reform and opening 15 years ago.    He said that a good environment for securities business in  China has taken shape.    Fu told the participants that China adopted nearly 20 laws  and regulations concerning securities last year. And it is  going to promulgate a securities law in the near future to  provide better legal protection for the management of securities.    He noted that Sino-foreign cooperation in the economic field  has expanded from joint ventures to capital investment.    China recently issued depository receipts in the United  States which have shown positive results, Fu said.    Fu expressed his belief that the seminar will effectively  encourage Chinese enterprises and their securities to enter the  world market, especially the U.S. capital market.    Joseph M. Velli, executive vice-president of the Bank of New  York, briefed the participants on the U.S. capital market,  saying that according to an estimation of his bank, China will  become the most important new depository receipts-issuing  country.    He added that many international companies and individual  buyers are "very interested" in China's stocks issued in the  United States.    J. Carter Beese, commissioner of the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission, Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New  York Stock Exchange, and Thomas D. Sanford, vice-president of  the Bank of New York, answered questions raised by participants.</p>

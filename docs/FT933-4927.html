			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Mexico reserves at record levels MEXICO has announced record levels of international reserves, which should further ease perennial worries of a currency devaluation and give the government more scope to boost the sluggish economy without fuelling inflation. The Banco de Mexico announced on Sunday that international reserves grew to Dollars 22.6bn (Pounds 14.9bn) at the end August, a Dollars 4.03bn increase from the end of last year. The trade ledger is also looking better, officials said. For the first half of the year, the current account deficit stood at Dollars 10bn, 4 per cent less than at the same time last year, while the capital accounts to finance the deficit jumped to Dollars 14bn. 'The strength of the Mexican economy gives the government a lot of room to manoeuvre,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, of Baring Securities. A tight grip on money under President Carlos Salinas has slowed inflation to 8 per cent a year and created a budget surplus of more than Dollars 4bn dollars for the first half of the year. But it has also choked the economy: manufacturing stagnated at 0.3 per cent annual growth for the first half of the year, according to official figures. Economists expect year-end growth of 1.5 per cent. Higher growth ahead of next July's presidential elections is widely seen as politically desirable for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party. Addressing a banker's conference on Sunday, Mr Salinas said his government would run a balanced budget for the rest of this year, boosting spending by Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn. There are also signs the government will use an extra Dollars 8bn, including proceeds from recent media privatisations, to finance a highway project in the south.</p>

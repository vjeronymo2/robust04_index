			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STARS FROM MAJOR SOCCER LEAGUE PLAY U.S. TEAM  </P> <P> The Major Soccer League, whose players complained that they were overlooked  when the United States selected its team for last summer's World Cup, will have  two chances this weekend to impress U.S. Coach Bob Gansler.  </P> <P> The MSL All-Stars meet the national team tonight at Kansas City's Arrowhead  Stadium and Sunday at St. Louis' Soccer Park.  </P> <P> The United States has lost several starters from its World Cup team to the  European professional leagues, but it still has both forwards, Peter Vermes and  Bruce Murray. In a 3-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago two weeks ago, Murray  became the United States' all-time leading scorer with his 10th full  international goal.  </P> <P> The previous record of nine was held by midfielder Rick Davis, who will be  playing for the MSL All-Stars.

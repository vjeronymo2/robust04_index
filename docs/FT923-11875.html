			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / One-stop ticket towaste land renewal: Plans to aid inner-city developers AN important feature of the new Urban Regeneration Agency (URA), according to environment secretary Mr Michael Howard, will be its ability to offer a one-stop service to developers who wish to invest in the UK's inner cities. The URA will have powers to assemble parcels of land - if necessary by compulsory purchase - and clear them for developers. It will control two sources of government funding: derelict land grant, which is used for land reclamation; and city grant, which is available for pump-priming development of inner-city sites by the private sector. English Estates, the quango that builds factories and offices in the assisted areas, will also be absorbed into the URA, so that the agency can tempt businesses into needy areas by providing premises. The initial response to yesterday's consultation paper from the professionals involved in inner-city regeneration was positive. Mr Gerald Cary-Elwes, secretary general of the British Urban Regeneration Association, said: 'The idea of a one-stop agency for identifying and assembling packages of land which can be used for development is excellent. 'The URA follows the very successful pattern of similar organisations in Wales and Scotland. It would be wonderful if Peter Walker, who will be the chairman of the new agency, could repeat the success of his work in Wales.' However, there will be disappointment if the URA is no more than a land use agency. 'Urban regeneration is about more than just land and property development,' believes Mr Victor Hausner, a consultant involved in many inner-city regeneration schemes. 'It involves economic regeneration, training, housing improvements and so on.' Pulling together all those other elements at present means tapping into the long list of government-backed organisations that can supply these other elements of urban regeneration: The 16 task forces run by the Department of Trade and Industry which are responsible for stimulating enterprise and training people for new jobs. Most local training is the responsibility of the 82 Training and Enterprise councils under the employment department. In Scotland, the task falls to Local Enterprise Companies. But the education department is in charge of city technology colleges, which are supposed to concentrate educational resources in urban areas. Housing needs are dealt with by programmes to rehabilitate run-down housing estates, such as Estate Action and the Priority Estates Project. If the developer intends to provide low-cost social housing, local housing associations will need to be involved. The Home Office Safer Cities project encourages building, design and employment initiatives to reduce crime. An early port of call would have to be the local council. Of the 57 urban priority areas, 31 have now won more than Pounds 1bn of government funds for urban regeneration over the next five years from the City Challenge programme. Also indispensable in the eight cities where they exist are the City Action Teams. These are led by different government ministers, which co-ordinate the various inner-city initiatives and programmes run by different government departments. And if there is an urban development corporation, it  -rather than the URA - will be the organisation to turn to for development needs. The complexity of the arrangements has been repeatedly criticised by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog. Having described the programmes as a 'patchwork quilt' in a 1989 report, the commission said in 1991 that the quilt 'remains only loosely sewn together'. It was that fragmentation that led to the introduction last year of City Challenge, the bidding process that aims to bring together resources from all the different programmes and concentrate them on projects proposed by local partnerships between the public and private sector. 'City Challenge offers a multi-faceted solution to a multi-faceted problem,' says Victor Hausner. 'The challenge for the URA will be to see whether it can develop a comprehensive strategic approach in the same way as City Challenge.' The government is not unaware of the challenge. The Conservative election manifesto included a promise to bring resources for targeted inner-city programmes into a single budget. One way of doing so would have been to use the URA as the organisation through which to focus the plan, perhaps by also giving it responsibility for managing City Challenge. However, yesterday's consultation paper says merely that the government is 'developing' its proposal to integrate inner-city regeneration funds. For the moment, the agency will be yet another partner to be drawn into inner-city programmes, rather than a one-stop solution to the developer's problems.</p>

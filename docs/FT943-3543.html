			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Unions scoff at tax breaks for servants French prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur's latest job-creation measures drew a mixed reaction yesterday. The opposition and unions welcomed the proposed government subsidy to companies hiring the long-term unemployed, but scoffed at increased tax incentives to encourage the middle class to hire more servants. In his Sunday night television interview, Mr Balladur also proposed, as 'a collective commitment' for all his countrymen rather than an electoral promise, that the 3.3m jobless total should be reduced by 1m 'over several years'. The Socialist opposition party yesterday criticised the prime minister's plan to quadruple the amount individuals can deduct from their own tax bill in social charges and pay for employees. 'This will help maids in posh areas, but hardly make a big impact on slum unemployment,' said the Socialist spokesman. Mr Balladur's other job plan is to give subsidies to companies hiring those unemployed who have qualified for so-called RMI welfare payments for at least two years, and who are at the bottom of the heap of French society. France's Patronat employers' federation said yesterday it was launching its own inquiry into corporate ethics and relations with the law and politics, following a series of corruption allegations against the heads of leading companies. The Patronat move follows Mr Balladur's announcement that he would appoint a three-man committee composed of a former Patronat president, a former union leader and a senior magistrate to report on issues raised by the scandals. Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, said his inquiry 'would question everyone concerned by this dysfunctioning of the system'.</p>

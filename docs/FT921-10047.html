			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Fisons' best seller faces threat FISONS' best-selling asthma drug, Intal, is set to come under pressure for the first time from a newly-licensed generic competitor. Mr Isaac Kaye, deputy chairman of Ivax Corporation, the US pharmaceuticals group, said that Harris Pharmaceuticals, the company's UK subsidiary, had received a licence from the UK authorities to sell a generic version of the asthma drug. The company has also applied for licences to market the product in Europe, he said. The licence, for a meter-dosed aerosol inhaler system for Intal, may allow Harris to take significant market share from Fisons. Analysts believe that Intal sales represented Pounds 170m of the company's total revenues of Pounds 500m during 1990. Sales in the UK alone are estimated at about Pounds 15m of those revenues. The product is highly profitable, according to analysts. Although Intal has been off-patent for some years, generic producers have had problems designing an aerosol inhaler that will deliver the product efficiently to asthma sufferers' lungs. It is this problem that Harris, which has considerable experience in inhaling technology, appears to have overcome. Fisons said that more than 50 per cent of Intal sales were in aerosol form. The ability of Harris to exploit the British Intal market will depend upon the company's ability to reach general practitioners and hospital purchasers. The group has only a small sales team, according to analysts. Similarly, Harris may have problems penetrating the continental market if the product is licensed because of the strength of Intal's brand-name there. Ivax is unlikely to exploit the Intal generic market in the US. A number of Fisons' patents have not yet expired there. In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration has not yet decided how to license generic inhaled drugs. The FDA is expected to insist on expensive clinical trials before licences will be issued.</p>

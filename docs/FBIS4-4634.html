			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chin Chang-nip from Washington] </F>   [Text] The United States originally set the overall  inspection [chonmyon sachal] of North Korean nuclear facilities  by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the  exchange of North-South special envoys as a precondition for  holding its third round of high-level talks with North Korea.  It has been learned that the United States has expressed its  intention to change its previous policy by attaching less  importance to the exchange of North-South special envoys. The  ROK, however, is opposed to this policy. The difference in  opinions between the two countries regarding the issue has been  disclosed.    The United States seems to believe it can make North Korea  come to the negotiating table to discuss the nuclear issue if  it attaches less importance to the exchange of special envoys.  Also, it seems to believe that this can be another way to  settle the North Korean nuclear issue, and that it will make  some progress in resolving the nuclear issue when it holds the  third round of high-level talks with North Korea, while the  North and South are carrying out their exchange of special  envoys.    The ROK worries that its efforts to denuclerize the Korean  peninsula may be fruitless under the pretext of the improvement  of North Korean-U.S. diplomatic relations when the United States  excludes the exchange of North-South special envoys from its  preconditions for holding the third U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks or intends to discuss the issue at the third U.S.-North  Korean talks as demanded by North Korea.    North Korea has maintained that it did not agree with the  exchange of North-South special envoys in either the second  round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks or in the past  unofficial contacts between the United States and North Korea in  New York. It has said, however, that the exchange of  North-South special envoys can be discussed as an agenda item at  the third North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The ROK and the  United States have stressed: The North Korean side first  proposed the exchange of North-South special envoys, then the  South Korean side accepted it. Therefore, this is a  precondition that should be kept by North Korea.    The ROK believes that although the North Korean nuclear  issue  involves the international community, it is, ultimately, a  matter of the Korean peninsula. Accordingly, it worries that  the issue of signing an agreement on the denuclerization on the  Korean peninsula through the exchange of North-South special  envoys would be discussed as an supplementary agenda item, when  the issue of improving diplomatic relations between North Korea  and the United States is being mainly discussed at the third  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. This is the reason for the  ROK's objection.    The ROK believes that it is highly possible that North Korea  would put forward the exchange of North-South special envoys as  a condition for negotiations in improving relations with the  United States if those negotiations are not going smoothly  during the third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. It also  believes that if something goes wrong, the ROK will be the  victim of negotiations between North Korea and the United States.    The United States is likely to review the change of the  timing of the exchange of North-South special envoys,  considering that it would be better to discuss other important  issues after inducing North Korea to the negotiating table.    It has been learned, however, that the U.S. Government has  not yet decided on its policy regarding the precondition for the  third U.S.-North Korean high-level talks after the coordination  of the timing of the exchange of the special envoys.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry believes that North  Korea's demands are an attempt to strengthen its position in  negotiations with the United States by splitting the ROK and the  United States and to exclude the ROK from participating in the  negotiations by downgrading it as a third-party, not as a party  concerned. Therefore, he said that it is the position of the  Department of Defense to block in advance North Korea's attempts  in order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.    He also said that the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea,  as well as the ROK Forces, must strengthen their combatant  capability to prepare for the emergency situation on the  assumption that the UN Security Council may impose sanctions on  North Korea. He stressed that the United States and the ROK  must closely cooperate with each other to strengthen their  capability.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Tenneco to pay Dollars 113m for German car exhaust producer Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, is expected to announce today that it will buy Gillet, a German automotive components manufacturer, for cash and assumed debt in a deal valued at Dollars 113m. The acquisition will boost Tenneco's European presence in the original equipment sector of the components market and will give the company a foothold in emerging markets where Gillet is already supplying customers. The purchase marks a further expansion by US component manufacturers into the European market, where several of Tenneco's competitors have already identified growth opportunities. Gillet, based in Edencoben, is Europe's largest maker of exhaust systems for new cars. It supplies parts to all of Europe's main carmakers. With 2,000 employees at 14 plants, including three in the UK, Gillet had sales of Dollars 275m last year. Tenneco is expected to merge family-owned Gillet into its Walker Manufacturing subsidiary, which produces exhaust systems as replacement parts in the US and Europe. Walker had sales of about Dollars 900m in 1993, including Dollars 219m from its European operations. Walker and Gillet combined will give Tenneco a leading position in Europe's original and replacement equipment markets. The purchase will be the third in a series of acquisitions aimed at bolstering Tenneco's three core businesses - natural gas, packaging and automotive components. It agreed last month to buy a US power generating and natural gas development company for Dollars 60m and said it would spend Dollars 73m to upgrade a US containerboard plant. Tenneco's investment in Gillet comes as it makes plans to shut its 86-year-old German tractor-making operation as part of a worldwide retrenchment. JI Case, Tenneco's heavy equipment subsidiary, will close its tractor factory in Neuss some time after June 1996. The Neuss plant has 1,300 employees. The company believes that the European auto components market offers more potential for growth than farm equipment. Securities analysts expect Tenneco to report third-quarter earnings of about 74 cents per share today, and to announce the Gillet acquisition.</p>

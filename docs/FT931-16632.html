			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Corrigan to quit as president of New York Fed MR GERALD CORRIGAN, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since 1985, yesterday said he would resign the post in August and seek a job in the private sector. Mr Corrigan, a one-time aide and protege of Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in New York that he was not looking for a job in the Clinton administration, although he acknowledged having met Mr Clinton's transition team a number of times 'in the context of brainstorming'. He said a search committee had been formed to appoint a successor when his resignation becomes effective on August 20. While Mr Corrigan said he would sever all institutional ties with the New York Fed by next Aug-ust, he plans to remain co-chairman of the recently formed Russian American Bankers Forum, a Moscow project to help develop Russia's banking system, for the forseeable future. The search committee includes Ms Ellen Futter, chair of the New York Fed's board of directors; Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT; Mr Thomas Labrecque, chairman of Chase Manhattan and Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US Secretary of State. The resignation surprised the US banking industry, which had regarded the 51-year-old Mr Corrigan as a potential successor to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. But Mr Corrigan said he had never had any interest in Mr Greenspan's job and insisted there was no 'hidden story' behind his decision to resign his Dollars 250,000-a-year post. The New York Fed supervises the New York banking system and is the Federal Reserve Board's main point of contact with the US financial markets. Mr Corrigan has been at the helm during several crises, including the 1987 Wall Street crash. He has become the leading US spokesman on banking supervision issues. He is also an important figure in international banking, having been appointed last year as chairman of the Committee on Banking Supervision, based at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. Referring to his job overseeing New York financial institutions, he said 'broadly speaking (the financial system) is regaining some much-needed muscle tone . . . I look forward to a stronger banking system'. Mr Corrigan first joined the Fed in 1968 as an economist, and in 1979 was brought to Washington as an aide to Mr Volcker. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night: 'Gerry Corrigan has been a close and valued colleague and is one of the world's leading experts not only in monetary policy but also in international supervision. His departure will be a great loss to the central banking community.' Crisis manager at the NY Fed, Page 3</p>

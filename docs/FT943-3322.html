			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Losses recouped following US consumer data - Market Report Confidence in the near-term outlook for UK equities appeared to recover yesterday afternoon when share and bond prices rallied after the latest US consumer price index came out in line with forecasts. Earlier, equities had dropped by nearly 43 points on the FT-SE 100 Index as nervousness ahead of the US data combined with fears in some quarters that further rises might follow Monday's increase in UK base rates. The recovery in the second half of the session, which was fuelled by a swing from losses to gains in long-dated UK government bonds, reduced the day's loss on the FT-SE 100 to 7.4 at a final reading of 3,121.4. Sentiment was also helped by an early rise of 20 points in New York's Dow Industrial Average. Although the mood remained nervous, market analysts regarded the revival of confidence in the UK bond market as very significant for equities. 'Monday's move on rates should reassure gilts,' commented Mr Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney. But in early trading, when bonds weakened across Europe on fears that the US data might provoke a fresh move by the Federal Reserve, equities were weak in London. Two leading financial newspapers suggested that UK base rates would have to be raised again soon. However, NatWest Securities took a firm stance against such fears. 'Base rates at 5.75 per cent; enough for this year,' it told clients, adding that it saw only one more move - 'to 6.25 per cent' - in the next 12 months. The equity market appeared unconvinced, however, and yesterday morning brought a round of losses among the retail stocks which had managed to avoid selling pressure in the previous session. Sentiment in these sectors was also hurt by disappointing results from Kingfisher, whose shares fell sharply at first but rallied later. A poor trading statement from Fisons also hit market confidence. The Footsie 3,100 mark was quickly lost and the slide continued until share prices steadied to put the index at a low for the day of 3,086.1. Against this background, the recovery in the second half of the session was all the more convincing. By the close, Marks and Spencer, the most prominent name in the retail sector, was a shade firmer on the day and losses elsewhere in the stores area were modest. Across the broad range of the market there were many firm spots, with P&amp;O standing out strongly on good first-half figures. Stock market traders were favourably impressed by the recovery of the 3,100 mark on the Footsie, and said that there had been ready support when the index moved below this level. The day's performance by equities showed that bond markets still hold the key to UK share prices and that a convincing recovery in bond prices is still the necessary base for a further advance in the stock market. The futures markets played their usual role in leading the blue chip stocks as they first fell and then recovered. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to the futures market, finished the day down 34.2 at 3,679.1. Stock Exchange statistics indicate that on Monday, when shares reacted to the unexpected timing of the first rise in Bank of England lending rate for five years, retail, or genuine customer, business in equities remained steady at Pounds 1.28bn. Volatility in share prices during that session suggested that investors were both selling and buying stock. Trading volume of 567.2m shares through the Seaq electronic system yesterday compared with only 484.6m on Monday, and showed a return to more normal daily average equity business levels. Further nervousness is likely ahead of tomorrow's policy meeting at the Bundesbank.</p>

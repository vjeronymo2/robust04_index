			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday  hailed US President Bill Clinton's removal of 30-year old trade  sanctions against Vietnam as a move that would benefit Thailand  and the region. At the same time, Mr Surin acknowledged that the  return of US business to Vietnam would have some repercussions  on Thailand. He did not elaborate on the repercussions, but said  they should serve to prompt Thais to "pay more attention' to  economic developments in the region. "Thailand will benefit from  economic development in Vietnam," he said. "The region is a free  market. The emergence of Vietnam in the market system will  enable the region to develop trade, investment and tourism  ties," he said.    A Foreign Ministry statement said the removal of the US  embargo would not only improve the "atmosphere" between the US  and Vietnam but also foster economic development in Vietnam and  the Southeast Asian region.    The Foreign Ministry's East Asia Department  director-general,  Don Pramutwinai, said better economic conditions expected to  come with the removal of the US embargo are unlikely to lead to  political liberalisation in Vietnam. It was a "matter of theory"  that people enjoying better living standards would demand  political freedom, he said. In reality, the situation in Vietnam  was different because the Communist Party remained firmly in  charge of the country, he said. The party recently made clear  that it would retain the existing system, indicating that  political and economic policies were working, he said. "If  existing conditions in Vietnam are suitable for the country, why  should they be changed?" But the future of communism in Vietnam  depended on economic developments in the world at large and  Vietnam's response to them, he said. Vietnamese people were  unlikely to demand political change "because they have been  under strict control," he said. Vietnam learned from  pro-democracy protests in the Soviet Union and China where there  were demands for political reform after economic improvements.    Demands for democracy and human rights in Vietnam were more  likely to come from the United States, he said. "If the  Americans don't make the demand, no one else will," he said.    Another official said that better economic conditions would  improve Vietnam's access to the outside world, and this might  lead to demand for change especially among Vietnamese in the  southern part of the country. The southerners were previously in  contact with the West and, with a better economy, might demand  political change, he said. The official cited the pro-democracy  demonstrations in Tienanmen Square in Peking in 1989. But he  noted that Vietnam's Communist Party was "more hardline" than  that of China and that it remained unpredictable how Hanoi would  adjust to any demand for political change.    Deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman Rawi Hongpraphat said the  removal of the US embargo would help ease tension in Southeast  Asia. Economically, Lt [Lieutenant] Rawi warned that Thais would  have to work harder because there would be competition in the  cheaper labour market in Vietnam.    Another official pointed out that there would also be  competition for Thailand in terms of US capital and technology.  "Thai businessmen must work harder because other investors from  the US have big money and high technology needed in Vietnam,"  the official said. "Our investors have the edge only in terms of  experience in some, not many, sectors." The entry of US business  into Vietnam would lead to more systematic economic development  of the country, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1800 GMT on 22  April on the "Today" program carries a report on the Plesetsk  missile test center in the town of (Mirnyy) in Arkhangelsk  oblast. The correspondent says the site is not shown on maps  because it is where military missiles have been tested since  1957. He says the country knew nothing of these tests for  decades, including the successes or failures.    A film shows an aerial view of the town, a convoy of  unidentified missiles on the road, and a missile transporter  erector launcher, TEL, driving down a forest road.    The correspondent says these scenes are being shown for the  first time, adding that disasters during missile launches in  1973 and 1980 resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people.  Video clips then show an explosion, with two soldiers dragging a  third past flames.    The correspondent then interviews an unidentified lieutenant  colonel in front of a memorial. The lieutenant says: "I took  part in organizing the funerals. Of course, it left a big  impression. When I come here, I can see that moment."    The correspondent continues: "The Plesetsk range was not  only a testing center. Events connected with the Cuban missile  crisis in the 1960's form a special page in its history. Soviet  missiles had been delivered to Cuba. The United States decided  to destroy them from the air."    A video recording shows TEL's maneuvering and being driven  out of hangars and along a road. The video then shows Major  General Nikolay Moroz, assistant commander in chief of the  Missile Forces, identified by caption, who says. "When it  became known that the Soviet Union had 12 missiles with the  range to reach America, this fact had a great influence on the  politicians."    The correspondent says: "Some of these missiles were aimed  at the United States from Plesetsk. Today there is a different  atmosphere at the range. This is the secret computer center.  Here they follow American missile testing. Moscow and  Washington have agreed to exchange information on these kinds  tests, and in accordance with the agreements the Americans have  installed this equipment in Plesetsk. The Russian specialists  have installed their own control instruments in the United  State. Today the soldiers at Plesetsk are not only studying  launches of other people's missiles; they are also developing  Russian military missiles for the 21st Century. The Plesetsk  state missile testing range. The fourth-generation Topol  [SS-25] missile is being developed here [as heard]. The video  shows the correspondent standing in front of an SS-25 road unit.</p>

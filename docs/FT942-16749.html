			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Bosnian Moslem leadership announces 24-hour ceasefire: Serbian officials respond by saying gesture is insufficient Bosnia's Moslem leadership, under mounting diplomatic pressure to enter peace talks with its Serb enemies, yesterday announced a 24-hour ceasefire and said this was intended to pave the way for talks on a longer-term truce. The gesture was rebuffed by Serb officials, who reiterated demands for an immediate start to talks on a permanent, general ceasefire. The Moslem announcement signalled a retreat from its previous reluctance to enter peace talks while Serbs were in control of freshly acquired land around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. UN military officials could not confirm the new truce, and said merely that they had issued ceasfire documents to both sides and were expecting an answer today. General Sir Michael Rose, head of UN forces in Bosnia, shuttled between Serb and Moslem commanders but failed to settle terms on which they could meet yesterday afternoon at Sarajevo airport, as initially planned. Another UN officer, Colonel Richard Pernoud, said the two sides might come together today. Serbian forces have in recent days gained strategically important ground near Gorazde, and moved closer to their long-standing goal of unchallenged control of eastern Bosnia, which adjoins Serbia. The Moslem leadership, whose troops are reported to be gaining ground in central Bosnia, wants international pressure to focus on the plight of Gorazde, one of three so-called 'safe areas' in the east of the republic. But the mild language of a UN Security Council resolution on Wednesday night, which stopped well short of threatening air strikes against Serb forces surrounding Gorazde, has disappointed the Bosnian government. Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, said the US had not ruled out the option of taking military action to defend Gorazde and other besieged Bosnian cities. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, expressed impatience with his adversaries. 'If the Moslems do not immediately stop their offensive along all confrontation lines, we will order an all-out counter-offensive, and then let the Security Council help them,' he said. The Serbs maintain that their offensive in the Gorazde area, in which about 400 people have been killed or injured, was in response to advances in central Bosnia by Moslem infantry, whose effectiveness is growing as the weather improves. Gen Rose has accepted this contention, but there are reports of unhappiness among some of his UN colleagues about his apparent determination to play down the situation in Gorazde and avoid Serb embarrassment. The UN commander said after meeting General Rasim Delic, the head of the Bosnian army: 'I am disappointed that the war will go on as long as we continue to debate on this level. We need immediate cessation of hostilities followed by the peace process, and that's what we are trying to achieve.' General Delic told reporters: 'There is nothing going on.'

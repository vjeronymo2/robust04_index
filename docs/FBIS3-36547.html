			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lozov, head of the North Ossetian </F> Interim Administration, by Major Vladimir Gilyuk in Vladikavkaz;  date not given: "Conflict Zone: Are Leaders Wise Enough?"]    [Text] As you know, the state of emergency regime has been  extended in a number of rayons of Ingushetia and North Ossetia  by Russian presidential edict. This enforced measure was  approved at a closed session of the Federation Council. The  upper chamber of the Russian parliament will continue seeking  ways to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. The sides  themselves have viewed the extension of the regime with  understanding, but without approval. Today we are publishing an  interview with Vladimir Lozov, head of the Interim  Administration, in which he hints that the skepticism of the  parties to the conflict is nonetheless unfounded.    [Gilyuk] Vladimir Demyanovich, what is your view of the  current situation in the state of emergency area?    [Lozov] It is still extremely complex. This is because --  in the view of the Ossetian and the Ingush sides, with which I  can agree there has still been no political assessment of the  armed conflict. The facts are borne out by the results of  sociological studies conducted by the Interim Administration.  Some 80 percent of Ossetians and 20 percent of the Ingush  advocate publishing such an assessment. What is more, the  factors that gave rise to the conflict have not been eliminated.    [Gilyuk] Can you tell us what they are?    [Lozov] In first place I would cite the Ingush Republic  leadership's continuing claims to part of the territory of North  Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. As for the Ossetian side, it has  still not adopted a decision distancing itself from the idea  that it is impossible to cohabit with the Ingush.    What is more, a huge arsenal of weapons has been stockpiled  in this region. And, as you know, these weapons are being used.  Nor is there a unified regional policy on fighting crime.  There is no well-organized cooperation between these republics'  law-enforcement structures.    The socioeconomic and demographic situation in the region is  tricky. Tens of thousands of innocent citizens have lost their  homes....    [Gilyuk] What steps must be taken to implement the Russian  president's edict of 13 December last year and the accords  reached in the city of Nalchik?    [Lozov] In our view it is first necessary to formulate  coordinated measures to implement the provisions of the edict  and the protocol adopted at the meeting of North Caucasus  republic leaders in Nalchik. They have not yet been elaborated.  Even then they have, they will need to be implemented.    [Gilyuk] What has the Interim Administration done to this  end?    [Lozov] We have succeeded in stabilizing the situation: The  number of provocations and terrorist manifestations has dropped.  We have incorporated our own view of how to settle the conflict  in a number of proposals now being considered by Ingushetia and  North Ossetia. Provision is being made to organize and hold  talks with a view to working out coordinated practical steps to  improve the situation in the region, confiscate unauthorized  weapons -- the use of which is poorly monitored by local  law-enforcement organs -- and detect and suppress the activity  of extremist and nationalist individuals and groups which are  trying to hobble the emergent process of rapprochement and the  longed-for reconciliation of the two republics' peoples. It is  planned to carry out a series of measures aimed at resolving the  social and economic questions involved in bringing back,  resettling, and looking after refugees and enforced migrants on  the two republics' territory.    [Gilyuk] Apart from the above plans, has the Interim  Administration made any progress or achieved any concrete  results in its activity?    [Lozov] Yes. But first I must talk about the material and  financial "injections" from the Russian Federation Government.  In the last year direct spending alone to stabilize the  situation in the state of emergency area has cost the Russian  budget over 30 billion rubles, and remarkably, Russian subsidies  make up the overwhelming proportion of both sides' budgets.    We conducted an inventory of all the facilities in four  population centers. A total of 2,389 homes and 63 social  facilities were surveyed. To show you the scale of the tragedy  and the amount of work that lies ahead let me tell you that only  915 of the 2,389 homes remained intact and 33 of the 63 social  and consumer facilities had been destroyed or damaged.    [Gilyuk] Vladimir Demyanovich, what must be done primarily  to begin the process of bringing back refugees and enforced  migrants?    [Lozov] I am convinced that the process of bringing back  enforced migrants must go hand in hand with moves to reconcile  the inhabitants. A meeting of the two republics' presidents  with a view to coordinating and formulating practical steps  pertaining to the whole question of solving refugees' problems  and other issues in the Kislovodsk agreements would be an  extremely important political step ensuring that favorable  conditions are created for the edict to be fulfilled. I want to  stress that without political will and wisdom from the two  leaders, backed up by the republics' organs of government and  socionational movements, it will be impossible to reconcile the  peoples and on that basis to bring people back and look after  them.</p>

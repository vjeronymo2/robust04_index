			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the </F> General Staff, by Zbigniew Lentowicz; place and date not given:  "Our Strong Army; In 10 Years, Our Army Will Be Smaller but  More Professional"]    [Text] [Lentowicz] Mr. General, you and your close  associates from the General Staff, which is the chief organ for  commanding the Armed Forces today, have been charged with  personal responsibility for what the Armed Forces of the Polish  Republic will be like in the future. What did you begin with?    [Wilecki] We deliberated very thoroughly the issue of our  country's defense philosophy, alliances, and security systems,  and, of course, we also used our national tradition as a basis.  It is the General Staff's view that Poland needs an army  consisting of conscripts and of professional military, with the  length of the basic military service being of one-year duration  in the future. As a general rule, our goal is to extend the  popular duty of defense preparation to all citizens, and that  goal is expressed in the draft of a future law on the popular  defense duty.    [Lentowicz] Does it mean that you [General Staff] intend to  cut down on the current list of possibilities for using  postponements of military service again?    [Wilecki] We intend to reduce the list radically. It is  obvious that some exceptions to the general rule of popular  military service must be allowed for purely humanitarian  reasons. But what is happening today proves that the law-making  agencies that enacted the current provisions, in our view,  committed a strategic error. Fifty percent of Polish youth  manage to avoid military service for various reasons.    [Lentowicz] Professionalization is the other issue....    [Wilecki] We want to achieve a considerable degree of  professionalization of the service. Therefore, we will have  soldiers of a professional service, a contract service, and an  over-the-time service. At the end of 1995, we should reach the  level of 16,000-20,000 over-the-time soldiers. That would make  it possible for us to assign experienced "experts" to the most  modern combat equipment units.    When it comes to military units today, only every tenth  person who would like to do so has the chance of remaining in  the service longer--that is, for another two to four years.    When one looks at current price lists, about a trillion  zlotys [Z] will have to be spent from the state budget for  making all over-the-time contracts operational. By the end of  June--that is, after the experiment is over--we will know how to  go about creating an image of that kind of service and also how  to provide financial incentives for people to serve there in the  most unrewarding kinds of posts.    [Lentowicz] The Vienna treaties imposed an obligation on us  to further cut down on the size of the Army, which now stands at  250,000. How many officers will simply be deprived of their  jobs?    [Wilecki] Reaching a specific size of the Armed Forces  (234,000) and also limitations regarding military equipment also  largely determine the future of the internal structures in the  Army. One had to come up with new, better, and more effective  kinds of measures, and also to see to it that the necessary  combat readiness of detachments and subdetachments be maintained  during restructuring. As early as 1997, an organizational  framework of the Armed Forces will be set up, with the Army's  final form being reached in 10 years. We will then have a  smaller Army but also a more professional one, and it will also  have greater combat and maneuver possibilities. One cannot  avoid cuts that will occur on the way to reaching that goal. We  must give up the professional cadre, especially in the Army  administration and in "logistical" support--that is,  quartermaster, medical, and commissary services. Many posts  currently occupied by officers will be taken over by ensigns and  noncommissioned officers. We are approaching difficult  transformations in the most rational manner possible. Reductions  in officer surpluses are facilitated by a new law on retirement  pensions, which makes it possible to leave the service sooner.  Besides, the changes will be spread over many years.    [Lentowicz] So we do not face the danger of a rebellion by  unwanted officers?    [Wilecki] I do not think we so. In the Polish Army, there  is no problem with lack of discipline or insufficient  subordination. The fact that currently there are 20,000 members  of the cadre awaiting apartments or improvements in their  housing conditions or that there are many military families  whose members do not live together did not have an impact on the  needs of the service, either. If only other state structures  were in as good condition as the Army, I think our country's  situation would be much better.    [Lentowicz] During the times of the Warsaw Pact, the Polish  Army was supposed to be a home front for Soviet fronts. Right  now, getting rid of the asymmetrical dislocation of forces  established at the time is a problem. What will change after  "Wilecki's model" is implemented?    [Wilecki] The backbone of our Armed Forces is made up of  land forces that in peace time are concentrated in four regions.  The fact that they will be organized into corps-division-brigade  structures will make these forces more mobile and also more  easily maneuverable and logistically supplied. Air forces are  another important element--these are supposed to perform the  role of an umbrella for the Republic of Poland during peace  time, and they are supposed to be a "shield and sword" in  wartime. Unfortunately, that type of military unit costs a  lot--supplying new missiles or aircraft means enormous  expenditures.    [Lentowicz] And yet you began the process of strengthening  air forces with cuts and reductions precisely in the area of  aerial military units.    [Wilecki] As recently as a few years ago, we had almost  1,000 aircraft. Currently, in accordance with the Vienna  agreements, we can have 460 at most, so it would be hard to  imagine maintaining entire technical supply units or the  elaborate services supporting the aerial equipment.    [Lentowicz] These days, no one any longer wants buildings  and other items left behind by the Army, whereas the Army made a  decision, for instance, to give up 20 of its airfields....    [Wilecki] We have addressed supreme authorities to prepare  the territorial government administration to receive not only  that part of the legacy. It would be a shame if the entire  infrastructure were to go down the drain.    [Lentowicz] What is the current value of the so-called  superfluous military property? Has anyone tried to calculate  that at all?    [Wilecki] What we intend to transfer to the national economy  this year and next is, according to our calculations, worth  Z80-90 trillion. That comprises 10-15 percent of the entire  military property: garrisons, airfields, and training fields'  infrastructure. There are also serious problems. As late as a  few years ago, local authorities were pressuring us to eliminate  garrisons; they demanded an immediate transfer of military  sites, and we defended ourselves. Today, the situation is  different: Demands are being made that the Army be present in  every small town, every gmina [small administrative units] and  voivodship [administrative units].    [Lentowicz] Is there a fear? Of what?    [Wilecki] This is not just about anxiety. Apart from a  certain stabilization and contributing to a sense of safety, an  army is also a factor contributing to the establishment of new  cities and towns. It creates "civilian" jobs, and, in small  centers, it occupies a significant position on the market in  terms of being a purchaser. However, we cannot afford to  maintain a military infrastructure this huge. So we are  gradually eliminating garrisons in the country's central  regions. Last year, we completely eliminated 11 garrisons, five  airfields, and seven testing grounds. This year, another 13  garrisons will be eliminated, including some with a substantive  historical tradition. We must dissolve 25 garrisons in total  and reduce the number of troops in many others.    [Lentowicz] Do the cadre, the officers in the units  affected, have a clear vision of the future? Do they already  know where they will be assigned next?    [Wilecki] The answer is yes with regard to a substantial  proportion of units that are being established on the basis of  the new structure, while the remaining officers will be learning  about that in due course.    [Lentowicz] Do you not think that the youngest cadre, in  particular--that is, officers dating back to the 1980's--who are  largely the result of a negative selection, will be able to  influence the cadre's quality shortly, and that they perhaps  will fail to meet challenges a modern army creates?    [Wilecki] Every now and then I hear about this negative  selection theory. I am hereby stating officially that there has  never been any negative selection in the Army with regard to  cadre selection. At least as far as I am concerned, I cannot  agree with such statements. You can never tell whether a young  man age 20 something will definitely become a general or whether  he will burn himself out in the Army as a captain. An army is a  tough school of life, and often we are not the ones who decide  personally where to go next. During 30 years of service, I have  already changed my residence 11 times.    [Lentowicz] And yet, many military, in accordance with the  spirit of the time, are beginning to regard the Army not as a  vocation but as a profession.    [Wilecki] I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  But still, my experience is that I do not come across  subordinates who tell me that they only work until 1500.... That  is, I have not come across them from the time I first put on my  uniform.    [Lentowicz] Army restructuring makes it imperative to make  choices. So who will be treated preferentially in terms of jobs  or finances?    [Wilecki] Reconnaissance and radioelectronic fight units are  priorities, as well as commanding systems and those systems that  secure the Army's functioning under combat conditions. We will  enlarge the entire antiarmor branch and also the antiaircraft  branch, the so-called small technologies. We are also concerned  with building a popular defense system that would be based on  territorial defenses, among others.    [Lentowicz] And a Krakow district will have new experiences  in that field?    [Wilecki] A new military district of Krakow will be the  experiment's main site. Within three to five years, we will  test new corps-brigade structures in the district, as well as a  model of land forces, where air forces would have a significant  contribution. We intend to secure maximum aerial mobility and  maneuverability of the troops in the region by equipping the  units there, among others, with Polish-made helicopters produced  by the Swidnik plant.    [Lentowicz] That is if appropriate finances can be found for  that.    [Wilecki] The final say has not been proclaimed yet with  regard to the state budget. If the budget really stays the way  it is now, including the rigid formula for expenditures that  have been imposed upon us, we will have to make substantial  changes regarding our purchase plans. That would consequently  mean a withdrawal of orders, which have already been submitted  to some factories, especially orders for armored weaponry,  antiarmor and antiaircraft means, and also other means of a  so-called small combat technique. By the way, I cannot  reconcile myself with the fact that, through a vote by this or  that Sejm deputy who cares only for his factory, we are forced  to make purchases of items we do not really need. To make IRYDA  the kind of equipment that would make us happy, one must still  make a lot of changes in it. For the moment, the aircraft does  not meet our expectations. Right now, we are waiting for a  satisfactory final offer from Mielec.    [Lentowicz] Does the present budget make it possible for  you to take any steps aimed at modernizing the Army?    [Wilecki] The time has finally come for radical decisions  and measures. Our military technology is to a large extent  decapitalized. We have argued for a long time now that a budget  that equals 3 percent of the GDP would allow us to begin  modernizing the combat equipment. We are still looking for  internal reserves; however, tightening one's belt is possible to  only a certain extent.    [Lentowicz] Today it is not only the extra parliamentary  opposition that keeps saying that the Army is "becoming  increasingly autonomous." You yourself keep the General Staff  away from the press--that is, from the judgments of public  opinion. Does the head of the General Staff feel that he is  fairly controlled by the civilians?    [Wilecki] I think the political practice in the recent  period has been healthy and rational. If we look at it through  the prism of accepted customs here, we can say that the control  is full. It is exercised by the president with his office, by  the parliament with the Sejm National Defense Committee; the  Supreme Chamber of Control has proved its competence for years;  there is also my superior, the civilian minister of defense,  with his entire very significant apparatus. The spokesman for  civic rights also comes to visit our units. Therefore, I  believe that there are enough controlling establishments. We  propose, however, that these controls be followed by responsible  and concrete decisions. This calls for appropriate provisions  in the Constitution and other legal solutions. You can be  certain that, if the head of the General Staff--let us call him  "the first soldier"--has influence on the Armed Forces, all of  the important decisions he makes are consulted with his  superiors.    [Lentowicz] How often do you consult the president?    [Wilecki] Not very often. Let us say, as often as is needed.    [Lentowicz] Is this the result of the fact that the  commander in chief trusts you entirely?    [Wilecki] We value the friendliness and understanding of the  president toward the Army. The president has done a lot for the  Army, and we are grateful that the atmosphere he has created  allows us to carry out the transformation of the Armed Forces  without any interruption.    [Lentowicz] Military people are saying many bitter words  about parliament members. The present Ministry of National  Defense [MON] head has reiterated them many times in public. Is  this not going to be detrimental to the interests of the defense  system in the Sejm?    [Wilecki] The previous and the present National Defense  Committee are making efforts that must be appreciated. I am  more critical of various groupings that, in a political fight  and to achieve some temporary goals, exaggerate some problems,  which are usually of secondary or even less importance and claim  that they are strategic issues. This is not conducive to  building the image of the Polish Army in the world. I am also  often utterly upset by statements of irresponsible, accidental  persons, who have not served in the Army and sometimes have had  only a fleeting contact with our ministry. I also often  reiterate that, in the area of defense, there are issues that  are better discussed in the recess of an office, at a closed  parliamentary session; we should not reveal our greater or  smaller defense weaknesses at an international forum.    Interesting is the fact that, whenever we meet with our  partners abroad, the Polish Army, not an exaggerated courtesy,  by any means, is perceived as a strong, responsible,  well-organized partner.    Actually, we are cooperating with all of our seven neighbors  in the border areas. On the continent, we are looked upon as a  considerable, medium-size European army that has temporary  problems with technical equipment but that has valuable soldiers  at its disposal. In comparison with some NATO armies, such as  the Turkish, Spanish, and Italian Armies, we really should not  be ashamed. All of those armies, apart from ultramodern  technology, have equipment of previous generations; one can even  find older tanks, aircraft, or drawn artillery there.    [Lentowicz] How should we explain the recent measures that  practically subordinate the Military Information Services  (intelligence and counterintelligence) to the General Staff and  thus deprive the civilian minister of some of the powers he had  before?    [Wilecki] Special services are an element of reconnaissance,  and they are supposed to provide the Armed Forces with all of  the necessary information and data. Military intelligence and  counterintelligence must first of all be included in the state's  defense system--that is, serve the purpose for which they have  been established.    [Lentowicz] The case of the Military Information Services,  transferring educational issues to the General Staff, as well as  other steps of this kind lead one to believe that increasingly  more prerogatives of the civilian head of the ministry are now  being taken away from him and given to the military segment.    [Wilecki] There is no use exaggerating this problem. It  must be remembered that, in the area of legal regulations, we  have not done anything special thus far. In place of a  totalitarian military commander, the head of MON, with enormous  prerogatives and powers, we once put a civilian person who was  entirely unprepared for that. It could be seen every single day  that the duties were greater than the capabilities of those  people. Thus, every single day people in uniform had to explain  certain issues, so obvious to them, to the inexperienced  politicians. We lost a lot of energy explaining issues of  secondary importance to them; there were many clashes, whereas  the main problems remained unsolved. Therefore, I believe that  first the powers must be divided very precisely "in high  places"; they should be regulated by laws. I want to know  exactly what my responsibility is in the area of the state's  defense, of which the Army is only a fragment, and what the  responsibility of the minister, as well as other cabinet  members, is.    [Lentowicz] The new bill on the general duty of defense has  been prepared in the General Staff, so it does reflect your  viewpoint.    [Wilecki] This is really a dilemma of our times. However,  who else should have drafted this law? The problem was that no  one else was ready or able to deal with this matter. We propose  that the solutions that have been arrived at in the General  Staff now be discussed by politicians. Perhaps we will avoid a  legislative catastrophe, which came in the wake of the recent  amendment of the Law on General Defense Duty, the programmatic  content of which was at that time not discussed with the  military. Only now can we evaluate that the authors were guided  by wishful thinking, emotions, and not by the desire to approach  the building of a new defense system rationally. Instead of a  comment, I will only say that, when last year we volunteered to  provide politicians particularly interested in these issues with  the most fundamental knowledge about the Army and the state  defense system, and even prepared for that in the National  Defense Academy, no politicians accepted the offer.    [Lentowicz] The Army does not willingly accept changes; it  has always been a slightly conservative establishment. However,  soldiers in barracks have for too long been waiting for new  regulations--disciplinary regulations, for instance--that  determine the life of military communities in units.    [Wilecki] I do not want to make my subordinates happy by  force; they were brought up in a certain tradition. I do not  want to do that by means of solutions that would not be  accepted. The proposals of regulations are currently being  consulted on a low level. Now, as for the conservatism, with  which the Army feels quite good, I will only say that other  armies as well as our state establishments envy us that. In  opinion polls, in which the Army has been in the lead for a long  time now, this pinch of conservatism is obviously approved of by  the people as well.    [Lentowicz] What do you think of the political games aimed  at introducing another "coalition" deputy minister to MON?    [Wilecki] The structures of the ministry cannot be built for  the people who come there.    [Lentowicz] Does the Army now have any concrete plans  concerning the "Partnership for Peace" initiative?    [Wilecki] We are now getting down to the practical  dimension, related to the implementation of bilateral and  multilateral political agreements. In the middle of this year  in Denmark and Germany, there will be exercises with the  participation of Polish soldiers; toward the end of the summer,  maritime exercises will be conducted. Staff discussions on  these issues have already begun. We are also planning joint  training with the French Army. Today my French counterpart is  beginning his visit to Poland.</p>

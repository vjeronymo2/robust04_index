			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Economic Digest: GDP soars in South Korea South Korean gross domestic product is forecast to grow by at least 8.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, according to Mr Kim Myung-ho, governor of the central bank. GNP grew by 5.6 per cent during the whole of 1993. The country's industrial output shot up 10.2 per cent in the first quarter from 1 per cent in the same period last year, the national statistical office reported. The state-funded Korea Development Institute recently revised its projection for gross national product to a real 7.6 per cent growth in 1994 from an earlier forecast of 7 per cent. 'With exports steadily increasing and the recovery in fixed capital investment accelerating, GNP is expected to grow more quickly than earlier forecast,' it said. An even more optimistic view comes from Schroders Securities which revised its GNP projection for the year to 8.2 per cent from an earlier 6.5 per cent. Japan's domestic vehicle sales are on a recovery path despite the year-on-year slippage in April for the 13th month in a row, industry officiala said yesterday. April's 6.6 per cent fall to 372,755 vehicles should not be seen as a sharp drop, said an official of the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association. One reason for the April fall, ironically, was a tax cut. Customers bought cars in March as dealers offered discounts to offset the effect of an April cut in the consumption tax. Portugal's overall trade deficit fell 11.3 per cent last year to Esc1,430.8bn (Pounds 5.55bn), with imports falling 4.6 per cent to 3,900.6 billion, according to official figures. Employment fell in large Italian companies by 0.4 per cent in January compared with December and was 5.1 per cent lower year-on-year, the Istat statistics bureau reported. The statistic covers companies with more than 500 employees but excludes the construction sector. Swedish new car registrations rose by 44 per cent in April to a preliminary 15,750 from 10,919 in April, 1993, according to the Swedish car retailers' association. The figure for the first four months of the year showed a 27 per cent rise, to 52,939 from 41,612 in January-April 1993.</p>

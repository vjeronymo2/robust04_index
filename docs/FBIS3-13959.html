			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bengali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Letter Writer to American President"] </F>   [Text] A cartoon has been published in newspapers showing  U.S. President Bill Clinton busy writing letters by dipping his  pen in a pot containing poison instead of ink. Meanwhile,  official circles in the United States have expressed surprise  over the hue and cry in India centering around the two letters  written by President Clinton. They even questioned why the  Indian Government felt it necessary to lodge protests over the  letters. Washington stated that the President's office receives  many letters every day, and his staff prepares the reply to the  letters selected by them. It added that the President only puts  his signature on letters drafted by his staff. The President  does not have the time to go through these letters to see what  has been written. Their clarification is not totally untrue.  If the President had to reply to all the letters received by  his office, then perhaps he would not have time to do other  tasks, including eating and bathing. However, the explanation  given by the President's aides is not acceptable. It is  surprising to note that letters written on political issues are  taken so lightly by the President's office, and replies to such  letters are also prepared in the same manner. It is desirable  that the President's signature carry more weight.    The President should decide which letters should be selected  for replies. He cannot refuse to give a reply to the letter  written by Congressman Gary A. Condit who belongs to his own  party. Someone should have the responsibility of going through  the subject matter of the letter and taking precautions in  replying so that it does not hurt those who are concerned with  it. It is possible that the close aides of the President can  work in accordance with their own likings and dislikings and  justify their actions in the name of the President. Congressman  Condit might feel encouraged to plead shamelessly for the  militants of Khalistan with a view to pleasing a section of the  voters in his constituency. However, the tone of the  President's letter shows that he is himself pleading for the  Sikhs. In replying to another letter sent by the pro-Pakistan  Kashmiri American Council, President Clinton's letter gives the  impression that he is raising the issue of protecting human  rights in Kashmir with a view to assisting the secessionists.  The U.S. Government spokesman has said that such an  interpretation of the President's letter is unfortunate. He  further added that Washington does not support terrorists or  secessionist activities in any part of the globe. Their claim  may not be wrong, but it does not seem that staff of the White  House have the professional skill to prove their claim in the  case of India.    It should be noted that the Indian Government did not  hesitate to lodge a strong protest in this regard. New Delhi  also expressed its dissatisfaction over the issue through its  ambassador in Washington, Siddharta Shankar Ray. It is  necessary to lodge protests against the tendency of the present  U.S. administration to indulge in unnecessary bossing. However,  it would not be proper to think that the responsibility of India  is over after the lodging of the protest. It is a type of  weakness to display reaction over all matters. On one hand, we  claim that human rights are not being violated in Punjab,  Kashmir, or any other part of the country, while on the other,  we will express our anger if anyone wants to probe into the  alleged violations. This is not fair. In the past, several  attempts were made to tarnish the image of our armed forces by  bringing false charges against them. This is not acceptable.  It is necessary to follow an open-door policy with a view to  protecting the image of our armed forces. This would help in  removing the doubts and the concern being expressed over human  rights violations. It is true that the army and the police  sometimes resort to repression, but the number of such incidents  is very small. For this reason, it is good to confess the  truth. This is the best way to close the mouths of those who  protest. We should give up the habit of concealing to make  others think that we have nothing to conceal.  *</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEATING ASKS TO GET LINCOLN S&amp;L BACK FOR TAXPAYERS' SAKE  </P> <P> Charles Keating, the former chairman of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  Assn., asked a federal judge Tuesday to let him operate the thrift under  judicial supervision.  </P> <P> Keating told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin that he could invest "every  ounce of my energy" but no cash into the Irvine, Calif., thrift if it is  returned to him.  </P> <P> Why no cash?  </P> <P> "I'm completely broke, as is all of my family," Keating said. "We're absolutely  broke as a result of this debacle."  </P> <P> "My question," Sporkin asked, "is how can someone say, 'Here, take it back,'  and expose $4 billion in depositors' money to someone's promise?"  </P> <P> Keating replied that he could save taxpayers' money by operating Lincoln's  assets instead of liquidating them as part of the government's thrift bailout  effort.  </P> <P> "Something else has to be tried. Something has to make history," he said. "You  always look back in the court of history. Here you can make it."  </P> <P> The exchange took place during a pretrial hearing on a government motion  seeking to dismiss a lawsuit Keating filed last May seeking the return of  Lincoln, which was seized by the government last April.  </P> <P> Regulators have estimated that protecting Lincoln's depositors from losses  could cost taxpayers as much as $2.5 billion, a figure Keating disputes. The  government also has filed a $1-billion fraud and racketeering suit against the  Arizona executive.  </P> <P> Keating told Sporkin that with his expertise, combined with the talents of  former Lincoln employees, the thrift could be operated profitably, preventing  any losses to depositors. He submitted a package of resumes of former employees  for Sporkin's review.  </P> <P> "The bondholders would recover, the taxpayers would have no loss, we could  outperform anybody else with the assets we've assembled," Keating said. "I  think it would be great to return Lincoln without any liquidation."  </P> <P> Keating's proposal came near the close of his fifth day on the witness stand  and moments before his attorneys rested their case.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Keating's attorneys produced a government memo showing that  federal examiners miscalculated Lincoln's net worth by $60 million.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Lincoln said the memo is significant because regulators ordered  Lincoln to operate under government-issued supervisory directives after finding  the thrift to be undercapitalized.  </P> <P> The directives limited the types of transactions the thrift could make.  </P> <P> The memo, dated Feb. 17, 1989, less than two months before the government  seized the Irvine thrift, was addressed to the regulators in charge of  overseeing the examination of Lincoln.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I find this error, if verified, most distressing -- not because it  changes my view of Lincoln and what has and will have to be done, but because  of how Lincoln will use it," wrote Alvin Smuzynski, a senior regulatory  official with the Office of Regulatory Affairs, a division of the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board.  </P> <P> In an interview, Kevin O'Connell, who supervised the government's examination  of Lincoln, discounted the memo as being based on "first blush" numbers and  said the mathematical error was never verified.  </P> <P> "There was no mistake by examiners," he said.  </P> <P> "The gentleman either can't add or he's a liar," responded Keating outside the  courtroom.  </P> <P> Keating's attorneys also produced a 1985 letter from Alan Greenspan, then a  private economist and now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, urging  regulators to grant Lincoln an exemption from stricter direct-investment rules.  </P> <P> Greenspan wrote that denial of an exemption "would work a serious and unfair  hardship on an association that has, through its skill and expertise,  transformed itself into a financially strong institution that presents no  foreseeable risk to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp."  </P> <P> Keating's attorneys attribute the demise of Lincoln to a "vendetta" by  regulators incensed over Keating's opposition to the direct-investment rule.  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Clinton trade policy makes noisy debut - Tactics come to the fore AMID a chorus of criticism and confusion abroad, the Clinton administration's trade policy has begun to emerge in speeches, interviews and, most tellingly, in its actions. In the fine tradition of the Democratic party (accused of devouring its own in the heat of battle), the debate is noisy. But it is more about tactics than policy, and insiders pour scorn on reports of differences among the main policymakers. Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former Republican trade official, and confidant of a number of Clinton trade policymakers, insists there is little conflict in the administration. He says there are different perspectives, depending on the officials' briefs, because 'you don't expect monolithic expressions' of opinion. In fact, trade policy under President Clinton is little changed from the days of George Bush. One way in which they are different, however, is that Mrs Carla Hills, President Bush's trade representative, imposed sanctions only reluctantly; her successor, Mr Mickey Kantor, believes US credibility suffered as a result. If he is the 'agnostic' he claims to be on trade policy, he is a complete atheist on the danger of trade war. He believes it will not happen. The players in the world economy have grown too interdependent - witness the administration's soul-searching on the question of renewing China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. During the presidential campaign, Mr Clinton promised to make China's MFN status conditional on good behaviour on human rights and weapons transfers. As president, he has learned US aircraft makers, farmers and importers - as well as friends in Hong Kong - are dependent on good US-China business relations. Mr Clinton is struggling to unearth a benign China strategy to honour his campaign pledge. On other fronts, there is no longer any hesitation. The administration is determined to complete the Uruguay Round this year, if it can be done at all. The tactics are mostly in the hands of Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of trade. The two experienced negotiators have developed a good working relationship, and showed in their recent agreement over government procurement that both possess the agility to succeed where others have not. The question has become how much they can achieve rather than whether. So confident is the administration that even before a Uruguay Round agreement has been forged, it has begun to prepare for a new 'Clinton Round' to deal with trade-related environmental issues, competition policy and technology. On Nafta the administration is pushing to complete side agreements on labour and environment next month, despite polls which show the pact in deep trouble with voters. It has taken up the Bush vision of a hemispheric-wide free trade agreement. However, it also intends to strengthen ties with Asia through the Asia Pacific Economic Council. Among the 15 nations, efforts will be made to create a regional trade and investment framework, to achieve minimum standards harmonisation and forge common approaches to trade and investment. Key to the administration's relations with Congress will be Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, and a respected adviser. In a pessimistic but thoughtful speech on Tuesday, Mr Gephardt warned of polarisation over Nafta because of emerging Republican opposition to the side agreements, necessary to its passage in Congress. Angry, too, at the press and academics who 'pigeonhole us as protectionists or worse,' Mr Gephardt laid out a depressing vision of a changing world where the old economic rules - for example the linkage between wage and productivity growth - no longer automatically produce high-wage economies. The prescription for the future is fiscal responsibility, retraining, rebuilding, research and development. Trade policy, while only part of the larger economic mosaic, is 'the inescapable link to the world economy'. His view of the need to manage trade in a complex world is shared by administration trade thinkers. This is true particularly with Japan, where, says one senior trade official, 'we have been very Japanese about Japan, reading off the same script'. There are few, if any, defectors from the 'Japan is Different' school, and the decision to apply pressure for quantifiable goals akin to the recent semi-conductor agreement awaits a definitive strategy. Mr Prestowitz scorns the view that economic adviser Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who selectively advocates industrial policy, and Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a supposed free trader, represent clashing poles in the administration. He recalls that Mr Bentsen was the author of the controversial Super 301 legislation which empowers the US administration to take unilateral action against countries it sees as unfair traders.</p>

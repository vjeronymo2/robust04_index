			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEA FACES BACKLASH FOR GRANT POLICY  </P> <P> One of the nation's largest arts groups suggested today that irreparable damage  may have been done to the National Endowment for the Arts in a new controversy  over cancellation of a grant for an art show on the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> And in Washington, a spokesman for a House subcommittee that will hold a  hearing next week on the conflict between artistic freedom of expression and  taxpayer rights said the panel's chairman is concerned that the new controversy  may have so compromised the arts endowment that "it is no longer a vehicle for  freedom of speech."  </P> <P> The statements came in reaction to Wednesday's decision by NEA Chairman John E.  Frohnmayer to cancel the $10,000 grant to Artists Space, a New York City  artists group and gallery that has scheduled a Nov. 16 opening for the AIDS  show, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." The show includes some sexually  explicit photographs and political commentary on various aspects of the social  devastation brought about by AIDS.  </P> <P> Milton Rhodes, president of the American Council for the Arts, said the arts  endowment decision, which Frohnmayer said was taken because the "Witnesses"  show was too politically risky in view of recent pressure on the NEA in  Congress, places the federal arts agency in grave short-term and long-term  danger.  </P></p>

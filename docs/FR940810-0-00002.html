L. 103&hyph;89), which provides for the temporary extension and orderly termination of the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) and specifies how former PMRS employees will be paid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> September 9, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> James Weddel, (202) 606&hyph;2858, concerning questions about the changes in 5 CFR parts 511, 530, 531, 536, 575, 591, and 595; and Barbara Colchao, (202) 606&hyph;2720, concerning questions about the changes in 5 CFR parts 293, 351, 430, 432, 451, 540, and 771. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On December 15, 1993, at 58 FR 65531, OPM published interim regulations to implement the ``Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89), with a 60-day comment period. These regulations were made effective retroactive to November 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 30, 1993, at 58 FR 69169, OPM published final regulations to implement locality-based comparability payments under the ``Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990'' (FEPCA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;509). The locality pay regulations revised the definitions of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> scheduled annual rate of pay  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in &sect;&sect;531.101 and 531.301 which were previously published in the interim regulations implementing the PMRS Termination Act. The final regulations on locality pay were made effective January 1, 1994, and were applicable on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 3, 1994, at 59 FR 5223, OPM published corrections to fix three typographical errors in the interim regulations for PMRS termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the comment period, which ended February 14, 1994, OPM received three comments, each from a different Federal agency. One agency suggested revising the regulations to clarify that employees cannot ``become'' GM employees after November 1, 1993, and to specify the personnel actions that would trigger loss of GM status. A second agency asked for clarification of whether an employee who loses coverage as a result of a temporary promotion regains coverage when the temporary promotion ends, and if so, how the employee's pay would be set. A third agency felt that the text of &sect;531.406(b)(2) (i)&hyph;(iii) specifying when time in a non-pay status is creditable service for a within-grade increase should be simplified. The agency also asserted that certain definitions in &sect;&sect;531.101 and 531.301 were superseded by revised definitions in the final locality pay regulations. Finally, it was called to our attention that the instructions for setting pay on loss of GM status should be revised to clarify that pay retention is not required if an employee requests a reduction in grade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following are the major issues raised, a summary of comments on each issue, and a discussion of changes made to the interim regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The definition of GM employee and loss of status as a GM employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One agency suggested that the statutory basis (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89) for the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> GM employee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> should be introduced in its regulatory definition in &sect;531.202. The agency also noted that the timing and basis for GM status could be clarified. Another agency specifically asked for clarification of whether an employee who loses GM status when temporarily promoted after October 31, 1993, regains GM status when the temporary promotion ends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion and Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OPM is adopting the suggestion that section 4 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;89, the Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993, be introduced in the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> GM employee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (see &sect;531.202(e)). Where possible, we are replacing references to coverage under section 4 of the Act with references to the amended definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> GM employee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and, where appropriate, to a new paragraph, ``status as a GM employee'' (see &sect;531.203(g)), which specifies personnel actions under which an employee would retain or permanently lose GM status (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 531.204 (d), (e) and (f), and &sect;536.308(b)(3)). Also, &sect;531.204(d) and the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> GM employee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have been amended to remove any suggestion that status as a GM employee can be acquired any time other than on November 1, 1993, the effective date of section 4 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a temporary promotion begins after October 31, 1993, coverage under section 4 of the PMRS Termination Act (GM status) ends because of the change in grade. Coverage cannot be regained once it is lost because it is linked to continuous service as a supervisor or management official in the same grade and in the same agency after October 31, 1993. Coverage is acquired only once, on November 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

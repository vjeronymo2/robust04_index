			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Excerpt] The Prime Minister insisted today that Britain  had wrung sufficient "concessions" from its European partners to  accept the so-called Greek compromise on voting powers.    To Opposition jeers in the Commons, Mr Major said in a  statement after this morning's Cabinet meeting on the issue,  that "progress on qualified majority voting was sufficient to be  acceptable until 1996." But a grim signal of trouble ahead from  Conservative Euro-rebels came in furious exchanges between Tory  Tony Marlow and the Prime Minister who was clearly enraged as Mr  Marlow told him: "As of now, My Right Honourable Friend has no  authority, credibility or identifiable policy in this vital  area!"    MPs gasped as Mr Marlow added: "Why don't you stand aside  and  make way for somebody else who provides authority...and  direction of leadership?"    Mr Major told a packed chamber there would then be a "root  and branch" review of the voting system -- which has been at the  centre of the row between Britain and her EU [European Union]  partners -- at the next inter-governmental conference.    The Prime Minister acknowledged that the weekend talks  between EU foreign ministers in Greece had met many but not all  of the Government's concerns. He said assurances had now been  received from the European Commission over the bringing forward  of proposals under the guise of Health and Safety articles,  which were not strictly relevant to the subject.    Labour leader John Smith branded the compromise agreement a  "humiliating climbdown" for Mr Major and added: "You seek to  camouflage your retreat from your vainglorious assertions of no  surrender." He said fear of warring factions in Tory Party had  propelled the Prime Minister "into an unwise conflict which you  could not -- and did not win."    In his statement, Mr Major said the Government had opposed  an  unqualified extension in the blocking minority in votes to 27  because ministers were concerned that successive extensions had  "weakened the democratic legitimacy of the Community."  Assurances had now been received from the Commission that "it  will not bring forwrd any further proposals under the Health and  Safety articles under its term of office except for measures  directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work."    The Commission had also now agreed that proposals under the  Social Chapter "will not embrace people or organisations in the  UK. For the purposes of the Social Chapter, the UK will be  entirely excluded from legislation."    He said: "The proposal on qualified majority voting (QMV)  negotiated by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd at the weekend  meets many -- though not all -- of the Government's concerns."  Agreement had been secured that the review of QMV in 1996 would  include voting thresholds as well as the number of votes  attributed to each member state. "At the request of the UK and  Spain, the transitional arrangements from accession until 1996  will no longer provide for unqualified extension of the blocking  minority to 27. The Council is under a legal and binding  obligation to seek agreement on the basis of a minority of at  least 23 votes." The Government expected this obligation to be  upheld scrupulously, he insisted.    Mr Major said: "On this basis, the Cabinet has concluded  that  since we wish to see the enlargement proceed, progress on QMV  was sufficient to be acceptable until 1996. We are informing  the Presidency that, provided the concessions made to the UK and  Spain are accepted without qualification by other member states,  the UK can accept this interim proposal.    ``Enlargement will bring into the Union countries which  share  Britain's open trading instincts.... It will be another large  step towards the wider, less centralised, open trading Europe  for which we are working.''    Mr Smith said: "However you seek to camouflage your retreat  from your vainglorious assertions of no surrender last week, you  have accepted a blocking minority of 27. Isn't your supposed  triumph of obtaining a minor period of delay hopelessly  undermined by the text of the declaration itself?"    He asked if the so-called assurances from the Commission  would extend beyond the end of the year and added: "You have had  to make a humiliating climbdown. Isn't the explanation for the  timing and whole sorry fiasco that you, fearful of the warring  factions in your own party, propelled yourself into an unwise  conflict, which you could not and did not win." It had resulted  in "unnecessary and severe damage to friendly countries and no  advantage to Britain."    Mr Major said a number of the Labour leader's points were  "factually inaccurate." He said: "What you appear to have  overlooked is that we have achieved a series of concessions that  would not have been available if we had adopted your position of  accepting, without let or hindrance, 27 for all areas  immediately.    ``We have not achieved the maintenance of the blocking  majority of 23. I would have ideally preferred that. But  neither have the other member states achieved what they would  have wished -- for we have obtained concessions particularly  that protect our most vulnerable flank on social affairs.''    To Labour jeers, he admitted that the agreement with the  Commission lasted only until the end of the year but added: "We  will certainly be seeking an extension under the new Commission  next year and I see no reason to suppose we won't achieve it."

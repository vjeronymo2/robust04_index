			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Australia considers rate rise The Reserve Bank of Australia would be willing to consider an increase in interest rates to protect the country's currency, Mr Bernie Fraser, the central bank's governor, said yesterday, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Mr Fraser also said that he believed that official interest rates might have been cut for the last time. The environment for monetary policy in Australia was changing, he told an investment conference in Tokyo, with economic activity picking up and the exchange rate lower. 'All this suggests the long phase of reductions in short-term interest rates is coming to an end', he concluded. Mr Fraser's remarks come after several weeks of battering for the Australian dollar, during which the Bank has intervened to support the currency.</p>

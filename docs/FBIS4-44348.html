			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kurt Horwitz: "The Dollar Rate as a Weapon in </F> the Trade War"]    [Text] "Comeback for the greenback" -- this is what eminent  financial publications wrote in their headlines at the beginning  of the year. They could refer to the unanimous predictions of  virtually all international financial strategists, and there was  absolutely no indication that, just like last year, the dollar  rate might again fall into a deep "summer hole."    Rising U.S. interests were making the American currency  attractive, the economy was flourishing, NAFTA was to provide  additional stimulus for industry, which was working at capacity  anyway. Some analysts even saw the dollar rise to the level of 2  German marks [DM] or 14 schillings after the American currency  had plummeted to DM1.60 or about 11 schillings in the middle of  last year.    The dollar has now dropped to that level again to the  surprise of everyone, at least in Europe. Yet, the real reason  for the weakness of the dollar is probably to be found further  east. In Tokyo, the U.S. currency stands at just 100 yen, which  is a historic low. Fifty years after Pearl Harbor, this might  impair the Americans' self assurance; economically, however, it  is a blessing for the U.S. economy, which suffered a more than  $60-billion record deficit last year in trade with Japan.    The lower the dollar falls, the more expensive Japanese cars  become, for example, on the American market. Or vice versa: To  remain competitive, the Japanese must put up with losses in  sales -- they get fewer yen for each dollar they gain in the  United States from their exports. The dollar is almost 10  percent down from last year's high.    This also explains why political experts in the United  States  not only acknowledge the decline of the dollar with relative  indifference but even deliberately produced it. Gail Fosler,  chief economist of the New York-based "Conference Board"  business organization, in a predicition that received wide  international attention, said that the dollar might drop as low  as DM1.50. His analysis is regarded as one important cause for  the slump of the dollar.    Fosler has, of course, provided good reasons: The German  economy was recovering, which would lead to rising interests in  Europe, making the dollar less attractive compared to the German  mark; prices for oil, metals, and agricultural products might  force up inflation in the United States in the second half of  the year and affect the economy. Investors got the message and  promptly sold dollars. They now prefer to invest in European  currencies and the yen.    Yet, this is only the obviously rational element of the  dollar spectacle. In reality, "negative remarks to force down  the U.S. currency" are an important part of the determined  campaign against the flood of Japanese exports. In the middle  of February, U.S. President Clinton, who was visibly upset, had  to recognize in the summit talks with then Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa that his partner in the talks was not ready to  conclude an efficient trade agreement.    For a moment, the Americans considered discriminating  against  Japanese products on the American market through a decree. Yet,  even in the United States, which certainly has very few scruples  as far as this is concerned, such a step would have been  regarded as a rather primitive blow against the unwanted  competitor.    Yet, what a coincidence: Since then, prominent U.S.  economists and political experts have analyzed the dollar  systematically down. Soon the dollar would be worth no more than  80 or 90 yen, they predict -- and the Japanese industry already  sees itself confronted with enormous losses on the U.S. market.    This is, of course, a much more elegant way of conducting a  trade war. Plus, it also explains why the Americans are  currently only making half-hearted attempts to effectively  stabilize the course of the dollar. Undesired side effects,  such as higher prices for certain imports, only play a  relatively insignificant role in this trade war.</p>

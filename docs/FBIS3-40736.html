			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Yusuf Sayigh, Palestinian Economic </F> Council member; place and date not given: "Dr. Yusuf al-Sayigh  Tells al-Safir the Entire Story of the Palestinian Economic  Council; Economic Separation From Israel Requires Surgery, and  We Will Perform It; Future Competition Will Be Between Israel  and Lebanon; Issuing Palestinian Currency Is a Risky Adventure"]    [Excerpt] From the position of an expert academic, Dr.  Yusuf Sayigh talks about the Palestinian occupied territories'  economy after occupation. Embarking on the details and dwelling  on an explanation of the causes and results, the economist  renounces the game of loyalty and opposition and becomes a  technician who tries to control damage and make the promised  start the best start possible.    One is amazed by the enthusiasm of this man, who was born in  Acre in 1916, and by his determination to face the  difficulties--and they are many--that obstruct, in his opinion,  the rescuing of the occupied territories' deteriorating economy.  He is not a politician and has no right to despair. Economy is a  science and cannot endure bargaining or withstand failure.    Sayigh, a part-time adviser to a number of Arab economic  establishments and a member of the Palestine National Council  since it was founded in 1964, seems to be the liaison between  the PLO, in its capacity as the future government in the  occupied territories, on the one hand and, on the other hand,  the IMF, the World Bank, and the aid-granting countries. Sayigh,  along with Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), tries to reconcile what is  economic to both sides with what is political.    AL-SAFIR interviewed Sayigh, who talked about the scheduled  economic plans, about the obstacles facing them, and about the  occupied territories' real needs, as compared with what is  actually projected. Sayigh pointed out that all projects are  still in limbo awaiting a final political decision, which is  supposed to be made by the PLO or, to be specific, by PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.    In the interview Dr. Sayigh explains the reasons he moved  away from Tunis lately, where he was confronted with the  problems of bureaucracy and of exclusive decisionmaking, and  where he could no longer continue to be a spectator watching  catastrophic mistakes being made in preparing for the  Palestinian future. He recounts the story of how the Palestinian  Economic Council was formed and discusses the debate with the  World Bank, the Palestinian economy's future and role, Israel's  future plans, the region's future economic conflicts, and the  endeavors to promote the so-called Mideastern market. Here is  the text of the interview:    [AL-SAFIR] Economic issues continue to represent the most  important aspect of the accord...    [Sayigh] I was away from Tunisia--I was in Lebanon--when the  accord was announced on 13 September, and I was surprised by it.  But I am not opposed to the accord. However, we could have  gotten more economically, especially since Israel seeks to cross  into the Arab countries economically through the accord. Had  Palestinian negotiators mastered tactics, they would have  achieved greater economic gains.    [AL-SAFIR] So Israel wants the new Palestinian entity to be  a  bridge to the other Arab countries? How can this be accomplished  tangibly?    [Sayigh] Even though most Arab states are eager to lift the  boycott of Israel, they say that it cannot be lifted unless  Israel reaches a settlement with the Palestinians.  Theoretically, these states are in a state of hostility and war  with Israel. The only card they hold is the boycott card.  Recognition is not a card in the Arabs' hands. Consequently, we  have had to fight for the only remaining card. What could we  have obtained? Now, we (Palestinians) and the Israelis have  become like Siamese twins economically. The appendices to the  accord show that we are strongly tied to the Israelis  economically and that we will end up turning our back on the  Arab economies. It will not be easy for us to separate from the  Israelis. The matter will require "surgery," and we will be  compelled to perform this surgery.    [AL-SAFIR] Fundamentally, did this link with Israel not  exist  prior to the accord?    [Sayigh] It existed in spite of us. Now it has become  stronger, with our signature, and herein lies the danger.  Initially, the link was imposed on us by a colonialist and  occupying power. Now we have put our signature to the accord.  Thus, the link has been given our approval.    [AL-SAFIR] Does the accord not represent an endeavor to  disengage from the Israeli economy?    [Sayigh] This matter is negotiable.    [AL-SAFIR] How can this be accomplished? A World Bank report  talks about a customs union, about the banking sector's role,  and so forth. These are points on which you negotiated with the  World Bank point by point. So what is the true nature of the  ongoing struggle concerning economic issues?    [Sayigh] Let us take, for example, the trade relationship:  should it be a free trade zone or a customs union? Israel has  not projected either of these two options because it is  experiencing an internal struggle. Merchants want a customs  union and industrialists want a free trade zone because a zone  of this kind allows each partner to establish the customs  barriers it wishes vis-a-vis the outside world, be they high,  low, or moderate barriers. Israel expects us, as a small and  young country, to purchase our needs at the lowest prices so we  can manufacture, produce, and so forth. Therefore, we need our  tariff to be lower than Israel's.    If this comes true and such a tariff is established, we will  import electronics, for example, and sell them on the Israeli  market because there will be no borders between us and Israel,  according to the free trade zone. Such a situation will harm  Israeli merchants. A customs union means that there will be a  single customs tariff for both sides. This will not suit us.  Israel's production is much greater than ours and Israel does  not import from abroad as we do. Therefore, it is in our  interest not to raise our tariff so the prices of our  commodities will not rise, whereas it is in Israel's interest to  raise its tariff so as to support its products. A union will  require us to raise our prices artificially.    [AL-SAFIR] So the dilemma is in the need for economic  independence and the impossibility of this independence at the  same time?    [Sayigh] If Israel lifts its hand and allows us freedom of  economic decisionmaking, then we can do what we wish. We can,  for example, build a new road network. The road network has  developed greatly--not the roads that link our villages with  each other but the roads that link the settlements with each  other, and the settlements are located in the territories  occupied in 1948. The same applies to electricity. Like Beirut,  the occupied territories suffer from rationing and power  outages. This also goes for water. The Jewish settler gets  sixfold the amount of water a Palestinian citizen gets from our  waters.    If we controlled our economic decisionmaking, we would  control all these issues. Now, we are destined to use Israeli  electricity for one year or more. Private Palestinian  electricity companies cannot meet all the demand. Jerusalem has  an independent electricity company, but this company is unable  to meet the demands of all Arab citizens. The same goes for  Ramallah.    [AL-SAFIR] But the accord stipulates a united electric power  network?    [Sayigh] The accord states that if the Palestinians wish to  establish their own electric power company, they may do so.    [AL-SAFIR] In such a case, will priority be given to the  infrastructure or to something else in the first phase, which is  scheduled to begin either after the 13th of next January or of  next April?    [Sayigh] This will be determined in two years, not now. The  World Bank program is a two-year program. It is within the World  Bank's conditions and powers to study the economy of all the  territories occupied in 1967 and to conclude its study with  developmental visions and proposals, provided that the emphasis  is put on the public sector's role and on infrastructure. No  reference has been made to agriculture or industry and only a  distant reference is made to the tourism sector. The program  focuses on the physical infrastructure, i.e. roads, electricity,  and telephones; and on the social infrastructure, meaning  education, health, and training.    [AL-SAFIR] And housing?    [Sayigh] The World Bank refused to include the population in  its program. Insofar as the West Bank and Gaza Strip refugee  camps are concerned, we basically refuse to discuss their future  on the basis of keeping them where they are, considering that  their future is governed by resolution 194 of 1948--a resolution  that stipulates the right to repatriation.    [AL-SAFIR] So will this issue be ignored?    [Sayigh] No. We have estimated that there are nearly 20,000  housing units (out of a total of 185,000 units) that are in very  poor condition. We will start replacing these units. There are  185,000 units in each of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including  enough units to accommodate the 1967 refugees, whom we think  will return. Israel has now permitted the repatriation of 5,000  refugees annually, which means that an entire century is needed  to repatriate all of the 1967 refugees.    We also have a program to replace the housing units in poor  condition outside the camps. There is terrible overcrowding. One  finds an average of no less than three persons living in a room  with an area of no more than four square meters. So, we need a  total of 185,000 housing units. The World bank has refused to  discuss this issue, expressing the opinion that it requires a  political decision. We rejected this position because everything  requires a political decision ultimately.    When the World Bank issued the first version of their  program  last spring, they asked to meet with me. We met in Amman and  discussed the issue for nine hours. They embraced 70 percent of  my observations concerning the housing issue. They said that  they will discuss the housing issue if the right to repatriation  is permitted. After modifications, we met with them again before  the final decision was made in Washington. All the countries  involved in the multinational negotiations, i.e. 40 countries,  participated with us in that meeting. I headed the Palestinian  delegation. The meetings lasted two days, 20 and 21 September  [1993]. I was able to convince them that the allocations for  infrastructure were very meager. They had allocated a sum of $3  billion for a period of 10 years, whereas our estimates showed  that a sum of $4.3 billion was needed over seven years, i.e.  more than their estimated figure. Finally, they acknowledged  that they had to reconsider the matter, and they raised the sum  to $5 billion.    At the meeting, which will be held on the 16th of this month  (tomorrow) in Paris, the final version of the World Bank  program, which is being modified in light of the observations I  sent to them, will be presented. It is said that they have  allocated $80 million to build housing in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip throughout two years in order to replace the units in poor  condition. But we have found that the minimum cost of a housing  unit with an area of 100 square meters and capable of  accommodating six individuals is estimated at $20,000, excluding  the land (state-owned land) which will be granted by the  government. This cost also excludes water and electricity, which  will have to be supplied from outside. This means that the $80  million will build no more than 4,000 units and that this $80  million is one-fifth the needed sum. They have amended the sum  for housing, but it is still less than what we are asking.    As for electricity, we seek to create the ability to  generate  enough electricity to meet the occupied territories' needs. But  this will take time. To reach this stage, we have two options:  either supply Gaza with electric power from Egypt and the West  Bank with electric power from Jordan, if they have a surplus, or  emulate the "Beirut formula," i.e. purchase big generators to  supply individual quarters until we are able to establish a  central power-generating capacity.  <H5>  Economic Council </H5>   [AL-SAFIR] Where did the discussion that was held at one  time  on forming a Palestinian economic council lead and what are its  guarantees?    [Sayigh] I will tell you about the council's background. I,  Tony Zahlan (a retired A.U.B. professor), and Abu-'Ala'  developed the concept of PEDRA. We emerged with the formula for  an organization which we called the Provisional Economic  Development and Reconstruction Agency, or authority. We said  that this was a temporary formula because the agency should not  remain independent and that when the state completes its  structures, this agency must become a part of the state, either  as a development board similar to the one in Lebanon or as an  agency divided into smaller parts, with the road construction  section attached to the ministry of public works, and so forth.  We proposed this formula, realizing that the resources that we  are scheduled to receive within five years, i.e. $2.4 billion,  would make many drool. An honest man will not steal, but he will  do his family and friends favors, and so forth. This is why we  decided that means have to be established to control the  process; that the board of governors has to operate very openly  and has to submit annual reports to be published; that internal  and external accounts have to be audited by a well-known  international firm; that we have to emphasize capability  primarily; and that salaries have to be adequate so that  employees will not be compelled to accept bribes or to leave us  if they get better offers.    Because immense sums of money are involved, politicians,  especially Executive Committee members, have felt that this  agency would have major powers. To eliminate these fears, we  proposed the creation of a higher council, called the Higher  Economic and Social council, to supervise the board of  governors. We proposed that the council include 40 or 50  politicians and Executive Committee members and be headed by  Abu-'Ammar. We also said that the board of governors should be  formed of no more than nine members who are experts on the  settlement issue, i.e. engineers, economists, and financial and  social experts, provided they are accountable before the higher  council. This council will assume an advisory character and will  meet twice a year.    [AL-SAFIR] Where will you meet: in Gaza or Jericho?    [Sayigh] In whichever place can accommodate us.    [AL-SAFIR] So Gaza is more likely.    [Sayigh] Gaza is crowded to start with. I am apprehensive  about Gaza because it means reliance on the Egyptian civil  administration.    So, we proposed the advisory council formula, provided that  the main powers and the power to follow up on, implement, and  amend programs is in the hands of the board of governors, which  will be accountable before the higher council. This formula was  proposed in mid-September [1993]. I was assigned to head the  Palestinian delegation and to go to Washington and hold  discussions with the World Bank and attend meetings of the  aid-granting countries.    We learned that the aid-granting countries wished to be  familiarized with the form of the council we had proposed  because these countries do not give their money away easily. But  I could not announce any formula before the World Bank or before  the aid-granting countries without a political cover. This is  why Abu-'Ala' conveyed our vision to Abu-'Ammar, who said that  the formula was good and gave it his approval. But Abu-'Ammar  said that he could not give us written approval because he is a  "democratic man who deals through the institutions and has to  present the formula to the Executive Committee." He added that  they had created a Higher Palestinian National Committee--of  whose members only the chairman has been appointed to date--and  that the formula had to be presented to this committee before it  is given written approval.    I told the World Bank that we had not yet obtained written  approval but that there was oral approval. World Bank officials  literally told us that they wished to see such a formula but  they did not demand it explicitly so they would not look like  teachers and we like students.    Our formula was identical to their vision. The aid-granting  countries and the World Bank approved it unanimously.    Moreover, the working team concerned with the region's  affairs at the State Department, headed by Ross Kurtzer and  including others, invited me for a discussion on the development  program and our vision of how to implement it. The U.S. Treasury  Department, represented by Under Secretary Summers, and Mrs.  Spero, under secretary for economic affairs at the U.S. State  Department, also met with me and supported my program. The 40  aid-granting countries also supported it fully on 27 September.    [AL-SAFIR] Did they support the mechanism?    [Sayigh] They supported the mechanism, the concept, and the  projects.    [AL-SAFIR] You proposed this formula on the basis of an  economic logic. But Washington has its political reasons also.  If the PLO's political authority in Gaza-Jericho is limited; if  its security authority is inadequate; and if the political  authority is stripped away from it; then the PLO will be left  practically naked. Is this not Washington's political goal?    [Sayigh] We did not forget the political aspect. This is why  we proposed creation of the higher council under Abu-'Ammar's  chairmanship.    [AL-SAFIR] The West and the aid-granting countries propose  the formation of an independent commission which would have  political independence.    [Sayigh] Yes, this is what they want. I explained our  proposal to them and told them that it has to be approved by the  Executive Committee and other institutions.    [AL-SAFIR] Where the Gaza-Jericho accord is concerned,  perhaps this point has the greatest degree of overlap between  economics and politics?    [Sayigh] We, too, realize that people have to see economic  benefits in the accord. Otherwise they will rebel against it. I  am not opposed to the presence of economic benefits.    [AL-SAFIR] What is the format needed to preserve the  proposed  formula and the PLO's role simultaneously?    [Sayigh] The board of governors will be accountable to the  Political Committee, which can, for example, dismiss us or  direct us. As an example, the Development Board chairman in  Beirut is subject to the control of a political authority.    However, when I ended my meetings in Washington, I returned  to Tunis. Abu-'Ammar had not yet signed the approval. It was 6  October then. The proposal had been submitted to him on 14  September. The World Bank started calling me and I suggested  that the World Bank deputy chairman concerned with the region's  affairs visit Abu-'Ammar.    A World Bank delegation comprised of a deputy chairman, the  Arab East region official, and Adviser 'Abdallah Abu-Habib  arrived.    We asked Abu-'Ammar to sign a resolution establishing this  agency (PEDRA), but he said he was unable to do so. He said "I  am a democratic man and I have institutions to refer to, such as  the Executive Committee, the Palestine National Authority, and  the Higher Economic Council." Of these, only the Executive  Committee actually exists. 'Arafat asked "When do you want me to  sign? What is the grace period?"    We told him that we had wanted the resolution signed the day  before but that it was still okay and that "we mean what we  say." But Abu-'Ammar responded, "I cannot. I have to check with  others." We then got a promise from him that the resolution  would be signed by 31 October at the latest. But he did not sign  it.    It was then time for me to leave to a conference of the  aid-granting countries on 4 and 5 November. I and Abu-'Ala'  represented Palestine at the conference. The arrangement was  that I would take the signed resolution with me so it would be  announced officially at the conference. On the evening of 2  November there was no news of any signing. On the morning of the  31st [no month or year given], i.e. just prior to my departure  for the airport to leave on my trip, I had contacted Abu-Mazin,  who is a frank man and with whom I am friendly, and asked him  what had happened at the Executive Committee meeting a day  earlier because we had received nothing and I had to take the  text of the resolution with me. Abu-Mazin said, "Nothing was  determined. It was a stormy session and we disagreed and split  into two factions."    I contacted Abu-al-Lutf, who said to me in the style of  Ahmad  al-Shuqayri [PLO chairman before 'Arafat], "What is this  ultimate grace period? Do they want to control us? Do they want  to dictate to us? We will rebel and we will sign after the third  day of the month (November)." I said to him, "Are you kidding?  These people have offered us $2.4 billion and you want to  dictate to them? Are you kidding?" He answered, "No, I am  serious."    Before I left Tunisia, a young man from the Economic  Department told me that Abu-'Ammar had signed the resolution 15  minutes earlier and that he was going to fax it to Abu-'Ala' in  Paris. I asked the man, "What is the text?"    He responded that Abu-'Ammar had installed himself as  chairman, Faruq al-Qaddumi as deputy chairman, and Muhammad  Zuhdi al-Nashashibi as second deputy chairman. Abu-'Ammar also  transferred all the powers designated for the board of governors  to the higher council, which meets twice a year, and formed the  board of governors with the names we had proposed.    I left for Paris, where I met with Abu-'Ala' and told him  the  story. He told me that there was a mistake and that he had just  talked to al-Hakam al-Bal'awi, who said that Abu-'Ammar had  signed the version we had submitted.    The following morning, i.e. 4 November, and just half an  hour  before the meeting, a fax of the distorted resolution was  received. Abu-'Ala' said to me, "You can rebel and say whatever  you wish because you are not an employee. But I am compelled to  announce the resolution. I will not defend it. But I cannot  criticize it."    The Europeans were surprised and started to wonder. One  European said, "This will not pass." They addressed their words  to me at the meeting. I was angry so I referred them to  Abu-'Ala', who said that he was not present [at the meeting that  adopted the resolution] and that he was in Washington before  coming to Paris.    The aid-granting countries, especially the European  Community  and the Norwegians (the accord's godfathers), issued official  statements denouncing this formula.    They decided that the Norwegian foreign minister, who  chaired  the conference, would meet with Abu-'Ammar and inform him that  this formula had been rejected, and this is what actually  happened. The foreign minister returned with a new formula  reflecting what we had proposed--an advisory council and a board  of governors with certain powers, to which they added even more  powers. They also defined the powers of the director general and  of Abu-'Ammar, the national authority chairman. They made the  board of governors accountable to the national authority, not  Abu-'Ammar personally. Faruq al-Qaddumi was made chairman of the  board of governors and al-Nashashibi was made a member, not  deputy chairman. This angered al-Nashashibi, who considered me  responsible for the affair. I received from him a "very  malicious" letter in which he says, "you mislead news agencies  and say that I am not deputy chairman, whereas the truth is the  opposite."    [AL-SAFIR] But no direct decision was made by 'Arafat?    [Sayigh] No. In the meantime, the board of governors held a  meeting which I did not attend. So Abu-'Ammar contacted me to  tell me, "The beloved one knows his place, so he dallies." I  responded, "No beloved and no dallying. You held a meeting and I  suspended my membership for reasons you are aware of because I  have stated these reasons publicly. Besides, I was not invited  to the meeting." He said, "You were away, and this is why you  were not invited. I am inviting you personally now." I answered,  "I want to acquaint you with my position on this issue. I have  two fundamental objections: First, the board of governors has no  powers in the formula you have issued, and second, you have  installed yourself as chairman of the board of governors. I have  nothing against you personally. On the contrary, I appreciate  and respect you as a head of state. But the head of state may  not be the chairman of an authority that is accountable to him.  How could he be accountable to himself? In all your statements  you say that we are accountable to you personally. No, we are  accountable to the national authority. If this authority is  still nonexistent, then we are accountable to the Executive  Committee. Therefore, I feel that if constitutional affairs are  not set right, I will not participate. Of the council created  since the Norwegian amendment, only the chairman exists so far.  There are 60 others whose identities we must know. Moreover, the  national authority must be formed and resolutions must be made  within the framework of the institutions." Abu-'Ammar answered,  "Let us talk about other issues. We must establish a development  bank." I said, "Yes, we must do this. But we must fully create  all the required conditions." He asked, "What are these  conditions and requirements?" I said, "Authorities must come  into existence and we must determine on the basis of what law or  legislation we will create them." Abu-'Ammar answered, "I will  issue a decree right now" and he pulled out a sheet of paper. I  said, "This is not how decrees are issued. Do you have the power  to issue decrees now? We are still in November. Where did you  get the authority to contact the occupied territories? Even if  you have the authority in Gaza and Jericho, you must realize  that either the Israeli or the Jordanian side will govern this  decree. This means that you will issue an illegitimate decree  and devise an illegitimate law." He answered, "This is an  Israeli reading of the issue." I responded, "Nobody says such a  thing to me. My reading is national and patriotic. If this is  your opinion, then there is no need for me to be sitting here."  Abu-'Ammar answered, "I did not mean that. You misunderstood  me." He then proceeded to make justifications.    I proceeded to tell him, "Even if you have all the powers,  the capital of a development bank has to be $500 million. Should  we create it in one session?" He answered, "No, I will give you  two or three days." I said, "We have a study conducted by a  prominent World Bank economist, a retired Palestinian who spent  three months drafting the study. This study was drafted before  announcement of the declaration of principles. Therefore, it  must be modified in light of the new conditions. We want to put  down some of our observations on the study, which will take two  or three weeks. Then we want to send them to the economist and  get the opinion of an international law adviser. This may take  weeks." Abu-'Ammar responded, "You are 'classicists' and you do  not known how to work." I said, "Abu-'Ammar, you are an engineer  and you will understand what I am going to say: if the  foundation is faulty, the whole structure will be faulty." He  answered, "And for something that is faulty, one uses extra  cement and iron."    [AL-SAFIR] Who was present at the session?    [Sayigh] There were eight members. The following day I said  to al-Qaddumi, "I will attend no more meetings until you, not  Abu-'Ammar, head them, provided only those invited by the  council attend these meetings." Yasir 'Abdrabbuh and 'Ali Ishaq,  who are not members, were present. I also said that we had to  establish a constitution that determines how we debate issues  and how we vote.    [AL-SAFIR] What is the story of the Central Bank and the  balances between the occupied territories and the diaspora in  forming its management?    [Sayigh] In the occupied territories there was full support  for our position until two days before my departure from  Tunisia. That is when Abu-'Ammar received a message from the  Norwegian foreign minister. Perhaps during his visit to the  Scandinavian countries he told the Norwegians that if we did not  receive financial resources and if the development process is  obstructed, "my people will suffer, and you will be  responsible." That message appointed Abu-'Ammar to the position  of "report point" [as published], a position I had not heard of  before. They also appointed al-Qaddumi as supervisor and deputy  chairman and al-Nashashibi as deputy chairman, as well. The  distribution of powers remained unchanged. I stressed that I  would boycott the meetings if Abu-'Ammar headed them. I  emphasized this because I had been an Executive Committee member  for more than three years and knew that Abu-'Ammar was  determined to dictate his opinion. I told them that I was going  to spend six weeks in Beirut and asked them to let me know if  conditions changed.    He [Abu-'Ammar] has not dismissed me to date because he  realizes that if the World Bank finds out that I have been  ousted, it would mean that the situation had become complicated,  considering that I am the only one who stands up to Abu-'Ammar.    Abu-'Ammar began to realize that all those around him were  criticizing him and that a lot was being said in this regard.    Yasir 'Abdrabbuh, Abu-Mazin, Sulayman al-Najjab, and three  others--Yasir 'Amr, Samir Ghawshah, and Jamal al-Surani from  Jordan--did not sign the appeal [no earlier mention made of this  appeal]. This means that six out of nine members did not sign it.    [AL-SAFIR] Is it personal love of leadership on the part of  Abu-'Ammar or is there concern?    [Sayigh] Of course, there is a certain concern, in addition  to the love of leadership, considering that Abu-'Ammar loves  leadership. Leadership is an instrument and a means to attain  power. Money is an additional means. Even if he does not seek to  steal, he can channel projects and contracts, and things like  that. What is sad is that Palestinian businessmen have refused  to participate in the council and have told Abu-'Ammar: It is  not right that we will be able to make bids when we are council  members.    [AL-SAFIR] Do the aid-granting countries and the World Bank  object to Abu-'Ammar's role or do they want specialists?    [Sayigh] No, they have concluded the accord with the PLO.    [AL-SAFIR] What is the objection against Abu-'Ammar?    [Sayigh] He may not be chairman of the board of governors.  This means that the problem is an organizational problem, i.e.  one cannot be accountable to oneself. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television At their best Peter Greenaway's films - The Draughtsman's Contract, The Belly Of An Architect - are as good as Bunuel's and better than Jean Luc Godard's. The trouble is that, like his Spanish and French precursors, Greenaway tends towards not only the weird but the studiously obscure. Full of visual interest, cleverly used music, and splendid performances (all depending very much on the director) his work too often makes you want to hold his head under water until he explains what he's getting at. This applies less than usual in his modern-day revenge tragedy The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, which gets its first television showing today (10.30 C4). It stars Michael Gambon as a violent crook who lords it in his own restaurant while his wife (Helen Mirren) has it away in the loo with another customer. BBC2's series, Assignment, investigates the 'Yardies", violent West Indian criminals who operate in the US and London (7.45 BBC2). Desmond Lynam presents a new 'infotainment' series: How Do They Do That? (8.00 BBC1).</p>

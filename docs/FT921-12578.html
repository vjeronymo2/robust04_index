			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / As They Say in Europe: Watch your tongue] THE Germans have been pleading for their language to be given appropriate recognition in the European Community: it is, after all, the mother tongue of a quarter of the Community's population. In London, the Daily Mail newspaper has been waging a campaign to ensure English is the language of Europe. French President Mitterrand has said he will sack any of his officials who does not use the 'world's most glorious language' when addressing international gatherings. All this adds up to a greater need for Britons to understand more other languages. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing though, as I found at the age of 12 in Holland. I asked a friend to tell me the Dutch for 'excuse me' and he told me 'donder op.' I got halfway down an Amsterdam tram before it dawned on me that something was wrong. I was actually saying: 'Get out of my way,' rather rudely. It was silly because the Dutch speak everybody else's language perfectly; if everyone was like them, there would be no trouble. Unfortunately, most Britons are not; and there is a ghastly gamut of pitfalls, misunderstandings and homonyms which, allied to the universal belief that foreigners are stupid or funny or both, can lead to a lot of ill-feeling. The English laugh at other people's English while remaining less aware of how they can generate endless amusement in France. I have lost count of the number of diet-conscious Britons who have asked if there were, say, preservatifs dans le gateau. In other words, are there condoms in the cake? The term 'cul-de-sac' is perfectly good English; but in France for the past 150 years, it has had to be rendered as impasse. Cul-de-sac manages to be lavatorial and genital at one and the same time. And this is the great problem. Even the sight of certain words in another language can lead to jeering, contempt and coarse allusions. No red-blooded Briton can be initiated to the joys of the autobahn without nearly crashing the car on sighting the word Ausfahrt at the first exit. The Germans are defensive about their language. They know that the piling-up of words to make new words, and the minefield of bits of verbs at the end of sentences, is a source of mirth and irritation to other nations. But I recall a magnificent defence of the German language in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung some years ago. Among other things, it pointed out that other languages lacked German precision. For example, that well-known thoroughfare in England, Old Fish Hill Street, was absurd. Nobody could tell whether it was the fish, the hill or the street that was old. In German, there could be no possibility of any misunderstanding. Misunderstandings are the norm between closely-related languages. The Spanish find the Portuguese entertaining. Voce me deixou embaracada means 'You have embarrassed me' in Portuguese but 'You've made me pregnant' in Spanish. The Slavonic languages are where the fun really starts. It is not surprising that Serbs and Croats are at each other's throats when you know that bulja means 'head' in Zagreb but 'arse' in Belgrade. Then there are simple problems, such as the fact that zapominac is the Polish for 'forget.' In Russian, it means 'memorise.' The worst difficulties arise between Polish and Czech, as I found out some years ago when working in that part of the world. I 'phoned a contact in Prague, but the woman who answered spoke no English or German. Czech is not my language so, drawing on my slender reserves of Polish, I said, 'I am seeking Mrs Vesela.' My interlocutor said something like: 'I don't wish to know that,' and slammed down the phone. The trouble was that the Polish word for 'to seek' is szukac In Czech, though, that word is the coarsest way of saying 'to make love.' For sheer linguistic confusion, though, it is hard to beat the great novel All Quiet on the Western Front. In German, that is the lapidary Im Westen Nichst Neues which translates easily into the Polish Nic Nowiny na Zachodziem. But that title on a book in Czech would mean 'There's no paper in the lavatory.' James Morgan is economics correspondent for the BBC World Service.</p>

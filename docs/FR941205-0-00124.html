			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Method 100.2 (asbestos)&blank;Four comments contained several suggestions and criticisms. Method 100.2 has been editorially revised to reflect the comments. These changes, however, do not affect the performance, cost or applicability of the method. One commenter asked EPA to approve SM 2570 for asbestos, which was published in a 1994 supplement to the eighteenth edition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standard Methods <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (APHA, 1994). EPA does not approve SM 2570 for asbestos in today's rule, because this method differs in significant ways from Method 100.2. For example, SM 2570 uses a larger pore filter (0.45 micron) to trap asbestos fibers, while EPA method 100.2 uses a 0.22 micron filter. The commenter did not provide any data comparing asbestos trapping efficiency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these two filters, whereas EPA has data (EPA, 1994e) to show that larger pore-size filters trap fewer asbestos fibers in drinking water samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 552.1&blank;A commenter asked that the sodium hydroxide rinse in Method 552.1 be optional, because the rinse is not compatible with their LSE product. Method 552.1 was developed and validated with ion exchange cartridges to take advantage of the special chemical properties of dalapon and the other acids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the method. To efficiently extract the acids the ion exchange resin must be activated with a sodium hydroxide rinse. Sorbent conditioning and elution steps, which are specified in Method 552.1 or any LSE method, cannot be modified or eliminated to accommodate the support material. Thus, EPA will not allow the sodium hydroxide rinse in Method 552.1 to be optional, because EPA has received no data to support the commenter's request to make the rinse optional.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter asked for a more generic definition of LSE media in Method 552.1 and in other LSE methods. The commenter believes EPA is unnecessarily narrowing the choice of LSE disks and cartridges. EPA does not believe LSE methods are overly restrictive in allowing use of alternative LSE disks or cartridges. However, EPA believes that additional guidance to help users correctly choose alternative LSE media without compromising the reliability of the analysis would be useful. The guidance is summarized below and will be published in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). The guidance is applicable to all LSE methods and supersedes the phrase ``or equivalent'' that is used in some methods to describe selection of alternative LSE cartridges or disks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liquid-solid extraction is performed using various sorbents that are either packed into a cartridge or enmeshed in a disk of inert support material. EPA methods describe the cartridge or disk that was used to develop the LSE procedure, and to produce the data which is published in the method. If a product is mentioned in the methods, it is for information purposes only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes various LSE cartridges and disks may be used, provided they meet all quality control requirements of the method, and provided they contain a sorbent that uses the same physicochemical principles as the cartridge or disk that is described in the approved LSE method. To demonstrate that alternative LSE cartridges and disks meet all quality control criteria, the analyst must be aware of the chemistry of the method. For example, in evaluating Method 552.1 the recovery of the free acid (not a chemical derivative) from the water sample must be tested with the alternative LSE cartridge or disk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In judging LSE disk media, both the sorbent and the support must be evaluated. In the case of sorbents, similarities in polarity are not sufficient. For example, a C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -Silica sorbent may not perform the same as a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer sorbent. Thus, these sorbents would not be considered to be equivalent. In judging supports, any physical support used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold the sorbent is acceptable provided the support is inert and compatible with the solutions or solvents required in the conditioning and elution steps of the method. However, any sorbent conditioning or elution steps, which are specified in the method must not be modified or eliminated to accommodate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In this period, the ideological revolution has been carried  on vigorously in the countryside to bring a phenomenal change in  the mental traits of the agricultural working people.    They have made strenuous efforts to implement the rural  theses under the socialist collective economic system, helping  and leading each other forward under the slogan "One for All and  All for One!"    In this course, more than 20 units including the  Mangyongdae,  Chongsan and Yongnim cooperative farms, the Pyongyang fruit farm  and the Chaeryong farm machine station and many agricultural  workers were awarded "Order of Kim Il-song." And more than 400  people have become labour heroes and many others have been  decorated by the state. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  published "Position and Role of the County in Socialist  Construction" in March 1964, "On Stepping Up the Work of the  Union of Agricultural Working People" in December 1985 and many  other immortal classical works and gave on-the-spot guidance to  agricultural domain, through which he has wisely led the  agricultural working people to carry out the tasks set by the  great leader President Kim Il-song in the rural theses.    The remoulding of man has been successfully promoted in the  countryside over the last three decades, with the result that  the peasants have fully discharged their duty as the masters of  rural construction with noble ideological and mental traits  befitting socialist agricultural working people.    They do farming with a strong sense of responsibility as the  ones in charge of the nation's granary under the slogan "I tend  the farm's fields as my own!"    Last year, too, cooperative farms in Sokchon, Mundok, Unjon,  Yonan, Paechon and other areas of the country reaped bumper  harvests.    Agricultural working people are fully displaying beautiful  traits of devoting their all to the society, the collective and  comrades.    In recent years, Pang Yong-pok of the Taechon-up cooperative  farm, Taechon County, North Pyongan Province, Kim Chae-nak of  the Naenam cooperative farm, Sunchon City, South Pyongan  Province, Yi Chin-su of the Chonnae-up cooperative farm, Chonnae  County, Kangwon Province, and many other peasants performed  feats in protecting people's lives and property.    Agricultural working people are also bringing into full play  such beautiful communist traits as bringing up orphans as their  own children, marrying disabled soldiers and donating surplus  rice to the country.    Comrade Kim Chong-il highly appreciated their beautiful  communist traits and sent his thanks and gifts to them.    With the reliable agricultural working people dynamically  advancing along the road indicated by the socialist rural theses  under the wise guidance of the illustrious leader, the socialist  rural stronghold of Korea is being further consolidated.</p>

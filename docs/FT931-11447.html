			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber talks break up without price deal FURTHER SIGNS of dissension have appeared within the International Natural Rubber Organisation, with the world's main producers and consumers failing to agree whether to cut the Inro reference price. The reference price, now at 207.2 Malaysian cents a kilogram, is the base on which calculations are made to determine whether the Inro buffer stock manager buys or sells rubber. A meeting here has broken up in deadlock with neither producers or consumers prepared to compromise on a new reference price. One participant at yesterday's talks - which were originally due to have concluded last Friday  -said that any decision had been indefinitely postponed. Under Inro rules the reference price has to be cut by 5 per cent if the average Inro daily market indicator price over the last six months period is below the organisation's 'may buy' level - at present 176 cents. Though natural rubber prices have flagged for much of the last few months, a recent sharp rally in prices has caused the six month average to jump to only 5 cents under the 'may buy' level. Producers, led by Malaysia, want the figure to be rounded off to 176 cents to avoid triggering a price cut. Consumers, led by the European Community, insist that the Inro rules should be followed. This is the latest in a series of increasingly bitter rows between the two sides within Inro. The most vexatious issue at present is whether or not to have a new international rubber agreement. The present agreement expires at the end of this year and producing countries have warned that unless progress towards negotiation of a new pact can be achieved by March, Inra could collapse. Producers would then bring in their own pricing mechanisms. Meanwhile, the rubber market been given new life in recent weeks by fears of supply shortages and a strengthening of demand from consumers. An early wintering season - the period of low latex production - has been reported from several producing areas in south-east Asia, a region that accounts for nearly 80 per cent of global natural rubber production. Market prices for RSS 1 and SMR 20, two of the most commonly bought rubber grades, are now at 25 and 16 month highs respectively.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, June 21 (AFP) -- New Zealand will find  it difficult to monitor what happens to people who speak to a  group of its MPs when they visit the disputed Indonesian  province of East Timor, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Tuesday.    Bolger's answer in parliament came in response to a question  on the upcoming visit by MP Phil Goff.    "Will it be a condition of that visit that the delegation be  free to speak with whomever they wish, and given Amnesty  International's warnings on past experience about victimisation  of those who speak to such delegations, will it be a condition  that those spoken to will not be subject to subsequent forms of  reprisal?" Goff said.    Bolger, who visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta  earlier this year after a majority of New Zealand MPs signed a  petition protesting alleged human rights abuses by Indonesia in  the former Portuguese colony, said he believed Suharto would  welcome the visit by four or five MPs.    But, he added, "Its going to be very difficult for us to in  anyway to control or monitor that."    Bolger said he had suggested the MPs also visit other  Indonesian provinces during their August 18-September 13 trip,  including West Timor, for comparison purposes.    During Bolger's visit to Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign  Minister  Ali Alatas claimed New Zealand parliamentarians had only a  shallow understanding of the situation in East Timor, annexed by  Indonesia in 1975 in a move still not recognised by the United  Nations.</p>

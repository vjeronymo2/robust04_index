			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Heron faces threat from 'significant' danger of default The threat of receivership is again hanging over Heron International, the property and trading group run by Mr Gerald Ronson, only six months after it completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing. Heron yesterday warned bondholders that it was 'currently exposed to a number of significant uncertainties' and there was 'a significant potential for cross defaults' on its debt. It also warned that interest due to bondholders might be delayed further. Some creditors doubted last summer whether Heron's business plan was achievable because it relied on a recovery in the European property market. Although there has since been an upturn in the UK, Heron said yesterday a collapse in the Spanish property market had raised the risk of its defaulting. The group said a review of all its properties was being undertaken, and initially showed that Heron would not now be able to repay its senior debt by its due date of March 1997. This debt would have to be renegotiated. Spanish difficulties also contributed to a net loss of Pounds 63.4m in the six months to September 30, by when the group's negative net worth had worsened to Pounds 157.8m from an adjusted figure of Pounds 109m six months earlier. Heron's interim results, prepared on the assumption that it was able to continue trading, included a provision of Pounds 13.3m for a further fall in property values and a Pounds 30.5m foreign exchange loss. The group has called meetings of its bondholders to seek approval of a deferral of interest, due on March 31, to June 30 on top of delays in debt repayments and fees. In total, Heron is seeking to defer payments of Pounds 52.1m. But Heron said recent events possibly meant a further deferral of interest beyond June 30. It expects to receive Pounds 75m from disposals by the end of June  - Pounds 31m from the sale of Heron Homes and Pounds 44m from the sale of the Heron Suzuki motor distributor to Suzuki Motor Corporation. Under Heron's complex banking arrangements, it cannot use this cash to meet head office obligations. Mr Ronson, formerly also Heron's chairman and owner, had led an investor group which planned to buy Heron Suzuki. Heron said yesterday Mr Ronson had no financial interest in the transaction. He would remain non-executive chairman of Heron Suzuki but receive no salary.</p>

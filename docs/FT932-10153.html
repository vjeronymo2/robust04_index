			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Danes given tax incentive to vote Yes THE Danish government is putting the finishing touches to a tax reform proposal which it will put forward later this month if the voters approve the Maastricht treaty and Denmark's opt-outs deal in next Tuesday's referendum. The income tax reform is expected to provide for substantial reductions in marginal income tax rates, especially for middle-income groups. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, who heads a four-party majority coalition government, is telling the voters that if there is a Yes in next week's plebiscite, the second referendum on closer European union, the government will devote its energies to bringing down unemployment, currently running at 12 per cent. The government's appeal to economic interest appears to have struck a chord with the voters. A poll in the business newspaper, Boersen, yesterday found that 40 per cent of those planning to vote Yes next week said they would do so because it would improve economic conditions. As Tuesday's vote approaches, the substantial majority for the pro-Maastricht side earlier in the year has begun to slip. A weekend poll gave a breakdown among those who have decided how to vote of 57.5 per cent in favour to 42.5 per cent against, while a few weeks ago the breakdown was 65-45 in favour. The anti-Maastricht movements have taken heart from comments by Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner for industry, to the effect that the Maastricht treaty could be used to forge a federal Europe. Ms Drude Dahlerup, a prominent figure in the left-wing-dominated anti-Maastricht June Movement, said she was convinced Mr Bangemann's statement in the Wall Street Journal would boost the No vote. 'It will help people to see that the politicians are out to cheat them,' she said. Denmark's four opt-outs - on defence, the common currency, supra-national legal and police co-operation, and union citizenship - were specifically designed to meet the electorate's fears that the country would lose its independence and identity by implementing the Maastricht treaty.</p>

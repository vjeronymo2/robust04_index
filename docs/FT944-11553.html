			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pru appoints finance director Mr Jonathan Bloomer, a senior partner at Arthur Andersen, the accountant, is to become group finance director at Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, from the start of next year. Mr Bloomer, aged 40, will be the second youngest member of Prudential's board, and comes with 20 years' experience at Arthur Andersen, where he is managing partner of the European insurance practice. He will be only the second person to hold the post of group finance director at the Pru: his sole predecessor was Mr Michael Lawrence, who left to head the Stock Exchange in February this year. Prudential's executive directors are paid in the range Pounds 295,000 to Pounds 435,000. Acknowledging that his post had been vacant for almost a year, Mr Bloomer said his task would be to bring a further layer of financial analysis to Prudential's strategic decisions in areas such as east Asia and within the US marketplace. He said also that the prospect of being at Prudential at a time when the UK life assurance industry was going through such a period of change was 'too exciting an opportunity to pass up'.</p>

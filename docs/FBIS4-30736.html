			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by unidentified correspondent in Budapest --  live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] In view of the easy way you were  able to take the 40-degree centigrade heat at the news briefing,  it is rather gratuituous for me to ask whether you, Mr.  Chairman, are well?    [Horn] Thank you. I am as normal as any average man. In a  few weeks this trophy [reference to the metal support-frame he  wears around his neck and head as a result of a recent car  crash] will be off my head early next week. In other words, the  traces of the break are slowly disappearing.    [Correspondent] If I understood your words correctly,  discussion about coalition negotiations, let alone ministerial  posts, is meaningful only after the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] congress, after joint coordinations. Nothing until then?    [Horn] [passage omitted] We convened the congress for 4  June.  We will decide then. [passage omitted] I think that it is most  obvious that it is the party that came second in the elections,  the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], can be considered as a  possible coalition partner. [passage omitted] I hope they take  seriously the responsibility the election presented them.  [passage omitted]. This country needs a viable parliament and  government.    An MSZP-SZDSZ government alliance may mean it will not be  too  difficult to agree on the most important tasks and that the two  parties' agreement with each other may open a path toward a  wider alliance. Under this, which I think would be very good, a  relationship should be shaped in the future or in the new  government between the six parliamentary parties different from  the current one. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Certainly your party has become the  strongest  party of the would-be coalition at this election. How do you  wish to use this power?    [Horn] The most important thing is to put right the affairs  of the country. [passage omitted] We have said the  transformation can be executed in a different way from the  present manner. In other words, we said it was possible to  conduct a policy in which people are put in the focus. It is  unacceptable for us that the transformation should be carried  out in such a way that the great majority of people should lose  out as a result. A burden-sharing in proportion to income must  be created. [passage omitted]    People's lives must be made more secure, and I do not mean  by  this public safety only, but also job availability, education,  and the assurance of all other aspects of existence. What we  also need, shall we say, is a policy with a human face, which  means also that we must solicit the views of a broad range of  people in all essential questions. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Among the 2 million people  who voted for the MSZP, many have recently lost their social  status; that is, the middle stratum that makes a country strong  and capable of progress. Can the MSZP offer something to them?    [Horn] I recently read an analysis of the kind of people who  have voted for the MSZP. The widest support has come from those  living on wages and salaries, the workers and peasants in the  villages. There are also very many entrepreneurs. [passage  omitted] Third, there is the middle stratum you mention, which  is sliding down on the social scale: teachers, public employees,  artists, and others. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you see a realistic chance for carrying  out all the changes you envisage?    [Horn] If there was not a chance we would not start this  task. This is why I started the news conference by quoting Franz  Vrantizky, who called me to congratulate me and tell me the  difficult part was just beginning. He is entirely right. For  although it is a great pleasure to know the Socialist Party  enjoys such huge support, it is also a great responsibility.  [passage omitted] I think the greatest strength of the  Socialist Party lies in its expertise. Thus people can have  faith that the Socialist Party will start dealing with matters  professionally.    [Correspondent] Have you got some sort of emergency aid  package?    [Horn] We have got a package that has already been disclosed  regarding social and employment policy, economic and social  agreements. It is a short term action program to be completed  within the year, in 1994.    [Correspondent] So rapid changes can be expected?    [Horn] Yes, yes. There are a lot of silly things in this  country. Several laws and decrees were adopted, structures and  practices evolved, and we protested against them to no avail.  Being in an opposition role, of course, there was not much  impact of our protest. [passage omitted] So many things can be  changed without applying investments worth billions of forints,  by way of which the life of people can be improved. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] You said at the news conference that Hungary  was in need of foreign help more than ever. What did you mean  by this?    [Horn] It is quite understandable the activity of foreign  capital came to a halt for the time being. This is quite  natural, and this is not some sort of no-confidence in the  outgoing government, but a kind of waiting. Well, there is an  enormous need for foreign capital, but at the same time,  internal laws also have to be adopted that will stipulate  definite conditions regarding the activity of foreign capital;  that is, it should not mean only the buying of markets, as it  happened in many cases.    The other thing is that this country will need new money.  Very serious amounts of money will be needed so that genuine  investment activity can take place and to generate economic  growth, even if of a modest rate.    Last but not least, this country is struggling with a huge  debt. There is sufficient reserve in 1994 to fulfill this debt  repayment obligation. But what will happen in 1995 and the  ensuing years? Will all our money go on repayment of the  interests and the instalments? For then we really will not have  any internal reserves or internal resources for development. So  all this has to be thought through. [passage omitted]    Thus a lot of things could be mobilized to put this country  back on its feet. Our conviction is that without foreign help  getting back on our feet cannot be done.    [Correspondent] The press wrote a lot about the fact that  the  MSZP did not quite manage to get rid of its image associating it  with the former HSWP [Hungarian Socialist Workers Party]. How  does the party relate to these old members?    [Horn] Look, I would very much like if in 1994, as a result  of the elections, we would close this dwelling in the past. Not  because we have nothing to say about the past, but because we  want to deal with the future. [passage omitted] People judged  that the policy of change cannot go on as it has done in the  past four years; they want change. They considered that the  Socialist Party can manage and lead this policy of transition  better than the present government. It is possible they will  put their faith into another party in 1998. [passage omitted]    We will work hard so that they should not be disappointed.  Anyway, the nature of a left wing party worldwide is to work in  the interest of the majority. So it is possible to deal with  the past, but nobody's life will improve one iota in this tiny  homeland. [passage omitted]</p>

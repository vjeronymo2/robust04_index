			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment stated that no currently existing lamps accurately and fully reproduce the UVA spectrum of sunlight. Pure UVA I lamps, e.g., the UVASUN series, are used primarily for photochemotherapy where only longer wave UVA (above 340 nm) is wanted. Xenon arc lamps modified with a WG345 filter are deficient in UVA energy below 335 nm and do not accurately reflect the energies or damage risk of natural sunlight UVA. According to the comment, such lamps remove too much of the energy at the short end of the spectrum and result in overestimating the UVA effectiveness of sunscreens. Xenon arc lamps filtered with 1- or 2-mm WG335 filters contain UVB wavelengths below 320 nm and thus can greatly affect test results. Thicker WG335 filters cut off too much lower UVA energy to accurately represent UVA risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment submitted a method that assesses the attenuation of the incident solar radiation on human skin by a sunscreen (Ref. 27). This method utilizes the principles of diffuse reflectance and fluorescence excitation spectroscopy. The method directly measures the optical properties of the skin decoupled from its biological responses. Both procedures are based on the same principle, any modification of the surface of the skin will produce changes in its absorption properties. Application of a sunscreen modifies the surface of the skin by providing an additional barrier through which solar radiation must penetrate before reaching the skin. Measurement of the absorption properties of the skin before and after sunscreen application yields the transmission spectrum of the product and permits calculation of it solar protection value for the wavelength range investigated. The comment stated that, because this method allows repetitive testing, evaluations of substantivity and water resistance are possible. The comment contended that, because the testing is done on human skin, questions of binding, distribution, and photodegradation can be answered. In addition, the comment maintained that this testing procedure, like the Diffey and Robson method (Ref. 12), does not suffer from a lack of dose reciprocity, as observed with UVA-induced acute skin reactions. The comment concluded that this procedure allows for the correct estimation of the attenuating power of a sunscreen; thus, the protection potential of products in sunlight will be correctly estimated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency would like to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various recommended testing procedures and the following specific questions regarding these test methods at the meeting:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Which of the in vitro test methods described above would be adequate to evaluate the UVA protection provided by a sunscreen drug product? Why would the others not be appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Are the results of in vitro UVA testing methods relevant to the UVA protection provided to consumers by a sunscreen drug product during normal use?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Does the APP test method demonstrate whether a sunscreen drug product provides meaningful protection against harmful UVA radiation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Do the data show that the APP test does not overestimate the actual amount of UVA radiation blocked by most sunscreen drug products? Identify the data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Describe the specifications for an appropriate light source for the IPD testing method, e.g., spectral distribution, intensity, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

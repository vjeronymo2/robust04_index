			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Boston reels at papal posting THE city of Boston was thoroughly gobsmacked on Tuesday night when Mr Raymond Flynn, its mayor for the past 10 years, announced he was to be the next US ambassador to the Vatican. There had been no hint in the days before St Patrick's Day that the popular Mr Flynn - Boston-Irish, liberal, Catholic and an opponent of abortion - would be so honoured or was thinking of leaving in the middle of his third term. Most local speculation had centred naturally enough on who was to become the next ambassador to Dublin, a nomination long expected to mark the visit to the White House yesterday of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister. President Bill Clinton confirmed most rumours by announcing he had chosen Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy. Another woman with impeccable political credentials, though no formal career in politics, is also widely expected to get the plum embassy in Paris. This is Mrs Pamela Harriman, English-born widow of the US statesman Averell Harriman, former wife of Mr Randolph Churchill, and mother of Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative member of parliament. Mrs Harriman is a great Washington and international socialite, long a prominent Democratic party fundraiser and an early supporter of Mr Clinton. She speaks French and is widely reckoned to possess a political acumen to match her considerable charm. The Paris embassy, like London's, is normally reserved for political patronage and Mrs Harriman was rumoured at one stage to be in line to be ambassador in the country of her birth. She always denied this, expressing a preference to stay in Washington. It is also now widely believed that Mr Raymond Seitz, the first professional ever to be US ambassador to the Court of St James, has been asked to stay on in his present post for at least another year.</p>

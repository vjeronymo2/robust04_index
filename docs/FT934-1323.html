			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Conflict looms on councils revamp Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, is expected to provoke further conflict with the Department of the Environment when final proposals for restructuring councils in Avon, Gloucestershire and Somerset are announced today. Sir John is expected to reverse a provisional plan to split Gloucestershire into unitary authorities, in favour of keeping the status quo of two-tier district and county councils. Since his first proposals were announced, however, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has issued new guidance for the commission which makes clear that the government does not expect the status quo to be maintained.</p>

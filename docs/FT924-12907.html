			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / (CORRECTED) Finance and the Family: Face the truth about your portfolio - Computing Correction (published 20th October 1992) appended to this article. MISTRUSTFUL of professional advisers, still more so of my own judgment, as an investor I hold an uneasy course between churning our portfolio to death and letting it wither away from neglect. I have recently found that a heavyweight portfolio management computer program can be a powerful aid to decision-making, although no substitute for it. By 'heavyweight' I mean a program designed for financial professionals: one that can handle many portfolios, drawing information (such as prices and dividend rates) about individual companies from a common pool; that can deal with a large number of individual shares and store as much data as I might need about each; that can receive data automatically via telephone lines. Reports, on the computer screen or printed, can display any selection or combination of data. Dividend lists, with tax credits, can be produced for a tax return; so can a statement of indexed capital gains and losses, actual or unrealised. There will be a wide variety of graphs, simple and sophisticated. A cash account can be kept with each portfolio. I tried two widely-advertised programs in this category. Both satisfied the job description. Synergy's ShareMaster Professional is austere, apparently meant exclusively for professionals. JSL Software's Fairshares Plus is friendlier: it is also much the cheaper. What does such a program have to offer someone like me (roughly, the Little Old Lady market)? To begin with, I was surprised at how educational using Fairshares was: to provide the information the program wanted, I had to dig in annual reports, and pay attention to interim results announced in the newspapers. That was valuable in itself, and in return Fairshares taught me more in the way it organised my information and reported it back to me. Facts too easily glossed over are clearly there to be faced. A strength of Fairshares is its kindly way of using what it already knows to interpret and amplify what you are telling it, even as you work. When you update share prices, the screen immediately shows the percentage rise or fall in each price or index over one week, two weeks, and eight weeks: and the intervals can be changed, if you prefer. Even better: as you enter purchases and sales of a share, the screen shows the average price you have paid for all the shares in your holding and the current value of the holding. It also shows the indexed cost of the holding. It is all too easy for a practised self-deceiver like myself to evaluate the performance of a long-held share through rose-tinted spectacles. Some of our old stagers have acquitted themselves nobly. In other cases, the indexed cost was an eye-opener. The transaction list was also revealing. We tend to take up rights issues unless we know the company actually has the bailiffs at the door, and we often accept shares in lieu of dividends. It is easy to overlook how much we are putting in to the portfolio in these ways: Fairshares presents an itemised account of how much we have put in (or taken out) since a chosen date, with a note of the percentage by which the portfolio has changed in value over the same period, apart from the additions and subtractions. Interesting. Fairshares offers a comprehensive scheme of graphs: of single shares and of relative strength, of volume traded and of the 'Coppock Index', to mention a few. There are also bar charts showing the relative weights of the stock market sectors represented in the portfolio, or of the geographical areas involved. Capital gains or losses since purchase, and percentage price changes from any date to any other, can also be shown in order. Fairshares offers a variety of ready-made reports for printing, with the option of tailoring others to your own requirements. Furthermore, the computer's 'print screen' key remains functional in this program, so that any display can be printed without fuss. Indeed, I could not think of any question to ask about our portfolio which Fairshares could not answer. To keep indexation right, you must add each new figure for the Retail Price Index as it as announced. You must also type in changes in tax rates and bands, so that tax credits will be calculated correctly. More fundamental changes in the rules for calculating capital gains tax would require an update of the program. Mistakes are easy to correct, and it is easy to start off with a minimum of information and fill in more as you go along. The manual is good, and well-indexed. My only grumble about Fairshares is that it allows only one classification of shares. The program assumes you will want to classify shares according to the sectors of a Financial Times listing, although you can replace those sectors with anything else you like. I would have preferred to keep the FT sectors and have another means of tagging shares, so that I could lump the privatisation shares together, for instance, or consider the performance of recent acquisitions as a group. Worth the money? For serious traders, certainly. Not a bad idea, either, for Little Old Ladies who want to know what's going on. Fairshares Plus costs Pounds 150, inc VAT, from JSL Software, Hallmark House, 97 East St, Epsom, Surrey, KT17 1EA; 0372-742526. They offer a demonstration disk for Pounds 5, deductable from later purchases. Automatic price updating requires further hardware and software, which JSL supplies. ShareMaster Professional costs Pounds 595 plus VAT from Synergy Software, Britannic House, 20 Dunstable Rd, Luton, LU1 1ED; 0582-424282. CORRECTION SATURDAY'S Minding Your Own Business page gave an out-of-date number and address for JSL Software, the supplier of Fairshares Plus. The correct address is 5 West Street, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 7RL. The telephone number is 0372 741969.</p>

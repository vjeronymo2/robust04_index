			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / GDP tonic fails to fortify franc THE French franc yesterday came under renewed pressure on the foreign exchange markets despite the announcement of unexpectedly robust figures for third quarter gross domestic product which helped revive the Paris stock market. The Bank of France was forced to intervene to support the franc during the day, according to dealers' reports. The bank, together with Germany's Bundesbank, has staunchly defended the French currency throughout this autumn's currency crisis. But yesterday it failed to prevent the franc breaching the benchmark level of FFr3.4 against the D-Mark. The news that GDP had grown 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, when most economists had been expecting zero growth, did not stave off further falls. The franc ended the day at FFr3.402 against the D-Mark compared with FFr3.394 on Monday. The assault on the franc reflects the underlying tensions within the European Monetary System and the unstable political climate in France, where the unpopular Socialist government is under pressure from the farming lobby to reject last week's agricultural trade agreement between the US and the European Community. The third quarter growth in GDP, which compares with a negligible rise of 0.1 per cent in the preceding three months, was fuelled by a 0.9 per cent increase in household expenditure and a 0.7 per cent rise in exports. However it disguised a 0.8 per cent fall in business investment, the eighth successive quarterly decline. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the increase in household expenditure was set to continue next year. Many economists fear that the present relatively high level of the franc could impede France's export performance. Goldman Sachs anticipates a slowdown in exports with France returning to GDP growth of 0.1 per cent in the final quarter of this year. Despite these gloomy predictions the GDP figures helped to bolster the Paris stock market after Monday's fall. The CAC 40 Index recovered almost all the ground lost on Monday by closing 2.7 per cent higher at 1,720,61.</p>

In his opinion, during a visit to coal regions of the  country  at the end of last year Gaydar managed to realise the situation  in the coal industry after which documents were signed to ease  critical tension in miners' collectives. A mechanism of  interaction between the government and miners was found and  Gaydar took a great deal of responsibility in the realisation of  this mechanism, Kislyuk said.    "The resignation of the first vice-premier makes miners  doubt  that their interests will be understood by the government," he  said.</p>

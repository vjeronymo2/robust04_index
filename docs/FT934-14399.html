			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: So much forest, so few people, that's Guyana - Michael J. Woods explores a country of tropical mystery and spectacular scenery TWO PAIRS of bright red rear lamps glowed from the depths of the dense reed bed bordering Guyana's Kamuni river. They were visible only when I shone the torch at eye level from beside my head; then, they glinted back without blinking. We paddled the boat closer, drifting almost silently on the mirror of black water. But even as the nosing bows rustled among the stems, the cayman continued to lie motionless, its yellow-green body submerged and its bulging eyes protruding from the surface, their redness reflected perfectly in the water as four vermilion orbs. We must have counted half-a-dozen of these reptiles in a cruise of less than a mile, the largest over 4 1/2 ft long and probably as big as they grow in these parts. But, even at that size, these fish-eaters pose no threat to humans; and when we returned to the steps of the landing stage, the camp staff were plunging about in the river, enjoying a midnight swim. At Timberhead, Tropical Adventures' jungle retreat, Amerindian-style houses lie on the boundary between some of Guyana's all-enveloping rain forest and what is known locally as the savannah, an area of dense, marshy grassland and scrub which grew up after a disastrous fire burnt down the trees on either side of the river some decades ago. The roofs of Timberhead's stilt houses are thatched with fronds from the troolie palm, and there is no need for windows or doors in an atmosphere which remains constantly warm even when it pours with rain - which it did, with disconcerting regularity, when I was there. Not for nothing is Guyana known as the land of many waters, and a dry T-shirt is a useful accessory. The inviting hammocks which hang across the living area, and bottles of deliciously cold Banks beer, are almost more than even the most hyperactive can resist. But resist I did from time to time so as to swim in the Kamuni river, the translucent black water of which turns the sky red when viewed from beneath the surface; to canoe in the early morning in silent search of the giant otter; and to walk in the rain forest. Without leeches, and with remarkably few biting insects, the jungle is comparatively benign. But, like such forests everywhere, most of the action takes place in the canopy, so we were lucky to spot a troop of bamboo monkeys as they crashed through the tree-tops after spying us from high above. Birds were easier to admire on the bird table adjacent to the dining/kitchen annexe and, here, a whole range of tanagers came to feast on banana. Even a neighbouring tarantula had the grace to stay well away from the houses while it posed obligingly on the light grey background of a palm frond, like a many-fingered black, furry hand. At night. the jungle becomes a place of mystery; and our night walk, in total darkness and linked to one another only by short lengths of dry twig, led us along a black corridor surrounded by strange cries, buzzes, whoops and zips. The Mississippi pontoon boat which had brought us here took us back downstream to the Demerara river, an opaque, mushroom soup of silt stirred up by storms far away in the hills. After half an hour pushing upstream, we landed during another torrential storm and piled into three jeeps for a two-hour slither through the jungle to Shanklands, a riverside resort. Here, a number of white colonial houses stud 10 acres of emerald lawns on a promontory above the Essequibo river, a waterway of enormous proportions and the third-largest in South America; the biggest of the three islands at its mouth is bigger than Barbados. Even at Shanklands, 30 miles from the sea, the river is tidal and almost two miles across. Tramp steamers ply up and down. The grassy expanse on the red granite headland has been reclaimed from the jungle over the past 10 years in a plan executed by Joanne Jardim, whose father left her several hundred acres of forest. She started by sleeping in a hammock under a plastic sheet before moving into an old bus. Now, with elegant houses on the land, she was able to welcome us in style and ushered us to a lunch table at which every setting was embellished with a hibiscus flower. Joanne has left some large trees for shade and, uncluttered by rain forest, it is possible to appreciate their soaring height. There is forest walking here, too; water sports on the river; and visits to the local towns and villages. But, most exciting of all, it is possible to fly from an airstrip some 20 minutes away to Kaieteur falls. Throughout the 90-minute flight, the habitat beneath changes rarely, and then only in small patches. For the most part it is endless, dark green rain forest, relentless in all directions, spotted by the odd clearing for a gold or diamond mine and lined very occasionally by a jungle track, the existence of which is only betrayed by the faintest of traces in the canopy below. It is easy to appreciate the analogy, quoted often to me during my visit, that Guyana is the same size as Britain with a population of less than 1m - and almost all of them living north of Inverness. Below, as we flew, a gorge cut through the mountains, its bed filled with a foaming river. And then there was Kaieteur, a clear fall of 741 ft throwing a great plume of cloud into the air as if the falling water was pouring from the spout of a boiling kettle. The aircraft banked steeply and slipped down into the gorge below the falls before flying up-river and over the very lip of the falls. If it is possible, the walk to see them is even more spectacular. The path lies over over sheets of bed-rock and dark, moss-filled crevasses before, finally, running through a cavernous hollow between enormous boulders to arrive abruptly on a natural rock terrace placed ideally for viewing. From here, a steady stream of Guinness apparently plummets downwards to burst in an endless flume on the rocks far below. On the flight back to Georgetown, I pondered the apparently endless rain forest. Logging is in its infancy here; but the temptations to plunder this valuable resource, in a country where three-quarters of any income disappears to feed its foreign debt, must be almost overwhelming. Both Guyana and its forest need visitors from overseas. Better still, both are worth the visit. Michael Woods travelled to Guyana with British West Indian Airways; his visit was hosted by Forte Hotels and Tropical Adventures. Details of Tropical Adventures' seven-night Guyana Adventure can be obtained from Forte Hotels in the UK. Tel: 0345-404040. The Guyana Adventure costs Dollars 950 plus air fares. A specialist operator to Guyana is Guy-Tours of Edgware, Middlesex, which offers itineraries of six and 13 nights. Prices per adult (until December 4) are Pounds 1,591 for six nights and Pounds 2,197 for 13, including scheduled BWIA flights (departing each Saturday), full board and standard rooms (two people sharing).

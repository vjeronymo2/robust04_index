			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sherwood Computer jumps 23% SHERWOOD COMPUTER Services, the USM-quoted company specialising in insurance software, yesterday reported a 23 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.99m to Pounds 2.45m, last year. Sales, however, dipped 10 per cent to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 24.8m), a consequence of the transfer of the disaster recovery business to a joint venture with ICL, the computer manufacturer, during the year. The share price, which has improved 40 per cent since the beginning of this year, yesterday rose 1p to 195p. The balance sheet was strengthened with net assets increasing from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 5.1m with net cash of Pounds 2.3m. Mr Richard Guy, chief executive, said the company was well placed to make acquisitions to improve its position in its key financial services and government markets. There was, he said, a choice of companies to buy and an acquisition was likely in the near future. The company's fortunes have improved markedly since it moved to products based on open, or industry standard, systems but it is still spending large amounts on research and development - Pounds 2.6m in both 1990 and 1991. Mr Guy said investment would not be as high this year but would remain significant. This year's accounts included an exceptional provision of Pounds 191,000 for potential losses on one of the first installations of Sceptre, the company's Lloyds software. Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 26 per cent from 15.5p to 19.6p. A proposed final dividend of 4.5p gives a total of 6p (5.25p) for the year.</p>

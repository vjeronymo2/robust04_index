Turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 17.47m (Pounds 15.69m). Earnings per share increased to 1.1p (0.9p), while the dividend was again passed. The company said retained profits were being used to reduce the deficit in the profit and loss reserves, 'bringing forward the date on which the directors can consider a resumption of dividend payments.' The company last paid a dividend in 1989. Mr Ray Davies, deputy chairman and chief executive, said he expected house price inflation of about 3 per cent this year.</p>

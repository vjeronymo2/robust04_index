			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Tories down but not out When the House of Commons returns on Monday, it will conduct its debates against a changed political backdrop. The government is on the defensive. The balance of forces on the opposition benches has shifted in favour of a Labour party revitalised by Mr Tony Blair. The Labour leader's speech at his party's conference in Blackpool last week touched the concerns of many ordinary voters. It remains to be seen whether he can sustain the momentum. How to react to the Blair challenge has been the subject of much debate at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth this week. Some have suggested that the party establish 'clear blue water' between itself and Labour - a phrase suggesting the espousal of greater Euroscepticism, rightwing social policies and early cuts in taxation. In a characteristically low-key speech yesterday Mr John Major wisely resisted the temptation to shift to the right. Labour's pilfering of Conservative principles is a form of flattery, the prime minister argued. Labour admits it was previously wrong on almost every important issue. Why should the electorate believe it is right now? Quite reasonably, Mr Major noted that 'the language of politics is now Conservative language'. The Tories were the real thing, the opposition an unconvincing imitation. 'We are the party of savings, of ownership, of property, of personal independence,' he said, before outlining a programme of consolidation, of resting on laurels perceived by the cabinet but not by the populace. Some of these achievements are genuine. The government was knocked off its perch on Black Wednesday, but it deserves credit for subsequently setting out to establish a track record of non-inflationary growth. The effort, however, will remain fragile as the next election approaches. And it is, to say the least, doubtful whether it can be maintained for the next quarter century during which the prime minister forecast a doubling of living standards. Fine aspirations He defended other key areas of his administration's record, with varying degrees of credibility. The Tories' fine aspirations for education have not so far been realised; Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new minister, will have to try harder than her predecessors if she is to persuade the teaching profession to embrace the national curriculum, testing and league tables. Mr Major's long-term proposals to offer nursery education for four-year-olds may go some way towards countering Labour's more ambitious schemes. The prime minister put up a passionate defence of his government's stewardship of the health service, but the Conservatives can never win political advantage on the NHS. Whatever Mr Major says, some people will continue to believe that the creation of an internal market is a prelude to privatisation. On law and order, the government's recent record is lamentable, and Mr Michael Howard is not a home secretary to win the confidence of a disquieted electorate. Mr Major came close to Mr Blair's celebrated 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime'. Flattery runs both ways. Clear-cut difference The prime minister did underline the clear-cut difference between the parties on constitutional reform and the future shape of the United Kingdom. The Conservatives would grant self-determination to Ulster alone; Labour offers regional assemblies in Scotland and Wales. It is a distinction that will loom large in the next election if Mr Major has his way. On the evolution of the EU, he stands by his Gaullist strategy, agreed after protracted consultation with his divided ministerial colleagues. The resulting coalition is less Eurosceptical than party activists would like, and could easily come under strain in the run-up to the 1996 inter-governmental conference. But for the moment it holds, despite uneasy rumblings from all sides. What was audibly lacking in the speech was any promise of further free-market initiatives. On Post Office privatisation, for example, a subject still being debated among ministers, Mr Major was eloquently silent. The government may eventually regret shying away from partial privatisation, a plan with sounder economic foundations than Labour's ideas. Yet this was a visibly more confident Mr Major, delivering a competent speech at the end of what might have been a disquieting conference. The Tory leadership has shored up morale among party workers, without resorting to the distasteful xenophobia that marred last year's proceedings. If the government is to recover sufficient ground to stand a chance at the next general election, it must now reach out in similar vein to the electorate at large. It may be that the message of safety first is not enough after what will have been 17 or 18 years in office, and that not even the sustained economic recovery that Mr Major is counting on will dissuade the voters from their desire for a change. On yesterday's showing, however, the Tories must be counted as down, far down - but not yet out.</p>

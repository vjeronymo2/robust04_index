			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRAFT TAKES SOME PLAYERS BY SURPRISE  </P> <P> Kennedy High outfielder Garret Anderson was nothing short of amazed when  informed that the Angels had drafted him in the fourth round of baseball's  amateur draft Monday.  </P> <P> He had heard whispers that professional scouts weren't exactly impressed by his  work ethic.  </P> <P> "I didn't think the scouts liked me," said Anderson, who batted .393, hit eight  homers and drove in 36 runs. "Everybody said I don't play hard. I think  everybody has a certain style of baseball."  </P> <P> Kennedy Coach Manny Alvarado, for whom Anderson has played the past two years,  said that some scouts' perception that Anderson is undermotivated is just plain  wrong.  </P> <P> "I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people otherwise," Alvarado said.  "He's a sweetheart of a kid."  </P> <P> If Anderson was surprised at how high he was selected, then Birmingham's Dan  Larson must have been in shock.  </P> <P> Larson, an outfielder who said he thought he might be selected as high as the  sixth or seventh round, was plucked in the third round by Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Unlike Anderson and other area players who already have signed to play next  season at NCAA Division I schools, Larson faces an unsettled situation that  could cost him during contract talks. Larson can't use a Division I ride as  leverage.  </P> <P> Larson, however, said he is considering playing at Cal State Northridge. But  Northridge's interest, like that of the Phillies, is a rather new development.  </P> <P> Joey Rosselli's situation is more complicated than most. Like many area  players, the pitcher from Alemany has committed to play baseball at a Division  I school.  </P> <P> But Rosselli has more to consider than merely whether he prefers to play at  Arizona State or with the San Francisco Giants, who selected him in the second  round. Rosselli is also considered a candidate for quarterback on the Sun Devil  football team.  </P> <P> Baseball, however, is winning at the moment.  </P> <P> "It's definitely a better career opportunity," said Rosselli, a 6-foot-1  left-hander who was Alemany's starting quarterback the past three seasons. "As  far as college football goes, I'm not the biggest quarterback around.  </P> <P> "And I'll probably have twice as many years in baseball if I make it to the  pros. The love of the game is there more for baseball than football." STEVE  ELLING  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Catalani's 'Loreley' - Opera in Genoa If Italian opera has an abused step-child it is poor Alfredo Catalani (1854-1893), whose name figures in every book on the genre while his works remain practically unperformed and unknown, except for one pathetic aria for soprano from his last work La Wally, 'Ebben me n'and lontana', familiar to film-goers as the much-repeated theme-song of the Beneix movie Diva. Catalani, however, has always had his persistent admirers (Toscanini, chief among them, named his children after characters in his friend's operas); but in recent years their number has been dwindling, and even La Wally, which came closest to popularity, has vanished from the Italian opera houses where, in the past, it was occasionally revived. So, last year, when the theatres of Verona and Genoa announced a new production of Catalani's Loreley considerable curiosity was aroused, and now, as the work is being heard at the latter city's splendid Teatro Carlo Felice, the Catalani caucus has come out in force. The conductor - 84-year-old Gianandrea Gavazzeni - long a specialist in this period, was at the helm of the performances; and with undiminished vigour, the maestro who led so many unforgettable Callas performances at La Scala infused his vitality and conviction into the Genoa orchestra and made a good case for the work itself. Originally the opera was called Elda, and it was Catalani's first full-length work for the theatre. Given in Turin in 1880, it had a mixed reception. Some years later - after other theatrical ventures - Catalani revised it extensively and it was given again (under its present title) in Turin in 1890. Once more, it was received with more esteem than enthusiasm. Catalani was a composer of skill and ideas, but - in a world still dominated by Verdi, and with the star of Puccini about to rise - he was an outsider, attached to the polemical Wagnerismo of the time. He was also dogged by ill-health and ill-luck (and the damaging hostility of the powerful publisher Giulio Ricordi). But, worst of all, he simply could not write good tunes. As the critics said at the time, Loreley is full of ideas (some of them recalling Lohengrin), but they are all short-winded. Instead of developing, he usually just repeats. Singers, too, misunderstand his music, singing it as if Catalani belonged to his contemporary 'verismo' school, which he did not. In the Genoa Loreley, for example, both the soprano Marilyn Zschau, in the title role, and the tenor Nicola Martinucci, as her enslaved lover, bawled their way through the first act with ear-splitting vehemence. The baritone, Alessandro Cassis, who has a generally pleasant voice, was simply inexpressive. The first act is the weakest; in the second, where the other soprano - the girl who loses the man - appears, Denia Gavazzeni Mazzola sang persuasively, displaying a real sense of style. Both the second and third acts have long instrumental interludes, which the conductor interpreted powerfully. The sets and costumes, by the usually sensitive Pasquale Grossi, were coarsely coloured and badly lighted. This German legend requires a generous amount of stage magic; here it had none, and Alberto Fassini's lacklustre staging was no help (the wood-choppers in the opening scene might has well have been stirring soup). So this revival of Loreley - while of unquestioned interest to historians of Italian opera - seemed to inspire in the 1993 public much the same emotions that its first version aroused in the Torinesi of 1880: respect, polite interest, and - to be honest - a certain amount of boredom.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 25 Feb (EFE) -- The leaders of the Movement  of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), former Bolivian President Jaime  Paz Zamora's party, after two days of meetings behind closed  doors asked Congress to investigate its possible link with drug  trafficking.    Confessed drug trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka Meco, in a  statement to authorities of the Special Antinarcotics Force  (FELCN), linked Paz Zamora and his closest aids with the most  important Bolivian drug traffickers.    Acting MIR leader Oscar Eid said that a congressional  commission will determine whether or not the party as an  institution was linked to drug trafficking, and added that if  there is evidence involving one or another of the leaders, "we  will promote the appropriate legal proceedings."    Eid also asserted that "there is no reason for the former  chief of state (Paz Zamora) to be subject to any investigation."    So far the Bolivian media have published about half a dozen  photographs of Paz Zamora accompanied by former Army Captain  Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded by the FELCN as one of  the greatest alleged drug traffickers.    Dominguez asserted that Paz Zamora personally "closed a  deal"  during a meeting in 1987 with Chavarria and Jorge Roca Suarez,  aka "Techo de Paja" [Thatched Roof] -- currently in prison in  California, the United States, charged with drug trafficking --  for $500,000 in financial aid for the MIR's electoral campaign.</p>

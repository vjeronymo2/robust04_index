			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Yen lifted by Dollar, D-Mark The yen was the beneficiary of weakness in both the dollar and the D-Mark yesterday as the US trade gap widened and jitters about forthcoming German money supply figures made the Japanese currency more attractive, writes Motoko Rich. Against the dollar, the Japanese currency advanced by about a yen to Y97.75 from Y98.7650. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at Y63.03, from Y63.61. Sterling also had a good day, finishing up against the dollar and the D-Mark. Against the dollar, the pound finished in London at Dollars 1.5764, from Dollars 1.568. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM 2.4446, from 2.4347. The UK currency was helped by overall market sentiment that base rates will continue to rise, a view which was supported by an active short sterling futures market. The December short sterling futures contract fell 14 basis points to settle at 93.03 from 93.17, discounting a short-term interest rate of 6.97, a full percentage point above current rates. The yen surged against the dollar following the release of the US trade deficit figures for July, rising to Y97.55 in the afternoon, near its mid-August levels and only a point off its post-war high of Y96.45. The US trade gap widened by 21.6 per cent in July to Dollars 10.99bn, from a revised Dollars 9.04bn in June. The trade gap with Japan rose 2.7 per cent to Dollars 5.67bn, its highest since March. Expectations before the figures were released were for an even higher deficit with Japan. But against the background of upcoming trade talks between the US and Japan, the markets took the news quite negatively and sold off the dollar. Mr Rob Hayward, economic advisor at Bank of America, said: 'Although it was a disappointing number on the surface, I do not think it changes the US trade position. It is just a bit of statistical noise.' The dollar fought back against the D-Mark towards a floor around DM1.552 after US Commerce undersecretary Everett Ehrlich said that in spite of the deterioration of the July trade deficit between Japan and the US, the trade situation remained 'fundamentally unchanged'. The dollar closed in London against the D-Mark at DM1.5508 from DM1.5528. The D-Mark remained soft on the crosses throughout the day as markets fluttered on concerns that German M3 money supply data, expected this week, would rise above market expectations. The markets are forecasting a small month-on-month rise, bringing down the annual rate of growth to 8.9 per cent from 9.8 per cent in July. But some analysts were talking of double digits, causing traders to unwind long positions in the D-Mark. 'There are rumours that the M3 numbers will be buoyed up,' said Mr Anthony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO. 'If that happened that could prompt the Bundesbank to raise interest rates, which would case increased bearishness in the bond markets, which is affecting the D-Mark now.' In London, the D-Mark closed against the lira at L1006 from L1010, against the Swiss franc at 0.829 from SFr0.830 and against the French franc at FFr3.418 from FFr3.416. The markets responded positively to Mr John Major's speech to British businessmen in Saudi Arabia on Monday, which gave a positive spin on the UK economy, and boosted sterling against the D-Mark and the dollar. But analysts were particularly struck by activity in the short sterling futures market, which they believed impacted the movement of the pound. The September short sterling contract, which expires today, finished at 94.03, from 94.15, discounting interest rates at 5.97 per cent, close to current cash rates. The December short sterling futures contract discounted the three-month interest rate a full percentage point above current rates. Mr Norfield said: 'There does not seem to be any willingness on the part of the market to say this has gone far enough,' he said. 'But I would say the extraordinary degree of tightening that the futures markets are forecasting in the next three months go beyond the bounds of credibility.' The Swedish krona remained fairly steady against the D-Mark, closing in London at SKr4.818 from Skr4.805. Although the Swedish trade deficit was worse than expected at SKr0.4bn against a forecast of a Skr1.6bn surplus, the markets did not take the news too negatively. 'The trade figures have not had much material impact,' said Mr Julian Callow, economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The markets are awaiting judgement on the new government.' An announcement on the government from prime minister designate Mr Ingvar Carlsson is expected today. The Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 243m at established rates after revising its shortage forecast to Pounds 550m. It provided late assistance of Pounds 215m. Overnight rates traded between 4 5/8 and 6 1/4.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporters Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472) and Chen Weiguang </F> (7115 4850 0342): "Shao Yunjie, President of the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of Beijing Municipality, Talks About the Issue  of Positively Carrying Out the Social Security System"]    [Text] Enlivening state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises is a topic of conversation that the economists and  entrepreneurs were most concerned with at the people's  congresses held over the past years. At the place where the  Beijing delegation stayed, Shao Yunjie, president of the  municipal industrial and commercial bank and deputy of the  municipality, set forth with the view of a banker that we should  positively carry out the social security system, lighten the  burden of enterprises, and create conditions for enterprises to  equally join the market competition.    Shao Yunjie said: Just as what Premier Li set forth in his  report, enterprises bear heavy financial burdens in supporting  social undertakings and there are many historical burdens.  Taking Beijing as an example, 1,030,000 staff members and  workers of the industrial enterprises should support 400,000  retired staff members and workers. How can they support such a  large number of retired staff members and workers? So, we  should set up, as soon as possible, a social security system so  that enterprises will not bear this burden any longer.  Enterprises hand over a portion of money to society.  Simultaneously, enterprises have also to deliver to society  portions of money from various kinds of earnings. Besides,  staff members and workers themselves should also pay a portion  of money and the state has to allocate a portion of money. So,  the living expenses of retired staff members and workers will be  provided under the social insurance system. The enterprises  that are hopeless for halting deficits should declare  bankruptcy. We can use the social insurance mechanism to  arrange the staff members and workers of the bankrupt  enterprises or to have the enterprises shift their lines of  operation in a step-by-step manner.    Shao Yunjie said: The higher levels must never define any  speed targets for large- and medium-sized enterprises. Defining  speed targets will bring damages to these enterprises. The  products without benefits and the products that nobody wants  must not be produced any more. Enterprises would rather suspend  production than seek high output value. Using coal,  electricity, water, and raw materials to produce unmarketable  products is big waste. Enterprises should readjust the product  mix according to market demands, grasp product quality, and  produce their own products with competitiveness. Only by so  doing will they be able to stand their ground on the market.  Shao Yunjie said: Enterprises and banks have relations of  loans. This does not mean that only enterprises seek banks'  help. In reality, banks also have to seek enterprises' help.  Only when enterprises have good economic results will banks be  able to live a good life. In a sense, banks and large- and  medium-sized enterprises share the same fate. According to the  State Council's decision on the financial system reform, the  industrial and commercial banks should turn themselves into  commercial banks. Seeking profits is the highest target of  commercial banks. So, the commercial banks have to make  self-management and self-development, run risks by themselves,  and restrict themselves. Some enterprises worry that they will  not be able to use loans under such a situation. In fact they  must not worry about this. Banks still give priorities to  large- and medium-sized enterprises because these enterprises  are the foundation stone of the socialist economy. Meanwhile,  enterprises themselves should have a sense of urgency, enhance  their internal potential, and increase economic results so that  banks will rest assured to give loans.</p>

Baysa] </F>   [Text] The AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Civil  Relations Service (CRS) said yesterday the capture of the  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) leader in the Visayas  and other top local insurgent leaders "may have saved them from  being liquidated by their own comrades."    Citing an intelligence report, the CRS, led by Brig. Gen.  Rene S. Dado, said a rebel strike force was assigned to kill  communist leaders led by Arturo Tabara, CPP chief in the Visayas.    The liquidation plot was reportedly hatched after Tabara and  his men defected to the "Revisionist" faction.    The plot was detected by military intelligence agents in the  region.    On the other hand, the military is looking into a report  that  leaders of the "Stalinist" bloc have sent reinforcements to  their comrades on Negros Island.    "The move was intended to strengthen the remaining Stalinist  elements on Negros Island and prevent the underground movement  from falling completely under the control of the rival bloc,"  the CRS added.</p>

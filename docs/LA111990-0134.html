			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RIVALRY FOR CARL REINER IS ON FILM  </P> <P> Carl Reiner was in an especially jovial mood the other day during one leg of a  daunting, nationwide promotion tour for his new film, "Sibling Rivalry," that  would have tired a man half his age.  </P> <P> But Reiner, tall, trim and as busy as ever at 68, still looks a lot like his  most well-known character, Alan Brady, the arrogant variety show host on the  old "Dick Van Dyke Show."  </P> <P> His good humor was evident despite decidedly mixed reviews about the movie, his  latest film in a career that spans 40 years. Reiner directed "Sibling Rivalry."  </P> <P> The critics have not been not especially kind to the comedy, which stars  Kirstie Alley and involves a man who died during sex with her and the various  cases of mistaken identity that occur as a result.  </P> <P> "The prospect of a new Reiner comedy is a lip-smacking one. Rob Reiner, that  is. Not papa Carl, whose best comedies were made years ago," wrote the New York  Post film critic in panning "Sibling Rivalry."  </P> <P> Carl Reiner does not dispute those sentiments.  </P> <P> "Rob had the toughest time of all my kids," he said. "He wanted to be in show  business, and he had a father who was going on all cylinders. He was in  competition with me, and he was impatient. Then he ended up outrunning Dad."  </P> <P> Reiner lists his son's movies with pride, saying, "He's been up at bat six  times, and you can't find anything really wrong with his work."  </P> <P> Reiner also said that his son "outstripped me as far as acting, too. Whenever  they'd see us on the street, they'd start yelling, 'Hey Meathead!' One time,  somebody called him Meatloaf, and I yelled back, 'No, it's Meathead!' "  </P> <P> According to Carl Reiner, family members have always been competitive with each  other, but they've also remained loyal.  </P> <P> Reiner's brother, Charlie, who owns a printing business in Atlanta, was always  the "funnier one" when they were growing up in the Bronx, the sons of a  watchmaker.  </P> <P> "But Charlie suffered because I was the more quiet, studious one and my mother  would always say, 'Why can't you be more like your brother, Carl?' We still  talk about it."  </P> <P> But it was his brother who urged him to enroll in drama school and become an  actor. And his brother still religiously tapes all Reiner's appearances on TV  and saves all news clippings about him. "Every time I'm on Carson, he still  tapes it," Reiner said.  </P> <P> Reiner's other two children are daughter, Annie, a playwright and artist, and  Lucas, who directed the film "Spirit of '76."  </P> <P> "My other kids have had a problem with it," said Reiner of both his success and  Rob's. "Annie was showing some of her work recently, and the first people who  greeted her at the door said, 'Aren't you Carl Reiner's daughter?' She's trying  to have her own identity. You want to make it on your own."  </P> <P> But Reiner said his family is very close-knit and often gathers for dinners at  the Beverly Hills home he shares with his wife of 47 years, Estelle.  </P> <P> Even if he believes Rob has surpassed him as a director, Carl Reiner is keeping  as busy as ever. He continually sifts through new scripts in search of a movie  to direct. He was eager to return to Beverly Hills, where he's in the midst of  a novel about Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I'm a worker," he said. "I've worked steadily all my life. I've become  venerable. I've gone through several incarnations, but I've kept current.  There's a whole generation of adults who grew up with me."  </P></p>

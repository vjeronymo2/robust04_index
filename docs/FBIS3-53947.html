			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz, in </F> Beirut, by Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo; date not given; from the  "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Miliji] Welcome to our program, minister.    [Buwayz] Thank you.    [Al-Miliji] Minister, a summit was recently held between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Ilyas al-Hirawi. Would you tell us  what went on in this summit?    [Buwayz] The summit was part of the continued coordination  between the Lebanese and Syrian leaders. The summit followed on  the heels of the [al-Asad-Clinton] summit in Geneva and,  therefore, focused on the outcome of that summit and on a  possible new approach to dealing with the situation.    We have discussed a number of issues brought up at the  Clinton- al-Asad summit. We have also discussed the future of  the negotiations that may take place in Washington early next  month.    [Al-Miliji] During their summit did Presidents al-Asad and  Clinton discuss south Lebanon?    [Buwayz] Of course, it seems that the issue of Israeli  withdrawal from the Lebanese south was discussed in that  meeting, for it is an integral part of the Arab-Israeli  negotiations process.    There is no doubt that finding the best mechanism for  achieving an Israeli withdrawal was among the topics discussed  by Clinton and al-Asad. It seems that the Americans understand  the need for an Israeli withdrawal as part of the peace process.    [Al-Miliji] Would this understanding lead to concrete  measures?    [Buwayz] Of course, this understanding needs a certain  mechanism to go with it. So far, Israel has not declared its  intention to withdraw. Once it does so, we believe that the  mechanism for implementing this withdrawal will be ready for  discussion. The proposal to form a joint military committee  without a statement of the goal of this committee, that is  without a commitment to the principle of withdrawal, does not  seem very logical to Lebanon. We want to know beforehand what  the goal of the committee is. If the goal is to monitor the  situation or contain the current security crisis, there is the  Armistice Committee and we do not need to set up a new  committee. If the goal is to disengage the forces, there is a  multinational force in south Lebanon and, therefore, we do not  need a new committee.    The only good reason for having such a committee is to  discuss a timetable for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.    [Al-Miliji] The Lebanese received an invitation to  participate in the coming round of Arab-Israeli talks. Has  Lebanon received certain guarantees? Are there certain  principles that will serve as the basis for the talks?    [Buwayz] There are no guarantees in the strict sense of the  word. The Lebanese head of the negotiating team will go to  Washington along with a number of the delegation members to hold  talks with the U.S. side on the mechanism issue, or on the  approach that will be adopted in this round of talks. Some  general matters or tendencies have already been formed.    [Al-Miliji] What are these general matters or tendencies?    [Buwayz] For example, there is a real desire to hold serious  talks to achieve peace.    [Al-Miliji] A desire on whose part?    [Buwayz] I think on the part of all sides.    [Al-Miliji] Including Israel?    [Buwayz] Well, this will be a test for the Israeli position  and approach.    [Al-Miliji] This leads us to another question. What are the  most important points of disagreement between the Lebanese and  Israelis, in light of the past 12 rounds of talks?    [Buwayz] The main issue is withdrawal. So far, Israel has  not given us a clear statement on its commitment to a withdrawal  to the internationally recognized borders. What we keep hearing  is rhetoric that Israel has no ambitions [on Lebanese soil].  Such rhetoric, however, falls short of a clear commitment to  withdrawal. We want this commitment to be spelled out with a  clear decision that would open the door to an agreement on the  details.    [Al-Miliji] How about the issue of water?    [Buwayz] Concerning the issue of water, there is no room for  negotiations. Lebanese water is non-negotiable.    [Al-Miliji] Concerning the South Lebanese Army, have the  Lebanese and Israeli sides discussed any arrangements concerning  the future of this army?    [Buwayz] No, we have not arrived at that point yet. I think  that it is too early to look into this matter. Until a  commitment is reached concerning the principle of withdrawal, it  would be premature to discuss such details.    [Al-Miliji] President Clinton has met President al-Asad and  will meet King Husayn. What effect will these negotiations have  on the Lebanese track of the peace talks?    [Buwayz] We believe, and I have said this before, that peace  should be comprehensive. Any progress on any track, if it  furthers understanding, is a positive matter.    [Al-Miliji] My last question is: Are there any specific  ideas that Lebanon is presenting ahead of the coming round of  talks?    [Buwayz] Lebanon calls for the return of its land. Lebanon  is not obliged to present more ideas. Lebanon, I reiterate,  awaits a clear commitment concerning the principle of  withdrawal. Once such a commitment is made, everything can be  resolved.    [Al-Miliji] Thank you, minister.    [Buwayz] You are welcome.</p>

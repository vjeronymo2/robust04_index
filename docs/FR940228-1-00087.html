			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if it has not had operating losses over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both of its two latest fiscal years that cause an operating loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding 10 percent of the institution's previous year's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tangible net worth for its latest fiscal year. While it may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unusual for an institution to record a loss in any fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, this loss is not harmful so long as the loss is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessive, is not indicative of a deteriorating trend in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's financial condition, and the institution otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the factors substantiating its financial strength. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to define an operating loss, for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these provisions, as total net income minus extraordinary gains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or losses, income or losses from discontinued operations, prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period adjustments, and the cumulative effect of changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting principle, estimate, or reporting entity. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible net worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally accepted accounting principles. The Secretary believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this standard will measure whether a profit-seeking entity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating from current cash flow to the extent possible. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate residual effect of these activities on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization's individual net assets is represented, along with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any interfund transfers that may have taken place during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if it had, for its latest fiscal year, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive tangible net worth. The Secretary proposes that, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of this section, a positive tangible net worth occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying this proposed standard, the Secretary could consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and infrequent events, and could take into consideration the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more accurate representation of the institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position in accordance with generally accepted accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles. For the past fourteen years, the Department has had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a standard for net worth that states that an institution is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if it has a deficit net worth (i.e., the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's liabilities exceed its assets.), a measure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term solvency. Therefore, an institution with a net worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of zero meets this current requirement. The proposed change from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalizing a deficit net worth to requiring a positive net worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is only a technical change in form that should affect few, if any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By excluding all assets classified as intangible, all assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as goodwill, organization costs, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covenants-not-to-compete, which have little market value in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of an institution's overall solvency will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated in the calculation of net worth. In purchasing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business, the new owner pays an amount and allocates the market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value to individual tangible assets in order to prepare financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements. After applying the proper market value to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various assets, any residual amount that appears on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's balance sheet as goodwill, organization costs, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covenant-not-to-compete, is classified as an intangible asset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the Secretary's intent to identify those institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that do not have sufficient capital assets. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses that operate on month-to-month leases with minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital actually invested in the business are a potential risk to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, and ultimately to the taxpayers in terms of possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collapse and bailout. In these cases loans to students are often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically discharged in accordance with provisions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA. Preventing institutions that have no real assets from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in the programs should enhance the gatekeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

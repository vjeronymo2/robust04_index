			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Air waves EUROPE IS flying through fog in its search for a system of airline regulation which yields greater competitive pressures and a better deal for consumers. The latest leg of this troubled journey ended in the small hours of yesterday morning, when EC transport ministers agreed a new regulation governing the allocation of airport take-off and landing slots. It says that in future airlines which do not use their slots will lose them and that when slots do become available, preference will be given to airlines which lack a significant presence at the airport system in question. It also gives governments the power to take the task of co-ordinating slot allocation away from the big airlines, although it may be doubted whether many of them will use it. This is presented by Mr John MacGregor, the UK Transport Secretary, as a breakthrough: 'a regulation which protects the legitimate rights of established carriers, while allowing new carriers onto routes and stimulating competition.' Some newer carriers do not agree. They think that once again EC transport ministers have done what their big flag carriers want, namely to keep the competition at bay. According to these smaller airlines, 'use it or lose it' is a rule the big carriers will be happy to live by. It is, after all, not difficult for a big airline to maintain an adequate presence even on a loss-making route if it knows that the alternative is withdrawal leading to a price war and the emergence of serious competition. The smaller carriers also ask: does the regulation mean that airlines which do use their slots thereby in effect acquire the right to go on using them in perpetuity, which would amount to a property right? And they wonder to what extent national regulatory bodies, such as Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, will be further hindered in their ability to coerce bigger carriers into releasing slots to smaller carriers by the appearance of an apparently more liberal new regime. These are good questions, to which ministers should provide answers before formally approving the regulation agreed in outline yesterday. All of this is perplexing for European air passengers, who are confronted daily with overpriced services. Those who think that even under the new rules, the airport slot allocation system will still be dominated by the big airlines for their own benefit will continue the quest for a more liberal alternative based upon some kind of rolling franchise system. Probably the best that can be said for yesterday's agreement is that it gives the European Commission power to intervene in the airlines' slot allocation committees, if the policy of easing the way for smaller airlines appears not to be working. The regulation also contains a clear review clause. These are powers the commission will need to use with skill and determination.</p>

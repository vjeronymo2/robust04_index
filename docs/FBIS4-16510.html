			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko held a news  conference in Almaty today. Attending were his first deputy  Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Economy Minister Mars Urkumbayev, Finance  Minister Yerkeshbay Derbisov, and National Bank Chairman Daulet  Sembayev.    He stressed that rumors about the lack of a constructive  governmental program of action were groundless and there was no  necessity to adopt a new program. It was said that the program  exists, is viable, and is working already. The president has  endorsed the anticrisis measures program for 1993-95. At the  parliament session the government will report about the progress  of implementation of this program. The Cabinet of Ministers is  working in conformity with the adopted plan. Its work is  described in the statement on the economic policy for 1994 which  was published.    Besides, in conformity with the president's instruction, a  group led by the first deputy prime minister was set up which is  examining the alternative programs of economic development and  reform in Kazakhstan, submitted by the opposition parties.  Members of the government, answering questions, touched upon a  number of topical problems in the implementation of these  reforms. In particular, the measures to enhance the national  currency were discussed, as well as state loans and credits,  foreign financial aid for entrepreneurship, and the introduction  of the new taxation system. Also discussed were enforceable  enactments adopted of late on abolishing natural [as heard]  allowances for some categories of the population, increase of  minimum wages and pensions, and further state policy regarding  the public welfare of citizens with low income.</p>

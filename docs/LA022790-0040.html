			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ICE-T'S MESSAGE BOILS DOWN TO VIOLENCE IN BRUTAL WORLD  </P> <P> For such a controversial guy, Ice-T certainly puts on a pedestrian show.  Performing Sunday evening in the Cal State Fullerton gym, the L.A.-based rapper  wouldn't have let down any Parents Music Resource Center monitors in the  audience: His 13 numbers were chock full of expletives and images of violence  and crude sex.  </P> <P> Missing from Ice-T's show, however, were most of his more politically based  material and, more crucially, a sense of spontaneity and engagement in his  show.  </P> <P> Given that those wanting labels on recordings haven't targeted, say, country  music (and is there any image in music more chilling than Johnny Cash singing  "I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die" to an audience of approving  convicts?), it may be that they're more upset by the way Ice-T and some other  rappers place their violent street world in a moral perspective, as on Ice-T's  "This One's for Me": "My homie got a year for an ounce of weed, While Bush  sells weapons to the enemy."  </P> <P> But except for the taped opening of "Shut Up, Be Happy" -- an ominous vision of  a brave new world where "the comfort you demanded is now mandatory" -- Ice-T  and his five-man Rhyme Syndicate Posse stuck to his well-crafted, if thoroughly  predictable, missives on his superiority with a microphone and his evocations  of gang violence.  </P> <P> While such numbers as "Drama" and the movie theme "Colors" created a palpable  sonic and verbal portrait of that brutal world, along with moralizing on the  futility of such a life, they were undercut in concert by the formulaic  pre-programmed manner of the show.JIM WASHBURN  </P></p>

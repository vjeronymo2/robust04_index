			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Nortel sees US spending giving lift to earnings NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is banking on higher capital spending by US regional telephone companies and continuing strong demand from the Far East and Latin America to reverse a 29 per cent slide in first-quarter earnings. First-quarter earnings dipped to USDollars 75.9m, or 30 cents a common share, from Dollars 104.2m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Revenues edged up to Dollars 1.94bn from Dollars 1.90bn. Northern warned last month that its performance would be dented by sagging sales of high-margin software. The company has also lifted outlays on research and development, and spent heavily on a venture with Matra, the French electronics group. Mr Jean Monty, who took over as chief executive earlier this year from Dr Paul Stern, declined to forecast 1993 earnings, beyond saying he expected the second half to be stronger than the first. He said growth in earnings needed to be balanced against other, longer-term measures of performance, such as the need to maintain market share, customer service and the launch of new products. The US disappointed in the first quarter. Capital spending by regional phone companies, Northern's biggest US customers, has stagnated. But Mr Monty said growth in the number of lines connected to their networks pointed to higher outlays later in the year. Performance was also hurt by the weakness of sterling, which affected dollar-denominated revenues from Europe. Mr Monty said his priorities since taking over had included cost containment and efforts to improve the effectiveness of Northern's R&amp;D effort. He said Northern expected to announce a new wireless venture in the UK within the next few days, although he declined to provide further details.</p>

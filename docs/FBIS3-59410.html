			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Civic Alliance as Seen From the </F> Inside and the Outside"]    [Text] We addressed the following questions to some  outstanding personalities who are active in the Civic Alliance  [AC] and to others who broke away from this group or have not  belonged to it and, as a result, have a more detached view:    1. Do you think that the AC is addressing itself to all of  Romanian society?    2. How would you evaluate the effectiveness of the AC?    3. Could it be more effective? What has prevented this?    4. What do you think the AC will be like five years from  now?  And what will civil society in Romania be like?    Gabriel Andreescu, chairman of the Civic Alliance,  responded:    1. The Civic Alliance is addressing itself to the entire  Romanian society, but this does not mean that the entire  Romanian society is receptive to the AC. However, the principal  values that it would like to impart--human rights and freedoms,  the principles of the state of law, the "humanistic" rationality  of social and political life--are, certainly, general problems.    2. The ensuring of a convincing selection system in regard  to  the candidates for president in September 1992 was a concrete  success. But, certainly, there are indirect results. We must not  forget that the AC provides humanitarian assistance, through its  medical-social center, as well as juridical and other assistence.    3. The AC could be better than it is. The failure of the  cooperation between the AC and the AC [as published -- probably  the PAC (Civic Alliance Party)] seems to me the most important  obstacle.    4. The optimistic response is: The civil society is an  independent reality in a Romanian society in which institutional  mechanisms, which are certainly imperfect, develop,  nevertheless, in the direction of democracy. The pessimistic  variant is: Heroic groups of the civil society are operating in  a society dominated by a Latin American type of oligarchy,  accepting sacrifices to the point of the physical elimination of  members so that the mechanism and human dignity will resist in  this new form of historic bankruptcy.    According to the two variants, the AC will either be the  shield of a variety of civic institutions (for example, "the  Institute for the Study of Totalitarianism") or it will signify  the street revolutions of December 1989, and June 1990, 1991,  1992, 1993....    Ana Blandiana, member of the Steering Committee of the Civic  Alliance    1. Yes. It definitely addresses itself to the entire  society.  The impression that it might address itself to only side comes  from the fact that its obvious impact is in that part of society  which accepts the rules of the democratic game. Through its  activity, the Alliance is trying to make this part of society  larger.    2. The nomination of a candidate for president or the  creation of a party regardless of how relations have developed  with this party --or activity within the framework of the  Democratic Convention, of which I was one of the founders. The  true success is, I believe, the existence throughout the country  of branches which live and breathe even under these conditions,  in which difficulties of all types affect not only the people  themselves but also their ability to associate and join together  in organizations. These branches, with everything around them,  are nuclei, seeds of a civil society, which are essential for  democracy.    3. Yes, indeed. The way in which it began three years ago  showed more promise. But then came the difficulty of organizing  a group of people under conditions in which we did not have any  headquarters -- as of now we have only three rooms, which we  have subleased in Bucharest -- or basic material resources. The  fuel on which we operated was and is nothing but moral drive.    4. If I were optimistic, I would have to imagine that, in  five years, there will be the solemn moment of the dissolution  of the Civic Alliance because the civil society no longer has  any need of it. The Alliance has as its principal tasks the  teaching of the alphabet of democracy, the transformation of the  mentality of a population that, for years, has voted for its  masters, into that of a sentient electorate which must vote for  its servants, whom it can recall if they do not fulfill their  contract with the civil society.    Alina Inayeh, coordinating chairman of the Pro-Democracy  Association    1. I do not believe that it addresses the entire society.    2. It does not seem to me that the activity of the AC has  been effective since it has not addressed all the segments of  society.    3. If it had known how to use the immense political capital  which it had and the confidence placed in it when it appeared on  the scene, then the message of the AC would have been able to  penetrate into the entire society.    4. The role of the AC in five years depends greatly on the  AC  itself and if it is able to recover the confidence lost.  Otherwise, there is a danger that its importance will be  diminished even more. As for civil society, in general, it will  continue the process of crystallization without achieving a  perfect society.    Bogdan Hossu, chairman of the "Alfa" cartel, deputy chairman  of the World Confederation of Labor    1. We hope that this is the role of the Alliance and that it  includes all segments of the civil society.    2-3. I could not say right now. The only thing which comes  to  mind is a good meeting that they had. I know of several  roundtable sessions which they had with representatives of the  executive branch, the governing party, and the opposition. You  should know that civil society has taken a big step forward  through this initiative.    4. I hope that civil society will be much more deserving and  more aware of its strength.    The leaders of the Students' League hesitated to make a  statement about the AC, on the grounds that they have belonged  to the League for only one year, during which time they did not  have any cooperation with the AC. In addition, the AC lost  points for being caustic and radical.    Dan Martian from the Party of Social Democracy of Romania  politely, but firmly, refused to give any statements on the  occasion of the anniversary of the Civic Alliance but provided  us, instead, with pertinent definitions of the concept of civil  society.</p>

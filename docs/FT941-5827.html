			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Block votes and Brussels British support for EU enlargement often appears self-serving in the eyes of Britain's present partners, who suspect that Britain's real objective is to dilute the Union, making it more like a free trade area and less like a federation. Yet Britain has good arguments on its side: the EU will be strengthened by the entry of new Nordic and Alpine members, and it has strong reasons of both morality and self-interest for not turning its back on the newly free countries of central Europe. It is perverse, therefore, of the British government to risk torpedoing the agreement on admission of Efta countries by insisting that the 'blocking minority' in the EU council under the qualified majority voting system (QMV), should remain unchanged even in a larger Union. The larger the number of member states, the more difficult it will be to achieve consensus, and the greater the danger of paralysis. To insist that the same number of states should be able to block a decision means that a larger number will have to be lined up in favour before a decision can pass. By taking this line, the UK courts the accusation that paralysis has been its true objective in backing enlargement. British ministers claim they need to keep the blocking minority at 23 votes, which can be mustered by two large states and one small voting together, in order to preserve the open and competitive character of the Union against 'the protectionist majority'. Only Germany and the Netherlands, it seems, can be relied on to vote with Britain on many such issues. This seems just the kind of negative and defeatist approach which has so often isolated the UK from its European partners - including Germany and the Netherlands, both of which, as it happens, support raising the threshold to 27 votes in order to keep it constant as a proportion (30 per cent). One reason why Britain has supported the entry of its former Efta partners is that they generally share Britain's commitment to free trade. Enlargement, therefore, so far from inciting Britain to cling to a veto, should strengthen its confidence that it can win important arguments in the council on their merits. Nor should this issue be confused with the question of subsidiarity. There are strong grounds for wishing to limit the competences of an enlarged Union, leaving more issues to be resolved at national level or below; but where it does have competence, it must have the capacity to decide and to act. The UK should not feel comfortable to find itself allied on this issue with Spain, which hopes to use the blocking minority to defend a pattern of EU spending that is neither in British interests nor in those of the new members. Spain has other demands that are more reasonable, such as an increase in its own voting weight to equal that of the other big countries, and a right for Spanish fishermen to fish in Norwegian waters when Norway joins. It is on these points, rather than the blocking minority, that Mr Felipe Gonzalez should be placated.</p>

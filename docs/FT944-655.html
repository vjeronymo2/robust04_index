			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: European cyclicals German steel, chemical and engineering companies' shares have given the German stock market a fillip this week, raising a broader question about the investment attractions of so-called cyclical stocks. These are manufacturing companies with earnings strongly geared to the ups and downs of economic cycles. Their share price performance tends to run in advance of developments in the real economy, but not to the extent seen in the current cycle. With some obvious exceptions, such as British Steel, the best performing share in the FT-SE 100 index this year, shares in European manufacturing companies have underperformed consumer goods companies in 1994. Since July, the underperformance amounts to more than 10 per cent, paralleling in a subdued way what has happened on Wall Street, where consumer stocks have outpaced manufacturers by more than 20 per cent since March. That this should be happening at the point where cyclical companies are generating large increases in earnings is not in itself anomalous: expectations of such increases powered outperformance in the shares long before the companies moved out of losses. But arguably cyclical companies' earnings power is stronger than expected this time round, and the path to the peak of cyclical profits longer than predicted. This reflects improvements in the productivity of European manufacturing industry following widespread rationalisation. For next year alone, European manufacturing companies' earnings are set to grow approximately three times faster than consumer goods companies - by nearly 50 per cent compared with 18 per cent. Hoechst's announcement this week that it will be raising prices for some of its fibres by 5 to 10 per cent early next year points to encouraging price resilience. Consumer goods companies have defensive qualities but cyclical stocks are due for a second round of outperformance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview on the eve of the birth of the new  democratic South Africa, the right honorable prime minister, Dr.  Ntsu Mokhehle, spoke about the importance of cementing bonds of  good neighborliness and cooperation between Lesotho and South  Africa as independent sovereign states. The prime minister said  the issue of integration or incorporation of Lesotho into the  new South Africa was therefore not necessary. On the issue of  the boundary between Lesotho and the Orange Free State, Dr.  Mokhehle said this was a national issue which must be followed  up. He said it is a matter to be resolved by the people through  a democratic parliament.</p>

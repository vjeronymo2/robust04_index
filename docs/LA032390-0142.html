			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TWO O.C. CONGRESSMEN WIN GENEROUS PRAISE FROM TAXPAYER GROUP  </P> <P> Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) were  among seven California congressmen singled out for praise by the National  Taxpayers Union on Thursday for casting votes against increased federal  spending.  </P> <P> Nine members of California's congressional delegation were classified as "big  spenders" and seven as "taxpayers' friends" in the group's 17th-annual rating,  based on recorded votes to reduce or increase government spending on national  defense and social programs.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer ranked second among all House members on the NTU's list of low  spenders, with a 72% favorable rating. Rohrabacher, whose district includes  part of Orange County, had a 60% rating.  </P> <P> California lawmakers on the NTU's spenders list were led by Reps. Glenn M.  Anderson (D-Harbor City) and Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), both with 26%  favorable ratings. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) also made the roster with a  32% rating.  </P> <P> "The big spenders in Congress are so out of touch with the majority of  Americans who oppose higher taxes and spending that they are taking a 'let them  eat cake' attitude toward American taxpayers," said NTU Chairman James Davidson  at a Capitol press conference.  </P> <P> Cranston, however, disputed the group's characterization of his voting record.  </P> <P> "I do not have time now to analyze each of the 18 votes that the National  Taxpayers Union objects to," Cranston said in a statement. "But I did take time  to check the three votes they considered the worst and gave a negative 'vote  weight' of 10. All three dealt with catastrophic insurance care reform, and in  each case, I voted to retain many of the Medicare catastrophic benefits while  repealing or reducing the premium surtax."  </P> <P> The National Taxpayers Union "thinks those were three of my worst votes,"  Cranston said. "I think they were three of my best, and I'm proud of them."  </P></p>

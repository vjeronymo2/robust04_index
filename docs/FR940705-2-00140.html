			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix G&hyph;I. Standard Practices and Training <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first principle of containment is strict adherence to good microbiological practices (see Appendices G&hyph;III&hyph;A through G&hyph;III&hyph;J). Consequently, all personnel directly or indirectly involved in experiments using recombinant DNA shall receive adequate instruction (see Sections IV&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;e and IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d). At a minimum, these instructions include training in aseptic techniques and in the biology of the organisms used in the experiments so that the potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any research group working with agents that are known or potential biohazards shall have an emergency plan that describes the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or the environment. The Principal Investigator shall ensure that everyone in the laboratory is familiar with both the potential hazards of the work and the emergency plan (see Sections IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d and IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;e). If a research group is working with a known pathogen for which there is an effective vaccine, the vaccine should be made available to all workers. Serological monitoring, when clearly appropriate, will be provided (see Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Laboratory Safety Monograph (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;O) and Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;B) describe practices, equipment, and facilities in detail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Addition of Appendix P, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Plants, to the NIH Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following new appendix, Appendix P, reads as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P specifies physical and biological containment conditions and practices suitable to the greenhouse conduct of experiments involving recombinant DNA-containing plants, plant-associated microorganisms, and small animals. All provisions of the NIH Guidelines apply to plant research activities with the following modifications: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P shall supersede Appendix G when the research plants are of a size, number, or have growth requirements that preclude the use of containment conditions described in Appendix G. The plants covered in Appendix P include but are not limited to mosses, liverworts, macroscopic algae, and vascular plants including terrestrial crops, forest, and ornamental species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant-associated microorganisms include viroids, virusoids, viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, certain small algae, and microorganisms that have a benign or beneficial association with plants, such as certain  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhizobium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species and microorganisms known to cause plant diseases. The appendix applies to microorganisms which are being modified with the objective of fostering an association with plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant-associated small animals include those arthropods that: (i) Are in obligate association with plants, (ii) are plant pests, (iii) are plant pollinators, or (iv) transmit plant disease agents, as well as other small animals such as nematodes for which tests of biological properties necessitate the use of plants. Microorganisms associated with such small animals (e.g., pathogens or symbionts) are included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one individual with expertise in plant, plant pathogen, or plant pest containment principles when experiments utilizing Appendix P require prior approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;I. General Plant Biosafety Levels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;A. The principal purpose of plant containment is to avoid the unintentional transmission of a recombinant DNA-containing plant genome, including nuclear or organelle hereditary material or release of recombinant DNA-derived organisms associated with plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;B. The containment principles are based on the recognition that the organisms that are used pose no health threat to humans or higher animals (unless deliberately modified for that purpose), and that the containment conditions minimize the possibility of an unanticipated deleterious effect on organisms and ecosystems outside of the experimental facility, e.g., the inadvertent spread of a serious pathogen from a greenhouse to a local agricultural crop or the unintentional introduction and establishment of an organism in a new ecosystem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;C. Four biosafety levels, referred to as Biosafety Level (BL) 1_Plants (P), BL2&hyph;P, BL3&hyph;P, and BL4&hyph;P, are established in Section II. The selection of containment levels required for research involving recombinant DNA molecules in plants or associated with plants is specified in Section III. These biosafety levels are described in Appendix P&hyph;II. This appendix describes greenhouse practices and special greenhouse facilities for physical containment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;D. BL1&hyph;P through BL4&hyph;P are designed to provide differential levels of biosafety for plants in the absence or presence of other experimental organisms that contain recombinant DNA. These biosafety levels, in conjunction with biological containment conditions described in Appendix P&hyph;III, provide flexible approaches to ensure the safe conduct of research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;I&hyph;E. For experiments in which plants are grown at the BL1 through BL4 laboratory settings, containment practices shall be followed as described in Appendix G. These containment practices include the use of plant tissue culture rooms, growth chambers within laboratory facilities, or experiments performed on open benches. Additional biological containment practices should be added by the Greenhouse Director or Institutional Biosafety Committee as necessary (see Appendix P&hyph;III), if botanical reproductive structures are produced that have the potential of being released. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II.

Greenhouse Access (BL1&hyph;P) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Access to the greenhouse shall be limited or restricted, at the discretion of the Greenhouse Director, when experiments are in progress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Prior to entering the greenhouse, personnel shall be required to read and follow instructions on BL1&hyph;P greenhouse practices and procedures. All procedures shall be performed in accordance with accepted greenhouse practices that are appropriate to the experimental organism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Contractors to manage Scottish roads The Scottish Office plans to put the management of Scotland's motorways and main dual carriageways into the hands of private contractors by early 1996, in what it sees as a big step towards a private-sector road management industry. Three groups of roads are likely to be offered under five-year contracts each likely to be worth Pounds 25m to Pounds 35m. The remaining 70 per cent of Scotland's trunk road network is to be divided into five geographical units. A managing agent will be appointed for each unit to co-ordinate the work of local councils for routine and winter maintenance. The managing agent might be a private company or a lead local authority appointed by the councils. The arrangement would be reviewed after three years. Roads would be managed under contracts agreed with the Scottish Office and monitored by an audit unit. The new arrangements have to come into effect by April 1 1996, when the nine regional councils which maintain trunk roads and motorways on behalf of the Scottish Office are abolished and replaced by 28 single-tier councils. The government believes that the new councils will be too small to manage parts of the trunk road network and is taking the opportunity to involve the private sector in road management  - an element in the government's private finance initiative. In England local government reform is less advanced and only four roads have been proposed for contracts that include designing, building and financing them. The new arrangements, set out in a consultation document, do not cover the southern stretches of the M74 motorway. Here the Scottish Office hopes to reach agreement with a consortium which would design, build, finance and operate the remaining stretches of the motorway and manage 100km of road between Carlisle and Abington, Lanarkshire, for 15 to 20 years.

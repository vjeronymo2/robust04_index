			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Major steps up pressure on IRA to end violence The UK government last night stepped up pressure on the IRA to halt its 25-year campaign of violence as it published a detailed commentary on questions from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about last December's Downing Street Declaration. London's carefully worded text, which followed detailed consultations between senior ministers including Mr John Major, the prime minister, answered just one of the 20 questions directly, confirming that a referendum on Northern Ireland's future would be the mechanism used to establish the wishes of the province's people. It said the rest of Sinn Fein's questions 'range much more widely' than seeking elucidation of the text of the joint UK-Irish declaration. London's response was warmly welcomed as 'comprehensive and positive' by Dublin. Sinn Fein welcomed the fact that the government appeared to have taken some trouble over its comments as a sign of its 'serious intent'. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said later that the remaining questions 'to some extent were invitations to negotiate', but London was 'not going to negotiate, that is made very clear'. By answering one of the questions and hence modifying its previous insistence that the declaration did not need clarifying, London appeared to be attempting to encourage republican doves, by giving them grounds for proclaiming the exercise a success. But ministers will hope to have reassured unionists and Conservative backbenchers with its punctilious refusal to be drawn into negotiations. Earlier this week, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to portray the government's decision to respond at all as a victory, saying it was 'gratifying' that people had now accepted clarification was needed. Last night, Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, said he was 'pleased' that each of the questions had been addressed. Sinn Fein would work 'in precise detail' through each of the answers and provide a response in 'relatively quick time'. Sir Patrick said he thought people would have been 'rather critical' if the government had decided to leave the questions unanswered. He added: 'We are facing something of great seriousness.' This was the continuation of political violence when both the British and Irish governments had agreed that the future should be decided by consent. Praising London's response as 'comprehensive and positive', Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said it should 'help to clear the road'. He was supported by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, who said: 'Sinn Fein should be able to welcome it . . . We feel very strongly that this effort by the British government should end the logjam.' Fine line, Page 8 Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

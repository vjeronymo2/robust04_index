			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Mexico devalues the peso amid deepening unrest in Chiapas Mexico's new government yesterday allowed a big devaluation of the peso in the face of mounting outflows of capital, reversing a long-held policy permitting only a gradual depreciation of the currency. It is the first significant devaluation by Mexico since 1987. The move by the government of President Ernesto Zedillo, who assumed office on December 1, followed 10 months of capital outflows from the country, which intensified again over the past couple of weeks. Government officials said they expected the peso would float upwards in value early next year, as political tensions in the country began to ease. Sales of Mexican assets by foreign investors reflected worries about deepening political tensions in the southern state of Chiapas, analysts said. Investors also had concerns about the size of the country's current account deficit, which will amount to some Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18bn) this year. Armed rebels mounted an offensive in Chiapas in January, demanding more rights for indigenous peoples and enhanced democracy. A tense impasse with the military has continued and this week some rebels occupied the Chiapas town of Simojovel and blocked roads around it. Several hundred government troops, backed by two light tanks, were reported last night to be heading for the town. The peso closed yesterday at 3.996 to the dollar, 15 per cent down on Monday's close. This follows a depreciation of some 10 per cent earlier in the year. The government announced that the permitted floor value of the peso would drop to 4.0016 to the US dollar, compared with Monday's floor of 3.466. The permitted daily slide, which amounts to some 4 per cent a year, will be allowed to continue. The Mexican stock market reacted favourably to the move, rising almost 6 per cent in heavy trading before falling back to close 1.97 per cent up following Monday's 4.2 per cent fall. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, said political pressure was the main reason behind the devaluation. Analysts said a seasonal demand for dollars by private companies, a switch by domestic investors from peso-denominated government paper to dollar-denominated securities and a general pull-out of Mexican stocks by foreign investors were also factors in the devaluation.

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COURT LETS SALVATION ARMY KEEP STREET-CORNER GOSPEL;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: DAILY SERMONS CAN CONTINUE ON AN OFFICE BUILDING'S PRIVATE FRONTAGE  BUT MUST BE QUIETER. BUILDING OWNERS HAD SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE  PRACTICE.  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Municipal Court commissioner ruled Friday that the Salvation Army  may preach and solicit contributions outside a Sherman Oaks office building --  as long as members turn down the volume.  </P> <P> Commissioner Manly D. Calof said the religious and charitable organization may  continue to exhort passers-by at the corner of Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards  to repent, rejoice and contribute to its cause. But the proselytizing must be  inaudible inside the nearby Trans World Bank Building, Calof cautioned.  </P> <P> Calof's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the building's owners,  United Properties Co., seeking a preliminary injunction to oust the  organization from the privately owned open space.  </P> <P> Since July, attorneys and accountants laboring through their lunch hours inside  the 13-story building have been distracted daily by fluegelhorn music,  tambourines, hymn singing and amplified readings of Leviticus from the pavement  below, the building's owners claimed.  </P> <P> Stuart Brand, an attorney on the third floor of the building, said he is  bothered each day by the group's "singing, preaching, ranting and raving from  12 to 1."  </P> <P> Salvation Army officials said they are not sure exactly what Calof's order  means but they'll stop using amplifiers while they study it and decide whether  to contest the matter in court.  </P> <P> "Am I allowed to use a megaphone?" Capt. John Purdell, 57, head of the group's  San Fernando Valley operations, wondered aloud after the hearing.  </P> <P> Salvation Army officials say amplification of some sort is necessary to be  heard above the traffic, and moving to another spot is out of the question  because the intersection is the busiest in the Valley, perfect for exhorting  the populace.  </P> <P> Besides, they have pledged to God to read the Bible from start to finish at  that spot, Purdell said. The group entered a Bible into evidence.  </P> <P> The organization has sporadically used the site for six years without  objections, said Alan L. Rosen, an attorney representing the building's owners.  Rosen said he was satisfied with the ruling.  </P> <P> "In the past, the army would come for a day and then leave, three or four times  a year," he said. But in July, the organization stepped up its schedule to  one-hour sessions seven days a week.  </P> <P> The army balked at informal requests from the building's owners to move. When  building maintenance workers erected makeshift barricades with sawhorses and  strands of nylon ribbon, Purdell ceremoniously cut the ribbons and resumed  preaching. The owners then filed suit.  </P> <P> Calof did not address lawsuit allegations that the army was "accosting" some  tenants and their clients in an attempt to get contributions.  </P> <P> In a declaration filed with the court, attorney Benjamin Felton, who works in  the building, said he was asked for a donation twice on Oct. 17 as he left for  and returned from lunch.  </P> <P> According to Rosen, one passer-by was told that a homeless family could be fed  for the cost of a pack of cigarettes.  </P> <P> Purdell denies that verbal solicitations are made.  </P> <P> "We never asked people for money. Talk to anybody who's seen us," he said in a  pleasant, clipped British accent. "I personally abhor buttonholing, accosting  and intimidating. If any comment was made, perhaps it was by an overly  enthusiastic worker."  </P> <P> Purdell also denied another allegation: that Salvation Army workers dance  during the daily proselytizing sessions.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's referring to the fact that when I sing an up-tempo gospel song, I  have difficulty keeping my feet still," he said.  </P> <P> Purdell said the organization has received letters from people who say they  have seen and heard the group at the Ventura Boulevard site. Some say they have  been moved to tears. Others enclose money and urge the group to keep up its  good work, Purdell said.  </P> <P> Money collected by the organization goes toward operating shelters for homeless  men in Van Nuys and Canoga Park, feeding the homeless, and providing hotel  rooms for homeless children and their parents, Purdell said.  </P> <P> The U. S. Supreme Court has ruled that private property open to the public can  be used by charitable, political and other groups. In the 1980 case of  Pruneyard Shopping Center vs. Robins, the court upheld a California Supreme  Court decision that the state had a right to require a mall near San Jose to  serve as a public forum. But the court said the mall may impose reasonable  rules and restrictions.  </P></p>

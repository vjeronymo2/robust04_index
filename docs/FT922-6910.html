			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (9): Where cost control counts - Profile, Akbank BE THEY large or small, most Turkish banks operate from glitzy modern headquarters designed to suggest vast opulence. Not so Akbank. Its headquarters are a distinctly unpretentious 1950s building on a busy street in Istanbul's Findikli district. 'The moment you set foot in that building you know you are in an environment where cost control counts,' says one foreign banker in the city. Eschewing the glitter, Ak, set up in 1948 and owned by the Sabanci Group, one of Turkey's two main conglomerates, has set its sights over the past two decades firmly on containing its costs and raising its profits. In doing so, it has risen from the ranks of the smaller and medium-sized banks with 30 branches to become of the dominant players in the country's financial system with 599 branches. Still smaller by asset size than its main competitors, Turkey Bankas and Yapi ve Kredi, Akbank was still far ahead of both last year with TL1,342bn (Dollars 265m) in post-tax profits, up from TL733bn in 1991. Assets at the end of 1991 were Dollars 3.65bn. For the past seven years, Akbank has come out ahead of the rest of the banking market in terms of net profit. Return on average assets was 9.17 per cent last year and return on equity 57.7 per cent, figures which places Akbank well ahead of many other European banks and not just its Turkish competitors. 'It is fairly clear now that Akbank is on the way to becoming dominant in the Turkish financial services sector,' says the general manager of another Istanbul bank. The results are achieved by fairly old-fashioned banking methods, combined with a determination to see the bank and its profits grow. 'Other banks tend to be satisfied with their results. We are not content,' says Mr Erol Sabanci, the bank's vice-chairman and dominant figure. During the mid-1980s, when most Turkish banks ran into trouble by lending to companies which could not pay them back, Akbank managed to keep its non-performing loans below 1 per cent of its loan book or less: no mean achievement for a bank which is owned by and closely associated with a large industrial group. 'We have known most of our customers for 20 or 25 years. We tend to be cautious about lending to new businesses unless we are very sure about what sort of management they have behind them,' says Mr Sabanci. The same caution applies to new types of banking business into which Akbank has moved in the past decade. It entered the field of trade finance and merchant banking for example, by setting up a joint venture with Banque Nationale de Paris and Dresdner Bank. In the UK it has a subsidiary, the first Turkish bank in London, Ak International, with paid up capital of 65m. When it became clear at the end of the 1980s that large Turkish banks would have to invest heavily in money transmission and information technology in order to tap the potential of an emerging domestic retail banking market, Ak watched and waited to see how the experiments of its rivals would fare. 'There are advantages in going second or third into a new market,' says Mr Akin Kozanoglu, the bank's head of retail operations and information technology. 'We were doubtful whether or not automated teller machines would be appropriate in Turkey for example," Once convinced that there were indeed profits to be made in retail banking, Ak pushed ahead, setting up a network of 300 ATMS and spending up to Dollars 100m a year on software development, through its own software house, Aknet, and developing on-line real time computerised links with all its branches. As a result Akbank customers now enjoy some facilities not generally available to European consumers: for example, they can dial a debit card number and learn the balance of their account over the telephone. The move into modern retail banking has brought other changes, especially in the bank's management structure. 'Akbank used frankly to be a one-man show, with most of its top managers relatively insignificant figures compared to Erol Sabanci,' says another banker. 'You can see that he is now consciously trying to replace the one-man show with young executives who are intended to be the backbone of a new management team for the future.' It may sound like a potentially difficult transition for a bank which was only a small family business little more than a generation ago. But other bankers point to the strong corporate culture which Mr Sabanci has developed at Akbank. 'Akbank executives rarely move to other banks, and they tend to understand what is expected of them much better than bankers in the other large banks. It is an old-fashioned outlook, but also a very tightly focused one. If you want to explain why Ak is probably going to go on outperforming the competition, I think that tight focus is the main reason,' says one banker.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Spending rises but output remains flat CONSUMER SPENDING rose in the second quarter for the first time in two years in the second quarter, but official figures confirmed that overall output in the UK was flat. Expenditure by consumers on durable goods, energy, food, clothing and services - which accounts for about three quarters of gross domestic product  -rose by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, the first quarterly rise since the three months to June 1990. However, fixed investment continued to move downwards in the second quarter. It fell by 2.5 per cent on the previous quarter and was 3.5 per cent lower than a year ago. The revised figures from the Central Statistical Office confirmed that overall GDP fell by 0.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first, to stand 0.6 per cent lower than in the same period a year before. Apart from a small upward blip in the third quarter of last year, this was the eighth successive fall in GDP. Excluding oil and gas extraction, GDP rose by 0.1 per cent in the three months to June, ending seven quarters of falling on-shore output. It was 0.9 per cent lower than the same quarter a year before. 'Overall, today's data confirm the picture of an economy bumping along the bottom, ready to pick up but with no strong impetus to do so,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner of SG Warburg Securities. The small rise in consumer expenditure was not unexpected. It followed depressed levels of spending in the first quarter, when consumer confidence was suppressed by pre-election nervousness. Other highlights of yesterday's figures include: A rise in general government consumption, which covers spending by central government and local authorities, of 1.1 per cent on the previous quarter. Compared with the same period a year before it fell by 0.5 per cent. Sharp quarter-on-quarter rises in spending on clothing and footwear. Spending on cars and beer also rose. A 0.9 per cent fall in construction output compared with the previous quarter. Output was down by 4.6 per cent compared with a year before. Service-sector output was flat on the previous quarter but 0.3 per cent lower than a year ago. Within that, hotels and catering rose by 0.5 per cent on the previous quarter.  -------------------------------------------------------------             CONSUMER SPENDING IN SECOND QUARTER  ------------------------------------------------------------- SECTOR                     % CHANGE ON       % CHANGE                           FIRST QUARTER    YEAR-ON-YEAR  ------------------------------------------------------------- Vehicles                       +2.6            +4.1 Furniture                      +0.4            -0.3 Food                           -0.8            -0.4 Tobacco                        -0.1            -2.1 Clothing                       +3.3            -0.6 Energy products                -0.1            -5.8 Rent and water charges         +0.3            +1.4 TOTAL                           0.5             0  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

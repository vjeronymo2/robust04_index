			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> INSULIN DOSES HELP CHILDREN  </P> <P> High doses of insulin appear to at least temporarily prevent the destruction of  cells in the pancreas that causes the most common form of diabetes among  children. Researchers at the University of South Florida Health Sciences Center  in Tampa gave 12 children who had just been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes four  times the usual dose of the hormone insulin for two weeks.  </P> <P> Compared to 14 children with Type 1 diabetes who received normal amounts of  insulin, those who received the intensive insulin appeared to have been spared  the destruction of cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.  </P> <P> At least 500,000 children in the United States have Type 1 or insulin-dependent  diabetes. The condition is caused by the lack of production of insulin by the  pancreas. Insulin controls blood sugar levels.  </P> <P> Dr. Sharish Shah and his colleagues reported in the New England Journal of  Medicine that the patients who received the high doses of insulin were  producing significantly more insulin one year after the treatment than the 14  children who did not.  </P></p>

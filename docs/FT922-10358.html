			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Moody's puts IBJ debt rating under review THE debt rating of the Industrial Bank of Japan has been placed under review by Moody's Investors Service, which is concerned about IBJ's internal controls and its exposure to the property sector. Moody's said that IBJ, once regarded as one of Japan's most prized financial institutions, would face increased competition in its traditional areas of business as financial reform proceeded, and that the erosion of its traditional businesses may not be offset by new business areas. Moody's said that the IBJ had a high exposure of lending to non-bank financial institutions, many of which are in trouble because of heavy lending to the commercial property sector in the late 1980s. Moody's said it was concerned 'that weakness in IBJ's internal controls could have a further impact on the bank's credit quality'. The IBJ's difficulties were underscored earlier this week when it turned out to be one of the biggest losers stemming from a rescue of the Toyo Shinkin Bank, which is being split up among 22 local credit co-operatives and the Sanwa Bank. Toyo Shinkin had bad debts of Y252bn (Dollars 1.9bn) following the issue of fake deposit certificates which were allegedly used as loan collateral by Mr Nui Onoue, an Osaka restaurant owner. Some Y122bn of debt owed by the Toyo Shinkin is being forgiven. IBJ will assume over Y40bn through IBJ Lease. The balance is to be borne by the Fuji Bank (Y11bn) and non-bank financial institutions. Sanwa Bank will acquire the majority of Toyo Shinkin assets for Y50bn, although 25 of Toyo Shinkin's branches will be sold for Y18bn. Sanwa will receive 10-year, low-interest loans worth Y80bn to help it liquidate the balance of Toyo Shinkin's bad debt. This money will come from the IBJ (Y50bn), the Federation of Credit Co-operatives (Y10bn) and the Deposit Insurance Corporation (Y20bn).</p>

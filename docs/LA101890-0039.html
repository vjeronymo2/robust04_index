			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> TEAM NOT EAGER TO FACE JACKSON  </P> <P> The Chargers would like the Kansas City Royals to improve their baseball team.  It's that simple.  </P> <P> Send Bo Jackson to the AL playoffs, send him to the World Series. Why not even  give him three weeks in Hawaii after the Series to rest his muscles and enter  his football mind-set?  </P> <P> "I hate him," Charger linebacker Gary Plummer said, smiling. "I'd rather go  against one of the running backs at Crawford High School."  </P> <P> Sorry, Gary. You're stuck with Bo. He is scheduled to play his first football  game of the season on Sunday when the Raiders play the Chargers at San Diego  Jack Murphy Stadium. And, of course, Marcus Allen will also be on hand.  </P> <P> Two Heisman Trophy winners in the same backfield. Some fun for the defense.  </P> <P> Tough as Jackson is, there is more concern about Allen, who is eighth in the  AFC in rushing with 295 yards in 73 carries.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see Marcus on the bench," Charger cornerback Sam Seale said. "Both  can beat you, but, to me, Marcus can beat you in more than one way. Bo can beat  you in a lot of ways, but I think Marcus can beat you in more ways."  </P> <P> Linebacker Billy Ray Smith worked with trainer Keoki Kamau Wednesday, but  probably will not be ready for Sunday's game. Smith has been on injured reserve  four weeks because of an abdominal strain. "He looks like he's moving around  pretty good," Henning said. "They have to make some strength determinations to  (see) if he can handle what he's got to do in the game."  </P> <P> Safety Vencie Glenn may miss Sunday's game because of a pulled hamstring, the  latest of several injuries that have slowed him recently. "I've probably missed  more practice in the last four weeks than I had in the last four years."  </P> <P> Other Chargers questionable for Sunday's game include: tight end Arthur Cox  (large toe), cornerback Donald Frank (fingers), offensive guard David Richards  (large toe) and Seale (fingers).  </P> <P> Raider injuries: Linebacker Art Jimerson (neck) is doubtful, running back Greg  Bell (ankle) is questionable.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1274A&hyph;1&blank;Special Rules for Certain Transactions Where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stated Principal Amount Does Not Exceed $2,800,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received on these regulations and no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material changes were made to this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1275&hyph;1&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to a comment, the definition of issue has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded. As a result, debt instruments issued in different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets or for different consideration can be part of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.1275&hyph;2&blank;Special Rules Relating to Debt Instruments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide that all payments (other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than qualified stated interest payments) consist first of accrued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but unpaid OID, then of principal. Several commentators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that unscheduled prepayments should be treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partial retirements of the debt instrument. In response to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the final regulations add new rules for the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of pro rata prepayments. In general, a pro rata prepayment is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unscheduled payment made on a debt instrument prior to maturity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of principal and interest remaining on the instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a prepayment on a debt instrument is a pro rata prepayment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prepayment is treated as a payment in retirement of a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the instrument, which may result in gain or loss to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder. The gain or loss is calculated by assuming that the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument consists of two instruments, one that is retired and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one that remains outstanding, and by allocating the adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price, the holder's adjusted basis, and the accrued but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpaid qualified stated interest between the two instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the portion of the instrument that is treated as retired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the pro rata prepayment. In the case of a pro rata  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepayment, the issuer may realize discharge of indebtedness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income (as determined under &sect;1.61&hyph;12) or repurchase premium (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined under &sect;1.163&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Partial retirement treatment is restricted to pro rata  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepayments because the IRS and Treasury believe that this type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of prepayment is common. The extension of the rule to non-pro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rata prepayments would add undue complexity to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, extension of the rule to non-pro rata prepayments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may cause inappropriate recognition of gain or loss if, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to a prepayment, the interest rate or the payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule is altered. Furthermore, as noted by one commentator, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for non-pro rata prepayments may not be necessary because an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unscheduled prepayment may, depending on the circumstances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a deemed exchange under section 1001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations contain a number of rules that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally require a holder to follow the issuer's treatment of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item, such as whether a debt instrument is issued in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially abusive situation. In response to comments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations provide that the issuer must make information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to its treatment of the item available to the holder in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reasonable manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1275&hyph;2T, which is published elsewhere in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , provides for an anti-abuse rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the rule, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, can apply or depart from the final regulations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a manner that ensures a reasonable result in light of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the statutes governing OID.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Chilean equities lose their fizz as interest rates rise - Rumours that pension fund holdings are too high have also depressed the bolsa The Santiago stock exchange appears to have lost its fizz. The IPSA index of the 50 most traded shares has dropped by almost 9 per cent this month, following a steady rise between January and July in which the index climbed by 39 per cent in dollar terms. Brokers are at a loss to explain the bearish sentiment in the market. Not even the announcement of Standard &amp; Poor's 'investment grade' rating for Chile, which ranks the country as the safest haven for investment in Latin America, lifted spirits on the trading floor of the bolsa last week. The economy is set to grow by 8 per cent this year, a construction boom has transformed Santiago into one huge building site, traffic jams and smog point to the society's growing affluence, and publicly listed companies reported an average net income growth of 21 per cent in the first half of the year. The strong company results alone should have boosted share values. Their fall, instead, suggests that the bolsa is suffering from a surfeit of good news and fears more difficult times ahead. Investment analysts at Celfin, the company that manages Salomon Brothers' foreign investment fund in Chile, point out that a large part of company profits came from the revaluation of the peso earlier this year, which is a one-off financial gain. Operating income rose by 6.5 per cent in real terms. Chile's central bank raised interest rates last week in an attempt to dampen a consumer spending spree that is overheating the economy and fuelling inflation. Consumer prices are forecast to increase by 1.4 per cent in August, the highest monthly jump this year, compared with accumulated inflation of 5.5 per cent in the first seven months of 1992. Brokers report that investors have begun moving money out of equity and into central bank paper as a result of the latter's more attractive yields. The August sell-off, however, began with rumours that Chile's biggest institutional investors, the private pension funds known as AFPs, had overstepped their investment ceiling in equities and would soon be forced to offload shares. At present, AFPs can hold only up to 30 per cent of their portfolios in equity. But as share prices have nearly doubled over the past year, many AFPs find themselves above the legal limit and must trim back their equity investments within six months. Mr Pedro Yrrarazaval, the bolsa chairman, says: 'The law is unfair as it penalises AFPs for making good investments. The pension funds should be allowed to expand their equity portfolios, and in no case should they be forced to sell.' The government is drafting a new law on pension funds which seeks to broaden their investment horizons. It is unclear, however, whether they will be allowed to channel more of their Dollars 10bn worth of assets into shares. Chile's stock market capitalisation is valued at Dollars 33bn, so greater attention is being paid to other instruments, such as foreign government securities. Mr Hugo Lavados, head of Chile's Securities Exchange Commission, says the government will decide what is best for the pension funds, not what suits the stock market. But Mr Yrrarazaval argues that the uncertainty is affecting investor confidence. 'The government should give a clear indication of its intentions. The market is awash with negative rumours as nobody knows what will be changed.' One corner of the market has proved immune to the downturn. A growing number of companies are seeking listings as a way of raising capital, and the stock exchange created a new index in July to track the performance of these 'emerging shares'. The bolsa selected eight companies that have gone public over the past year, including the Iquique free trade zone (Zofri), two bottling companies, Edelpa and Polar, two wineries, San Pedro and Santa Rita, a ceramics manufacturer, Cordillera, a maker of fruit juice concentrates, Jucosa, and Puerto Ventanas, a private port. The value of their shares, weighted in the new IPAE index, has risen by 77 per cent since the beginning of the year, more than double the performance of the IPSA index of most traded shares.</p>

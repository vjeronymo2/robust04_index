			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Europe's Jobs Crisis: Social blight deep in structure - Why is unemployment so much worse in the European Community than in the US or Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper factors? / FT writers report as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit ALARM and pity about unemployment are nothing new. 'A man willing to work and unable to find work is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune's inequality exhibits under the sun,' wrote the Scottish thinker Thomas Carlyle in 1839. In terms of mere physical well-being, the EC's 17m unemployed are better off than those without jobs in Carlyle's day or during the 1930s depression. What has changed for the worse is the long-term hopelessness engendered by an EC problem which has persisted for a generation. The Community's unemployment rate, about 2 per cent before the 1973-74 oil price shock, has ratcheted up remorselessly. Each cyclical upturn has receded, leaving a larger proportion of jobless. The jobless figures themselves are managed, massaged, manipulated and moaned over - permanent symbols of a dissatisfied society. With every wave of protestation by politicians and trade unionists that the level is unacceptably high has come a fresh wave of public disillusionment about their inability to do much about it. Pump-priming 1930s-style is no longer appropriate - not only because of the size of government deficits, but also because many structural causes of unemployment would not be resolved, even if the Community were to find its way back to 3 per cent growth. There is no shortage of microeconomic suggestions to correct the trend. Many of these proposals, such as real wage cuts and more flexible working methods, are economically sound. The long-term jobless might, however, note cynically that these recipes are mainly offered by commentators suffering from over-work rather than under-work, and whose real wages have shown a comforting propensity never to fall. The latest Commission document on 'a framework for employment' highlights the less-than-inspiring options on offer. The document, put forward by Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, outlines 'a process of analysis and policy reflections on possible solutions.' The aim is 'some operational conclusions over an 18-month period.' But the EC's room for manoeuvre room seems inversely proportional to the political sensitivity of the issues it would like to address. The single-market programme, for example, set forth a tide of investment in the second half of the 1980s which contributed to the Community's buoyancy. Now, however, the programme is becoming increasingly associated in public opinion with job-killing corporate restructuring, diminishing further popular enthusiasm for European union. Also, the latest rise in unemployment is coinciding with intense immigration pressure. To discontented populations in eastern Europe or the third world, even a high-unemployment Community looks to be a source of succour.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Brel workers may block control bid THE 6,500 workers at Brel, the privatised UK rolling-stock maker, are threatening to block attempts by Asea Brown Boveri to take control of the loss-making company. Union representatives say that members wish to retain the shares they were given on privatisation, and would be prepared to increase their holdings if the price was right. The Swiss-Swedish company ABB owns 40 per cent of the shares and has agreed to buy the 40 per cent stake held by Trafalgar House subject to clearance by the European Commission. Once clearance is given, ABB must bid for the remaining 20 per cent of shares held by the Brel workers and management, at the share price paid to Trafalgar House. However, Mr John Darby, chairman of Brel, told shareholders at the Brel annual meeting in Crewe on Saturday that he was recommending employees not to sell at that price, which was based on a 'nominal' valuation. Although the company had made a loss of Pounds 41.6m in 1991, new orders and the recent restructuring of Brel had made him much more optimistic about the company's future. Since ABB has a policy of taking 100 per cent ownership of subsidiaries, a higher offer is likely to be made for the shares held by employees and the management team. Mr John Heavey, secretary of the RMT union branch at the Derby carriage works, said yesterday that employees at all Brel factories had told him that they wished to retain their shares and even to buy more. 'We are not looking for a better price,' he said. 'Holding shares gives us a say in the company, including the right to say our penn'orth at the annual meeting. 'We are also opposed because we can see a brighter future in the company and want a stake in it,' Mr Heavey added. Each employee was given 43 of the Pounds 10 shares when Brel was privatised in 1989. About 6 per cent of the shares are owned by past and present employees, with another 14 per cent held by the management team.</p>

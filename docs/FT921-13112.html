			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: General Electric marks time GENERAL Electric, the US group with interests ranging from power systems to financial services, reported a rise of just 2 per cent in fourth-quarter net earnings as the US recession held back growth. Net earnings totalled Dollars 1.26bn, or Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with Dollars 1.24bn, or Dollars 1.42, in the final period of 1990. Consolidated revenues rose by 2 per cent to Dollars 17.5bn. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that, despite the recession, all the group's operating segments, apart from broadcasting and materials, increased their operating profits, demonstrating the strength and breadth of its businesses in the face of a difficult global economy. However, the group gave no detailed breakdown of each sector's fourth-quarter performance. For the full year, earnings were up 3 per cent at Dollars 4.44bn, or 5 per cent on a per-share basis at Dollars 5.10, before the adoption of a new accounting standard for retirees health benefits. This non-cash adjustment, taken in the third quarter, reduced reported earnings to Dollars 2.64bn. The group's 11.3 per cent operating margin compared with 11.6 per cent in 1990, but GE said this was more than accounted for by price declines and lower ratings at NBC, its television network. Operating margins at the group's other businesses grew from 11.5 per cent to 11.9 per cent. GE's financial services operations produced a strong performance, with earnings rising 17 per cent in the year to Dollars 1.27bn.</p>

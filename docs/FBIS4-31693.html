			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georgi Kardanov: "Security by All for All"] </F>   [Text] Joining the European and Euro-Atlantic economic  structures and security systems, which represents part of our  foreign policy strategy, offers us the best opportunity to give  scope to Bulgarian national interests -- Bulgarian President Dr.  Zhelyu Zhelev made this statement at the Central Military Club  in Sofia yesterday in a speech he made to the Atlantic Club.    After our association with the European Union [EU], our  membership of the Council of Europe, and our "enhanced" status  in the Western European Union [WEU], Bulgaria's relations with  NATO within the framework of the Partnership for Peace  Initiative acquires particular importance, Dr. Zhelev said.  Bulgaria has already signed the outline agreement and has  committed itself to the process of seeking a higher degree of  security, called security by all for all. Dr. Zhelev outlined  the most important features of the initiative: The equality of  the parties in their initial positions does not exclude, but  presupposes a differentiation, close in time, between the  Eastern European states according to their abilities to share  responsibilities and fit into the NATO structures and  mechanisms; the North Atlantic Alliance aims to internally  reorganize and adapt itself to become a common system of  security; within this system, the United States retains its  participation in building European security, and the role of the  WEU will be enhanced; and, lastly, the Partnership initiative in  no way aims to isolate Russia, nor does it intend to favor  Russia.    Dr. Zhelev noted that for a number of years Bulgaria has  been  making immense efforts to change the nature of interstate  relations in our region, directing them into a new channel;  toward good-neighborliness, cooperation, stable development, the  opening of borders, and real integration into the rest of  Europe, due to which the ideas of the Partnership for Peace are  in harmony with our own national interests. The president sees  grounds for this in the following factors. First, now the  Balkans are no longer split into blocs or divided along  ideological lines; quite the reverse, the Balkan countries,  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  included, accept the initiative. In this way we can avert the  greatest danger for the region, namely the appearance of  alliances -- "Orthodox or Pan-Slavic axes," an "Islamic  crescent," and other configurations -- that in past history were  the precursors of Balkan wars and disasters.    Second, Bulgaria is surrounded by neighbors that are  militarily superior to it in both absolute and relative terms,  producing a tendency for the imbalance to become greater. It is  precisely the PFP Initiative that will help to fill the "vacuum"  in the sphere of regional balances. Bulgaria is also interested  in mutually acceptable levels of the individual components of  the military balance, in transparency, and in the application of  the Treaty on Limiting Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, but  measures in relation to the Balkans cannot be delayed; action is  needed now, before it is too late!    After speaking about the possibilities offered by the  initiative to the Eastern European countries regarding access to  Western markets, Dr. Zhelev urged Bulgarian companies, banks,  and institutions to utilize these opportunities in the most  rational manner, including in the struggle of the police and the  investigation organs against organized crime, narcotics  trafficking, and smuggling, by relying on partnership and  professional cooperation within the framework of NATO.    The president devoted special attention to the effect that  the Partnership initiative will have on the reform of the  Bulgarian Army, military science, and the country's defense  potential. First, the Defense Ministry and the army command  would gain indisputable benefit from the relevant NATO  documentation -- in juridical matters, standardization, material  and equipment supplies, communications, and management  coordination. In the future, this cooperation may also extend  to the fields of military production and the control of and  trade in special products. Bulgaria sees possibilities for  cooperating with NATO in training specialized units for missions  under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE. The  training of the officer corps also offers broad scope for  cooperation, such as in special training courses at NATO centers  and military schools, cooperation in training exercises, command  staff exercises, and many national field and naval maneuvers.  It is no accident that the plan of the Defense Ministry  includes the "Breeze '94" naval exercise, with the participation  of naval units from the U.S. 6th Fleet, Russia, Greece, Turkey,  Ukraine, and Romania, and with observers also invited from  Georgia.    Bulgaria's armed forces are going through a difficult and  demanding stage of profound reform, in both essence and scope,  the aim of which is to maintain in peacetime a small, but  high-quality army. Close cooperation with NATO is a  precondition for reform to succeed and for the Bulgarian  officers corps and all the military to make a worthy  contribution to the democratic civic society.    The president's speech was listened to with great interest  by  the capacity audience, which included representatives of  parliament and the government and state institutions;  ambassadors and military attaches; Army General Lyuben Petrov,  chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff; representatives of  the Defense Ministry and senior officers of the armed forces;  eminent Bulgarian intellectuals; and members of the Atlantic  Club.</p>

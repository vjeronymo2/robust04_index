			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Sung-chol] </F>   [Text] As North Korea's nuclear issue has abruptly entered  a dialogue phase with the talks between North Korean President  Kim Il-song and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as momentum,  the government is outwardly showing a very prudent attitude,  although it has become very embarrassed.    At the Unification Security Coordination Council meeting  held  on 17 June, the government showed a different reaction to the  results of the Kim-Carter talks from that of the United States.  The government stated: "We will fine-tune our position after  studying former President Carter's talks with Kim." This  reflects the complicated stance of the government.    The government is showing such a reserved attitude because  the government feels as if it had been hit on the back of the  head-- because the United States, which has so far led the moves  for the imposition of sanctions, has abruptly changed its  attitude--while attempting to keep pace with the U.S. policy.    Since North Korea unilaterally replaced fuel rods at the  five-megawatt reactor, the United States has virtually attached  preconditions to the realization of the third round of  North-U.S. talks by stressing that "there should be an advance  in the negotiations between North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]" before the third round of talks are  held.    As soon as the substance of the talks between former  President Carter and Kim Il-song was made public, U.S. President  Clinton and Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci have made the  holding of North-U.S. talks a fait accompli, while responding  affirmatively to North Korea's proposal. In this connection,  some officials are even speculating if there have been secret  contacts between the United States and North Korea.    One government official in authority stated: "North Korea's  proposal is a new one in terms of its intention to allow IAEA  inspectors to remain in North Korea and to guarantee the  operations of monitoring devices. A top priority for us is to  certify what else is included in the proposal."    The government is still unclear about the following  regarding  North Korea's proposal: the substitution of a light-water  reactor; the return to safeguards regulations of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and the IAEA, including special  inspections [tukbyol sachal]; and a freeze on nuclear  development.    The government feels if North Korea's promise turns out to  be  true, it has no choice but to agree to the holding of the third  round of high-level North-U.S. talks.    Under the circumstances in which the United States has  virtually made the holding of North-U.S. talks a fait accompli,  the government seems to have taken such a position on the basis  of its own judgment that, although it is somewhat unbecoming,  the government will have to follow the United States if the  proposal includes "special inspections," in which North Korea's  past nuclear development will be uncovered; and "a freeze on  nuclear development," in which the future and the present are  guaranteed.    As a result of the abrupt turnaround of the United States,  the government has been mired in a dilemma. Some officials  believe the government should distance itself from the United  States when dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue in the  future. Therefore, it is expected that the turnaround of the  United States this time will serve as a factor for conflict  between the ROK and the United States during the UN Security  Council debate on sanctions in the future.    One official concerned stated: "This dialogue phase will  serve as a turning point to help escape from another crisis,  rather than as a decisive opportunity for the settlement of the  situation. We should reexamine the ROK-U.S. cooperative system  this time, to avoid North Korea's nuclear development from  becoming a long-term issue."</p>

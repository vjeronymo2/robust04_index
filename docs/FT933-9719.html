			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Property: Pricey but desirable, that's Switzerland - And since restrictions can make it difficult for foreigners to buy homes, make sure to get yourself a good lawyer 'we have not withdrawn it and we have not activated it,' says the country's embassy in London - the prospect of Switzerland becoming a member in the next few years seems remote. Thus, any large-scale relaxation of the restrictions on foreigners buying property is unlikely. In spite of this, London solicitor Simon Malster - whose firm, Osbornes, sells Swiss property to foreign buyers - says he feels the restrictions have added greatly to the country's attraction for buyers of second homes. 'Switzerland has effectively maintained its exclusivity, high standard of living and quality of life,' he says. Malster adds that although property prices may have dipped in some of Switzerland's major cities, they have not done so in popular resorts like Villars (in the canton of Valais). He stresses that people who buy there tend to be virtually recession-proof and that a market for the country's leisure homes exists throughout the world. Random choices from Osbornes' list in Villars include a two-bedroom chalet apartment, where you can ski to your back door, for Pounds 169,400, or a duplex apartment with three double bedrooms at Pounds 202,000. Both can be occupied immediately. For the bargain-hunter, there is the Residence Dauphin: a four-bedroom apartment on two floors in a 200-acre private estate, also at Villars. Construction is 'excellent' but the inside needs updating. Price: Pounds 230,000. Only a handful of agents in Britain offers Swiss property regularly. Among them is Hilary Scott Overseas, which produces information sheets about some of the many regulations governing property purchases by foreigners - an almost impossible task since they vary from canton to canton and change often. But the rules also seem flexible, and a good Swiss lawyer is the first essential. A foreigner may buy only one property. He cannot sell for five years (unless in exceptional circumstances) and must then sell only to a Swiss resident. After 10 years, though, he can apply for a permit to sell to another foreigner. Quotas are issued for the number of properties authorised for sale to foreigners each year: for 1991/1992, it was 1,420. The total is divided between the cantons, some of which may not take up their allocation. Certain cantons (often those where German is spoken) virtually are closed to non-Swiss buyers so there are more opportunities to purchase in French (or perhaps Italian) speaking areas. But foreigners may only buy a percentage of apartments in any one building. Mortgages, at about 7.5 per cent, should be available from Swiss banks. Legal fees and transfer tax come to about 5.5 per cent of the purchase price. Swiss property prices have been rising on average by 5-7 per cent a year. They may appear high, says Hilary Scott, but the Swiss found it unthinkable to build to anything but the best standards. On top of that, the country has political and economic stability with good medical care, transport and general services - and that healthy climate. Hilary Scott has a choice of properties in Villars, including a development of 25 studio to three-bedroom apartments in the centre. Prices range from Pounds 72,000 to Pounds 455,000, with occupations from Christmas. Owners will be able to use the services and pool in a hotel across the road. So far, a third of purchasers have been British but the Swiss also are buying there - something to note should you need to re-sell. This agency can offer rental and management services and deal with lettings. It says: 'As a guideline, if a property is rented for 15 to 18 weeks a year, one can expect a return of about 2 per cent over the annual cost.' Villas Abroad (Properties) has a spread of locations and prices for its Swiss holiday homes. There are plenty of re-sales, which probably will be cheaper than new, but these can present problems and may require a degree of patience. If a foreign vendor is involved, there is the need to ensure that he has been there long enough to re-sell to a non-Swiss. There could also be a long wait in some cantons to go through the procedure. As recession touches Switzerland, you hear of local builders 'leaning on' authorities to make it easier for new, rather than existing, properties to be sold. As always, situations vary between cantons. Again, if a Swiss can buy a property right away and a foreigner, while willing to purchase, must wait, a two-tier market with different prices can develop. Villas Abroad has its own bargain suggestions. The Grand Hotel at Sainte-Croix, overlooking Lake Neuchatel, is an old-style, stately hotel on the French Riviera scale with pool, tennis and other facilities. Nearly all its apartments have been sold and prices have now been slashed to clear the rest. You might not choose the furniture that goes with them - large and heavy, although certainly serviceable - but the prices are down to Pounds 92,000. Then there is Leysin, a resort on a plateau high above Aigle which is renowned for long hours of sun. Many buildings, originally clinics, have been converted to apartments, with some now available for around Pounds 88,000. David de Lara &amp; Partners is another agency which has property in a number of cantons. It produces a booklet giving brief descriptions of these areas and price ranges. Chalet-style apartments in Chateau-d'Oex (in the canton of Vaud) are from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 450,000; in Wengen (Bern), from Pounds 123,000 to Pounds 257,000. At Riva san Vitale, Lugano (Ticino), there is a one-bedroom apartment with three balconies, on the bank of the lake, at Pounds 145,000. In the village of Klosters (Grisons), few properties can be sold to foreign buyers, but the agency does have studios and one-bedroom apartments from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 206,000. With the growing number of golf courses and variety of recreational activities, many mountain resorts are changing in character. Indeed, the scenery from some has to be viewed through confetti-like showers of para-gliders. 'A lot of people don't want to be inundated with tourists. They want somewhere tucked away and quiet,' says de Lara. For them, he suggests Arbaz (Valais), with its lakes and forests below Anzere. Here, Les Jolis Chalets, four three-bedroom chalets on individual plots, are being built. Prices are from Pounds 190,000 to Pounds 260,000. Meanwhile, for the non-Swiss who would like his own chalet in Villars - where only apartments are allowed to foreigners in the centre - there is Le Petit Duc, a half-chalet. The lower section, with three bedrooms, other rooms, basement and garden is for sale at Pounds 570,000. Osbornes: 071-485 8811; Hilary Scott Overseas: 0243-554 319; Villas Abroad (Properties): 081-891 5444; David de Lara &amp; Partners: 081-742 0708.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "There cannot be steady peace in Europe without  Russia," the chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly, Loic  Bouvard, said in Moscow Wednesday. A NATO parliamentary  delegation headed by Bouvard was received by Federation Council  Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko Wednesday.    According to Bouvard, Russian deputies' controversial  attitude to Russia's joining the NATO Partnership for Peace  program was mainly explained by the internal situation in the  country rather than foreign policy matters.    At the same time, Shumeyko said that Russian politicians'  speculation about and attitude to the subject were mainly caused  by insufficient and incorrect information.    "In addition, this issue is psychologically difficult for  citizens of Russia as until very recently the NATO alliance was  enemy No.1 for many," Shumeyko was quoted as saying.    Nevertheless, "the issue is on the way to resolution,"  Shumeyko said.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Philips trebles with help from the World Cup Philips, the Dutch electronics group, more than trebled its profits in the second quarter of 1994, beating even the most optimistic of analysts' forecasts. It also predicted a substantial increase in full-year earnings now that it has begun to feel the effects of economic recovery in some European countries. Part of the second-quarter rise was due to higher sales of colour television sets in the run-up to this summer's soccer World Cup. Philips' shares jumped to a new 12-month high of Fl 58.50, but fell back slightly later in the day to close at Fl 57.80, a rise of Fl 1.90. Philips said: 'We are rather more encouraged with respect to the future than we were some six months ago.' Net profit surged to Fl 402m (Pounds 147m), from Fl 117m before extraordinary items in the second quarter of 1993. First-half net profit totalled Fl 662m, up from Fl 220m last year. Turnover advanced 6 per cent in the quarter, pushing first-half turnover up 3 per cent to Fl 27.96bn. Sales volume in the first six months rose by 8 per cent, easily outstripping an average 2 per cent fall in prices. 'Some of this growth comes from increased sales of televisions, stimulated by the World Cup, and is probably not sustainable,' said Mr Dudley Eustace, finance director. The soccer-inspired sales are thought to be the main reason behind the 14 per cent increase in consumer electronics turnover in April-June. Mr Eustace noted that the decline of the dollar, which is negative for Philips, was another reason why the strong second-quarter and first-half performances could probably not be matched in the rest of 1994. However, the company expected 'substantially better' full-year results. The heavy restructuring of the early 1990s was paying off, enabling the management to concentrate on 'revitalising' the company. On Wednesday, for example, it announced a Fl 500m investment in its Dutch semi-conductor plant, the biggest single investment since the company ran into difficulties in 1990. The semi-conductors and components sector saw first-half operating profit nearly double to Fl 750m. Consumer electronics swung into an operating profit of Fl 211m from a loss of Fl 113m, helped by a halving of losses at Grundig in Germany. Communications equipment activities in Germany continued to suffer from lower investment by the country's telecommunications authority.</p>

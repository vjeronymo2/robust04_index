			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Germany's overnight rate  cuts will not lead Japan to take fresh fiscal and monetary  measures ahead of a spate of international meetings slated in  Washington later this month, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  said Friday [15 April].    "Japan will not change its policies and will continue  steadily implementing its latest measures," Fujii told a regular  news conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    The Bundesbank's policy-making council decided overnight to  cut its discount and lombard rates by a quarter of a percentage  point to an annual 5.00 percent and 6.50 percent, effective  Friday.    Fujii declined to comment on overseas policy, only saying  that lower rates help a country's economy.    The timing of the rate cuts would allow other European  nations to follow suit ahead of the international financial  gatherings in Washington.    Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven  (G-7) major industrial nations are expected to meet on April 24  before a spate of twice-yearly meetings of the International  Monetary Fund and World Bank.    With Germany set to portray its rate cuts as soothing  growing  concerns over the recent trend for a rise in long-term market  rates in G-7 nations, Japan may be under pressure to demonstrate  a commitment to reducing its huge trade surplus.    The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan and the United States.</p>

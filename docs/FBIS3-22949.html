The ambassador told AKHIR KHABAR that Libyan-Jordanian  relations are extremely good. He said there is a plot that is  intended to harm Libyan-Jordanian ties, saying that the plot  that is being hatched is bigger than the Arab people. He said  colonialist nations seek to create problems and sow discord in  order to preoccupy the Arab people with bilateral and trilateral  problems, in order to peddle their solutions and policies in the  region.    Answering a question about any official contacts between the  Libyans and the Jordanian Government, the ambassador said: The  Jordanian Government knows the truth. There is no need for any  contacts. It is difficult to discuss denial and confirmation  between brothers.    Regarding the party that leaked the information to AFP, the  ambassador said: We do not know who is behind this. But  imagine that the United States has recently said that Libya is  conspiring against its security. Who would believe that?  Imagine a Third World nation conspiring against the security of  a superpower?    The ambassador concluded: Reason must prevail in this  region. The United States and the colonialist countries should  know that we are not little children anymore. We should analyze  things. Dialogue is not a bad approach.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance deputy Mirko Tremaglia, </F> chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of  Deputies, by Federico Bianchessi in Rome; date not given:  "Tremaglia: `We Shall Return to Africa'" -- first two  paragraphs are LA VOCE introduction]    [Text] Mirko, and the world...trembles [pun on  interviewee's surname]. He wears neither the fascist uniform of  coarsely woven woolen cloth nor a black shirt, but can it be a  mere coincidence that it has fallen to him, Mirko Tremaglia, the  former sublieutenant under the Republic of Salo who now chairs  the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, to  break the news of al-Qadhdhafi's surrender over the Lockerbie  affair? Yes, it is true, yesterday, the colonel of the  Jamahiriyah, the supreme head of Islamic Libya, informed the  veteran of the Empire -- via his ambassador in Rome -- that he  will consent to the trial of the two men suspected of planting  the bomb on the Pan Am jumbo. The trial will be held at the  International Court of Justice in The Hague.    But, a native of Bergamo through and through, the  indefatigable Tremaglia has also succeeded, in the very same  hours, in hammering home to Russian Ambassador Valeriy Kenyaykin  the need for Moscow to expedite the return of the remains of our  war dead to Italy. In exchange, of course, for substantial aid,  the Russian Government is also to withdraw its veto on the  former communist countries joining NATO.    [Bianchessi] Full steam ahead, then, Mr. Chairman. What else  do you have in mind to give Italy back its -- how did He  [Mussolini] put it? -- place in the sun?    [Tremaglia] I am working on various matters. The unsettled  legal dispute with Slovenia and Croatia takes first place.    [Bianchessi] Is that what it is, an unsettled legal dispute?    [Tremaglia] No doubt about it. The Osimo Treaty is a thing  of the past.    [Bianchessi] What do you mean, a thing of the past?    [Tremaglia] It ceased to exist when the party that signed  it,  by which I mean Yugoslavia, became extinct. I have never called  for territorial reviews. The legal dispute was opened by Italy  in September 1992 with bilateral committees, whose findings were  negative, however. We are pressing for two things: first, the  right of the 350,000 exiles forcibly expelled in 1947 to go back  to their homeland and have their property returned to them,  though let us also remember the thousands massacred by Tito's  forces in the canyons; second, safeguards for the Italian  minority in Slovenia and Croatia, including the right to  bilingualism. These are rights recognized by the Council of  Europe and the Vienna Summit. The problems faced by the  Italians have become much more serious since the territory was  divided by the border between Slovenia and Croatia, which has  done away with one of the basic principles, that of ethnic  unity. We call on Slovenia and Croatia to treat the Italians as  we treat the German-speaking population of the Alto Adige region.    [Bianchessi] Francesco Rocchetta, under secretary for  foreign  affairs, is about to set off for Sarajevo. What do we intend to  do for Bosnia?    [Tremaglia] Rocchetta's trip will be a humanitarian mission,  as in Rwanda. But it is not enough. All the political  solutions have foundered by now. We must make our minds up to  go in with air strikes to neutralize the shelling positions on  the ground. This is the only way to enable the UN peacekeeping  forces to help get the true political solution under way.    [Bianchessi] How about a quick look at Africa?    [Tremaglia] Yes, there are two things here that need rapid  action. One concerns the northern African countries on the  Mediterranean seaboard: a European investment program to  provide work for 20 million North Africans in their own  countries. This will curb the flood of immigration, not for  racist motives, but for reasons of solidarity. We shall be  talking about this in Cagliari in a month's time. Secondly,  Somalia. It must absolutely not be allowed to end like this.  Pulling out was a mistake.    [Bianchessi] Do you think that we will have to send our  soldiers back there?    [Tremaglia] The peoples of the Horn of Africa are waiting  for  us. I have many contacts there who are telling me so all the  time. I propose another initiative, even a solely Italian  initiative, in Somalia, again under the aegis of the United  Nations, and provided, of course, that the Somalis ask us to go.  This time, it must really be a peace mission, bringing  humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and reconciliation, and not a  war operation. I believe that we can and must do it. We have a  century of friendship with the peoples there that we must honor.    [Bianchessi] And your battle on behalf of expatriate  Italians?    [Tremaglia] It continues. Indeed, I have called for the  European election to be declared null and void because tens of  thousands of our fellow countrymen have not received their  voting papers.</p>

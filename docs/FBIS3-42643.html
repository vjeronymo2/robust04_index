			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST columnist Yanina Sokolovskaya: "We </F> Are Reaching Our Boiling Point--Ukraine May Be Overwhelmed 18  January by an Unprecedented Strike"]    [Text] In a single instant, miners, dock workers, railroad  workers, machinists, textile workers, air traffic controllers,  and airline pilots flying foreign and domestic routes will cease  work, city transportation will come to a halt... This is the  decision made in a session of the executive committee of the  association Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The main demand of the  All-Ukraine strike is the resignation of the Cabinet of  Ministers and formation of a new government headed by Volodymyr  Lanovyy, who is supposed to obtain all possible authority over  the period prior to the elections and set about the conduct of  economic reform. Resignation of the president is not yet a  demand--in the opinion of the trade unions, "his task is not to  interfere."    Until such time as these demands are met, Ukraine will  constitute an appendage and will remain not only without coal,  but without means of transportation and communications with the  outside world as well. The scope of losses from such a strike of  indefinite duration would be difficult to predict.    But we know for certain that the epicenter of the impending  events will not be Donbass, but rather Kiev, where several  large-scale enterprises will be the first to go on strike.  Others will immediately follow--in all regions. In the opinion  of Free Trade Unions, the "higher authorities" will better feel  the impact of a strike begun in the capital than ordinary miners.    Lenin Forge and other industrial "monsters" in the capital  have already repeatedly declared their desire to take part.    "Ukraine is reaching its boiling point"--noted Aleksandr  Mril, leader of the Independent Trade Union of Miners. "Just one  more small upheaval and the country will not survive to election  time. If the trade unions do not today mount a strike, extremist  forces will take advantage of the disarray of the masses--a  situation fraught with the prospect of civil war."    But right now, independent trade union forces are looking at  a specific common enemy: "the existing authority, under which  people cannot live normally."    Meanwhile, even the obsolete Cabinet of Ministers has been  granted a stay of execution of the trade union sentence and been  given the opportunity to remain in their long-occupied seats, if  they bring salaries into conformance with price increases in the  course of a month and introduce a mechanism of anticipatory  compensation. This is mentioned in the decree of the executive  committee of Free Trade Unions which was distributed to the  Supreme Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president.    However, the workers do not believe that that which has  remained undone over two years can be realized over the course  of one month. Therefore, they are using the time remaining prior  to 18 January to coordinate strike activities. Talks have been  held with Volodymyr Lanovyy as well, whose candidacy for the  position of prime minister elicits no objection from the  population majority, it has become clear, or from most parties  and movements, which have long discussed the need for  professional economic leadership of the country. As the current  leader of the Center for Market Reforms stated, he "will agree  to accept the responsibility entrusted, taking into account the  adversity of the economic situation in the country," and will  take the first steps on a state level towards extricating the  country out of crisis and stabilizing the socioeconomic  situation.    In the opinion of the trade unions, this will prevent a  "witch hunt" from taking place in Ukraine and will give the  country a period of respite and the opportunity to survive until  the elections. But here we recall information not as yet refuted  by anyone: In the event of social conflicts in Ukraine, a state  of emergency will be introduced and the elections will be  postponed; a ban will be placed on political parties and  movements, and other measures of a military nature will be  enacted. A Ukraine-wide strike of indefinite duration more than  constitutes suitable cause for a "state of emergency."    "Social conflicts in January-February may be used by the  'higher authorities' as a pretext for introducing an  illegitimate regime and government and prolonging the authority  of the president. This will lead the country into a final  impasse," V. Lanovyy believes. "The impending crisis has to  yield positive results, for example--a revision of economic  policy and the reactionary law on elections."    But then, in the opinion of trade union leaders, the "higher  authorities" will be able only to proclaim a state of  emergency-- they will not have the power to implement it. And if  this does take place, people will just become further convinced  of the lengths to which their present leaders will go. And in  that case, the year 1994 in our country will be covered with the  banner of strike.</p>

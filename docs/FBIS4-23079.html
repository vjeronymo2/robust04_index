Nazarov, M.P. Nevolko S.B. Pichugin </F> (Moscow)]    [Abstract] A specialized subscriber access algorithm and  analytic relationships for calculating the capacity of a  satellite communication system (SCS) is proposed. Two  configurations of an SCS that implements the algorithm are  examined. The first configuration assumes the simplest message  stream generated by subscriber stations; the holding time is a  random variable with an arbitrary distribution function. In the  second configuration the message stream consists of simplest  streams with different intensities and a certain holding time  distribution. Both configurations are loss type queuing systems.  Analytic relationships for calculating the capacity of this SCS  are determined using the theory of queuing systems,  particularly, the body of Markovian line processes. It is  concluded that, all other things being equal, in order to  determine an SCS capacity it is sufficient to know the average  length of subscriber conflict notification and not to use the  distribution law. An SCS capacity is higher when message  switching is used. Figures 2, references 3.</p>

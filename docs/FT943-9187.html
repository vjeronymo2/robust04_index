			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C warns on progress of markets Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust warned yesterday that stock markets may have difficulty in making progress, partly because of the rapid expansion of the US economy. The UK's second largest investment trust after 3i reported a fall in net assets from 148p to 134.2p per share during the six months to June 30. However, net assets per share rose 9.6 per cent compared to June 1993's figure of 122.4p. The share price fell 10.9 per cent in the first half against a 13 per cent drop in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. The trust blamed fears of higher inflation and rising interest rates, particularly in the US, for the falls. Mr John Sclater, chairman, said: 'Concern about future inflation and higher interest rates is adversely affecting market sentiment. To a large degree this is based on fears that the US economy is expanding too rapidly.' However, Mr Michael Hart, chairman of F&amp;C Management, said that he did not rule out the possibility of the FT-SE 100 reaching 3,500 by the end of the year. The trust benefited from a 25 per cent rise in the Japanese index through its 13 per cent holding there, but it was weakened in falling markets elsewhere by its gearing, part of which was in yen. F&amp;C has traditionally followed a policy of borrowing to gear up in falling markets in order to buy cheap stocks. Mr Hart said that though the aim was to borrow in a weak currency, where the yen was concerned 'we got it wrong.' He believed, however, that the yen would weaken. After-tax revenue declined from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 9.31m due to a sharp fall in bond income. The expenses of running the trust's savings scheme, through which private investors can make regular contributions, have been rising fast, according to Mr Hart and the trust will be made more cost-effective. Details are to be announced in the autumn. Total net assets were Pounds 1.41bn, down from Pounds 1.56bn at the start of the year. Earnings per share dropped from an adjusted 1.13p to 0.88p. The interim dividend is 0.6p, against an equivalent 0.575p - the board's intention is to recommend a final of 1.23p, making a total of 1.83p - a 4 per cent increase. At the end of June, the trust's asset mix was UK - 43.6 per cent; North America - 21.1 per cent; Europe - 13.5 per cent; Japan - 13.4 per cent; Far East - 5.7 per cent and others - 2.7 per cent.</p>

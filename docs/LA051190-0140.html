			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIDEKICKS AGAIN TEST SOCKERS  </P> <P> One year later, the Sockers are back for another run through J.R. Ewing's town  and another run-in with the Dallas Sidekicks.  </P> <P> The Sockers continue their quest for an eighth indoor title when the MISL's  best-of-seven Western Division championship series begins tonight at 5:35 in  Reunion Arena.  </P> <P> The Sidekicks extended the Sockers to the limit in last season's playoffs  before midfielder Branko Segota sent a 30-footer that curved into the right  corner of the goal in Game 7 to give the Sockers a 1-0 victory and a trip to  the finals against Baltimore.  </P> <P> What's new with the Sidekicks? Well, they've improved.  </P> <P> If Socker Coach Ron Newman goes by the numbers, he has to figure his team is in  for trouble.  </P> <P> First of all, Dallas finished the regular season 31-21, six games ahead of the  Sockers (25-27). Forward Tatu led the MISL in points with 64 goals and 49  assists, defender Wes McCleod led in blocks with 154 and goalie Joe Papaleo had  the best goals-against average at 3.34.  </P> <P> Statistically, the Sockers fell well short. At the conclusion of the regular  season, Segota was the points leader with 27 goals and 34 assists, defender  George Fernandez led in blocks with 98 and goalies Zoltan Toth (3.48 GAA) and  Victor Nogueira (3.61 GAA) were both behind Papaleo.  </P> <P> About the only thing the Sidekicks didn't do was play consistently against the  Sockers, who won the series, 5-3. Dallas did pound them, 9-3, in the opener  Oct. 28. The Sockers were only potent with their words that night.  </P> <P> Said midfielder Waad Hirmez: "If they're going to peak in the first game of the  season, that's fine. We peak at the end."  </P> <P> Nice try, but Dallas was at a peak throughout the season, while the Sockers  peeked timidly at the standings to see how far behind they were.  </P> <P> What remains to be seen is if intangibles will help the Sockers. The reward the  Sidekicks received for winning the division was a 20-day vacation and  home-field advantage. A week ago, that looked awfully important, but after  winning just six of 26 games on the road during the regular season, the Sockers  went 2-0 in St. Louis in the first round.  </P> <P> The Sockers now have four tough games with St. Louis to their credit, and that  might work in their favor.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's the best situation (for the Sidekicks) to go into," Newman  said. "I know I wouldn't like it. If you're resting, you're getting your  players fit again. But the down side is you're not getting any competition.  We've got the best of both worlds. We've gained four competitive games without  any injuries."  </P> <P> Dallas is a young but experienced team that returned 15 of 18 players from last  season. The only real loss during the off-season was forward Michael King, who  departed to the Cleveland Crunch and then finished fourth in the league in  scoring with 45 goals and 26 assists.  </P> <P> It's hard to tell yet if the Sockers are better or worse than they were at this  point last season. Veteran forward Steve Zungul was at his best during the  playoffs in 1989 and provided the Sockers with an extra splash of experience.  Arthritic hips will prevent him from doing anything more than watching now.  </P> <P> The Sockers lost some offensive punch when forward Zoran Karic, who led the  Sockers in scoring during the regular season last year, was traded to Cleveland  for forward Paul Wright. What they gained was chemistry that has helped them  win 12 of 19 games since.  </P> <P> If Segota's game picks up and forwards Rod Castro and Damir Haramina continue  playing well, the Sockers figure to have an offense as potent as last year's.  </P> <P> There are two big questions:  </P> <P> Is Dallas good enough to send the Sockers home before the championship series  for only the second time in nine years? Or is Dallas good enough to be here but  not good enough to win?  </P> <P> Series Notes  </P> <P> Defender Cacho is still having problems with fluid on his left knee but will  play full shifts tonight. . . . Midfielder Ben Collins, who has been out since  March 31 with a right foot sprain, has been cleared to play for this series but  is not on the trip. . . . Midfielder Brian Quinn (two goals, seven assists) is  tied for the MISL playoff scoring lead with Kansas City forward Dale Mitchell,  who has six goals and three assists.  </P></p>

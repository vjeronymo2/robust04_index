			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (3): Roads over northern waters - Hugh Carnegy describes the scope of Europe's biggest bridge building programme Although Denmark is a small country, its scattered landmass of islands and the Jutland peninsula has always meant that any non-air journey between the main centres required at least one ferry crossing. By the end of the decade, however, that will have changed. Within the next four years a DKr20bn project to build a bridge and tunnel between the islands of Zeeland and Funen is set to be completed, providing for the first time a direct road and rail link between the capital Copenhagen and the country's other main centres such as Odense, Esbjerg, Arhus and Aalborg. When construction began in 1988 of the link across the 18km-wide Storebaelt, or Great Belt, channel, the then minister of transport, Mr H. P. Clausen, summed up its significance: 'We will have a completely new Denmark with the fixed link across Storebaelt. We shall no longer speak of east and west Denmark, but of Denmark as a whole. This project will be more significant to the population of Denmark and the business sector than any other traffic project has ever been.' But Storebaelt is only the first step in a series of huge bridge/tunnel projects planned by Denmark to transform its transport links both internally and to its neighbours. If outstanding political obstacles are overcome, construction will begin next year on the Oresund bridge linking Copenhagen to the Swedish city of Malmo. Discussions have also begun with Germany and Sweden on building a fixed link from the south eastern Danish island of Lolland, across the Femarn straits, to Germany. Once in place, the Oresund bridge will, in concert with Storebaelt, give Sweden a direct land link for the first time, not just to Denmark, but to Germany and the rest of continental Europe. This link would be made even quicker and more direct by a Femarn bridge. Denmark expects a significant boost to its economy from its own improved links and from increased through-trade from Sweden to Europe. Storebaelt has slipped about one year behind schedule chiefly because of problems encountered while tunnelling. But the rail link, which will run for most of the crossing in the tunnel, is due to open by 1996. The road link is scheduled to open a year later, running across a two-stage bridge including the world's longest single suspension bridge span of 1,624 metres. The DKr20bn cost has been raised by the state-owned Storebaelt company through international markets, backed by state guarantees. It will be paid for by a commitment from the state railways to pay DKr825m a year for 30 years to use the link and from vehicle tolls. Much greater controversy and uncertainty surrounds the Oresund link. Although the Danish and Swedish governments signed a treaty to build it in 1991, minority parties in the two governments currently in office have raised objections, delaying a final go-ahead for the project. The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the combined 16.8km road/rail tunnel and bridge link is due to invite construction tenders early next year. But, on the Swedish side, the Centre party, which holds the environment portfolio in the government, is continuing to object chiefly on environmental grounds, despite support for the project from the coalition leaders, the Moderate party, and the main opposition Social Democrats. In Denmark, the Radical Liberal party is objecting on the grounds that the cost of the project is unlikely to be met by the planned method of repayment. The budgeted cost of the link is DKr17bn, including DKr12bn for the tunnel and bridge, DKr3bn in land costs on the Danish side and DKr2bn on the Swedish side. The consortium concedes that these costs are likely to rise by up to DKr700m as a result of construction strictures demanded by Sweden's Water Rights Court this month to ensure the environmental impact of the bridge is minimised, particularly on the sensitive subject of impeding vital salt water flows into the already badly polluted Baltic. The pay back on the costs is scheduled to come from DKr300m a year shared by the Danish and Swedish state railways and the rest to be raised in vehicle tolls. But the project's backers have run into something of a Catch-22. Their financial plans rely on a rather modest estimate of 10,000 vehicle crossings per day. More vehicle crossings would raise the toll income, but the two governments are under pressure not to break international undertakings on exhaust emissions by allowing excessive traffic on the bridge. Mr Henning Hummelmose, the chief executive of the Oresund company, nevertheless believes the project will go ahead. 'I think we have reached the point of no return. I don't think that the environmental questions or the financial questions can stop the project. So much political prestige has been invested that it must go through.'</p>

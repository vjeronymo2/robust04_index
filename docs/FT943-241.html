			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Tec to be warned over payments South Thames Training and Enterprise Council is expected to be warned next week that it is in breach of its contract and that it must take urgent remedial action in its financial monitoring systems by the end of the year. The action is the first taken by the Department of Employment against any of the 82 Tecs which administer government training in England and Wales, although it is understood that the department is in discussion with others over similar problems. Tecs receive about Pounds 2bn in public funds to deliver programmes including Youth Training and Training for Work, a scheme for unemployed adults. The problem at South Thames concerns lack of adequate controls over payments to providers of training. There is understood to be no question of dishonesty involving anyone at the Tec. In August the Tec's finance director resigned after its non-executive board expressed concerns over accountancy matters. Mr Michael Hanson, the chief executive, who was admired for his vision of training and enterprise in the inner-city area, has also resigned. It is understood that the Tec's auditors are awaiting details of the breach notice before deciding whether to qualify its accounts. Tecs have had problems in accounting fully for the money they spend with the private and public-sector bodies with which they contract to provide training. Mr Tim Hoult, chairman of South Thames Tec, said yesterday: 'The breach notice is not a surprise to us. We have a remedial action plan and I am quietly confident that the action we are taking will result in the breach notice being lifted.'</p>

General Fabian Escalante, from the Interior Ministry, spoke  at the Union of Cuban Journalists' (UPEC) headquarters to  reporters from all media at the ceremony launching his book:  "Cuba: The CIA's Secret War," [Cuba: La Guerra Secreta de la CIA]    The event was part of a program organized by UPEC  celebrating  Cuban press day. The program will conclude on 14 March by  honoring the 26 March anniversary of state security  organizations.    The book discloses the background to a series of events that  took place starting with the triumph of the Revolution in 1959  and before the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961.    A long chain of conspiracies, assassination attempts against  Cuban President Fidel Castro and other revolutionary leaders,  the preparation of the previously mentioned Bay of Pigs  invasion, as well as other, lesser known events, are detailed by  the author. This has been based on declassified documents and  statements by participants and witnesses.    During his conversation with reporters, Escalante, who  joined  the Cuban Interior Ministry in 1960, made reference to CIA and  other U.S. Special Service efforts to obstruct the profound  Cuban political process, initially, and then later to destroy it.    A significant number of anecdotes on the struggle carried  out  by the nation's newly born security apparatus, in that early  period, to resist and beat Washington's plans were related at  the UPEC event.    At the conclusion of his presentation, Gen. Escalante  explained to PRENSA LATINA, in brief statements, that only  because of the massive participation of the Cuban people were  they able to win such an unequal confrontation.    If the people had not been on the side of the Revolution, he  added, this would not have been possible, taking into account  the enemy's enormous resources.    Escalante indicated that in his opinion, Cuba's true history  is the history written by the people in their daily struggle and  in the defense of a nation faced with foreign aggression.</p>

The experts agree that the present 7-meter-deep waterway at  the river mouth has greatly restricted the economic growth of  Shanghai, the Chang Jiang River delta and the Chang Jiang River  Valley. Therefore, an upgrading project has become an imminent  task.    According to the study, a 12.5-meter-deep waterway will be  developed. In six years, 50,000-ton vessels will be able to go  freely into and out of the Chang Jiang River, whereas at  present, the river mouth is accessible only to 20,000-ton  vessels.    The upgrading program will help Shanghai play a pivotal role  in international container transport and on the other hand  promote the economic growth of Shanghai and the whole Chang  Jiang River Delta, experts say.    The study was conducted chiefly by the Shanghai Waterway  Bureau and the Nanjing Hydraulic Design Institute.</p>

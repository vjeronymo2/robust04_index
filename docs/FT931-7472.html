			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals falls 8% and calls for Pounds 24.3m YORKSHIRE Chemicals, the dyes and specialist materials group, is to raise Pounds 24.3m through a 1-for-5 rights issue at 330p, in order to fund its capital expenditure programme over the next two years. The rights issue was priced at a 17.5 per cent discount to the 401p price prevailing before yesterday's announcement. Yorkshire's shares closed down 1p. The proceeds will strengthen the group's balance sheet and will prevent gearing from doubling to about 40 per cent as it might have done. Reporting an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 11m to Pounds 10.1m in the year to December, the company said demand remained strong and constraints on production capacity had led the group to contract out production to an increasing extent. The company said it had grown rapidly largely through organic growth but that it was engaged on a significant investment programme to support continued expansion. The board expected to spend about Pounds 16m this year and the balance of the rights proceeds next year which would substantially increase production capacity. The pre-tax result was struck on turnover up 5.6 per cent at Pounds 98m (Pounds 92.8m). Operating profits declined to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 12.1m) while net interest charges increased from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.41m. Earnings per share fell from 20p to 18.4p and the board is recommending a final dividend of 5.15p, making a total of 7.65p (7.25p) for the year. The new shares will not be eligible for the final divi-dend. The fall in profits was well-flagged. Mr Philip Lowe, chairman, said sales and margins had continued to be affected by deteriorating world trading conditions in 1992 and were also hit by the weakness of the US and Australian dollars. The rights issue is fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. COMMENT Whatever the virtues to raising cash to strengthen the balance sheet one has to wonder why yesterday's rights issue was quite so deeply discounted. By opting for expansion with equity rather than debt, Yorkshire has clearly opted for the most conservative route. But one wonders whether the company's advisers have really earned their underwriting fee at this price. Another consequence of the issue is that shareholders will be rather more heavily diluted than they might have needed to be. As a result, the shares are unlikely to continue their recent strong performance. After taking into account the right issue proceeds, pre-tax profits are likely to rise to Pounds 14.3m this year, giving 22.3p of earnings and a prospective multiple that now looks fairly full at nearly 18 times.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Art on the Tube: New York painter Marilyn Minter has taken to the airwaves to  advertise her artworks with MTV-style commercials seen on late-night shows like  "Late Night With David Letterman" and "Nightline" and "The Arsenio Hall Show."  </P> <P> The ads, seen in the New York area only, are hawking her "100 Food Porn"  exhibit at a Manhattan gallery which opened Thursday. The paintings sell for  $3,500 each. And the cost of producing and airing six television ads is  $16,500. Minter says the price tag is less than a splashy ad in an art  magazine.

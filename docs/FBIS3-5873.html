They reaffirmed the growing importance of the Japan-U.S.  alliance in the meeting that temporarily set aside their  continuing disputes on trade.    In the first bilateral "two-plus-two" meeting of foreign and  defense ministers, held at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  official residence, they affirmed that the alliance "has grown  stronger and has increased in importance in the post-Cold War  period," a joint statement by the bilateral security  consultative committee said.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency chief Kazuo  Aichi represented Japan and the U.S. side was headed by  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, along with Undersecretary  of Defense Frank Wisner on behalf of new Defense Secretary  William Perry.    Hata said there was "frank" discussion of security issues in  the post-Cold War era in a good atmosphere and the two sides  agreed to hold such meetings regularly in the future.    Japanese and U.S. participants shared the view that the  meeting was "meaningful," according to Foreign Ministry  officials.    Tokyo and Washington originally agreed on the ministerial  "two-plus-two" security meeting in December 1990, but had been  unable to hold it before now due to the difficulty of getting  all four ministers together.    Christopher told the meeting that relations with Japan are  especially important in Washington's Asia policy, saying  bilateral security ties are important for the peace and  stability of the Asia-Pacific region.    The two countries should not forget the importance of the  bilateral security arrangements, officials quoted him as saying.    The U.S. reiterated its commitment to maintaining a strong  military presence in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region and  thanked Japan for its host nation support and providing  facilities.    The two sides agreed to start consultations on continuation  of an agreement on host-nation support, due to expire in two  years.    Wisner said the U.S. is studying issues involving strategic  nuclear weapons and may make an interim report as early as this  summer. Washington will also make clear its position on the  U.S. presence in Asia within a few months, he said.    Regarding U.S. forces stationed in Japan, both sides pledged  to continue efforts to consolidate and realign facilities and  areas, particularly in Okinawa, consistent with the purposes of  the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and U.S. operation requirements.    They also agreed on the importance of boosting exchanges of  defense technology.    The security talks coincided with the arrival of the  91,487-ton U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier Carl Vinson at the U.S.  Naval Base at Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of  Tokyo.    On international affairs, they reaffirmed that a diplomatic  solution is the best way of resolving the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development program, the officials  said.    Christopher said that if there is progress in diplomatic  efforts such as dialogues between Pyongyang and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and with South Korea,  there could be a resumption of talks between the U.S. and North  Korea on March 21.    He called for close consultations among the U.S., Japan,  South Korea and China, in case such diplomatic efforts fail and  the problem is brought to the United Nations Security Council,  they said.    Hata replied that in such a case Japan would take  responsible  actions while keeping close contacts with Washington and Seoul.    Aichi echoed Hosokawa's remarks in the Diet that Japan will  take responsible actions within the constitution.    The two sides also endorsed efforts to enhance regional  political and security dialogues and welcomed the convening of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional  forum.</p>

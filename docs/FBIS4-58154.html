			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, who is in Tehran at the head of a  delegation, was received today by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    According to a report by our correspondent, during the  meeting the Bosnian deputy prime minister described the struggle  of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Serbian  aggressors as a struggle for safeguarding the Islamic  aspirations of the whole world. Thanking the humanitarian  support by the Iranian Government and people for the tyrannized  people of Bosnia, he said: Iran is among the greatest friends  and supporters of the people of Bosnia which, side by side,  through its political and diplomatic efforts, continues that  support in a practical way through humanitarian assistance.    The Bosnian deputy prime minister added: At the moment our  nation pays the price for adhering to religious principles and  its love of freedom. Speaking about the latest situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said: The Serbian aggressors are  preparing themselves for another attack against the free areas  in Bosnia so that by occupying more land in that area push our  people to areas where there are no facilities for living.  Continuing, the Bosnian deputy prime minister pointed out:  Through reliance on God and through the efforts of the military  forces, our honorable people, and the all- round political  support by freedom loving states in the world we will thwart the  enemies in achieving their ominous objectives.    According to the report, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani,  praising the brave defense of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina  in the face of the aggressors, said: The patience, endurance,  jihad, and the oppression of Bosnian Muslims will be registered  in the history of that country as an honorable example and  juncture. [passage omitted comparing the current situation in  Bosnia with others in history]    Hashemi-Rafsanjani also stressed the need for increasing  international efforts by Islamic states in order to prevent the  annihilation of the Bosnian nation.</p>

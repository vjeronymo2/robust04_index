			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (16): The cutting edge  -Case Study / Bomford Turner / Paul Cheeseright charts a productivity drive IN Bomford Turner's yard the stack of stillages is going higher and wider. Pat's mountain, it is called: a pile of metal cages mounted on pallets. The stillages used to ferry material and parts around the factory. Now they are no longer wanted. Pat's mountain, named after Mr Pat McLaughlin, the company's manufacturing director, shows how the manufacturing system at this factory of grass- and scrub-cutting equipment has been simplified and speeded up in the search for higher productivity. It is a common tale. UK engineering companies have since the 1980s recession been in the throes of profound change and the process has speeded with the recession of the 1990s. Most of the changes in the manufacturing process at Bomford Turner occurred last year, so the full effects are not yet apparent. What is clear is that its plant, set appropriately enough for a company making grass-cutting equipment near Evesham, Worcestershire, is very different from the plant of 1990. That year, Mr Andrew Hall became managing director. 'The company had lived off the past and like a lot of engineering companies it didn't really develop,' he says. In the trade, says Mr Hall, Bomford Turner had a decent reputation. It had a parent - it is part of the Elswick group - ready to invest. But there was a downside. The business lacked focus and it was operating in a declining market. Its main customers were in agriculture and the public sector, both subject to financial pressure. Survival and future prosperity depended on winning a larger share of a shrinking market. That forced the new management to reorganise the business and expand the product range. The product range had the first attention. It was decided to concentrate on the UK, French and US markets. Customers were making it clear that they wanted delivery at their convenience, not that of Bomford Turner which had met orders out of stock or, if that was not possible, offered delivery times of 10 weeks. New products were out on the market, resulting in an immediate increase in French sales and the return to profit of the group's plants in the US. New flexibility towards customers became apparent. Like many other UK groups, Bomford Turner was rediscovering the notion of service. But flexibility to meet sudden and changing demands could not be obtained from a manufacturing system which relied on making equipment in batches and holding heavy stocks of work in progress. Nor, financially, could the company tolerate the high level of stocks it was obliged to hold. 'The objective was to find a way to reduce the lead time from 10 weeks to five days for volume products,' says Mr Hall. 'It was brought about not with investment in new plant, but with detailed attention being paid to improving the effectiveness of the existing resources of both plant and people,' recalls Mr Paul Simon, a consultant on the project. The chosen technique was not new. It was to establish manufacturing cells concentrating on processes or products, each with a team of machine operators. The effect was to shorten the chain of production, thus reducing the material and parts held in the plant at any particular time. Inventory has been halved by about Pounds 2m and sales per employee have increased by 25 per cent. But, like other companies seeking higher productivity, the payroll has been cut. In 2 1/2 years, the number employed has fallen to 190 from 300. 'Most of the redundancies have come from the overhead base. People who used to move materials around are not there because the material is not there,' says Mr Hall. The change in working methods was accompanied by changes in working conditions, at least partly to reflect the uneven production flows: demand for grass-cutting equipment is greatest when the grass is growing. Bomford Turner introduced annual hours - that is employees are contracted to work a given number of hours a year but on a flexible basis so that they receive a constant weekly wage regardless of the hours worked in a particular week. Overtime was suppressed. Terms and conditions of employment are uniform throughout the company; only the method of payment varies. For Mr Hall the past two years have shown that 'the major lesson in the management of change is the handling of people - that is the key.' Deciding where to place machines and the physical changes on the factory floor are easy by comparison, simple textbook stuff. Just as in the automotive and aerospace industries, Bomford Turner is now urging change on its suppliers: if its own production is to be flexible, then the production and deliveries of the suppliers have to be more closely attuned. 'The suppliers are a harder nut to crack,' confesses Mr Hall.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Tories rapped by Halifax chief The chief executive of Halifax building society yesterday attacked the government's housing policy and called for new forms of subsidy to promote choice. In a speech that contrasted Tory commitment to choice with the absence of policies likely to achieve this in housing, Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief, argued there was a need for a better-targeted subsidy for owner-occupation; more support for the private rented sector; and a mix of subsidies for people on lower incomes. He said support for people on lower incomes should be available both to those buying and renting. Addressing the annual Building Society Association conference in Birmingham, Mr Blackburn said the government should not reduce mortgage tax relief any further unless it was replaced with a subsidy that was more closely directed to particular needs. He cited the example of other countries that targeted tax relief by making it available for a limited time only, or to families with children. It was not satisfactory for the government to try to create a level playing field by withdrawing all subsidies. 'It may have a certain simplicity and rightwing intellectual appeal, but it is not a way of managing housing policy in an advanced country - in many ways it is an abdication by government of its responsibilities for housing policy,' said Mr Blackburn. The kickstart needed to assist the private rented sector could be directed either at encouraging the small landlord or promoting investment by institutional funds through some form of tax-free investment trust. He also criticised cuts made in the housing association grant and the apparent short-term approach of government policymaking. Mr Blackburn's approach was backed by Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the second-largest society. Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the housing charity, also attacked the government for its 'irresponsible policy' of promoting home ownership across all classes, and called for changes in the tax and benefit systems.</p>

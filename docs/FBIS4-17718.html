			<p>BFN     [Text] Tajik opposition forces are readying for an attack  on the Ishkashimski border guard unit in Gorni Badakhshan.    According to military sources, the opposition forces are  planning to disrupt efforts to defend the Tajikistan-Afghanistan  border and to capture Army hardware and ammunition for their  further use against Dushanbe Government troops.    The opposition buildup of up to 1,500 men is seen as a sign  of preparations for the attack. Reconnaissance missions are  being carried out to try to familiarize with the strength and  technical capabilities as well as daily routine of the border  guard units, and the system of fortifications under their  control.    Both the command of the Russian border guards in Tajikistan  and the unit's commanders are taking actions to be ready to  rebuff possible attacks and insure the safety of their units.</p>

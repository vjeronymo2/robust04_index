			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza just ahead of forecast with Pounds 3.2m Canadian Pizza, the recently-floated pizza and pizza crust maker, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.2m for 1993, marginally ahead of its prospectus forecast. Sales were constrained during the second half as the Salford manufacturing plant reached full capacity, but a Pounds 1.2m upgrade has now been completed, adding 20 per cent capacity. Turnover increased by 17.6 per cent to Pounds 17.9m during 1993, and operating profit margins were maintained, in spite of continued pricing pressure in its main business, the sale of pizza crusts to retailers. Retail sales grew by 20 per cent, accounting for 54 per cent of turnover and 38 per cent of profits. The other significant area of growth was export sales, which grew by 9 per cent to Pounds 4.7m, primarily on sales to continental Europe. The company is looking at sites for a manufacturing operation in continental Europe. This is likely to be built in France, involving a maximum investment of Pounds 10m. Construction should start in 1995. It is also looking to expand sales to the Pacific Rim. The company raised Pounds 15m from its November flotation in November, which paid off senior debt and preference shares, leaving the company ungeared. It said it would not call on shareholders to fund any expansion plans. Earnings per share amounted to 12.9p, and a final dividend of 3.6p is proposed, in line with its prospectus forecast.</p>

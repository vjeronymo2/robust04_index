However, CPC leaders cannot  prepare for their New Year holidays with ease. They are  immersed in coping with various changes brought about by the  reform measures which came into force on 1 January, including  problems in the new taxation system, the agricultural issue, and  the price issue. At present, the most pressing problem lies in  agriculture.    Recently, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also in charge of  agriculture, stressed the need to ensure peasants' livelihood  while stabilizing grain prices in order to prevent trouble among  them. The serious attention of the authorities reflects the  worrisome situation in the countryside. However, the  authorities did not make public the real situation in the  countryside.    According to reliable official sources, in 1993 the areas  sown with major crops decreased by the largest margin in the  last few years. In particular, the area sown with wheat, rice,  and corn decreased by 2.64 million hectares. Although it is  expected that the gross grain output remained at the same level,  if the factor of population growth is also considered, then the  per capita grain output decreased. In addition, the area sown  with cotton decreased by 1.38 million hectares and the cotton  output decreased by about 10 million dan. The area sown with  oil-bearing crops decreased by 420,000 hectares and the output  also decreased by about 30 percent.    This inevitably led to a decline in peasants' income and  brought about instability in the countryside. In addition, this  also caused a sharp increase in grain prices. The central  authorities are deeply worried about this situation. They think  that grain prices will increase by at least 10 percent in 1994.  China always has to import wheat to meet domestic needs, and  the wheat import in 1994 will have to increase. Moreover, as  the central government has changed the allocation system into  the agent system for imported grain, with import subsidies being  terminated, plus the unification of the foreign exchange system,  it is expected that the wheat price will inevitably increase  substantially. On the other hand, as the international corn and  soya bean prices are increasing, exports will grow. However,  rice output decreased by a big margin. In some localities it  was difficult to purchase rice from peasants. Some localities  even dispatched military troops for forced grain purchases.    Another fact that the authorities did not tell the public  was  that China's current area sown with grain crops has decreased to  the warning level, or even below it. The Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery recently delivered a report  to the central authorities saying that the area of farmland sown  with grain crops in China must be kept at a level higher than  1.65 billion mu. However, the area of farmland for growing grain  crops decreased sharply in the last two years. In 1992, it  decreased by 24 million mu to 1.66 billion mu, and in 1993 it  further decreased to 1.62 billion mu, which was lower than the  warning level.    As peasants are uneasy and found it hard to maintain their  livelihood, the tide of migrant laborers has appeared earlier  than in previous years. Peasants in poor areas have begun to  pour into cities, but they did this after Chinese New Year in  previous years. According to the official information, as early  as last November four or five streams of migrant laborers  gradually took form in the country, and they separately flowed  to Guangdong, Beijing-Tianjin, Shanghai, Harbin, and cities  along the Chang Jiang. It is expected that the number of  migrant laborers will exceed 50 million people, and those from  Sichuan alone will be nearly 10 million people. The spread of  the "Sichuan troops" all over the country indeed worries the  authorities.    The authorities can only adopt two countermeasures. First,  opening the state granaries to keep the grain prices stable.  Normally, the Chinese Government stores grain for the nation's  consumption in six months, so there is sufficient grain in  stock. It is not difficult to tide over the demand peak period  around the Chinese New Year. However, China will have to  quicken grain imports in the following months of this year.  Another measure is to print more bank notes to purchase grain  from peasants. In October 1993 the amount of newly printed bank  notes exceeded the major mark of 100 billion yuan. As the State  Council was determined to solve the IOU problem, it allocated 30  billion yuan to local governments. However, the local  governments said that the funds were still insufficient and  required the central authorities to increase the allocations.  Finally, the central authorities could not but allocate another  50 billion yuan to ensure that the first 30 billion yuan could  be delivered to the hands of peasants. It seemed that while the  IOU problem was resolved or mitigated, fuel would have been  added to inflation.    All such unstable factors forced the central authorities to  seek various countermeasures. The pressure on Zhu Rongji, who  is also in charge of agriculture, was even greater. Recently it  was rumored that his status might have become worrisome (for  example, the "macrocontrol" for which he bears the main  responsibility has quietly come to an end), and the outside  world is now wondering if he is in a predicament. However,  informed sources said that Zhu Rongji's position was still  rather firm and had not been shaken or changed. Although he may  withdraw from the office of governor of the People's Bank of  China (and may be succeeded by Dai Xianglong, currently first  vice governor of the bank), this is in fact an arrangement made  long ago. When Zhu Rongji took the banks' governorship, it was  known among the insiders that this was only a transitional step,  because the situation at that time required Zhu's authority for  adopting some urgent and stern measures.    In addition, Zhu Rongji continued to take charge of the  economic work without change. Although Li Peng frequently  appeared on public occasions in the last few months, Zhu Rongji  was still one of the principal officials deciding the economic  reform policies in 1994. Otherwise, he would not have said that  macrocontrol was not contradictory to Deng Xiaoping's idea about  accelerating development. The economic officials also gave  tacit consent to the option of alternately tightening and  loosening control, because the disorder would appear if control  is too loose and the economy would be stifled if control is too  tight. However, such policy was different from the previous  retrenchment policy. Instead, it was just a means of more  flexibly alternating "tight control" and "loose control."    Another issue that is now worrying the central authorities  is  the confusion in people's minds and the tendency to independent  administration among the local authorities. Therefore, in the  activities of commemorating the 100th anniversary of Mao  Zedong's birth last month, the authorities again stressed the  values advocated by Mao. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, negating  Mao is equal to negating the party, so they must adhere to this  even if the sky is falling down. However, at the same time  there was a "criticizing-Mao campaign," which was not officially  called this. That was the large-scale study of Volume 3 of Deng  Xiaoping's works promoted by the authorities.    In fact, in the study of Volume 3 of Deng's works, the  authorities concerned relayed Deng Xiaoping's recent  instructions on foreign, economic, and political affairs. Deng  stressed that China has entered the era of peaceful  construction, so there should be no life-and-death struggle  between China and the international community. Instead, it is  an era of interdependence. China's economic construction has  included a variety of operation forms and management systems,  and is no longer in a "large monolithic mode." To put it more  plainly, China now needs to replace Mao's theories about "taking  class struggle as the key link," about "preparing against the  unavoidable world war," and about the planned economy, with  Deng's ideas that "keeping stability is an overwhelming task"  and his theory about "building socialism with Chinese  characteristics."    Therefore, the current activities of "praising Mao" only  served the purpose of consolidating the legitimacy of the CPC's  rule, and the criticism of Mao also served the same purpose,  that is, consolidating the CPC's ruling position through  correcting Mao's mistakes.</p>

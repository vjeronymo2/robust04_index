			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canon bid for Rentsch fuels Swiss takeover row CANON has become the latest bidder to take advantage of the absence of effective Swiss takeover regulations. The large Japanese office equipment group has agreed to purchase the controlling 50.7 per cent stake in Walter Rentsch, a quoted Swiss office equipment distributor and retailer, from Mr Hubert Looser. Terms have not yet been finalised. However, no offer is being made to minority shareholders. This is the fourth such case in three years of minority shareholders of Swiss companies being ignored or offered inferior terms in takeover bids. The others were the Philip Morris takeover of confectionery group Jacobs Suchard in 1990; the purchase by Mr August von Fink in 1992 of the controlling stake in the hotel group Movenpick; and the takeover of the controlling holding in Kardex last year by Industrieholding Cham. Each case has provoked criticism in Swiss stock market circles, and new legislation to eliminate discrimination against minority shareholders is being considered. Mr H. J. Scheffer, manager of EC affairs for Canon Europe in Amsterdam, said the company's move was 'in line with Swiss practice'. One analyst suggested a possible conflict of interest in that Canon products accounted for up to 70 per cent of Rentsch sales. The Japanese group might in the future arrange transfer pricing of its products to the detriment of the Swiss company's profits, he said.</p>

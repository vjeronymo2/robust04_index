			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Piech says VW is too fat VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume carmaker, is a duck which has grown too fat to fly, according to chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech. But it has sprouted a new feather - a DM12m (Pounds 4.8m) group profit in July - and more are growing all the time, he said yesterday. All the profit, compared with a DM1.6bn loss in the first half of the year, stemmed from improvements at the German parent company, where Mr Piech and his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, have focused much effort. The workforce had responded with stunning enthusiasm to the implementation of a refined continuous improvement programme, Mr Piech said. Productivity targets for this year in German plants had been achieved in only six months. 'I was faced with having to move a two-tonne rock. It was impossible but I got so much help that now it is rolling and gathering momentum like a flywheel,' he claimed. The workforce had promised to deliver quality in the VW range by next year comparable with that of the Toyota Lexus luxury car. But Seat, the Spanish subsidiary, remains firmly grounded, and is one of the main causes of Mr Piech's recent retreat from confident forecasts of the group breaking even this year. He limited his forecasts to a promise that the parent company, which earned a net DM447m last year, would show a profit for 1993. Audi, VW's luxury car division, is also in less publicised difficulties. Output is down 34 per cent this year, according to Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman. 'At the end of the year we shall be able to break even only if we do not lose any more sales,' he said. World sales had fallen 26 per cent, and Britain was the only market to register an increase. Deliveries to customers were up 26 per cent - compared with an overall rise in car sales of 9 per cent - to 17,000 in the first eight months.</p>

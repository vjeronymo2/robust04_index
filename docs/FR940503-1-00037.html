			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's experience has been that the great majority of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative penalty actions conclude by a settlement. Part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicitly provides settlement procedures and, unlike part 22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would allow field citation cases to settle by the simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement of the parties in a consent order or, if the Respondent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses, by the Respondent's payment of the amount requested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency in the field citation itself (or in any superseding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pleading). Under part 28, a settlement may be reached at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, even before the deadline for a response has passed. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases of settlement, there is no further administrative review,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Respondent waives its rights to appeal the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty to the appropriate federal court. Pursuant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language of the CAA, consent orders under the Part 28 field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation program would allow for the compromise, modification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remission by the Agency, with or without conditions, of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty requested in the administrative complaint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 28 would be revised such that failure of the Respondent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to affirmatively request a hearing in the response would lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of the penalty proposed in the field citation. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 113(d)(3) of the Act, the penalty assessed by the field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation becomes final if the Respondent fails to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing within the time required by the implementing regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 28 would also be revised to require Agency counsel to file a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written explanation for the penalty imposed by the field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no later than five days following a Respondent's default by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to request a hearing. This would ensure an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative record for the penalty imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon the request of a party, or on his own initiative, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer may make a summary adjudication of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegations, without further proceedings, whenever he finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are no material facts in dispute and that a party is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In the same manner, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer may accelerate the transmittal of his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended decision to the Regional Administrator if there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling need for additional fact-finding on remedy issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Either party may request a summary determination or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accelerated recommended decision at any time after service of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response, up until thirty days before the time set for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, the Presiding Officer may summarily determine any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the allegations after the time for the exchange of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has run, and after he has examined the entire administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record. The Presiding Officer may accelerate the transmittal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recommended decision, upon finding liability in a summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination or upon stipulation as to liability by the parties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if there is no need for further fact-finding as to remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reaching a recommended decision, the Presiding Officer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to consider the statutory penalty assessment criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in section 113(e) of the Act. These criteria include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size of the business; the economic impact of the penalty on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business; the Respondent's full compliance history; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's good faith efforts to comply; the duration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation as established by any credible evidence; payment by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent of penalties previously assessed for the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation; the economic benefit of noncompliance; the seriousness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the violation; and such other factors as justice may require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Respondent is afforded the opportunity to provide evidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relevant statutory criteria, including evidence concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the duration of the violation. Part 28 would be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate these statutory penalty assessment criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other than by a motion for summary determination or by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motion for an accelerated recommended decision, a field citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be settled preliminarily by a consent order. The consent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order includes a penalty settlement which has the force and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of a final order issued by the Regional Administrator,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except that the consent order is not appealable. Part 28 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be revised to provide that, consistent with the authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 113(d)(2)(B), the consent order may be issued with or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 28 establishes deadlines to ensure that administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases do not languish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than thirty days following the Respondent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response, the Presiding Officer is required to hold a prehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference at which the parties meet to consider matters which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may expedite the disposition of the proceedings. The Presiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer also sets the time and place for further proceedings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules an information exchange during the prehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference, if one is requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authority to require discovery is limited to exchange of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain information. The required information that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchanged is limited to: (1) Documents intended to be introduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the proceedings under Part 28 that have not already been filed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Hearing Clerk; (2) witness lists, qualifications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expert witnesses and the subject matter of intended witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testimony; and (3) information known to the Respondent relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Respondent's inability to pay a civil penalty or relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any economic advantage accruing to the Respondent as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of his alleged violations of law. Part 28 would be revised to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand this last category, by allowing the Agency to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's good faith efforts to comply with the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act requirements. Other forms of discovery, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interrogatories and the taking of depositions, are not permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless stipulated to by the parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for supplemental materials, the information exchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must conclude no later than sixty days following the prehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference. Since new information concerning witnesses or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents may develop after an information response deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passes, the parties may supplement the original information, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not later than seven days prior to the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A corrosion test of increased rigor for reflectors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaceable lens headlamps would remove much of the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern about relensing lamps that have become contaminated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dust and moisture. The agency is proposing a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental test for reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which it believes is consistent with Ford's recommendations while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing minimum testing burdens. NHTSA is proposing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional salt spray test with the following features for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaceable lens headlamps: (a) A 24 hour exposure to salt spray  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the lens removed, (b) a 48 hour drying period, (c) cleaning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reflector according to instructions to be furnished with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement lenses and included in the owner's manual, (d) a non-magnified examination for corrosion, and (e) a photometric test of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the headlamp as reassembled with a new lens. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed reflector test mimics the existing test of headlamps with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenses but with a much reduced duration since reflector exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in service would not be continuous. However, it makes use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected salt deposit formation to test the durability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflector coating to cleaning. Finally, it would require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer of a headlamp with a replaceable lens to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> photometric compliance of the reassembled cleansed lamp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford recommended three distinct tests of headlamp reflector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to salt-fog, moisture, and dust, while the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes a single test. Comment from parties familiar with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflector construction and exposure testing is sought. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following questions are of particular interest:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A cracked lens frequently causes a headlamp to partially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fill with water. Is the moisture and exposure time involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ASTM B 117&hyph;73 salt spray test sufficient to test moisture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance of reflectors? If not, what test would be sufficient?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The present dust test for replaceable bulb headlamps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses Portland cement as dust, and the agency presumes that Ford's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment refers to the same kind of dust test. Cleaning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflector after Portland cement dust exposure may be equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a rigorous abrasion test. The agency believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed salt-spay test will coat the headlamp reflector with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salt deposits and that the subsequent cleaning will provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate abrasion test. However, does a 24-hour salt spray test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit enough salt to act as a de facto abrasion test? Should a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular method of salt removal be required or should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers' cleaning instructions dictate the test procedure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as proposed? Is a Portland cement dust test as well as a salt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spray test of reflectors needed, and if so, why? Should a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abrasion test be used rather than the indirect abrasion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning, and if so, what procedure would be appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is the proposed 24-hour salt spray test followed by 48  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours drying time sufficient to test the headlamp reflectors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the metal light shields sometimes used? What corrosion criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are appropriate for light shields? Can rusty water dripping from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metal light shields eventually cause otherwise durable headlamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflectors to fail because of stains?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The present standard for replaceable bulb headlamps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposes lamp assemblies with the bulb removed (but the lens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attached) for eight hours to humid salty air in a salt spray  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chamber with the salt spray turned off. Is this present test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (followed by a photometric test and whatever cleaning is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary) sufficient to qualify headlamp reflectors for use with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaceable lenses without the proposed direct salt spray test or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the moisture, dust and salt spray tests recommended by Ford?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing Standard No. 108 also includes a chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance test of the exterior of the lamp to fuel, tar remover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power steering fluid and antifreeze. NHTSA has tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the test should be extended to headlamp reflectors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using chemicals suggested by the manufacturer in the cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions or with a realistic probability of use by vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners despite the manufacturer's instructions. Chemicals in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latter category would include tar remover, lacquer thinner and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral spirits. The manufacturer's instructions may concentrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on water soluble contaminants because of the salt spray test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inclusion of the other chemicals gives the owner a means to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove organic contaminants without resorting to abrasion. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral spirits is a major constituent of tar remover, a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test for mineral spirits appears unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The plastic lenses on replaceable bulb headlamps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured for use in the United States are given a hard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective coating that would be expected to exceed the reflector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coating requirements established by the proposed tests. NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects that similar coating methods could be used to create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> robust reflectors for replaceable lens headlamps. It would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable to expect successful lens replacement by vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners, especially if the lens attachments were designed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible without disturbing the headlamp aim. The requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for headlamp reflector durability also reduces concern about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> untrained persons installing the lens seal. Should an owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> install the seal incorrectly, causing moisture to collect inside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lamp, the reflector will not degrade quickly. The visible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moisture would serve as a telltale, and an owner motivated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace the lens initially would be motivated to disassemble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean and reinstall the lens until the desired repair was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful. If manufacturers choose to design headlamps for ease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and economy of lens replacement by owners, the prospect of better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lamp maintenance in non-inspection States is realistic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Benefits to the Consumer of Replaceable Lenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

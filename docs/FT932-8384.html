			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Bank's report THE GOOD news is that the Bank of England's best estimate of underlying inflation over the next 18 months is 3-4 per cent. The bad news is that people do not believe the government will meet its 1-4 per cent target for inflation in the long run. The worry is that the costs attendant upon convincing people they are wrong will so frighten the government that the sceptics will be proved right. The Bank of England's latest report on inflation derives estimates of expected inflation for between two and 25 years from now. Expected annual inflation, it shows, rises from 4 per cent two years hence to more than 6 per cent 8 years from now, before declining to 5 1/4 per cent. At no point is annual inflation expected to fall within the target range. These results ought to make the chancellor weep. But it is not difficult to see why people are so sceptical. Past performance is one good reason. Another is the evident temptation. The ratio of net public sector debt to gross domestic product is expected to jump from 33 1/2 per cent in 1992-93 to 49 3/4 per cent in 1997-98. Such a rapid rise will itself increase the incentive to inflate, especially when the long-term real rate of interest on conventional gilts would be double the economy's trend rate of growth, should the government's inflation target be achieved. The rise in indebtedness occurs despite the higher taxes announced for future years in this year's Budget. But it may be doubted whether a weak government will introduce these increases, never mind the further increases that may be needed. The most important reason, however, for questioning the government's commitment is that achievement of its target may prove inconsistent with steady economic growth and declining unemployment. 'Looking to the end of 1994 and beyond,' notes the report, 'the principal uncertainty concerns the response of domestic factor costs - wages and profits - to the loss of purchasing power resulting from depreciation of the currency.' The long-term future for wages, both nominal and real, is the principal doubt. If nominal wage growth were too high, the target for inflation would either not be met or it would be met at the expense of a renewed squeeze on profits, employment and growth. If real wage growth were to be too high, inflation might be low, but growth would fail to reduce unemployment by any large amount. Either way the government might panic and try to go for growth, whatever the risks for inflation. It is not good enough for the government to be determined to achieve its target. It must convince others it is determined. Otherwise, the costs of the achievement could prove excessive and the achievement itself correspondingly less plausible. Sensible policymakers would be exploring every possible means, including independence for the Bank of England, to obtain the credibility that still eludes them.</p>

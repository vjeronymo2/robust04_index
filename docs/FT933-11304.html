			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Solicitors' fund pays out Pounds 15m ALMOST half of the 17,000 complaints received last year by the Solicitors Complaints Bureau concerned default and dishonesty. Mrs Veronica Lowe, director, said there had been 'a staggering 65 per cent increase in the number of applications to the compensation fund, with a record pay-out of almost Pounds 15m'. The bureau intervened in 70 practices last year to close them down, a 42 per cent increase on 1991.</p>

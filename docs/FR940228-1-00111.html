			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.23&blank;Audits, Records, and Examinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes provisions dealing with third-party servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat the discussion of those provisions here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to extend the requirements of this section to foreign institutions as that term would be defined in 34 CFR 600.52 of the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). Participating institutions, like institutions in the United States, would accordingly be required to have compliance audits performed, be subject to program reviews and other investigations, and maintain records under the provisions of this section. The Secretary believes these steps provide the best means for evaluating a foreign institution's compliance with the requirements for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations as may be necessary to provide for a compliance audit of an institution with regard to any funds received under the Title IV, HEA programs on at least an annual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that, currently, the Department of Education could not properly and effectively review the volume of audits that the Department would receive if every institution submitted an audit report on at least an annual basis. The Secretary is concerned that an effort that extensive could diminish the resources needed to concentrate on timely review of those institutions that pose the greatest financial risk to the government and the taxpayer. The Secretary proposes to exempt from some or all of the audit requirements of this section certain categories of institutions that pose no serious threat to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes that an institution, other than an institution that is participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time, have the audit performed at least once every two years if it meets the following conditions: (1) The institution received less than $100,000 in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs for the period covered by the audit; or (2) the institution had no deficiencies identified in the audit report most recently submitted to the Department if that audit report was submitted in a timely fashion. The Secretary bases this amount on the amount that would exempt entities from the audit requirements of the Single Audit Act. The Secretary also believes that an institution that had no deficiencies identified in its most recently submitted audit report will continue to perform at a level that does not warrant as great a degree of oversight. In addition, an institution would not be required to have a compliance audit for any year in which the institution receives less than $25,000 in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs. This proposal would establish in regulations the Secretary's current practice. Institutions that do not handle large amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds do not put a large amount of Title IV, HEA program funds at risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that in spite of these exemptions the Secretary would reserve the right to require an institution to have a compliance audit performed annually from any institution as the Secretary deems necessary. Further, the Secretary proposes to require an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time to have an audit performed at least once a year for the first five years of its participation. The Secretary believes it is important to monitor an institution more closely if the institution has not previously participated in the programs and has not had an opportunity to establish a record of consistent compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 487(c) of the HEA requires that an audit performed in accordance with this section must cover the period since the most recent audit. The Secretary proposes to specify, for clarification, that an institution's first audit for a Title IV, HEA program must cover the institution's activities from the beginning of the institution's participation in that program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather than continuing to specify deadlines in regulations for the submission of audit reports, the Secretary proposes to require an institution to submit its audit to the Department's Inspector General by the deadlines established in the audit guides developed by the Department's Office of Inspector General. Beyond establishing deadlines for the submission of audit reports, these guides will provide for certain extensions beyond establishing deadlines for valid reasons. These guides are developed in consultation with the academic community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to make the results of compliance audits available to cognizant guaranty agencies and eligible lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, and designated SPREs. The Secretary proposes to add nationally recognized accrediting agencies to this list, because of the role of accrediting agencies in assisting the Secretary with regard to institutional participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes to require institutions to provide copies of their audit reports to these entities upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / EU acts to ease multiple share listings European Union finance ministers yesterday approved a measure intended to reduce the administrative burdens on companies seeking share listings on more than one EU stock exchange. The measure, which will be an amendment to the Listing Particulars Directive, will allow companies listed on one exchange to use their existing documentation as the basis for an application for another exchange. Before becoming effective, the European parliament must give its opinion on the issue. Currently, companies seeking listings outside their home country must prepare an entirely new set of documentation for a second listing, a requirement which can discourage cross-border listings. Mr Paul Smee, head of public policy and international relations at the London Stock Exchange, said that while the amendment was not revolutionary, 'it is a first step towards cross-border listing. It is progress.' It is expected the amendment will smooth the way for the Eurolist project under which the 250 largest EU corporations will be able to obtain cross-border listings. Eurolist will be open to those companies with a market capitalisation of at least Ecu1bn (Pounds 760m), with annual turnover of at least Ecu250m and which are prepared to seek a listing on at least five European exchanges outside their home country. However, the creation of Eurolist and the new listings amendment fall short of what the London Stock Exchange has been seeking and what many regard as essential to genuine integration of European stock exchanges. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, London Stock Exchange chairman, has called for mutual recognition of listing requirements by EU stock exchanges. While the listing and reporting requirements need not be exactly alike, stock exchanges should agree to list the shares of those companies which have met listing requirements in their home states.</p>

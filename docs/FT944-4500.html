			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Business steps up move from central London The number of office occupiers moving out of central London has risen sharply this year and is likely to remain high as companies rationalise premises, says an annual survey by the surveyors Jones Lang Wootton. Central London - the City and the West End - has lost about 200,000 office jobs over 30 years as a direct result of companies decentralising operations away from the capital. Decentralisation fell in 1992 and 1993 as the cost of central London office accommodation fell in relation to other regions during recession. Nineteen big organisations moved a total of 8,440 jobs out of central London this year, up from 3,500 last year. While only 11 organisations have firm plans to move next year and in 1996, the level of prospective moves, involving 55 organisations, is at a historically high level. The new wave of relocation away from central London appears to be driven by wider corporate rationalisation rather than outright concern for occupancy costs. More than half of the companies likely to move out of central London were motivated by the desire to consolidate their number of sites as part of wider restructuring. As a result, 40 per cent of companies questioned planned to move to locations where they had existing premises. Only 37 per cent cited occupancy costs as the main reason for their move. In the 1980s this percentage was typically more than 50 per cent. The narrower cost differential between the south-east of England and other regions means that companies moving out of central London are more likely to move only short distances. Favoured destinations for decentralisation are those within the immediate orbit of central London, such as Hammersmith and Docklands, which offer proximity to the capital and significant cost savings over the West End or City.</p>

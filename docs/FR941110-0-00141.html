			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We chose not to set the minimum amount of notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required any higher than 2 days in the case of immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy because the longer immediate jeopardy persists, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater the likelihood that actual harm or even death may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result or continue. We have, for the reasons cited in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph immediately preceding determined that a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be given no less than 2 days before imposition of sanctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Besides, it has been our experience that, as a practical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter, it takes longer than 2 days to complete termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings once they are begun. It is our belief that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have struck a fair balance between giving facilities fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice and a reasonable chance to correct deficiencies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfilling our responsibility to safeguard the health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have chosen 15 days in the case of nonimmediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy by carefully weighing the same considerations. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is important to understand that we are bound by Federal law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to minimize the time between the identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations and final imposition of remedies. While sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819 and 1919 of the Act do not require giving specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice before the imposition of remedies, constitutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles of due process generally do require such a notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of agency adverse action. On the other hand, neither the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act nor the Constitution require that providers have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to correct deficiencies before sanctions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed. In other words, there is a need for prior notice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not an entitlement on the providers' part to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to correct deficiencies. This policy, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe, satisfies due process concerns of providers. As we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have said, the only exception is the immediate imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State monitor when there is an immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation, because, above all else, it is our responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect the lives of residents. The facility will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to pay the salary of the State monitor; nor will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State monitor have managerial authority to obligate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility funds. (That authority is reserved for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager who could be installed a couple of days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later.) The State monitor can be appointed immediately,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while other sanctions are pending during notice periods to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect residents. With respect to civil money penalties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not believe that any notice is required before HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State advises a facility that noncompliance has occurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that a penalty is to be imposed. As the statute clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggests, civil money penalties may be imposed for past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods of noncompliance even if a facility is currently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. Notice is required, however, before a civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty can be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> collected,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and the regulations call for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exactly this procedure. Like any other commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enterprise, nursing homes must structure their debits and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits around their cash flow. We believe that notifying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility that it must pay a civil money penalty instantly is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfair, unrealistic, and not in accordance with the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles of due process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule, we are removing the provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring a maximum of 4 days notice before the imposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a sanction in &sect;488.402(f). We may impose a remedy for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy, as &sect;488.410 allows, as long as we give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility at least 2 days' notice before the imposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the remedy and no more than 23 days from the last day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey to remove the jeopardy or be terminated. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual practice, the facility is notified that there is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy deficiency as soon as the survey has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed. It is only the official notice of the imposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a remedy that may not be sent until later, as long as it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is received by the facility at least two days before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

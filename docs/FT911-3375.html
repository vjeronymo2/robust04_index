			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Saunders said to be suffering dementia MR Ernest Saunders, the former chairman and chief executive of Guinness, is suffering from incurable pre-senile dementia, the appeal court was told yesterday. A scan has disclosed evidence of abnormalities of his brain. Three doctors called to give evidence on Mr Saunders' appeal against the five-year jail sentence he is serving for his part in the Guinness affair said they had diagnosed pre-senile dementia and believed he would have been suffering from it during his trial. A doctor called by the Serious Fraud Office did not agree with that 'unequivocal diagnosis'. He said there was no definite correlation between an abnormal brain scan and pre-senile dementia. Mr Saunders, serving his sentence in Ford open prison in West Sussex, was sentenced on August 28. He will become eligible for parole after a third of his sentence, at the end of next April. Mr Saunders; Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker; and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, are appealing against their convictions and sentences. Mr Antony Shaw, Mr Saunders' counsel, said the brain scan had been part of an investigation carried out into possible organic causes for headaches from which Mr Saunders had suffered for some time. Mr John Chadwick, QC, for the SFO, said the Crown had been advised the diagnosis was 'not impossible' but was not capable of being confirmed by reference to the observations and tests so far carried out. Dr Patrick Gallwey , a consultant with Devon and Cornwall Forensic Psychiatric Services, said he had treated Mr Saunders in 1988. When he had seen him earlier this month the change in Mr Saunders' symptoms, coupled with the scan evidence, had been sufficient to diagnose pre-senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Dr George Perkin, consultant neurologist at Charing Cross Hospital, called by the SFO, said the 'bedside tests' carried out on Saunders would raise 'a suspicion' of pre-senile dementia, but he would want further, and much more structured, data. He said that undoubtedly if Mr Saunders did have pre-senile dementia it would be a progressive disorder and it should be easier month by month to make a diagnosis based on psychometric tests, because changes would become much more evident. The appeals continue today.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sogo stake in Criterion SOGO UK Ltd, the subsidiary of the Japanese retailer, has acquired a 50 per cent stake in Criterion Developments Ltd from its joint venture partner Mountleigh, the property company which went into receivership in May, 1992. CDL owns the Criterion building on Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London's West End. Sogo made its first UK investment when it entered into a joint venture agreement with Mountleigh in December 1990, buying a 50 per cent stake for Pounds 30m. Mountleigh went into receivership with debts of Pounds 590m. Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James, partners of KPMG Peat Marwick, joint administrative receivers, warned at the time that the disposal of Mountleigh's Pounds 400m UK property portfolio could take years. Mr Hiroo Mizushima, president of Sogo Co Ltd, said that the company's full acquisition of the London site was an important element in Sogo's international development.</p>

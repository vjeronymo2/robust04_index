			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Posco 27% increase beats forecast POHANG Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's third-largest steel company, yesterday reported that net earnings for 1992 rose by 27 per cent to Won185.1bn (Dollars 230m). The South Korean group's result was better than expected. Analysts had predicted profits of Won150bn, while its own forecast was Won169bn. Sales totalled Won6,180bn, an increase of 6 per cent. Profits were boosted by a rationalisation programme to cut production costs by Won160bn, increased sales of higher-valued steel products, and a fall in raw material prices. Analysts predict that Posco earnings could climb to Won220bn this year as its capital costs shrink following the completion last year of its fourth and final steel plant. Posco, however, could have its exports to the US curtailed if Washington decides to impose dumping duties in June. Its main export to the US is hot-rolled steel sheets, which face a 30 per cent dumping penalty. The steel is mainly delivered to UPI, a California-based 50-50 joint venture of Posco and USX.</p>

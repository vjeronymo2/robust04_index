			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Ex-Dokken Members Block Founder: Three members of the now-defunct heavy metal  rock group Dokken won a preliminary injunction in Superior Court on Thursday  blocking group founder Don Dokken from using the name Dokken or Dokken II to  launch a solo career.  </P> <P> Judge John Zebrowski found that a contract signed by all four band members  prevents Don Dokken from using his last name on future recordings. The former  Dokken members, Jeff Pilson of Van Nuys and Mick Brown and George Lynch, both  of Phoenix, filed the suit in January after learning that Don Dokken was  preparing to release an album on Geffen Records under the name, Dokken II.  (Filed Jan. 5, 1990, Case No. C748437)  </P></p>

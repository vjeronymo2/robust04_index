			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Bingham cautious on BCCI probe LORD Justice Bingham, who is to succeed Lord Donaldson as Master of the Rolls, said yesterday he did not know when his completed report into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International would be published and whether it would be published in full. 'The question of publication is entirely for others and I have no input now,' he said. 'But certainly there is material in the appendices which I would expect to be unpublish-able.' Lord Justice Bingham, speaking the day after the announcement of his appointment as the most senior civil court judge in England and Wales, described the 11-month BCCI inquiry as 'extremely laborious, but very interesting'. He said it would have been impossible to conduct the inquiry in public because a great deal of the material could not have been disclosed without prejudicing possible criminal proceedings. Lord Justice Bingham, who is in favour of a number of radical reforms, said that provided there were adequate safeguards to ensure the quality of advocacy, he was in favour of wider rights of audience for solicitors in the higher courts. He would like to see judges and barristers abandon their wigs in the civil courts but not the criminal courts, and the European Convention on Human Rights incorporated into domestic law.</p>

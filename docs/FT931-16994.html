			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: The bell tolls for drugs harmony  -Plus ca change AS THE midnight bells tolled on December 31, the pharmaceuticals industry found little to celebrate in the creation of a European single market. In few other industries has the promise of a single market been so poorly rewarded. The important changes sought by the industry, such as a single licensing authority or uniform prices throughout the EC, have not yet been addressed. Admittedly, by some legal quirk, a directive on pharmaceuticals patents came into force, extending patents to compensate for the difficult and costly regulatory hurdles facing medicines. But the measure will affect only a handful of products each year. And since the extensions only come into force at the end of the drugs' patent-lives, pharmaceuticals groups will only start benefiting in the next century. The EC has been forced, at least for the time being, to sacrifice its ambitions for the harmonisation of drugs prices on the rock of subsidiarity. At present, prices are set individually by national governments. Every health ministry in the EC is desperate to control its spending on drugs. Some - such as the UK - do so by allowing relatively high prices but controlling volume, while others control costs by keeping prices low. This means that in countries such as Portugal, France and Spain, prices are often half those in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. The result is that best-selling drugs, such as Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment Zantac, are exported from the UK to Greece, for example, and can then be imported back again. Sir Leon Brittan, the out-going commissioner responsible for competition, reckons this is a nonsense. 'With such disparate forms of pricing regulation, markets remain resolutely national and consumers are not able to reap the benefits of a free market,' he says. However, last monthSir Leon admitted that plans to harmonise prices had had to be shelved. Few countries were willing to let the EC decide how much drugs should cost. If prices were set too high, health ministries could see their drugs budgets spiralling out of control. If too low, others could see their pharmaceuticals groups suffering.</p>

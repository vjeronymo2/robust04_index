			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The specific rationale that forms the basis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement in the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's draft EIS for Point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beach was not documented. The decontamination requirements for the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs are comparable. The VSC&hyph;24 DSC is loaded into the ventilated concrete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask (VCC) forming the VSC. The VSC is then transported from inside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor auxiliary building to the storage pad. During moving and storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VCC, the exterior surface remains clean because it has not been exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination in the spent fuel pool. The NUHOMS DSC is moved in the transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask from the reactor building to the horizontal storage module in the field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the transfer cask has been in the spent fuel pool, it may have small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of external contamination that have the potential to spread during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transit. However, any potential contamination of this type could not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant. The NRC requires that the limits for surface contamination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers' dose, and environmental dose must all be met for the operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ISFSI, including during any transfer operations. Each 10 CFR Part 50 licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must have a radiation protection program to monitor operations to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface contamination and worker and public exposure to radiation are below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable levels and as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the NUHOMS shows that the doses are well below all NRC limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter ``is concerned that heat generated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fission product decay may provide the driving force, the presence of free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moisture in water-logged fuel may, in a non-mechanistic way, provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport mechanism for fission product release and the ambient air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circulating through the cask concrete structure may provide (an unmonitored)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathway to the biosphere.'' One commenter remained concerned about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of insufficient drying of the fuel before placement in the DSC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter, citing the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PNL&hyph;5987 on the removal of moisture from degraded fuel during vacuum drying,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contends that the mechanism for free moisture and radionuclide release that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain in normal or upset conditions, such as conditions caused by sabotage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been simulated adequately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The DSC is a closed vessel. There is no path available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for release of fission products from inside the DSC to the atmosphere. During  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal operation, the circulating air, as it passes through the HSM and around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the outside of the DSC to remove the heat, never comes in contact with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fission products and therefore, could not remove these products from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cavity of the DSC. Moreover, design basis accidents under upset conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were postulated and analyzed in the SAR and SER. These analyses show that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat generated from fission product decay is not capable of breaching the DSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and could not provide the driving force for a release of radioactivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, it is not expected that any significant amount of moisture will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in the fuel after it is loaded into the DSC. The fuel is dried after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has been loaded into the DSC and the topcover plate seal welded to the DSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shell. The Certificate of Compliance requires two pump-downs to a vacuum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure of less than 3 mm Hg each with a holding time of greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 minutes. A stable vacuum pressure of less than 3 mm Hg further assures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all liquid water has evaporated in the DSC cavity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The safeguards issue of radiological sabotage of storage casks has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed previously and assessed in the 1989 proposed rule to add Subparts K  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (54 FR 19379). The NRC has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS is sufficiently robust such that the effects of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful attack would have low health consequences and are similar to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results presented in the 1989 proposed rule. (see also response to comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> N.1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. A number of comments were received that focused on monitoring,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance, and inspection activities associated with dry cask storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel, particularly as they relate to the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that there are neither active nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passive systems in place to mitigate barrier breaches, nor are there active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiation monitors that would indicate a breach has occurred. There are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored drains and sumps nor are there retention basins. The commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the cask is insufficient to be relied upon for the health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of Ohioans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Certificate of Compliance (Section 1.3) for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS includes surveillance and monitoring requirements that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than sufficient to detect cask degradation in time to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate corrective actions can and will be taken. In addition, radiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and environmental monitoring programs would detect any radiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leak in excess of NRC limits from an NRC-approved cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some instances, the NRC has required continuous monitoring where it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is needed to determine when corrective action needs to be taken. Under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general license, to date, the NRC has accepted continuous pressure monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the inert helium atmosphere as an indicator of acceptable performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanical closure seals for dry spent fuel storage casks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the NRC does not consider continuous monitoring for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS double-weld seals to be necessary because:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

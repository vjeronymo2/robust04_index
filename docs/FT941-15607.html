			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: Former leader attacks 'dictatorial' inquiry Mr David Weeks, former leader of Westminster council, last night attacked the basis for the inquiry in which he said the district auditor had acted as the 'prosecuting counsel, judge and jury'. He said the council's actions on housing policy had been approved as legal by Mr Jeremy Sullivan, a Queen's Counsel who specialises in local government, on three separate occasions between 1987 and 1993. Mr Weeks, who is still a Westminster councillor and works as a marketing executive at the Lovell construction group, said Mr Magill, the auditor, had taken a 'naive and dictatorial view' of how councils ran their housing policies. Mr Weeks said party political issues had been one consideration in the council's actions but not the only one. Mr Magill had been incorrect 'in not seeing a role for party politics' in the council's activities in housing. 'Party politics is a fact of life in local government,' said Mr Weeks. Any shredding of documents that may have taken place had been a 'normal part' of people disposing of files after they moved jobs. Mr Weeks said he had not shredded any papers personally because he did not have an office at the council and did not keep papers for any length of time. Over the next few weeks he would be writing to Mr Magill to set out his views formally. Mr Weeks was leader of Westminster from 1991 to last year. He was a key player in Westminster council's policies in the late 1980s. He said it was a 'misconception' that the council had formulated its housing policies on the basis of 'tramping around in the undergrowth' when it had taken careful advice from Mr Sullivan. He added: 'We (the council members) knew what we wanted to do and he (Mr Sullivan) told us it was legal. We went ahead on the basis that the policy was legal and I am still sure that it was legal.' He said that Mr Sullivan had been asked to provide an opinion on three separate occasions, in 1987, 1989 and in May last year, and each time gave the same answer that the council's actions were within its legal powers.</p>

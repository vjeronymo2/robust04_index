			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ECC is flattered by land sales The first interim profits from English China Clays since it demerged Camas, its construction materials arm, in June were flattered by a sharp increase in profits from land sales. ECC's construction business increased sales from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 37.9m and operating profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 21.6m in the six months to June 30. The group said it intends to sell off the business's land bank over the next few years, subject to the state of the market. The remaining land is worth an estimated Pounds 65m-Pounds 70m at current market prices, but analysts estimate next year will mark the last significant contribution to group profitability, with the remaining disposals being spread over several years. Mr Patrick Drayton, finance director, said it had been decided to keep the construction business within ECC while it was being run down, because the profits and cashflow from the disposals would have greatly distorted the performance of the much smaller Camas. ECC's group sales rose from Pounds 515m to Pounds 618m, including a full contribution from Calgon, the US speciality chemicals business it bought last June for Pounds 210m. Calgon, which now makes up the speciality chemicals division, made operating profits of Pounds 6.1m on sales of Pounds 78.5m. Growth was significant in paper chemicals, but water management sales were down, reflecting customer destocking, lower usage and competitive pricing. Earnings per share rose to 11.47p (9.45p). An interim dividend of 5.35p, combined with Camas's interim, gave an unchanged total of 6.6p. COMMENT ECC has cuts its workforce heavily in recent years, so should benefit quickly from any increase in volumes, even without hoped-for price increases. Analysts were pleased by signs that this operational gearing is already being demonstrated in Europe, but remain puzzled as to why the US paper industry seems to be recovering so slowly. With gearing of only 30 per cent, Mr Teare has plenty of elbow room to pursue his strategy of growing the speciality chemicals business by acquisition. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 104m put the shares, down 10p to 381p yesterday, on a prospective multiple of 17. The premium to the market increases if one strips out the contribution to earnings from land sales. That seems reasonable, at least until the US situation becomes clearer.</p>

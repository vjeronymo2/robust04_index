			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japan's trading companies post fall in earnings, sales JAPAN'S big six trading companies yesterday reported an expected fall in both sales and earnings for the fiscal year that ended March 31 due to the global economic slowdown and sour financial investments. Weaker domestic demand curbed import revenues, while there was also a decline in income from third-country transactions. In terms of product sectors, there was a decline in turnover from energy and chemical products as crude oil prices fell. A price drop for metals also depressed income. But sales of machinery rose for some companies. Most of the trading houses expect pre-tax earnings will remain flat or rise only slightly during the current fiscal year reflecting the gradual recovery of the global economy. C. Itoh &amp; Co retained its position as the world's biggest trading company with Y20,000bn (Dollars 154.26bn) in sales, but it suffered its first profit fall in five years with pre-tax earnings declining by 16.7 per cent to Y45.28bn. After-tax profits plunged by 42.7 per cent to Y10.9bn as extraordinary losses amounted to Y5.9bn. C. Itoh predicts sales will fall slightly to Y19,000bn in the current fiscal year, while pre-tax profit will be steady at Y45bn. The after-tax profit is expected to rise to Y12bn. Sumitomo Corp reported an 18.1 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y63.25bn as its net financial income was cut by 48 per cent to Y13bn. This reflected a decline in net interest and dividend income and losses on securities. Sumitomo predicts pre-tax earnings will increase slightly to Y66bn as sales reach Y19,000bn. After-tax profits are expected to reach Y34bn. Marubeni had the sharpest pre-tax earnings setback among the top trading companies with a 29.9 per cent drop to Y38.4bn. Its deficit on net financial items nearly doubled to Y20.6bn due to a fall in interest and dividend income. But its after-tax profit increased by 2.2 per cent to Y17.4bn as extraordinary losses eased. It expects pre-tax and after-tax earnings to remain steady this fiscal year, while sales should decline slightly to Y17,000bn. Mitsui and Co performed better than than its competitors with a 7.1 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y61.4bn. It narrowed its deficit in financial income to Y5.9bn from Y19.8bn in the previous fiscal year. Its after-tax profit grew by 1.7 per cent to Y22.6bn as it reduced its extraordinary losses, mostly connected with the ill-fated Iranian joint venture petrochemical project, to Y10.2bn from Y29bn a year ago. It expects moderate rises in its pre-tax and after-tax earnings to Y62bn and Y23bn respectively in the current fiscal year, while sales should increase by 2 per cent to Y16,500bn. Mitsubishi Corp had the highest pre-tax profit at Y85.89bn among the main trading companies, although it represented a decline of 8.9 per cent. It was the only trading house to predict a significant earnings drop this fiscal year, despite a slight rise in sales to Y16bn. It estimated pre-tax earnings will fall by 20 per cent to Y70bn and after-tax profits by 25 per cent to Y30bn. But analysts cautioned that Mitsubishi is normally conservative in its forecasts. Nissho Iwai had the sharpest fall in sales with an 18.2 per cent decline to Y10,900bn. It predicts a 5.4 per cent decrease in pre-tax profits to Y20bn.</p>

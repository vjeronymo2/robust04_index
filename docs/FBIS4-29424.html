			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By senior political reporter Kim Chong-nae] </F>   [Text] Having gone through a crisis over the "replacement  of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the handling of the approval  of Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok's appointment," the relationship  between the ruling and opposition parties is expected to bring  tremendous changes to the political world.    "Tremendous changes" means that the relationship between the  ruling and opposition parties formed since the birth of the new  government will be shaken to its roots. It appears that this  change will create great waves within the ruling and opposition  parties and will become a new compass by which the direction of  the political situation is determined.    Symptoms of the change in the relationship between the  ruling  and opposition parties appeared in the negotiations on and  handling of the approval of the appointment of Prime Minister  Yi, which went through a repeated game of hide-and-seek: full  confrontation--narrowing of opinions--rupture of negotiations.    A surface change in the relationship between the ruling and  opposition parties is that their mutual images have changed. The  ruling party may want to deny it, but it is a change deeply felt  by all in political circles. Only a year ago, when the new  administration was born, the opposition party disappeared from  the political stage. An extreme expression would be that only  President Kim Yong-sam got the spotlight. It was hard to see or  hear anything of the opposition party. It ran about in  confusion, without even knowing where to stand in the whirlwind  of reform and the anticorruption drive. A so-called "identity  crisis" heavily burdened the minds of the opposition. Now,  however, they are undeniably the star of the stage. Achieving  symmetry with the Kim administration, they have returned in the  form of a "new opposition," having clearly secured a space for  opposing the present administration.    The advent of the "new opposition" signifies that the ruling  party has lost part of its right to manage the political  situation." It is now actually impossible to direct the  political situation according to the purposes and plans of only  the ruling party, as it had done in the past.    An internal change in the relationship between the ruling  and  opposition parties is that their perceptions of each other have  changed. The present ruling and opposition parties have the same  roots; they came out of the opposition of an era of  authoritarian regimes. All one has to do is think of the old New  Democratic Party [Ku Sinmindang] and the Council for the  Promotion of Democracy [Minchuhyop]. Although divided into  ruling and opposition parties, they shared a common denominator  of antidictatorial, anti-military-regime emotion. Now, however,  they have entered into a completely hostile, competitive  relationship. Having become no different than the relationship  between the ruling and opposition parties of the past, hatred  and disregard have accumulated about as much as is possible. At  one time applauding the president's reform so much as to shame  the vested forces of the ruling party and calling for the  strengthening of national competitiveness as if competing with  it, the opposition has now entered an attack phase, saying it is  "the president's form of rule and consciousness which should be  the objects of reform."    This change in the relationship between the ruling and  opposition parties is a key for predicting the future of the  political situation. The importance of this change can be felt  more intensely when reflection is made upon its background and  causes.    Most carefully to be considered of the factors behind this  change is that it was not a result of the spontaneous choice of  the political world. The change was neither agreed upon nor even  based on a tacit understanding between the ruling party and the  opposition. Rather, external conditions and structural factors  of the political world brought change. Inasmuch as it was not a  spontaneous choice, it is difficult to gauge the influence  accompanying this change. If it had been a choice in which the  will and preferences of the political world had functioned, it  would be easy for the political world itself to control the  direction and breadth of the change. The situation, however, was  just the opposite. Korea's political climate, used to  considering moral justifications important and to confrontation  between camps, makes it more difficult to control change.    Factors outside the political arena pressing for change  include not only various domestic, environmental and other  outstanding issues, but also international factors as well, such  as the Uruguay Round. As for opposition to the ratification of  the Uruguay Round Final Performance Plan, it became an  opportunity for reviving the practically-exhausted opposition  party. Of course, there have been issues, such as the Uruguay  agreement, difficult for the political world to endure, but it  is hard to deny that other blunders of the ruling party played a  big part in getting the opposition back on its feet.    Circumstances inside the ruling and opposition parties will  be different, but a structural factor of the political world  accelerating change was the leadership of the minority faction.  The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] has been led by the minority  Democratic-Party [DP] faction. Apart from an objective  evaluation, one got a sense that the minority's control of the  political situation was insufficient to effectively lead the  majority, the Democratic-Justice-Party [DJP] and  Republican-Party [RP] factions, at least as far as the front  against the opposition party is concerned. Most really feel  that the passive posture of the DJP and RP factions caused a  loss of the DLP's power to deal with the minority faction within  the National Assembly.    Party President Yi Ki-taek, belonging to the minority  faction  in the DP, has lead the opposition party. Although the largest  faction, the Tonggyo-tong faction, supports President Yi, there  cannot help but be a difference between this and the  Tonggyo-tong faction exercising direct management of the party.  More important is the fact that the Tonggyo-tong faction's  support for President Yi has varied according to the situation  and issues under consideration. What has caused this gap to  widen is the system of collective leadership called the Chief  Executives Council. As it is a collective leadership system, it  is very possible for it to lean toward the selection of an  inconsistent, hard party line toward the ruling party based on  vividness, rather than one which is realistic and flexible.    Butting heads as a result of thus overlapping factors both  inside and outside the political arena, in one fell swoop the  ruling and opposition parties raised to the ceiling the  intensity of their attack and defense. With the traditional  course of problems posed and counter attacks launched generally  abbreviated, the situation got hot in the blink of an eye.    The opposition naturally attempted to make changes. They  seemed intent on redeeming in a day the silence they have kept  up to now.    As was seen in the exposure of the Sangmudae scandal, the  opposition made an all-out attack on the ethics of the present  administration, as if going for its Achilles Heel. The  administration had advocated reform as though it had a patent on  it. In a special press interview on 2 May, DP President Yi  Ki-taek, taking aim directly at the president, demanded he  explain the Sangmudae scandal. The ruling party ignored and  disregarded this.    Meanwhile, teamwork broke down within the ruling party. It  was the Kim Hoe-chang crisis. As the ruling party became the  object of the scrutiny of public opinion, and of the stinging  scrutiny of the middle class in particular, it hastened to bring  the situation under control, but it was too late. The crisis had  already worsened.    In this state, both the ruling party and opposition both did  their best to control the crisis in a manner benefiting  themselves. This made conflict between the two more intense. The  DP brought up the president's closest aides, criticizing them;  the DLP officially presented the idea that Asia-Pacific Peace  Foundation Director Kim Tae-chung was interfering in politics.  Although this was not a full mobilization of the means of attack  from which the two had been refraining, it was the first use of  subjects which till now had been considered taboo.    Looking back over such circumstances, it appears the change  which has started to show itself in the relationship between the  ruling and opposition parties will become greatly accelerated.  Particularly, it appears that, as long as there is no change in  the situation, the fight for leadership of the political  situation will grow much fiercer and that this will be the  epicenter of the accelerating change in the relationship between  the ruling and opposition parties. Looking at it by their time  table, in the short term, prospects are that the ruling and  opposition parties will clash severely over invoking the right  of parliamentary investigation into the Sangmudae scandal, house  composition of the National Assembly which must be completed  within six months, National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay  Round, and disposal of the budget for the new year in the  regular session of the National Assembly.    Of these, the UR ratification cannot be omitted, so it is  clear that it will be a battle from which neither side can  withdraw.    However, avoiding an open confrontation in the National  Assembly, etc., the possibility the ruling and opposition  parties will enter a full-scale propaganda battle for securing a  support base and for taking control of the overall situation  cannot be excluded. For example, the ruling party, completely  ignoring the opposition, will carry out national affairs  directed toward the public and will strongly pursue a policy of  reform and of strengthening national competitiveness; the  opposition may strengthen its out-of-parliament attack on the  ethics of the ruling party. If this happens, the battle in the  National Assembly will deteriorate into one line of  confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties.    No matter what their side, within the minds of those in the  clashing ruling and opposition parties will always be drawn a  picture of the local autonomy system, [the election for which  will be held] in less than a year (June of next year). Strategic  and tactical concern about from what position and in what mode  they should carry out the local elections will regulate the  actions of the ruling and opposition parties.    This may be premature, but the results of next year's local  elections will be a decisive variable by which to judge the  composition of the management of the political situation in the  latter half of the ruling party's time in power. In the  opposition party too, it will become a chance for an outline to  come into focus of the direction of the party leadership and of  the battle for the party candidacy for the next presidential  election.</p>

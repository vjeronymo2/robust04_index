			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Microchips on the Paris metro The Paris metro commuter rail network is testing an advanced ticketing system that uses a plastic card, embedded with a microchip, battery and tiny antenna, that need never leave your pocket or purse. The card - about the size of a credit card, though a little thicker - is being tested between the Chatelet stop in central Paris and the suburb of Les Lilas, officials of the Paris Transport Authority said. It has been designed for use on 2,900km of bus routes and the metro's full 201km. The system is being developed by Roland Moreno, the Paris-based inventor of France's electronic banking and public telephone systems, which rely on microchip-equipped cards. The current system, used by some 4.3m travellers daily, relies on paper tickets with magnetic strips. But that system is near its end and is plagued by fraud.</p>

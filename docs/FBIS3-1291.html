			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cape Town March 23 SAPA -- An international  investigation would be set in motion if African National  Congress [ANC] Western Cape Premier Candidate Allan Boesak  provides evidence supporting his allegation that cabinet  ministers stole R70 billion [rand] from the state, Law and Order  Minister Hernus Kriel said on Wednesday night. "I undertake  that, if the ANC [African National Congress] tells us who the  guilty people are, an international investigation team will be  appointed," he told a cheering crowd of about 500 people at a  meeting at the Malibu High School in Blue Downs, a coloured  suburb near Cape Town.    "I challenge him to say who it was that was supposed to have  put that money in their pockets so that we can investigate the  matter properly and put the guilty ones in jail.    "If he does not accept this challenge, then we will know  why.  I am not a prophet, but I predict he won't accept this  challenge."    Mr Kriel was replying to recent allegations by Dr Boesak at  a  meeting in Moorreesburg that cabinet ministers and national  party politicians had "stolen R70 billion of state money" over  the last few years. He said the ANC was hell-bent on  discrediting the leaders of the NP [National Party].    Referring to a full-page advertisement in Cape newspapers --  placed by COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and  saying the NP ruled through weapon smuggling and assassination  gangs -- Mr Kriel said the advert was dishonest.    Nothing about the so-called third force in the SAP [South  African Police] had yet been proven.    "What has happened to fairness and justice in South Africa?  If Mr (Nelson) Mandela and Mr (Cyril) Ramaphosa find you guilty  before it has been proven in a court of law, is this what is  going to happen in the new South Africa?    "Why was the advert placed by COSATU? I say it is because  COSATU is one of the arms of the octopus that is the ANC. The  ANC is too scared to place such an advert under its own name  because it knows it will run up against the Independent  Electoral Commission which would find they have misused the  circumstances."    Referring to other allegations by Dr Boesak that coloured  children had poor examination results because of poor education  facilities provided by the NP, Mr Kriel said the government had  built more schools and trained more teachers than any other  government before it.    "The NP has never told children to boycott their classes or  teachers to engage in chalk-downs. We will never sell our  children out for political gains. The future of South Africa  lies in the hands of our children.    "We say the ANC must leave our children alone so that they  can learn and become useful citizens of this country so they can  break the circle of poverty. They can only do that if they are  educated."    Chaos threatened on several occasions during question time  when a contingent of about 70 ANC supporters were vociferously  shouted down by the rest of the audience.</p>

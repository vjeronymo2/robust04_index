			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: BOC BOC could not have chosen a better day on which to remind the market of its defensive qualities. Nine-month figures were notably robust and contained no surprises: in the current market certainty has a value all its own. BOC's policy of announcing its dividend in advance only adds to the sense of security. Even exposure to the weak dollar is hedged through forward currency transactions which have already netted some Pounds 3m in cash. This goes a long way towards offsetting the Pounds 6m currency translation loss that might be anticipated for the full year. Yet BOC has not convinced the market that it can deliver anything more than secure but incremental earnings growth. Yesterday's 3 per cent gain in the share price only partly reverses a 10 per cent fall in the last two weeks. Bottom-line improvements in the core industrial gases business came from efficiency gains this time around. There must be doubts about BOC's ability to repeat the trick in the absence of higher volume. The healthcare side looks increasingly exposed, with the patent for Forane expiring in January. The replacement drug, Suprane, has to convince US regulators of its safety and anaesthetists of its efficacy if the threat from generic manufacturers is to be repelled. Until these doubts are resolved BOC is unlikely to trade at a premium to the market despite the attraction of a secure dividend.</p>

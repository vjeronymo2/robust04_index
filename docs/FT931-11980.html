			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Final Brown Shipley sale likely stockbroking and investment management - seem set to be acquired by Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise only seven months after it rescued Brown Shipley &amp; Co, the banking arm. KBL, a sister organisation to one of Belgium's biggest banking groups, is likely to offer 30p a share for the 70.2 per cent of Brown Shipley Holdings it does not already own, valuing it at Pounds 4.8m. When KBL bought its initial 20 per cent stake in 1986 it paid 750p a share and a total of Pounds 23m. Brown Shipley's share price slid from 51p to 35p after yesterday's announcement about the potential deal - and about the problem that had sparked it off. This dates back to KBL's Pounds 1 purchase of Brown Shipley &amp; Co last June. Leasing losses, bad debt provisions and a property write-down had undermined the bank's capital base and it could no longer be sustained by the holding company. However, one of the liabilities passed on with Brown Shipley &amp; Co has rebounded in the form of potential claims totalling Pounds 2.4m against BSH. The claims relate to Lease Management Services, which was sold last June for Pounds 5.9m to Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group in which Credit Lyonnais of France has a near 50 per cent stake. Although BSH has denied liability, if the claims were successful they would reduce its net assets to less than half the Pounds 16m called up capital, necessitating an extraordinary general meeting to discuss what to do. Mr William Dacombe, chairman and chief executive, said fighting the claims would not only be expensive, but also destabilising and bad for morale. 'Independence has its attractions, but the financial strength of KBL also has its attractions.' If the offer goes ahead and is accepted - and the odds are on that outcome - it will round off the break-up of Brown Shipley. That started last May with the Pounds 33m sale of its insurance broking operations to Holmwoods Group and the Pounds 10m disposal of its offshore operations to Standard Bank Investment Corporation of South Africa.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations for the formation of the new government  are coming to a head. The crux of the negotiations remains the  need to increase the majority of the Freedom Alliance --  something that Silvio Berlusconi is trying to achieve by winning  over the Italian Popular Party and Mario Segni's Pact for Italy  in order to gain their support for the future government. Rocco  Tolfa reports:    [Tolfa] To the Center! To the Center! This is the litany of  Silvio Berlusconi's men, who are desperately trying to put  together a solid majority so that they can govern. Mario Segni  has already said no.    [Begin Segni recording] There are profound differences  between ourselves and Silvio Berlusconi. His is a right-wing  movement that was created with the direct support of the Italian  Social Movement. It has an institutional and economic program  that does not convince us in any way whatsoever, and so we  certainly will not enter into, nor will we support a Berlusconi  government. [end recording]    [Tolfa] However, there is a cautious opening as far as  institutional reform is concerned.    [Begin Segni recording] We are asking for the same changes  as  Berlusconi on some points, in other words, voting over two  rounds rather than one; antitrust laws to be brought in for a  number of different sectors, above all as far as the mass media  and private television stations are concerned; and in addition  we are asking for the reorganization of RAI's shareholder  syndicate. [end recording]    [Tolfa] The door remains closed as far as economic policy is  concerned; their policies would lead us to ruin, Segni said.    On the other hand, Michelini, also from the Pact for Italy,  has left the door open for Berlusconi. He wants to compare  plans with Forza Italia. Roberto Formigoni from the Italian  Popular Party has not ruled out an alliance with Berlusconi.    [Begin Formigoni recording] If the positions, the proposals  of the government were seen to be particularly clear as far as  what we regard as important for the country is concerned, then  we could decide on a technical abstention during votes. [end  recording]    [Tolfa] Opposition! Opposition! This is the cry of the  Italian Popular Party's left wing. In this way, Berlusconi is  dividing the remnants of what was for so long the white armada  [against communism, i.e., the Christian Democrats].</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andres de Leon -- live] </F>   [Text] Thousands of our Emisoras Unidas listeners have been  calling to report the presence of military personnel along the  streets and avenues of the capital. We must inform you this is  part of the crime prevention operation to provide security for  the Guatemalans traveling into the city from various points  around the countryside.    Police, the Treasury Guard, and the Guatemalan Army are  guarding access routes. No abnormal activity has been reported;  everything is under control. Military personnel have been  assigned to assist the police, and the Treasury Guard is  checking those coming in from the countryside or leaving  Guatemala City via one of the main access routes.    We have also learned military units are controlling the main  entrance routes, specifically Puente de Belize, Incienso, and El  Trebol, as well as key electricity high-tension pylons in the  capital city, as prevention measures against terrorism. We  hereby inform Guatemalans there is nothing abnormal going on in  the country. The military personnel are assisting with security  for those moving in an out of the city.</p>

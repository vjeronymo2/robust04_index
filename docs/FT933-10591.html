			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: IBM and Dell try new approaches to US marketing INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Dell Computer of the US yesterday introduced products and marketing approaches designed to address the increasingly segmented personal computer market. In the US, IBM formed Ambra, a personal computers sales subsidiary, to target 'price-sensitive PC customers who prefer purchasing through the direct channel'. Ambra will sell its own brand of PCs, built by sub-contractors, through mail and telephone orders. The formation of Ambra US follows similar moves last year by IBM in Europe and Canada. It will offer a broad range of desktop and notebook PCs, aimed at the US market and substantially different from Ambra-branded products in Europe and Canada, the company said. Marketing and service functions will also be sub-contracted to other companies. Through Ambra, IBM is also attempting to broaden the scope of its PC marketing to cover market that its own brand products do not address. The new company aims to capture a significant portion of the Dollars 10bn direct-response market in the US, which at the moment is catered for by Dell, Gateway 2000 and Zeos. Dell announced a series of desktop PC systems, services and support programs aimed at specific types of PC buyers. 'The old categories that computer companies have used - home versus business, large versus small, low-priced versus high-performance - no longer suffice,' said Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive. Wang Laboratories, the US computer group, said it could emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as early as autumn this year, Reuter reports. The company said it had reached agreement in principal on the private placement of Dollars 60m in 12 per cent exchangeable preferred stock and warrants to purchase 3.6m shares of the new common stock that Wang will issue as part of its reorganisation plan. Hewlett Packard has cut prices of its DeskJet brand inkjet PC printers by between 9 per cent and 22 per cent.</p>

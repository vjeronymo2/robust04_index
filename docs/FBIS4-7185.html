			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji </F> Kakizawa with unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime  minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [unidentified official] Next we will have a news  conference with newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa,  chairman of the Liberal Party.    [Kakizawa] I am Koji Kakizawa, and I was just appointed  foreign minister. Although our cabinet is a minority coalition  government, it embarks under difficult circumstances. I will  work hard to fulfill my duties while maintaining teamwork and  assisting Prime Minister Hata.    The international situation is now undergoing profound  changes, and there are many issues Japan is pressed to resolve.  Japan has to repair soured relations with the United States and  play a proper role in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan is also  being asked to make broad-ranging contributions in various  fields.    I intend to work for Japan's aggressive role in maintaining  world peace and promoting world prosperity. Breaking the  deadlock over Japan-U.S. economic relations is one of the urgent  issues. I also think Japan should fulfill its responsibility to  clear up suspicions about North Korea's development of nuclear  weapons and should cooperate with activities of the  international community and the United Nations.    Now that Japan's role in the international community is  attracting world attention, I would like to make Japan a  trustworthy and respectable country within the international  community. At the same time, we should seek the people's  understanding and should assist Prime Minister Hata. I would  like to solicit your cooperation.    [Unidentified correspondent] A major difference between  Japan's foreign policy under the coalition government compared  with that of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is that the  coalition government candidly admitted Japan's responsibility  for the past war. The coalition government has also apologized  to South Korea for Japan's colonial rule. Minister Kakizawa,  you served as parliamentary vice foreign minister under former  Foreign Minister Watanabe. What do you think of the admittance  and apology made by the coalition government? How are you going  to deal with Japan's war history?    [Kakizawa] In his policy speech to the Diet last August,  former Prime Minister Hosokawa made a statement to that effect.  With regard to Japan's acts of aggression against Asian nations  and the pain the Koreans suffered under Japanese colonial rule,  I share their pain and will do everything I can to address them,  always keeping his statement in mind.    [Unidentified correspondent] Kakizawa, you said on 18 April  that you intended to back Michio Watanabe as prime minister. It  has been said you quit the LDP in order to make Watanabe prime  minister. What do you think of Watanabe now? It has been said  you have been asked along with other LDP members to break away  from the party on the promise you would be appointed foreign  minister. Would you answer?    [Kakizawa] Your question is totally groundless. I respect  Watanabe as a politician in present political circles with  profound perceptions and leadership. After Hosokawa announced  his resignation as prime minister, I considered the need to  rally politicians who share the same policies, forming a new  cabinet that transcends the pro-LDP and anti-LDP framework.  Forming such a cabinet will greatly serve to reconstruct  politics and realign the political parties in Japan. With that  belief in my mind, I have worked hard toward that end. Japan's  second political reform and second realignment of the political  parties is about to begin. I have formed the Liberal Party  after concluding that I have to act now. From now on, together  with my colleagues I will work toward realigning the political  parties, not caring for the present framework of the political  parties.    [Unidentified correspondent] Minister, many people feel that  the Hata cabinet is a minority coalition government and will be  short-lived. What is your comment?    [Kakizawa] As a minority coalition government, our cabinet  will embark under difficult circumstances. Our cabinet has to  handle the fiscal 1994 budget which is the backbone of our  economic stimulus measures. It should do everything in its  power to get the budget passed in the Diet. Both the ruling and  opposition parties should cooperate with each other to pass the  budget for the sake of the people. As foreign minister, I am  not in charge of handling the budget, but as a member of the  Hata cabinet I intend to work for the passage of the budget in  the Diet while assisting the prime minister.    [Unidentified correspondent] Minister, there is a view that  it would be difficult to get the Diet to ratify an Uruguay Round  accord on rice. What do you think?    [Kakizawa] With regard to a set of accords hammered out at  the Uruguay Round, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister Hata formally signed them in Marrakech. My  understanding is that there will be domestic problems with  putting those accords into effect. However, our cabinet will  seek the people's understanding of Japan's commitment to fulfill  its international promises while pursuing an agricultural policy  that can open a bright future for farmers. I believe  parliamentary ratification of the rice accord is a necessary  process of building Japan into a nation that can live together  with other nations. Our cabinet is ready to listen humbly to  anyone's views.</p>

The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was  expected  to approve a U.S. proposal for limited East-West military  cooperation and send a signal of its eventual intention to take  in new members.    But with East European states pressing to join NATO over the  strenuous objections of Russia, NATO made it clear it would do  nothing to antagonise Moscow and hurt its programme of reforms.    "Our vital objective remains to build a new comprehensive  Euro-Atlantic architecture of security with, and not without or  against, Russia," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said in  his opening speech.    He said the message for Russia's former satellites was "we  shall not leave you alone," but added: "When we extend  membership of NATO to new countries it will be to help stabilise  Europe and not to divide it again."    Woerner, who met just before the summit with U.S. President  Bill Clinton, echoed the themes laid out by the American leader  in a major policy address here Sunday. [passage omitted]    The 21-month-old conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has  split the alliance at times, was likely to figure in the  discussions here. But NATO diplomats said they expected no new  concrete initiatives.    France and other countries are lobbying for NATO to launch  air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs as promised in August if  requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo  and other Moslem communities.    But Washington, which backed the air raids last May but was  frustrated by European opposition, now appears reluctant to act,  warning the attacks could endanger humanitarian operations on  the ground.    Britain has also balked at the possibility of air raids for  fear of reprisals against its troops serving with the  10,000-strong UN contingent in Bosnia. But British Prime  Minister John Major said on arriving at the summit, "We set that  out some months ago that we would go ahead with air strikes.  That was the position and that remains the position today," he  said.</p>

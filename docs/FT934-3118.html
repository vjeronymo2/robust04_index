			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Levitt case cost SFO Pounds 1.4m The Serious Fraud Office spent Pounds 1.4m on the prosecution of Mr Roger Levitt, the financier who received a 180-hour community service sentence for a single charge of fraudulent trading, the government disclosed last night. The case followed the collapse of Mr Levitt's financial services group with debts of more than Pounds 34m. His sentence, imposed at Southwark crown court last month, provoked a storm of protest. After more than 20 days in court, much of it spent in legal argument, the SFO reduced the charges to just one of fraudulent trading, to which he pleaded guilty. Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, said in a Commons written reply: 'The best estimate of the cost of the SFO arising from this case is approximately Pounds 1.4m. I have at present no information about other costs.' Mr Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South, said: 'Considering the SFO eventually only prosecuted Levitt on just one charge, this cost is astounding. It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money to spend so much time preparing other charges, then to drop them at the last minute.'</p>

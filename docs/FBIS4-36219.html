			<p>BFN     [Text] Among its reactions, Algeria has welcomed with  satisfaction the Yemeni Government's decision to accept the  cease-fire beginning at midnight tonight. In a statement by the  official spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Algeria  welcomed the Yemeni Government's decision and expressed the hope  that the Yemeni brothers would immediately begin a dialogue and  lay the foundations of a just and permanent settlement to the  conflict based on the protection of the Yemeni people's higher  interests.    The statement added that Algeria, in the words of head of  state Liamine Zeroual, had repeatedly warned the Yemeni brothers  of the great risks of the conflict to Yemen. The head of state  had insistently indicated the need for dialogue and consultation  to prevail in the confrontation, especially when he received the  two special Yemeni envoys and in the greetings message that he  sent to the leaders of that country on the occasion of the  Yemeni national day.    Within this context, Algeria renews its desire and readiness  to offer its cooperation and that of the AMU [Arab Maghreb  Union]--of which Algeria currently holds the presidency--with  the aim of putting an end to this bloody struggle.</p>

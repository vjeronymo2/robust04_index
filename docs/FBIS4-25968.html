			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is to pool  more overseas investment for infrastructures, hi-tech and  industrial projects, and the tertiary industry.    Wang Zukang, official in charge of the city's economic  relations and trade, said that the metropolis welcomes all  overseas investors, no matter what size of investment.    Now, the second batch of ten capital construction projects  are inviting biddings, such as an international airport and a  railway in the Pudong New Area, a deep-water container port and  a sewage disposal project.    The city has encouraged cooperation among large state-owned  enterprises and big international conglomerates, expecting to  launch a group of joint projects featuring high technology and  products with high quality and good market outlook.    The city's tertiary industry has also seen fast development.    The country's "Wall Street" on the west bank of the Huangpu  River is taking shape. Commercial housing and renovation of the  old downtown have progressed smoothly.    So far, the city has approved 8,551 foreign-funded projects,  with promised investment of 17.57 billion U.S. dollars.    In January-May this year, 1,612 such items were approved,  with a contractual investment of 3.85 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

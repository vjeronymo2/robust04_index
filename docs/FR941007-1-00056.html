			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies could have adjusted an institution's rating upward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the investment test to take into account whether the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments were particularly innovative or met a special need or whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's activities in connection with the investments were particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex or intensive. The agencies also would have been able to adjust an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's rating upward if the institution had made a large amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments that would have been qualified investments except that they failed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to benefit the institution's service area. Downward adjustments would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been justified only in exceptional cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters criticized several aspects of the proposal. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notably, many banking industry commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test's focus on the amount of qualified investments relative to an institution's risk-based capital. They felt reliance on any such investment-to-capital ratio would unfairly penalize well-capitalized institutions. Community groups commented on various aspects of how the term ``qualified investments'' was defined and the banking industry criticized the restriction that qualified investments must benefit the institution's service area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The investment test in the revised proposal has been modified to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the principal concerns raised in the comments. The reliance on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio of qualified investments to risk-based capital has been eliminated. Rather, under the revised proposal, the agencies would focus on the dollar amount of the institution's qualified investments (independent of the institution's capital), the innovativeness and complexity of the qualified investments and their connection to credit needs, and the institution's responsiveness to credit and community economic development needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the revised proposal clarifies the definition of ``qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments.'' <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Qualified investments are lawful investments, deposits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> membership shares in a credit union, and grants that primarily benefit low- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income individuals or businesses or farms with under $1 million in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual revenues or that qualify as small businesses under SBA regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that address affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development needs that are not being met in the normal course of business by the private market. The agencies intend the limitation regarding needs not being met by the private market to exclude untargeted municipal bonds and standard mortgage-backed securities. The revised proposal also would clarify that grants, membership shares in a credit union, and other non-loan financial support can qualify as qualified investments. Under the definition, a qualified investment would not otherwise be disqualified because an institution receives favorable treatment (for example as a tax deduction or credit) for them under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, under the revised proposal, qualified investments no longer would need to benefit an institution's service area, provided the investments benefit a broader statewide or regional geographic area that includes the institution's service area. This change would conform with the broader geographic scope permitted for community development loans discussed previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of qualified investments identified by the agencies include, but are not limited to, investments and grants: in or to financial intermediaries (including, but not limited to CDFIs, CDCs, minority- and women-owned financial institutions, and low-income or community development credit unions) that primarily lend or facilitate lending in low- and moderate-income areas or to low- and moderate-income individuals in order to promote affordable housing and/or community economic development; in support of organizations engaged in affordable housing rehabilitation and construction, including multifamily rental housing; in support of organizations promoting small businesses, including Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), and specialized SBICs; in and to not-for-profit organizations serving low- and moderate-income housing needs and/or other community economic development needs; to support or develop facilities that promote community economic development in low- and moderate-income areas or for low- and moderate-income individuals, such as day care facilities, in projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits; in state and municipal obligations that specifically support affordable housing or other community economic development to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals or areas; to not-for-profit organizations serving low- and moderate-income housing and/or other community economic development needs, such as home-ownership counseling, home maintenance counseling, credit counseling, and other financial services education; and in or to organizations supporting activities essential to the capacity of low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies to utilize credit or to sustain economic development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised proposal deletes the definition of small business from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the December proposal that some commenters criticized as too complicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, the qualified investment and community development loan definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer to investments and loans that benefit businesses with annual revenues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under $1 million or that would qualify as small businesses under a Small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Business Administration program. The $1 million figure was chosen because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used in Regulation B to differentiate among borrowers for requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning adverse action notices and application retention. The new proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions also maintain a treatment of small business that conforms to the SBA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions, as required by law for federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

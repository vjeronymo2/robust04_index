			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva by Celia Cahim and </F> Gilberto Nascimento on 13 January; place not given]    [Text] [JORNAL] How will the two events that recently  occurred in the ABC [Santo Adre, Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao  Caetano do Sul, industrial area] -- namely the murder of trade  unionist Oswaldo Cruz Junior and the attack on two trade  unionists linked to Cruz which took place a week later -- affect  your candidacy?    [Lula] The sectors that seek to implicate the PT [Workers  Party] do so precisely because they expect it will adversely  affect my image and standing in public opinion polls. We wish  to tell the public that moves like this against the PT have been  attempted several times in the past, even to the abduction of  Abilio Diniz in 1989. I do not expect any of my political  enemies to sing my praises. I have no illusions about that.  What concerns me is that there seems to be no hurry to capture  the murderer so that he can explain why he did it. With regard  to the alleged attack [on the trade unionists], there are also  very contradictory reports. We will once again circumvent the  problem and prove that this dirty trick on the PT, which began  immediately prior to the elections in 1989, has now been  restarted nine months before the next elections.    [JORNAL] Do you think you took too long to react to  allegations concerning the PT's involvement in these events?    [Lula] No. Following my political strategy, and out of  respect for his widow, Valeria [Cruz], I had no interest  whatsoever in getting involved in an altercation when the  deceased had not even been buried. Furthermore, I believe the  truth will out. It is already coming into the open via some odd  coincidences -- the same police superintendent of the Diniz case  is involved, the same accusations are being leveled by the same  enemies, and the same insinuations are being made by the press.  Fortunately, these two cases will be settled in a speedy  fashion. Once Zeze [Jose Benedito de Souza] is arrested, we  will know who is who in this story. The same old vultures, who  were thirsting for prey, are already leaving.    [JORNAL] Following that line of thought, you can expect to  come under intense fire until October. Are you ready to face,  let us say, another issue similar to the one involving Miriam  Cordeiro? [who named Lula on television as the father of her  child]    [Lula] If I were not prepared, I would not be a candidate. I  base my actions on the following premise: When voters cast  their votes in the ballot-box, they choose the candidate who can  solve the problems that confront their country, city, or state.  They are not interested in his private life.    [JORNAL] But you are dealing with people who have not gone  to  the polls for 30 years and therefore lack that degree of  political maturity.    [Lula] I will lead my campaign at the highest possible  level.  This will entail a certain degree of politicization of our  society. We will not play the game the same way as our  adversaries. We will not exploit everything that pertains to  political charges. I am not interested to know whether a person  drank or not, or whether he smoked marijuana when he was young.  That is his problem, not mine.    [JORNAL] And yet, your adversaries are interested in  learning  about and publicizing your past indiscretions.    [Lula] I have no problem with that. They can do as they  please. I cannot campaign for the presidency with fear. If the  people want a program that provides solutions for the problem of  hunger, health care, agricultural policy, and income  distribution, they have a candidate. If they want to vote for  those who practice foul play, I will be deeply sorry because  Brazil will fare worse at the end of the century than at the  beginning.    [JORNAL] Is the Brazil you envisage a socialist state?    [Lula] No. We want to implement a government program which,  regardless of its name, understands the need to resume a  different type of growth from the one that characterized the  1970's and to implement an income distribution policy. We  cannot just emulate European or U.S. development models. We  need a national development program to help transform the 150  million Brazilians into citizens.    [JORNAL] Are you a socialist?    [Lula] I do not like labels. I am a lathe operator and a  mechanic. The PT does not intend to govern the country  following a socialist-style model. We are separating what is a  strategic program, a dream of society, a utopia, from a  five-year government program. If we manage to solve our basic  problems, we will undoubtedly bring about a revolution --  regardless of its name.    [JORNAL] What is the difference between the program of the  PT and the others?    [Lula] We are going to do the obvious. We guarantee that  within five years all children of school age will be attending  school. We guarantee that within five years there will be a  health system under which people will not be treated like  animals. We guarantee that this country will produce 150  million tonnes of grain, instead of making a lot of fuss about  our present 70 million-tonne production. Each person will have  the right to three meals a day. These are basic things which,  if accomplished, would be tantamount to a revolution. People  keep discussing privatization, nationalization, opening borders,  etc. when reality shows that our people are famished,  unemployed, and overcome by despair.    [JORNAL] But important sectors want answers for those issues  that you relegate to second place, seeking to assure  governability.    [Lula] Nobody will close our borders, but by the same token,  nobody will open the sluices so that our country becomes a  duty-free zone. This is why we want to devise a national  project to provide a strong industry and import quotas. It is  all very well to talk about opening our borders, but it would be  even better to know who will solve the problem of unemployment  in Brazil. The role of the state is to find a way to create  more jobs. Brazil cannot be a modern country with only 30  million consumers. It will become a modern country when  children have shoes, schooling, milk, and health care. This is  the project we want to implement and that everybody promises to  further during the election campaign. [Former President  Fernando] Collor said that his modernization project would place  our country on a same footing as France. The truth is that we  resemble Ethiopia. One need only look under the bridges.    [JORNAL] In your view, what is modernity?    [Lula] It is not the modernity of Norwegian codfish or  imported cars. Those who can afford to buy an imported car may  do so. Nevertheless, our priority is that people may be able to  eat, work, and live decently. This is the miracle we want to  perform in Brazil and we are convinced that it may be  accomplished.    [JORNAL] Is it possible to accomplish that miracle in just  five years?    [Lula] Part of it can be accomplished in five years. We can  set goals to be attained in two, three years. We will ensure  that Macapa city dwellers, for example, do not have to eat  tomatoes from Sao Paulo. Our agricultural policy should create  green belts around each city so that people may obtain their  staples at more reasonable prices.    [JORNAL] What would you tell those who fear that your  victory  might be the victory of an old-style socialist? In past  elections, your adversaries convinced some of the electorate  that you were going to divide three-bedroom apartments.    [Lula] The most reactionary sectors think like that, but  society already knows the PT administrative experience. There  was a time when a politician could distinguish himself by  building a great viaduct, but that is over. The people want to  know: Is my street paved? Does it have a sidewalk? Brazil  needs an about-face.    [JORNAL] How will this about-face affect the financial  sector?    [Lula] During a meeting with bankers, I told them that banks  will continue to operate normally, but that the financial system  cannot continue to fuel inflation as a way to make more money.  In the industrialized world, banks have a 4-percent  participation in the GDP, whereas in Brazil that percentage goes  as high as 13 percent. Here, the Central Bank makes money  through speculation, the Social Security makes money through  speculation. Many people foster speculation to make money.    [JORNAL] How can one check this?    [Lula] The financial system must be convinced that it can  make money by supporting the productive sector. I intend to  discuss with the financial system an agreement to extend the  profile of the government's domestically contracted debt. In  Italy, the domestic debt represents 5 percent of the GDP while  inflation runs at 6 percent. Here in Brazil, our domestic debt  represents 24 percent of the GDP and the inflation stands at 40  percent a month. The basic difference is the time-frame of the  rescheduling of the debt. Italian securities have a 20-year or  30-year maturity; here one has to pay every three months.    [JORNAL] What have you discussed with representatives of  foreign companies and businessmen?    [Lula] I have told them of the great harm we can cause by  obliging them to double their production. We do not want to  continue to be a country with 30 million consumers. I have  explained that we do not want to act like hustlers in the dead  of the night acting without agreements. We want to establish  clear rules of the games with businessmen and workers, and  demand that these rules be obeyed. Sometimes I prefer a  gentleman's agreement to a law. We will work to encourage  foreign capital to invest in Brazil. Obviously, I cannot  implement a program to only please Volkswagen. I must implement  a program to please the 150 million Brazilians, a program in  which the neediest will take priority over the rest.    [JORNAL] How will you tackle the privatization issue?    [Lula] Strategic industries will continue to be owned by the  state. We want public companies, not state-owned enterprises.  Why public? Because they will not have a huge payroll nor will  they be obsolete. They will be modern companies that offer  better services. I have time and again said that oil is  strategic; so much so that the United States did not hesitate to  spend $30 billion on the war against Iraq to preserve its  international reserves. The current telecommunications system,  in which the state retains control while freeing the production  of equipment, is interesting. We will not engage in a drive  that may render the state vulnerable. With regard to the  privatization of highways, entrepreneurs are interested in the  Dutra, Anchieta, Imigrantes, and Bandeirantes highways. Nobody  wants the Rio de Janeiro-Bahia highway to be privatized. Why  don't businessmen create a pool [previous word in English] to  construct new highways and then manage them? They should  repatriate the money that they have invested abroad.    [JORNAL] You are criticized for your lack of administrative  experience and for not having a regular job. What do you have  to say about this?    [Lula] Recalling Collor's experience, I may venture to say  that I do not envy the administrative experience of the  Brazilian elite. The purchasing power of the workers declined by  50 percent since 1985 and 32 million people live in squalor.  What administrative experience are we talking about? The  experience of hiring building contractors for great public works  just to collect the bribes they offer is not and will not be the  slogan of my government campaign. I am proud to say that I am an  official working for my party. I work at least 10 times harder  than when I was a metallurgist.    [JORNAL] Who will fund your election campaign?    [Lula] We hope to obtain contributions from people and  firms.  We will open a bank account to receive contributions. We will  do everything above board and tell businessmen -- those who want  to contribute to my campaign do not have to do so via a secret  account.    [JORNAL] Public opinion polls show that 30 percent of the  people would vote for you. Do you believe you have already won  the election?    [Lula] No. The election campaign begins after the party  conventions, when all the parties register their candidates.  And yet to head the polls for such a long time, withstanding  the vollies of taunts I have to endure, really shows that my  candidacy is very strong. I am convinced that we will win in a  runoff. If we work in an upright manner we may score an  election victory in the first round. One should be aware that  the game is just beginning, that everything remains to be done,  and that one is not successful at the polls until after the vote  count is over.    [JORNAL] Against whom will you fight the runoff?    [Lula] I am not concerned with choosing adversaries. Part of  the elite, the most conservative one, is an orphan. For all its  efforts, it has no candidate. I have no doubt that these  elections will be hotly contested. There will be at least five  or six candidates and I do not know who I would like to face in  the runoff. I would rather defeat them all in the first round.    [JORNAL] If you are elected president you will have to  confront pressures from both the elite and the working class.    [Lula] We are well aware that on one hand an elite force  will  pressure us in an attempt to hinder us from governing, while on  the other hand millions of workers will pressure us to overcome  in three months problems that have not been solved for  centuries. We are not going to wait until the campaign is over  to start holding talks. This is why we want to draft a very  feasible program. Pressure is important and is a peculiar trait  of democracy.    [JORNAL] But, does the PT have cadres to govern?    [Lula] Following the cabinets of Collor, Itamar Franco, and  Jose Sarney, saying that the PT does not have cadres is a bit of  a joke. For each of their cadres, we have 10. But I do not  intend to form a government only from PT cadres. I will look  for people outside the party who are honest, able, and  politically aware of the social problems confronting the  country. We want to form alliances not only to win the  elections but also to rule the country.    [JORNAL] Will you demand guarantees from the military?    [Lula] I am going to talk with the military. I want to hold  talks with the Army, Navy, and Aeronautics ministers because  they represent consolidated and necessary institutions. I want  to know their views about Brazil and about the problems of each  branch of the Armed Forces. I am going to take that initiative  and try to discuss things at the War College; but I am not going  to demand guarantees, because the role of the Armed Forces is  defined in the Constitution.    [JORNAL] What can you say to dispel any misgivings about  Lula's government.    [Lula] Entrepreneurs could have misgivings if the PT were  involved in corrupt practices, if it were involved the Budget  Committee, or if public works were over invoiced. To be afraid  of honesty is sui generis. There is no need for anybody to be  afraid.    [JORNAL] And yet, the left wing of the PT even scares the  middle class.    [Lula] The left wing of the PT is necessary. Any party with  any self-respect has a left and a right wing. We do not want to  be a government with a subservient party. We want society to  nudge us all the time. The PT government does not wish to  become the prisoner of that glass case called Planalto Palace.</p>

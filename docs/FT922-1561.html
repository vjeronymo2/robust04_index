			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: Brother slims down bloated product range - The Japanese equipment maker has embarked on a critical restructuring In the foyer of the Brother Industries building, a smiling photograph of Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, congratulates the Japanese company on sitting at the top table of Olympic corporate sponsors along with Coca-Cola, 3M, Philips and a few others. Having already paid for its high profile, Brother should be able to bask in Olympic year publicity. Instead, the year of Barcelona has become an important test of strength for the maker of information equipment, sewing machines and other household electric appliances. With profits under pressure, Brother has just announced a restructuring plan that could become commonplace among Japanese manufacturers, many of which are burdened by too broad a product range and struggling in overcrowded consumer and business equipment markets. Another problem not unique to Brother is the side-effect of having achieved the admirable aim of producing high-quality goods at reasonable cost - the company has consistently reported poor operating profits and has been dependent on non-operating items, such as profits on stock sales, to boost its earnings. The weakness of Japanese stock prices has not only increased the cost of capital for manufacturers such as Brother, which lifted its long-term institutional borrowing from zero to Y3bn (Dollars 23.8m) last year, but it has also denied the traditional easy profits on marketable securities. For Brother, these circumstances were behind a mediocre operating profit of Y486m last year, down from Y2.35bn. The company would have reported a loss were it not for a change in pension plan accounting that produced an operating gain of Y669m. Sales for the year were down from Y166bn to Y165.2bn. Net profit rose slightly from Y3.2bn to Y3.6bn, thanks mainly to a Y1.1bn increase in gains on property and equipment sales, and an extra Y699m in gains on stocks sold. In response, Brother plans to cut its product range by about 30 per cent to 700 items, transfer 10 per cent of its 5,300 Japanese workers to new ventures, increase the percentage of parts produced in-house, and make research and development operations more market sensitive. Mr Tamotsu Shimizu, the company's managing director, said a slowing economy had forced the restructuring. Office automation equipment and industrial machinery markets, already overflowing with competitors, were made all the more difficult by capital spending cuts. Meanwhile, sales of its old mainline product, home sewing machines, rose by 16 per cent. He reckons that reducing the product line by 30 per cent will reduce sales by only 10 per cent, as the items to be discarded are clearly not Brother's best sellers. At the same time, the company is hoping that a focus on successful products will eventually lead to an increase in sales and, most importantly, stronger profits. 'If it's not contributing to profits, we will no longer make it. Sometimes you continue to produce a loss-making item because it is something that your customers want and you have to keep their loyalty,' Mr Shimizu said. Items to be pruned, he says, will include white goods and older-style sewing machines. Asked whether the company had tolerated losses in order to secure market share, tilted his head back, closed his eyes and said: 'Yes, that's true.' He explained, for example, that US discount stores wanted high-volume, low-cost deals that sometimes force a company to take losses. Mr Shimizu pointed to a curious contradiction that Brother was trying to resolve. Its international sales division is wholly owned and tends to produce good-quality market research material for product developers, while market trends are less well-tracked at home, where sales are handled by an affiliate of the company. 'Within Japan, we have been product-driven and we have got to become more market oriented,' Mr Shimizu said. Again, Brother is one of many Japanese manufacturers reaching this conclusion, as the boom years of the late 1980s  -when GNP expanded at 6 per cent and 7 per cent and the stock market soared  -gave over-confident producers the impression that virtually anything would sell. During this period, companies rapidly introduced slight variations on existing products and also attempted to squeeze into new markets. The steel companies elbowed their way into electronics, the camera makers attempted to re-establish themselves as office equipment companies, and the consumer electronics makers launched hundreds of new items each year. Times have changed. Japanese car makers are at least talking about slowing the flow of their new releases, while Hitachi, the consumer and commercial electronics company, wants to lengthen the life-cycle of its products to reduce expenditure on research and development. But, in spite of weak earnings and murmurings about reform, most companies are yet to bite the bullet, and there are doubts as to whether Brother's changes go far enough. For example, the planned shift in parts sourcing only aims to increase in-house components from 12 per cent to 13 per cent of all parts. The company also wants to maintain Japanese production at 80 per cent of the total, though it hints that south-east Asian and Chinese factories will probably take a larger share if profits continue to falter. Mr Shimizu is confident that the success of new ventures will allow the company to soak up excess labour, making redundancies unnecessary. One of those new ventures is a karaoke (singing machine) systems company, Joysound, of which he is a director. Brother plans to provide karaoke hardware and software in Japan, and would eventually like to go international. However, the company could find the karaoke room as crowded as the white goods market and, in two years the company may be reckoning as to whether the start-up funds could have been better spent shoring up its postion in information equipment, which accounts for about 40 per cent of sales. The company is genuinely reassessing the cost of being an Olympic star, and contemplating whether to be a corporate front-runner again at the 1996 games in Atlanta. 'They want a lot more money for Atlanta,' explained Mr Shimizu, aware that Brother's presence in the main stadium is less important than its survival in the market.</p>

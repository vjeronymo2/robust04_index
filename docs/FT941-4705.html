			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Waldegrave says he will not resign Mr William Waldegrave yesterday said he had no intention of resigning as the minister for public services and science over his comments that ministers had to lie in exceptional circumstances. But as the prime minister gave his public backing to his cabinet colleague, Downing Street was forced on to the defensive by a request from Lord Callaghan for Mr Waldegrave to 'clear my name'. This was after Mr Waldegrave said the former Labour prime minister had told untruths during the devaluation crisis of 1967. Clearly angered by Mr Waldegrave's comments, Lord Callaghan emphasised that he had chosen his words very carefully, but that he had never lied to the Commons. Comments later released on behalf of Mr Waldegrave sought to make it clear that the minister had not criticised Lord Callaghan's actions. The comments stressed that the former prime minister was working 'in extremely difficult circumstances'. Mr Waldegrave 'specifically recognised Mr Callaghan's difficulties and believed he behaved with propriety. If Lord Callaghan now feels that Mr Waldegrave has impugned his integrity it is very clear that is not the case.' Downing Street described the devaluations under Labour governments in 1949 and 1967 as 'exceptional circumstances in unusual times'. It was clear, however, that Mr John Major continued to believe ministers 'must be truthful and not mislead the Commons'. Mr Waldegrave had pointed to two Labour chancellors, Lord Callaghan and Sir Stafford Cripps, who had been forced to mislead the Commons in order to try to prevent the devaluation of the pound. Mr Major said: 'Mr Waldegrave answered an intelligent question frankly about what had happened under another government a quarter of a century ago.' The prime minister was asked on the BBC whether lying could be justified in parliament. He replied: 'Nobody can and nobody does.' Mr Waldegrave, asked by Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2 whether he thought he was going to keep his job, replied: 'That is entirely up to the prime minister. If ministers are going to be fired for telling the truth, we are going to get into a very difficult pickle.' Mr Waldegrave later told his colleagues that he had no intention of resigning. Asked earlier if he had blundered by being too honest, he said: 'If the new line of attack is to say we really don't want ministers to tell the truth on these matters, we want ministers who give weasel words, I suppose I plead guilty.'</p>

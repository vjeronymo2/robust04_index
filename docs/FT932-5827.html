			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / DTI report into Astra cost Pounds 2.1m THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's report into Astra, the defence company which went into receivership last year, has been completed at a cost of Pounds 2.1m. Some witnesses have complained that the time taken to complete the inquiry - three years after the inspectors were appointed - has adversely affected their careers. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said in a letter to one of the witnesses that the timetable might have been affected by factors outside the inspectors' control, including 'the failure of some witnesses to attend or delays in providing information'. The first draft of the report was sent to up to 25 witnesses last summer and contained criticisms of former directors of Astra and its former auditors, Stoy Hayward. In a move believed to have resulted from the DTI inquiry, Mr Paul Smith, a corporate finance partner who worked on the Astra account at Stoy Hayward, is now to spend most of his time on internal computer projects. Mr Philip Rusted, an audit partner working on the account, left the firm in March last year.</p>

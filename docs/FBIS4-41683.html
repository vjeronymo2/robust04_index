			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "One Billion Dollars in </F> Investments Is Not Enough for Russia: The Consultative Council  Is Hoping To Radically Change the Situation"]    [Text] Just $1 billion -- that is the expected volume of  direct foreign investments in the Russian economy this year.  According to Yakov Urinson, first deputy economy minister, this  is even less than in Estonia, which is a "very small country."    In an attempt to stimulate interest among investors -- both  Western and Eastern -- in Russia, a Consultative Council for  Foreign Investments is being created under the Russian  Government and will hold its first session in Moscow next Monday  under the chairmanship of Viktor Chernomyrdin. The leaders of  14 large corporations which either already are investing money  in our economy or are intending to do so have been invited onto  the council, whose main function, as far as may be judged from  comments by government spokesmen, will be to outline or adjust  the general course and strategy of Russia's investment policy.    There is, of course, a certain risk that the council may be  turned into a powerful grouping, which will promote the  interests of the corporations represented on it. But in  conversation with journalists Urinson ruled that risk out,  stressing that the council's activity "will not be dedicated to  specific investment projects but will be concentrated solely on  questions of principle."    It is expected that at the first session the Russian  Government will unveil a set of measures designed to increase  the influx of foreign money. The plan will include among other  things draft amendments to the recent law on foreign  investments, which, from the Moscow White House viewpoint, is  not entirely adequate to our present-day economic realities. It  is not impossible that the plan will finally answer the question  which is being actively debated in the government itself and  outside it, namely whether it is worth creating special  conditions for foreign investors. In the view of the deputy  minister of the economy (his "personal" view, as he stressed),  "this hardly neerds to be done." I wonder whether his opinion  will prove decisive.    One final point: There is clearly some irony in the fact  that the U.S. banking corporation, Citicorp, figures among the  council's members. This corporation, which is undoubtedly a  major potential investor, is affected by the restrictions  contained in the president's edicts on the activities of foreign  banks in Russia.</p>

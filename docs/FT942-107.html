			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bluebird Toys graduates to main market As foreshadowed at the annual meeting last month, Bluebird Toys is graduating from the USM to the main market. Dealings in the ordinary shares and convertible loan stock will commence on July 4. The directors, headed by Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, have already forecast a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.99m to not less than Pounds 6.5m for the first half of 1994. Earlier this week Mr Norman disposed of 275,000 ordinary shares via a private placing through Smith New Court Securities. The sale followed the appointment of Mr Chris Burgin as group chief executive and Mr Norman's relinquishment of that role.</p>

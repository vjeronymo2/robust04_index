			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe lifted Confirmation that British Aerospace was to sell its corporate jets business to Raytheon, of the US, for Pounds 250m sent the shares 16 ahead to 355p, a high for this year. Analysts were particularly cheered by the higher than anticipated price received for the business, particularly after a similar deal collapsed last September. One researcher said: 'They have sold it for more than we expected. It strengthens the balance sheet and improves shareholders' funds.' The shares are now in a new trading range, having broken through the 340p barrier for the first time in nearly a year. Volume was 3m by the close. Whispers of a rate cut added support to some consumer stocks, among them Whitbread, the shares moving forward 8 to 485p, albeit in poor volume. Scottish &amp; Newcastle firmed 2 to 449p. Luxury hotel group Savoy crept forward as weekend press speculation over the intentions of Forte gained momentum. The latter, which owns 42 per cent of Savoy's voting shares, has not confirmed reports that it is to appoint a former Savoy executive to its management team. The speculation was given extra spice by suggestions that Forte could legally break out of its agreement not to bid for Savoy before 1994. Savoy shares climbed 10 to 785p. Forte was a penny cheaper at 193p. BT appreciated 4 1/2 to 426 1/2 p in the wake of a number of bullish broker recommendations ahead of the BT III issue, notably from SG Warburg, BZW and Daiwa Securities. New subscriber numbers for last month failed to produce any substantial movement in Vodafone, 2 easier at 427p. Glaxo was in firm fettle, moving ahead 9 to 618p on turnover of 1.2m, with Lehman Brothers, the US stockbroker, said to have been keen supporters of the shares. Wellcome, badly mauled last week by worries about US policy towards drug manufacturers, was a much steadier market, recovering 5 to 776p on 1.1m traded. Talk of a broker's recommendation lifted Reckitt &amp; Colman 3 to 578p. News of the Pounds 19.3m provision against its construction business shocked dealers in Shanks &amp; McEwen, who marked the shares down to 153p before a late rally left the stock a net 7 cheaper at 162p. The market's two newcomers put on diverging debut performances. OGC International, the oil services group, proved a disappointment, opening at a 5p premium to the placing price but subsequently sliding back to close at 127p after hefty trading of 5.3m shares. On the other hand, the day's other newcomer, Phonelink, the computer software company whose shares were placed at 155p, attracted a flurry of strong support and finished at 218p. Other software companies that have come to the market in recent months, namely Tadpole and Quality Software, have delivered exceptionally strong performances in the after market. Lasmo, which until last week had languished at the bottom of the FT-SE 100 list until ECC came under pressure and ultimately dropped out of the premier index to make way for Zeneca, attracted renewed support. The shares edged up 2 to 155p on relatively high turnover of 1.7m shares, amid hints that the group could be about to announce more asset sales, hard on the heels of last week's US bond issue. British Petroleum dipped 3 to 304 1/2 p on 6.7m traded, in the wake of news that the company is seriously considering the flotation on Wall Street of its US animal feeds division, Purina Mills. Confirmation of encouraging drilling news from the North Sea saw Goal Petroleum edge up a penny to 54p. Specialist printer De La Rue reported a good set of results, at the top end of analysts forecasts, This, together with an upbeat message, enabled the shares to advance strongly - although profit-taking eventually limited them to a rise of 3 to 668p. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 77.9m to Pounds 104.7m, while turnover increased to Pounds 559.5m from Pounds 415.4m. Rolls-Royce shed a penny to 144p after cautious comments from Strauss Turnbull and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Interim figures ahead of market expectations boosted Westland Group. Profits jumped 23 per cent to Pounds 12.8m. The shares gained 14 to 187p as analysts moved to upgrade year-end forecasts. Charterhouse Tilney added Pounds 2m to its original forecast and now predicts year-end profits of Pounds 29m. GKN, which has a 28 per cent stake in Westland, gained 7 at 464p, cheered by the positive sentiment in the latter. Talk of a rights issue weakened Siebe, which reports full year figures today. The shares gave up 5 to 460p. Zeneca's debut in the premier FT-SE 100 listings was at the expense of English China Clays. The loss of its position in the listings unsettled the stock in early dealings and at the day's worst the shares were down 16 at 401p. However, they later recovered with the firm market trend to close a penny lower at 413p. Executive changes at Dalgety left the food group just a penny adrift at 428p. A negative note, said to be from UBS, saw United Biscuits decline, aided by the receding takeover talk which has hounded the stock in recent months. The shares weakened 10 to 389p. In a muted food retail sector, J. Sainsbury and Tesco clawed back some ground after recent weakness, closing 5 ahead at 489p and 4 1/2 up at 226 1/2 p respectively. Boots also recovered ground, ahead of interim results due tomorrow, for which the market expects profits in the region of Pounds 400m to Pounds 420m. The shares improved 7 to 445p.</p>

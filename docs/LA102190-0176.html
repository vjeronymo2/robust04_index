			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER HAS CLUB ADVISER ROLE DOWN TO SCIENCE  </P> <P> Sofia Pappatheodorou is the first to admit she doesn't fit the profile of a  typical science teacher.  </P> <P> "So often scientists are so rigid," said Pappatheodorou, who is anything but  typical as an adviser to the Science Society student club at Cal State  Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> The Science Society was recently honored for the second consecutive year by a  national chemists' organization as one of 12 outstanding student groups in the  nation.  </P> <P> It takes just a few minutes of talking to club members to find out that  Pappatheodorou, an associate chemistry professor who has been teaching for more  than 10 years, is a big reason the club has been so successful. The outgoing,  energetic Pappatheodorou has immersed herself in the club and has rejuvenated  student interest in the sciences, school officials say.  </P> <P> Her approach to science is to make it fun. Pappatheodorou recently organized a  magic show where a guest speaker mixed chemicals to show a variety of  reactions, some of which produced minor explosions.  </P> <P> Pappatheodorou was one of the primary founders of the club in 1986, and it has  since grown from a small number of students to about 45 last year. In addition,  22 faculty members were associate members last year. Pappatheodorou said she  hopes even more students and faculty will be involved this year.  </P> <P> The group's activities encompass all fields of science and include sponsoring  lectures by professionals, panel discussions, slide presentations, field trips,  luncheons and social outings. The club is open to all students.  </P> <P> The American Chemical Society recognized the Dominguez Hills group this month  as an outstanding student chapter. Every year, the society's student chapters  -- about 850 -- submit an annual report of their activities. Certain chapters  are selected as either outstanding or commendable, according to Rita Boggs,  chairwoman of the society's Southern California section. The national society  was impressed by the number and quality of activities of the Dominguez Hills  chapter, said Linda Ross, a spokeswoman for the organization's education  division.  </P> <P> "They have a significant lecture series, and a number of their students present  research at our local and national conferences," Ross said.  </P> <P> The organization was also impressed by Pappatheodorou, Ross said. "Sofia  exemplifies the wonderful, nurturing characteristics that turn people on to the  sciences," Ross said.  </P> <P> Contrary to popular perceptions, science is interesting, said Deborah Ward, a  senior biology major. "You get to light things on fire -- that's fun," she  said.  </P> <P> Pappatheodorou said she stresses a personal touch. She is known for lending a  sympathetic ear to students with personal problems and for giving rides to club  members in need of transportation. She shares her small office with students,  who store their backpacks there, use her computer and typewriter or just hang  out -- even when she's not around.  </P> <P> "She's such a caring person," said Ledford Powell, a biology senior and club  treasurer. "She's the most wonderful instructor I've ever met. She's like a  mother figure."  </P> <P> Oliver Seely, chairman of the chemistry department, said Pappatheodorou has  given the department a new profile since her arrival in 1985.  </P> <P> "She is so bubbly, so enthusiastic -- it's something to really rejoice about,"  Seely said. "What we have in Sofia is somebody that came in who has a real love  for the students, who wants to be close to them and get to know them. By and  large, the field has been populated by people in the past who are, if not  aloof, at least distant."  </P> <P> Science is often thought to be time-consuming, difficult work -- a perception  that intimidates students and discourages them from entering science-related  fields, Pappatheodorou said. So she makes a point of dispensing with "highbrow"  airs and "highfalutin" language, she said. To that end, many of the Science  Society's activities are down to earth.  </P> <P> Seely said the Science Society serves as a potentially strong recruiting tool  and should attract students to the school's science departments over the next  several years.  </P> <P> Chemistry senior Anthony Del Real said he changed his major from psychology to  chemistry a few years ago after becoming involved in the club and taking a  class with Pappatheodorou.  </P> <P> "It's a nice relationship, teacher to person," he said. "You don't get lost in  the shuffle like you would at a larger school."  </P> <P> Seely said he hopes students such as Del Real will help reverse declining  enrollment in the chemistry department. In keeping with a national trend toward  fewer students entering the sciences, the number of chemistry majors at Cal  State Dominguez Hills -- 21 -- is the lowest it has been in six years, he said.  </P></p>

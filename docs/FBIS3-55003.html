The Chechen government on Sunday [2 Janaury] banned  delegates  of the local clans to hold a congress in Shali designed to  announce general elections in the republic. Its organizers told  INTERFAX the forum was annulled in order to avoid violence. The  council of local clans and ethnic groups says it will announce  the timing of a new forum within hours before it opens.    Khalidov warned against attempts to try to accuse President  Dzhokhar Dudayev of dictatorial habits and seeking to bring an  end to democratic reforms. He blamed politicians in the  President's entourage for playing on some traits of Dudayev's  character and occasionally offering ill advice.    Officials in Groznyy say the congress is illegal because the  council of local clans was not officially registered.  Parliamentary Chairman Akhyad Idigov, in an interview with  INTERFAX, described the forum as a step back and an attempt to  try to split the Chechens.    In the meantime, moderate opposition leaders in the  recalcitrant Nadterechny region, which refused to be ruled by  Groznyy in June 1992, have described as unproductive attempts to  try to call a forum of Chechen clans. It would be much better  to rally effort in creating a healthy opposition to the  dictatorial regime in Groznyy instead, they told INTERFAX.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: CBI chief says Smith's plans could lead to slump LABOUR's plans for a sharp increase in the taxation of individuals earning more than Pounds 22,000 a year could abort economic recovery and turn the UK's recession into a slump, Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, warned last night. Although Sir John took care not to mention Labour by name, his unusually blunt speech made clear that the party's taxation policies, outlined in Mr John Smith's shadow Budget, were the object of his attack. He told business executives in Sheffield that the tax plans proposed by Labour could result in a further fall for house prices and consumer confidence. Jobs would be lost throughout the UK as homeowners and taxpayers cut their spending, 'perhaps by as much as Pounds 20bn', he said. Sir John, who will soon retire from the CBI, added that proposals for a national minimum wage 'would rekindle inflation'. Labour's policies would damage the UK's competitive position and could hinder inward investment. He warned that CBI members would put their UK investment plans on ice in the event of Labour's policies being enacted, adding that 'the freeze might be a long one'. Shortly before Sir John spoke, a survey of business leaders by COBA, a management consultancy group, indicated that Labour has failed to win business support for its economic policies. In a poll of 100 top executives in industry, banking and commerce, the group found that 73 per cent thought that their company would be directly affected by a change of government, compared with 35 per cent when the same sample was polled in 1990. After netting out positive responses, COBA said a balance of 49 per cent expected a change in government would result in falling revenues for their company, while a net 48 per cent expected to cut employment. On balance, around four out of 10 executives expected to cut investment plans and become more risk-averse if the Conservatives lost the election. A net one in four forecast worse labour relations and indicated that they would consider shifting some of their operations abroad. The survey was conducted after the publication of the shadow Budget and contrasted with COBA's 1990 survey, when the majority of respondents felt that a change in government would be unlikely to affect their own industry. In the latest survey most executives interviewed by the consultancy thought that a Labour government would be bad for the UK economy. A net 81 per cent of interviewees expected interest rates to rise.</p>

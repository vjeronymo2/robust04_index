			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Letter: MP is critical of EC deciding fate of bids for Midland Bank Sir, Your front page story on May 5 claimed that 'Lloyds Bank had been taking advice from Keith Hampson. . .in its battle with Hongkong Bank for control of Midland'. This allegation has since been repeated in several newspapers. Let me make it clear that at no stage have I been an adviser to Lloyds Bank, nor had any discussions with it about its proposed offer for Midland. Nor have I been retained by GJW Government Relations, Lloyds' political advisers, since last summer. I have no financial interest in the outcome of the rival bids, but as a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Trade and Industry, I take an interest in the issues raised by them. The likely turn of events should cause concern. In particular there is the disturbing prospect that we shall be obliged to operate procedures which give foreign bidders an advantage over bids by British companies. Should the European Commission decide that consideration of the Hongkong bid is a proper matter for it and, as is currently the case, it considers only the effects on competition, then the Hongkong bid will almost certainly be cleared. Some competition issues do, however, arise over the proposed Lloyds bid; but should that bid be referred to our Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it virtually leaves the way open for Hongkong Bank. The future of the major high street banks surely raises public interest issues other than those of competition alone. All bids should be considered on the same playing field. The Select Committee's recent report on takeovers and mergers recommended that mergers which fall over EC thresholds but may materially affect UK interests, should be considered by the UK authorities. The only course of action that I can see which would prevent the Hongkong Bank from having a clear run, would be for the British government to claim that there are specific 'legitimate' non-competition UK interests which warrant examination by our MMC. The Commission would have to decide whether such a claim was compatible with Community law, but the government could bring any adverse ruling before the European court so as to clarify the scope of legitimate national interests. I suggest that, meanwhile, it would be a nonsense to allow the bid to go ahead and there would presumably be scope for the secretary of state to seek an injunction. This might at least ensure that the British bidder was less disadvantaged. Keith Hampson, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

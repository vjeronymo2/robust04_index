			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 18 (CTK) -- Czech Defense Minister  Antonin Baudys today denied the presence of biological weapons  in the Czech Republic, reported by the press on Thursday [17  March].    However, he told journalists that two banks of virus strains  which were used in research and for protection and defense  purposes were destroyed at his order.    He said in February he had been informed about the existence  of a bank of virus strains used in research in the Central  Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice.    The same applies to a similar bank in the Immunology and  Microbiology Institute of the Military Medical Academy in  Techonin, east Bohemia, of which he was informed in March.    These banks of virus strains were destroyed as there was no  further need in them, Baudys said, adding that the bank in the  Stresovice hospital was destroyed on February 25, and the bank  in Techonin at the beginning of March.    Baudys said a commission of experts from the Defense and  Health Ministries had been set up to study the matter. The  experts took necessary safety measures and destroyed the  strains. He said these substances were stored in minimum  amounts for medical purposes as they were used in research and  therefore served the defense purposes. They did not have the  nature of biological weapons and their storage did not  contradict the Geneva Convention through which the Czech  Republic had pledged not to develop, produce or store biological  weapons.    Baudys said he wanted to calm down the Czech public. He was  thus reacting to press reports on Thursday and today according  to which dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses have been  developed in the Military Medical Academy in Techonin to be used  for the production of biological weapons. The daily CESKY DENIK  wrote that these substances were stored at several places in the  Czech Republic. "These reports can "incite people's fantasy,"  Baudys said.    Specialists present at the press conference confirmed that  the virus strains designated for diagnostics were safely stored  in liquid nitrogen and their liquidation was also safe. They  said a bank of virus strains was created in the Techonin  institute in 1970- 1980 and was used for research, primarily for  the production of sera.    "Banal" strains, for example, viruses causing influenza made  up 80 percent of the strains stored in the bank, while only 20  percent were "especially dangerous and exotic" strains, director  of the Military Academy Vladimir Radovnicky said. He said there  was also a bank of diagnostic sera in the institute and this  will be preserved.    Ales Macela, pro-rector for research in the Military Medical  Academy, said the institute in Techonin was opened in 1972. He  said he had been working there since 1975 and there had never  been conditions there for the production of a larger amount of  microbes necessary to produce biological weapons.    He said the institute was dealing with immunological  research  and, among other things, with testing preparations. Tissues and  animals were used for this purposes. The institute is not  "particularly secret" and is accessible to foreign experts as  well, Macela said, adding that Swedish specialists visited the  institute last year.</p>

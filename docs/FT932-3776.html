			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Judgment reserved in Clowes appeal THREE APPEAL Court judges yesterday reserved judgment on the appeal by Mr Peter Clowes, the jailed financier, against his conviction on 10 charges of theft, John Mason writes. Mr Clowes, who is in Wandsworth prison serving a 10-year jail sentence, appealed against the theft charges, but not the eight counts of fraud of which he was also convicted at the end of his trial last February. He claimed that Barlow Clowes International had authority from investors to invest their money as it thought fit, and was more like a banking operation than a trust fund company. Mr Peter Naylor, who has served an 18-month sentence for theft, also appealed against his conviction. No date was set for the court to announce its decision.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): League offers cut in credit card costs - In a Nutshell Help is at hand for smaller companies that sometimes have to pay more than 5 per cent to process credit card transactions. From next week, companies that join the Independent Business League*, formed last year to represent smaller company interests, can expect cuts in charges on payments received by credit card. Members with average transactions of Pounds 150 or more will qualify for a 1.55 per cent rate. Those with smaller transaction sizes will pay between 1.7-3.0 per cent. The deal was negotiated with Barclays Merchant Services, the processor of about 40 per cent of plastic card purchases. *Details from the Independent Business League. Tel 0800 387085.</p>

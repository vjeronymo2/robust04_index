			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: A question mark over the UK's future prosperity WITH UK economic recovery apparently on the horizon, the big question now is whether Britain has capacity to exploit the opportunities ahead. Past experience and common sense suggest that a recession stretching over two and a half years will have destroyed a great deal of productive capacity, especially in manufacturing industry. That was certainly the case in the recession of 1979-81 when huge steel and engineering plants were shut, demolished, and eventually replaced by out-of-town shopping malls such as Merry Hill in the West Midlands and Meadowhall near Sheffield. The widespread fear is that the same process has been under way since 1990 and that this will limit the scope for recovery. But how valid are such concerns? A general impression, garnered from anecdotal evidence, is that this recession has not been accompanied by a massive scrapping of manufacturing capacity. Another encouraging sign is the strength of profit margins. In its recent quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reported that profit margins from non-North Sea activities have fallen far less in this recession than in those of the early 1980s or the mid-1970s. However, it is very difficult to estimate how much capacity has been lost or to measure the gap that has emerged between actual and potential output in the economy as a whole. Although this 'output gap' is vitally important for assessing the nation's capacity to grow out of the recession without running into inflationary bottlenecks, statistical deficiencies mean that nobody has a clear idea of its size. The Bank of England's inflation report included estimates that the gap could be around 7 per cent or 3 per cent, but the Bank made no judgment as to which was nearer the truth. In the case of manufacturing, however, economists at Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, suggest industry has come through the recession in 'surprisingly good shape' and the destruction of capacity has been far less than between 1979 and 1981. Two Kleinwort economists, Mr Peter Spencer and Mr Leo Doyle, have looked at Central Statistical Office estimates of manufacturing industry's capital stock and evidence on below-capacity working from the quarterly Confederation of British Industry industrial trends surveys. They conclude that the recession has not yet seriously reduced industry's productive capacity. Their view is broadly endorsed by Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economics and one of the seven-man panel of independent forecasters set up by the Treasury to advise Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. According to Mr Sentance, manufacturing capacity has declined slightly from its peak in 1990 but is about a fifth higher than at its post-recession trough in 1982. However, Mr Sentance points out such growth hardly constitutes good news. Business investment grew too slowly in the 1980s because an excessive portion of resources went to consumption. 'In the 1980s, the UK devoted a larger share of gross domestic product to public consumption than any other Group of Seven country and the proportion devoted to private consumption was the second highest after the United States,' he says. The UK's lagging investment performance has also been a matter of concern for Professor Douglas McWilliams, a former CBI economic adviser and chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), an economic consultancy. He says that UK manufacturing capacity has grown by only 20.5 per cent since 1970. Although it grew at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent from 1984 to 1991, this relatively strong growth failed to offset the deterioration relative to other countries that had taken place earlier. While UK manufacturing capacity grew by 19 per cent between 1970 and 1990, it increased by a total 43 per cent in Germany, France and Italy combined, by 86 per cent the US, and by 129 per cent in Japan. Between 1980 to 1990, the picture was slightly more encouraging. UK manufacturing capacity grew by 7 per cent compared with just 1 per cent in the continental 'big three' countries, but lagged the US and Japan where capacity grew by 32 per cent and 39 per cent respectively. So much for the bad news. Official figures suggest that UK investment is now picking up after a sharp fall of 9.4 per cent between 1990 and 1991 and a 3.5 per cent decline between 1991 and 1992. Capital spending by manufacturers on buildings, vehicles and machinery rose by a real, inflation-adjusted 3.1 per cent in the final six months of 1992 compared with the first half of that year and has now risen for three quarters in succession. Such an upward trend in investment is unprecedented in a recession and when CBI surveys say that about 70 per cent of companies are working below capacity. It should add to confidence about Britain's capacity for recovery. But the investment upturn may also reflect special factors. A CEBR study published last week showed that nearly one-fifth of the Pounds 220bn invested in British industry since 1987 had come from abroad. Some of this flow may start to tail off, particularly if the Japanese car industry has to address problems at home. The accelerating pace of technological change may also explain why investment now appears to be leading rather than lagging the business cycle. Mr David Owen, another of Kleinwort's economics team, suggests that spending on information technology may be behind the investment surge. A similar pattern of strongly rising investment in weak economic conditions was visible in the US in 1991 and 1992, reflecting the need of companies there to restructure and shrink and acquire the latest technology to compete successfully. Spending on rationalisation may not add significantly to growth. Indeed, the UK may simply be replacing the wrong sort of capacity with more efficient and up-to-date equipment. While such investment is clearly better than none at all, the danger is that Britain will still be left with a small and efficient manufacturing sector that is too small for the nation's future prosperity.</p>

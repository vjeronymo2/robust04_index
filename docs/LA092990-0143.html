			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUOTABLE  </P> <P> When Father Leonid Kishkovsky, 43, the first Eastern Orthodox president of the  National Council of Churches, was in Los Angeles this week he praised the  Soviet legislature for lifting a longtime ban on religious education at  churches and ended government funding of atheism classes:  </P> <P>  "Critically important in the new law . .  </P> <P> . is what appears to be the disengagement of the state from the propagation of  atheism. If the churches were given freedom of educating children but the state  continued to propagate atheism through the curriculum in schools, what you  would have is still second-class status for believers. That is a very  significant step . . . to create an even playing field, as it were. The law  removes the official advantages of atheism from education."  </P> <P> </P></p>

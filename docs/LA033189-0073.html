			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POST OSCAR  </P> <P> "Rain Man" has won screenwriter Barry Morrow an Oscar, and now the film may  also earn him a belated college degree. Some 20 years ago, Morrow left St. Olaf  College in Minnesota one credit short of graduation. He attended St. Olaf in  the late 1960s, transferred to the University of Hawaii for his junior year,  then returned to St. Olaf, but some credits were not transferred. Now, St.  Olaf's speech-theater department has said if he'll submit his script, it will  be graded and give him enough credit to graduate. "There's always something  perversely funny about coming one short of graduating," Morrow, 40, told the  Associated Press. "I didn't really matriculate until now as a professional  screenwriter, so it seems a good and fitting ceremony to celebrate the success  of 'Rain Man.' " AILEEN MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Earlier release for economic statistics ALL ECONOMIC statistics are to be released at 9.30am instead of 11.30am, the Central Statistical Office announced yesterday. The change, which takes place next week, was sought by the prime minister to give the City and financial markets more time to digest the information, and to stop the release of figures clashing with cabinet meetings. Downing Street yesterday said that the prime minister had also argued for the change partly to shorten the period when information was available without being made public. The move stemmed from a 'prime ministerial initiative that CSO were very happy to go along with', Downing Street said. The change fitted in with the prime minister's Citizen's Charter initiative and was 'good news for the users of statistics'. The CSO has already taken steps to limit access to sensitive information ahead of release. Statistics released by other departments, such as employment data, will follow suit. The new time of 9.30am is seen as a compromise between the markets, which want information released as early as possible, and journalists and government officials who are not in favour of an early start. Next week's figures for new construction orders will be the first official statistics to be released at the new time. The old release time of 11.30am was already an improvement for the markets on the previous time of 3.30pm. One City analyst commented yesterday: 'This shows that the CSO is catching up with the working day of the City, and the new release time is good news for lunches.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 26 May (SUNA) -- Sudan has expressed  extreme sorrow over the state of affairs in fraternal Yemen and  called on the brothers in Yemen to be guided by wisdom and act  as friends in resolving their existing differences by way of  dialogue and negotiations. Sudan appealed to the brothers in  Yemen to preserve their unity which constitutes the only way of  emerging from the current crisis.    This was stated in a communique issued by the Foreign  Ministry regarding the situation in fraternal Yemen. The  communique said the Sudanese Government hailed all the  praiseworthy and sincere efforts being made by the Arab League  and a number of Arab states towards resolving the conflict and  fratricidal bloodletting in Yemen. The statement declared  Sudan's readiness to do everything in its power to reconcile the  conflicting sides in fraternal Yemen so that Yemen would remain  strong in the face of foreign interference and the plots being  hatched against it by some enemies and would be able to  persevere totally in performing its role among the brothers in  the Arab world.</p>

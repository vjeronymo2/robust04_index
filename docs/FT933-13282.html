			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: L&amp;G reports increased life and pension business LEGAL &amp; General, the life and general insurer, reported a strong increase in new pension and life business in the first half of 1993, indicating recovery after a sharp decline in new business at the same stage of last year. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said the figures reflected 'the gradual emergence of the economy from recession and a more focused approach to the management of our distribution channels.' L&amp;G's distribution network of direct sales and tied agency sales forces has contracted sharply since 1989 and has only just begun to stabilise. The company was boosted by strong growth of income from single premiums in the UK. Life business single premiums were sharply ahead at Pounds 150.3m, of which Pounds 140.4m came from unitised with-profit bonds. Single premium income from pensions rose 66 per cent to Pounds 335.8m. Overseas single premiums rose by 50 per cent to Pounds 79.2m. Overall single premium business increased 96 per cent to Pounds 99.6m. With consumers still lacking confidence to make long-term financial commitments, the growth of new annual business premium income was slower. Premiums from UK life business rose 3 per cent to Pounds 38.1m in the first six months of 1993, while income from UK pensions business remained level at Pounds 34.7m. Overseas annual business premium income amounted to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 21m).</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Japan waves anti-dumping stick at China JAPAN has warned that anti-dumping duties may be imposed on Chinese exporters of ferrosilicon manganese, used by the steel industry, unless they increase prices alleged to be unfairly low. Officials at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry denied local newspaper reports that a decision had already been made to apply duties of between 5 and 26 per cent, which would be the first anti-dumping penalties imposed by Japan. However, Japanese investigators have warned Chinese export corporations that there is evidence of unfair pricing policies which have caused damage to Japanese producers, and that further information will be sought before a final decision. China's share of the Japanese market has risen from about 17 per cent in 1989 to 39 per cent. Reports of the anti-dumping case are embarrassing for Japan, which has taken a leading role in international negotiations on the anti-dumping issue. It recently produced a discussion paper which concluded that a series of European cases against Japanese producers were unfairly conducted. The case highlights increasing trade tensions between Japan and China, whose exporters are penetrating a range of markets, prompting complaints from local producers. Japanese textile companies also complain that Chinese factories are using predatory pricing policies to gain market share. An investigation was made of ferrosilicon manganese producers in South Africa and Norway, but it is believed that both countries will be cleared of dumping. Japanese officials were required to prove unfair pricing and that domestic producers suffered as a result of that pricing. In the past, Japan had threatened to impose anti-dumping duties on South Korean knitwear exporters, but these companies reluctantly agreed to 'voluntary restraints' before the duties were formally imposed, and Tokyo is hoping that a similar agreement will be reached with the Chinese producers. About seven Chinese state-run companies are alleged to price exports at far below levels offered on the domestic market, but the companies insist they are doing nothing wrong. Miti officials said they were gathering further information from the companies, and negotiations would continue into the New Year.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / IBM to form separate PC unit INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has decided to spin off its personal computer operations as a separate business. The world's largest computer manufacturer said yesterday that it had established a new unit, the IBM Personal Computer Company (IPCC), with responsibility for developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing the company's range of personal computers. IPCC will be based in Somers, New York State; Mr Robert Corrigan has been named president and Mr Edward Rogers, chief financial officer. With inherited annual sales of about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.5bn), it starts life as the world's largest personal computer concern. Yesterday's announcement confirms earlier reports that Mr James Cannavino, IBM's general manager of personal systems, has been anxious to focus IBM's personal computer activities in a single, autonomous division. IPCC will remain within IBM's corporate structure but will have greatly increased freedom in setting budgets, sourcing components and recruiting staff. The personal computer business depends on speed and flexibility to market changes and is far removed from the mainframe and minicomputer businesses which constitute IBM's traditional strengths. IBM created the modern personal computer market, but has increasingly been under pressure from competitors manufacturing copies, or clones, of its best-selling design and marketing them through unconventional channels, such as mail order. It has seen its global market share slide from more than 30 per cent to under 20 per cent as competitors, including Dell and Compaq as well as Asian manufacturers, have brought out innovative, low-cost products of equivalent quality. In Europe and Canada it has already formed wholly owned subsidiaries to sell low-cost clones sourced from Asia. Industry observers said the formation of IPCC seemed a cosmetic gesture rather than a fundamental attempt to create a true personal computer culture within the mainframe giant. They say the company's products will continue to be marketed by IBM's sales force while the structure of the personal computer business in Europe will remain largely unchanged.</p>

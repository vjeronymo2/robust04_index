It is designed to provide mobile communications links  between  ships on the Indian and Pacific oceans and people on any  continent.    The Beijing Marine Communication and Navigation Company a  member of the International Maritime Satellite Organization  (Inmarsat), has invested in the station.    The Beijing Inmarsat station which started trials in June  1991 was set up with $2.44 million in loans from the Norwegian  Government.    During the trials, the station helped customers at sea to  put  through domestic and international telephone calls, faxes and  telexes.    The station can also provide help with news reporting and  geological prospecting and has commercial and safety  applications on land sea and air.    Inmarsat is based in London and was founded in 1979 to serve  the maritime community. China was one of the first members.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy's close to filing for Chapter 11 protection RH MACY, the New York-based department store chain, is widely expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection against its creditors over the next few days, possibly as early as this morning. The collapse on Friday night of a last-minute bail-out by Mr Laurence Tisch and his Loews Corporation appears to leave the heavily-indebted company with no way of escaping a bankrupctcy filing. Macy's, which was taken private in a 1986 leveraged buy-out and is struggling with Dollars 3.6bn of debt and trading losses, declined to comment over the weekend. However, its officials were believed to be closeted with financial advisors discussing the mechanics of a bankruptcy filing. Mr Tisch, whose interests range from the CBS media group to insurance and property, offered to inject Dollars 1bn of cash into Macy's. Loews would have paid Dollars 740m for the group's publicly traded bonds and Dollars 80m for virtually all the equity. It would have used between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m to pay off Macy's suppliers. The deal collapsed when Prudential Insurance refused to grant better terms to Mr Tisch on the Dollars 811m mortgage it holds on 70 Macy's stores, about half the chain's outlets. Mr Tisch apparently asked for a cut in interest on the loan from 12 per cent to 9 per cent. Mr Frank McDougal, president of Prudential Mortgage Capital, told the New York Times that 'we had many discussions with the Tisch organisation and we were willing to bend and compromise to a certain point, and beyond that it would not have been prudent for us.' A Chapter 11 filing could help the group because it would remove the uncertainty that has surrounded its finances since early this month, when it deferred payments due to trade suppliers in the hope of meeting the provisions of its revolving credit agreement with banks. Suppliers have since been holding back fresh shipments of goods to Macy's stores.</p>

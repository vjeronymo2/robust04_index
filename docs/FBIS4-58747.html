			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has stated the importance of the signing of the  Israeli-Palestinian agreement to implement self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho, which took place in Cairo yesterday.    In remarks he made today, Musa described the agreement as  "good," noting that it is the first step toward reaching a  comprehensive solution for the Palestinian issue. Musa pointed  out that the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian self-rule  agreement in Gaza and Jericho will begin in a week or two, with  the return of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and senior PLO  officials. He noted that the first step will be implemented in  Gaza and Jericho, to be followed by extending the Palestinian  authority over the remaining Palestinian territory in the West  Bank. He added: Other steps have been agreed upon and we hope  the pace of the peace process will accelerate to reach the final  stage as soon as possible and within two years of the  implementation of the agreement.    Musa emphasized that any step toward achieving peace and  stability in the region will have a positive impact on all the  region's countries. He noted that Egypt is interested in  establishing peace and stability in the region. He pointed out  that if the Arab-Israeli conflict is resolved in accordance with  the resolutions of the international community and through  negotiations and agreements among the parties concerned, the  region will undoubtedly enter a better stage. It will be a  stage of cooperation and development in which the region's  peoples can enjoy peace.    On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent talks  in Damascus, Musa noted that such meetings show Syria's interest  in the U.S. role regarding the peace process. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / BA poised to buy stake in French airline BRITISH AIRWAYS is in advanced negotiations to buy a large minority stake in a French regional airline, Transport Aerien Transregional. The move is part of BA's strategy of acquiring stakes in smaller carriers in large European countries in order to take advantage of the single European air market which starts next year. The deal would follow BA's acquisition earlier this year of a 49 per cent stake in Delta Air, a German regional carrier which has since been renamed Deutsche BA. European airline industry officials said yesterday the negotiations between BA and TAT were at a critical point. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's deputy chairman and chief executive, declined to comment on the TAT negotiations. But he confirmed that at the same time as negotiating its global alliance with USAir - in which BA is planning to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 375m) for a 44 per cent stake - the UK carrier was seeking regional airline partnerships to strengthen its European network. A deal with TAT is expected to spark a fierce reaction from Air France, the French flag carrier, which was forced to dispose of its 35 per cent stake in the regional carrier last year. Air France sold its stake in TAT as part of an agreement with the European Commission to enable it to take control of Air Inter, the French domestic carrier, and UTA, the independent French long-distance airline. Mr Bernard Attali, Air France chairman, has already warned he will make life difficult for BA if the deal with TAT is concluded. Action could include the ending of Air France's aircraft leasing arrangements to TAT. TAT, founded 20 years ago, employs about 3,100 people, has annual sales of about FFr2.4bn (Pounds 250m) and runs a fleet of 50 aircraft. It operates a network of domestic routes and is expanding into European regional services, including flights to the UK. Mr Michel Marchais, founder and main shareholder of TAT, indicated in February he would be prepared to sell part of his family's 72 per cent controlling interest in the airline. He is understood to have approached BA earlier this year. Sir Colin said at a Financial Times aerospace conference yesterday that BA's strategy of becoming a global airline was 'well on the way to becoming a reality' with the proposed USAir investment and the European joint ventures. Sir Colin forecast that the airline industry would ultimately be dominated by 'no more than 10 or 12 global airline combines, perhaps less'. BA-USAir deal, Page 5 City Airport stake offer, Page 8</p>

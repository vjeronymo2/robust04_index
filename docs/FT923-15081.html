			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / More of the same for BR: Little upheaval will result from privatisation SUDDENLY it is becoming clear why Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, has been looking so relaxed recently about the prospect of rail privatisation. Sir Bob - who has never been a great privatisation enthusiast - has a fortnight to wait for the government to publish a white paper setting out its plans for transferring BR to the private sector. However, he must by now have a good idea of what the white paper contains: and what he knows is that BR is to survive remarkably unscathed. The bare bones of privatisation were set out in the Conservative election manifesto. BR is to be reorganised into two separate bodies: one owning the tracks and charging for their use, and the other operating the trains. Once this has been done, the aim is to get BR's train operations into the private sector by selling the freight services outright and inviting the private sector to bid for franchises to operate the passenger services. Separately, would-be train operators such as Mr Richard Branson, chairman of the airline Virgin Atlantic, will be allowed to run their own passenger or freight trains on BR's tracks. An official regulator will resolve arguments over track charges and access. In theory, it all sounds quite revolutionary. But in practice, the most striking feature of the privatisation may be how much is to stay the same. The choice of routes for the passenger service franchises, for example, may appear to be a fascinating throwback to the golden age of rail: but in reality the franchise areas reflect the so-called profit centres into which BR has been subdivided over the past two years in an extensive management restructuring. From BR's point of view, one of the biggest potential dis-advantages of privatisation was that it could cut across this reorganisation, thus throwing staff into demoralising turmoil just as they were coming out of it. Choosing the profit centres as the basis of the franchises will leave BR's management structure intact. So much for BR. But what about the passengers? As the manifesto has already made clear, the whole track infrastructure including signalling is to remain in BR's ownership. That means that private-sector train operators will continue to be at BR's mercy when it comes to many of the most common causes of delays, such as signal or point failures and congestion. Further, it now emerges that companies wanting to run their own trains on BR's tracks could find it difficult to get access because BR and its franchisees will enjoy 'grandfather rights' to all train paths in the existing timetable. This means that any slots left over for independent train operators such as Virgin will almost by definition be the least desirable ones. The biggest scope for change therefore appears to be offered by the plan to franchise out BR's passenger services. Ministers say there is plenty of behind-the-scenes interest in bidding for the rights to run BR's trains. Ministers hope to encourage these bidders to come forward by placing on them as few requirements as possible about minimum service levels. The opportunities for innovation, it is believed, will do the rest. Franchisees with experience of the bus industry, for example, might hope to make more money out of suburban lines by running bus feeder services to connect passengers with commuter trains or shoppers' specials. But it is also acknowledged that it would be impractical in the vast majority of cases to expect franchisees to buy their own fleets of trains. Instead, the franchise for any given service will come complete with the BR rolling stock necessary to operate it, to be returned to BR when the franchise ends. One consequence is that, with BR continuing to own the trains as well as the tracks - and for that matter, supplying most of the staff - franchisees may have little scope to introduce significant changes beyond improvements in station and on-board services. Another consequence is that a state-owned BR will remain responsible for the vast majority of railway assets for the foreseeable future - meaning that the government will continue to exercise its relentless grip on the sums available for investment. In any event, as ministers acknowledge, the franchising of BR's services will take many years to complete. This is because the only franchises likely to attract any interest from the private sector are those for routes which have already benefited from heavy investment. Thus, on mainline services it is possible to imagine that someone may be interested in taking on the east coast franchise because BR has just finished upgrading the line and buying new trains for it at a cost of Pounds 500m. The worn-out west coast main line, conversely, is likely to attract little interest because it needs an Pounds 860m upgrade. Even the modernised lines may not necessarily attract much interest. Everything will hang on how much franchisees have to pay for access to the tracks, and this information will not be available until later in the year. But with ministers making it clear that track charges will not be subsidised, franchisees may need to be persuaded that there is any money to be made from running trains - particularly after the heavy losses reported by BR this week. What seems increasingly likely is that the main impact of privatisation will fall on freight services rather than passenger ones. The government remains committed to moving these into the private sector as quickly as possible - though, again, its chances will hang on the question of what charges freight operators are required to pay.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              HOW BR PASSENGER SERVICES WILL BE FRANCHISED  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERCITY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Great Western Mainline services from London Paddington to west and south-west England (Former - pre-nationalisation - operator: Great Western Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- West Coast Mainline services from London Euston to west Midlands, north-west England and Glasgow (Formerly: London Midland and Scottish Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Coast Mainlines services from London King's Cross to York, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh Formerly: London and North Eastern Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Midlands/Cross Country Mainline services from London St Pancras to Leicester and Sheffield, plus cross-country main lines from south-west to north-east England (Formerly: Midland Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatwick and Anglia Gatwick Express and mainline services from London Liverpool Street to Norwich  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NETWORK SOUTHEAST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South West Services from Waterloo to south-west England (Formerly: London and South Western Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South East Kent Link and Kent Coast services (Formerly: South Eastern and Chatham Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Central South London and Sussex Coast services (Formerly: London Brighton and South Coast Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thames and Chiltern Suburban services from London Paddington and Marylebone  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Great Eastern Services form Liverpool Street to Essex (Formerly: Great Eastern Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North Suburban services out of Euston  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thameslink North to south London and cross-London suburban services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- West Anglia and Great Northern Services form Liverpool Street, King's Cross and Moorgate to Hertfordshire (Formerly: Great Northern Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London, Tilbury and Southend Services from Fenchurch Street to Southend Central (Formerly: London Tilbury and Southend Railway)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL RAILWAYS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Central Suburban and branch-line services in central England and Wales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North West North-west suburban and branch-line services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North East North-eastern suburban and branch-line services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Wales Suburban and branch-line services in south Wales and south-west England  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ScotRail Scottish branch-line services  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A MATTER OF TRUST;  </P> <P> STING: THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES TAUGHT IN THE CLASSROOM LOSE THEIR MEANING  WHEN POLICE AND SCHOOLS USE LIES, DECEPTION AND DUPLICITY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT DRUGS.  </P> <P> Another sting operation in San Diego schools.  </P> <P> Undercover police agents pose for six months as students in three San Diego  high schools to ferret out drug dealers.  </P> <P> We read about the raids in the newspaper and are comforted. More self  congratulation that San Diego moves aggressively to protect its children from  the horror of drug abuse.  </P> <P> Let's agree upon one thing: The cost to our society of drug abuse in terms of  ruined lives, grieving families and crimes inflicted on others is incalculable.  </P> <P> Action must be taken to stem the momentum of this scourge.  </P> <P> Our hearts go out to those distraught parents who are daily witness to the  deterioration of their addicted children.  </P> <P> But, in our enthusiasm to "do something about it," we should look very  carefully at the consequences of our actions.  </P> <P> "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," Thomas Jefferson warned. Sometimes  the vigilance needed to protect our freedom is painful. Protecting the values  of a free people is never easy.  </P> <P> We have seen in East Germany how distrust permeated the very fabric of the  community with fear and hate.  </P> <P> Throughout the Cold War, we have known that people in Soviet Bloc countries  refused to talk openly for fear they would be informed upon. There was no  trust.  </P> <P> But not in this country. Here we pride ourselves as people with a reputation of  "speaking our minds" to anyone. Here the police are civil servants -- friends  who control automobile traffic, deliver babies on occasion, protect us from  lawbreakers.  </P> <P> Trust.  </P> <P> That's what we take for granted in this country.  </P> <P> Some of the things we say may be imprudent or hurtful or simply stupid. But  that is our choice. We are free to make jackasses out of ourselves. We never  doubt that is our constitutional right.  </P> <P> Living in a constitutional democracy means that sometimes lawbreakers go free.  </P> <P> Dictatorships are tidier in that respect. Their wrongdoers are meted out swift  and often lethal punishment. But in dictatorships, there is subjectivity in  determining "wrongdoers."  </P> <P> We try not to cross that line in our democracy. We are a nation of laws whose  ideal is to judge all people by identical standards.  </P> <P> So, finally, we return to the sting operation in the San Diego schools.  </P> <P> The head of the San Diego police narcotics task force is quoted as saying, "The  previous raids have taught high school kids a lesson. Obviously, there's a  paranoia (among students) now."  </P> <P> If the narcotics officer meant that the student paranoia was an indication of  the success of the sting, the "benefits" of the sting warrant closer  examination.  </P> <P> When our young people are taught to distrust their classmates, how then are we  different from those totalitarian states we have traditionally abhorred?  </P> <P> There is a story that during the blitz of Britain in 1940 it was determined  that the British anti-aircraft effort against the German bombers was  ineffective. The shells could not reach the required altitude.  </P> <P> To save munitions, the shelling was discontinued. Immediately, the civilian  population became extremely upset with the silence. The sound of the ack-ack  obviously fulfilled their need to feel as if protection were being provided.  </P> <P> The anti-aircraft shelling was resumed and the people were comforted. The  government accommodated the public need at only the cost of the shells.  </P> <P> After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government, to give the appearance  that it was doing something, interned U.S. citizens of Japanese descent.  </P> <P> The damage to the integrity of our government and to the Japanese-American  internees as a result of that effort to accommodate a purported need of the  people is irreparable.  </P> <P> The stings are not just a police operation. Because the San Diego Police  Department is an arm of city government, in effect, the stings are a  cooperative effort of the City of San Diego and the San Diego Unified School  District.  </P> <P> The city and the school district, by implementing the sting, are making the  statement that there is a terrible drug abuse problem in the schools, and they  are doing something about it.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the benefits are dubious; the paranoia is real, however.  </P> <P> It is foolhardy to believe that young people can be taught democratic  principles in a classroom and still retain a belief in those principles while  observing lies, deception and duplicity around them in those same classrooms.  </P> <P> The living example of the school system and Police Department in acknowledged  collusion to deceive them, no matter how noble the purpose, teaches the wrong  lesson.  </P> <P> The city and the city schools find themselves in a dilemma. But they should be  aware that standing firm against public frustration in order to serve the  long-range best interests of students is also courageous.  </P> <P> Would the school system incorporate into its curriculum the premise that deceit  is acceptable when seeking a desirable end?  </P> <P> Of course not.  </P> <P> Would the school system incorporate into its curriculum the premise that to  foster distrust among one's fellows in order to achieve a desirable end is  acceptable?  </P> <P> Of course not.  </P> <P> Inculcating distrust in the minds of impressionable students is far more  serious than lobbing futile shells at enemy aircraft.  </P> <P> San Diego Unified must find another way.  </P></p>

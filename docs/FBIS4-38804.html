			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] June 1 TASS -- "By prolonging  the state of emergency in the Dniester area, the Tiraspol  leaders have grossly violated the agreement on the peaceful  settlement of the Dniester conflict, signed by the presidents of  Russia and Moldavia [Moldova]," co-chairman of the Joint Control  Commission for promoting stability in the conflict area, First  Deputy Interior Minister of Moldavia Viktor Katane said here  today.    As earlier reported, president of the unrecognised Dniester  republic Igor Smirnov has decreed to prolong the state of  emergency on the left-hand bank of the Dniester beginning from  June 1. The state of emergency was announced on January 18 to  prevent the holding of pre-term elections to the Moldavian  parliament in the Dniester area.    According to Katane, the state of emergency envisages the  toughening of the border regime by the self-styled Dniester  republic and deployment of additional paramilitary units within  the safety zone. He described as far-fetched the arguments of  the Tiraspol authorities that the state of emergency was  necessary to combat crime in the region.</p>

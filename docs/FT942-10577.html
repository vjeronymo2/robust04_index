			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Courting the customer: Judy Dempsey says city centres in east Germany are fighting back to attract western retailers East Germany's city councils have had enough. For three years, they have watched large west German retailers invade the east, setting up furniture, home improvement and liquor stores in out-of-town outlets which occupy vast tracts of land, miles from the urban streets full of cranes used in building refurbishment. It was a golden opportunity to escape the rigid west German planning system. Department stores and city retailers, supported by Germany's Association of Retailers, as well as a battery of planning legislation and the city councils, made it virtually impossible to build on 'greenfield' sites. These are out-of-town developments on unused land which are often subject to strict environmental controls. 'The entire retailing sector is under-developed in west Germany,' said Mr Guy Barker from Knight Frank Immobilien Consulting in Dusseldorf. East Germany offered scope for expansion. Before unification in 1990, retailing in the east had been monopolised by the Konsumgenossenschaft co-operatives, comprising supermarkets and small shops; and the Handelsorganisation, the state-run department stores. Compared to west Germany, which has maintained a level of 1-1.2 square metres of retail space per person for several years, there were only 0.3 sq m per person in east Germany before 1989. Once the unification treaty was signed, west German retailers rushed in. But, unlike in the west, they found city centre sites unsuitable for development - many were too expensive, and many were subject to labyrinthine property claims stretching back decades. So they snapped up plentiful rural sites which had investment incentives in the form of tax write-offs and state grants of up to 50 per cent. The result? 'The expansion has been quite incredible,' said Mr Hubertus Tessar from Germany's Association of Retailers, who reckons there are now 3 sq m of retailing per person in east Germany. The retailers had hungry customers. East Germans demonstrated an insatiable demand for consumer goods, especially for home improvement items. Mr Tessar said turnover in east German retailing last year totalled about DM120bn, compared with about DM88bn in 1992. For instance, Hornbach, the do-it-yourself west German chain store, this year expects its four outlets in east Germany to account for a quarter of its total turnover, which last year was DM750m. However, Mr Tessar expects only 1 per cent retailing growth this year largely because the attraction of greenfield sites may be diminishing. There are three reasons. The city councils are beginning to adopt a strategy aimed at correcting the imbalance between retailing outside city centres and in cities. The current ratio is about 85:15, unlike in west Germany where it is about 50:50. Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg, for example, have already adopted strict planning regulations for anybody wanting to develop retailing outlets on greenfield sites. Leipzig, in the southern state of Saxony, has followed suit and may try to block planning permission for Ikea, the Swedish furniture store, to build a plant in the region. City councils are not primarily interested in the consumer, however. Rather, they want to recoup lost tax from the retailing sector. Under current legislation, tax on a percentage of stores' turnover goes to the local councils on whose land the shops are located. For example, the small local council of Gunthersdorf, west of Leipzig, which has a population of 650, can expect to flourish from the revenue derived from from the 100,000 sq m Saale Park shopping complex which is expected to achieve a turnover of DM850m next year. Mr Ralph Kausch, a retailing expert at Leipzig's Chamber of Commerce, reckons that the city of Leipzig is substantially losing tax income from an estimated annual DM900m turnover by retailers on greenfield sites. 'A struggle is taking place between the city government and local councils. That struggle is about how to win back consumers to the inner cities,' he said recently. Pressure on out-of-town retailers is building from another quarter. As property disputes are resolved in city centres, so more buildings will become available. Mr Barker of Immobilien Consulting believes department stores and small supermarkets geared towards convenience shopping, are poised to take on the giant retailers. Finally, the retailers in greenfield sites confront economic problems that are a long-term result of unification. Although the east German economy is expected to grow about 7 per cent this year - after a fall in gross domestic product of about 30 per cent between 1991 and 1992 - consumer spending is slowing down as more east Germans save to provide a cushion against potential unemployment. Some retailing experts believe that as shops in city centres improve, consumers will reduce their out-of-town expeditions. The cities, however, have some way to go to make shopping in the centre attractive. There is a dearth of parking facilities, and entering most city centres is like negotiating the gateway to a fortress. Roads are blocked by bulldozers being used to modernise the infrastructure. More crucially, in their attempt to fight back, east German cities may be starting to adopt the outmoded practices of west German retailers. For example, instead of introducing more flexibility, restrictive shopping hours are being introduced; and instead of a competitive pricing policy, many stores are accepting the Rabattgetesz, a law dating back to 1933 which prevents retailers lowering their prices by more than 3 per cent except at designated sales times. 'Its all very well the cities trying to compete with the greenfield sites, but perhaps they could start thinking about the consumer for a change,' said Mr Barker. Until they do, any resurgence in city centre shopping will get off to a slow start. Consumers have acquired a taste for choice in products and a range of services which cities are struggling to fulfil. Mr Cy Schluter, a Frankfurt-based retailing expert, said: 'That was the great thing about the initial expansion of the greenfield sites in eastern Germany. Retailers tried to break the old-fashioned pattern of the west German planning system. 'Even if the cities in east Germany fight back, there's no doubt that the giant retailing outlets are here to stay.'</p>

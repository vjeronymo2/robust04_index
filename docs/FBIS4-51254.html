			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Tang Weibin (0781 5898 1755), and HUBEI </F> RIBAO reporter Jiang Zuosu (3068 0155 5685)]    [Text] Wuhan, 20 May (XINHUA) -- During his recent  inspection tour in Hubei, Liu Huaqing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and Vice Chairman of the Central  Military Commission, stressed: We must accelerate the  development of defense industries as well as the modernization  of defense through the application of high technology.  Meanwhile, defense industries should contribute more to the  national economic development by serving economic construction,  which is today's central task.    Liu Huaqing said: Revolutionaries of the older generation  care very much about national defense. Not only have they  written a lot of incisive works on defense, but have also  personally directed and organized many major research projects.  Defense industries have made new headway in recent years as a  result of the leadership of the party central committee, the  State Council, and the Central Military Commission. From now on  we must work even harder and continue to press forward to live  up to the expectations of the revolutionaries of the older  generation.    Liu Huaqing noted: Having been tempered and nurtured for  decades, Chinese scientists, technicians, and administrators  working for defense industries have become quite proficient.  Considering hard work and selfless dedication an honor, they  have contributed significantly to China's defense through giving  full scope to their talents and capabilities. Because we have  such invaluable people, the modernization of China's national  defense is highly promising.    Liu Huaqing said: Defense industries must closely follow the  world's rapid development of high technology. The development  of our own advanced technology should be organically combined  with purchases of advanced technology from abroad, and we must  make constant efforts to improve these technologies so that they  can serve our strategic policy, namely "active defense." Under  the premise of ensuring our technology's systematicness [xi tong  xing 4762 4827 1840], integrity, and reliability, we must from  now on set higher standards for our development and make  constant efforts to attain new goals. Meanwhile, we must set  strict requirements for management, underscore quality, and work  meticulously. By no means should we do our work formalistically.    Liu Huaqing stressed: China now gives top priority [shou wei  7445 0143] to economic construction, which is the center of  everything. Defense industries should also obey and serve the  needs of economic construction, and give local industries and  economies the support they need for development.    During his inspection tour in Hubei, Liu Huaqing also  visited  the Wuchang Shipyard to understand its production and to see the  cadres and workers there. He also inspected the Wuhan Changfei  Optical Fiber Cable Company and the Tonghu High-Technology  Development Zone. In Yichang, he also inspected the Three Gorges  Project and the Gezhouba Power Plant, and heard briefings of the  dam's construction and the plant's management.    Accompanying Liu Huaqing during the inspection were Hubei  Governor Jia Zhijie and leaders of relevant departments.</p>

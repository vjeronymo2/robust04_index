			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Money Markets: France cuts rates THE BANK of France yesterday fulfilled market expectations by cutting its official interest rates once again, but dealers took the view that this would be the last easing for several months, writes James Blitz. As expected, the Bank of France cut both its intervention rate and its 5-10 day lending rate by 25 basis points to 8.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent respectively. The move came at the end of several weeks in which the French franc has performed extremely strongly inside the exchange rate mechanism, bringing French franc money market rates close to those for the D-Mark. However, the market's response appeared to be in the tradition of 'buying the rumour and selling the facts' and cash rates rose again. The Bundesbank's decision not to change monetary policy at its fortnightly meeting was also the source of some disappointment. The June French franc contract closed down 14 basis points on the day at 92.48, while the September contract was 11 basis points down on the day at 93.18. Three month French cash drifted down during the day, closing at around 7.50 per cent - the same level indicated by the June future. The disappointment in German markets was partly due to the surprisingly tight conditions there this week. The Bundesbank's net drain of DM2.4bn from the market on Wednesday came as dealers were clearly finding themselves short of funds. Borrowings through the most expensive Bundesbank window, the Lombard rate, have already amounted to more than DM3bn this week, a far larger sum than normal. German call money yesterday remained firm at about 7.78 per cent. Sterling futures reflected some of the disappointment felt over the Bundesbank's unchanged policy, and the June contract was down 6 basis points at one stage yesterday at 93.90. However, the contract later recovered to close at 93.95. Once again, this was the same close as that for the September contract. Three month sterling cash fell about  1/16 per cent to close at 5 15/16 per cent. The easy removal of a Pounds 1.25bn shortage again helped to bring down short-dated rates in the interbank market.</p>

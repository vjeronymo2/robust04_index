			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Downturn at Federated Stores Federated Department Stores, the US retailer that last month succeeded in winning the rival RH Macy's agreement to a merger, suffered a sharp downturn in profits in its second quarter to July. The company blamed costs associated with the integration of 10 Joseph Horne stores acquired during the period. Net profits fell to Dollars 3.8m from Dollars 8.9m, but Federated said that without the one-time costs relating to the Horne acquisition, they would have more than doubled to Dollars 19.9m. Turnover increased by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn, while increased efficiency helped the group lower operating expenses to 33.5 per cent of sales from 36 per cent. Earnings per share fell to 3 cents from 7 cents, but would have risen to 16 cents without the one-time costs. Federated Department Stores' net income for the first six months was Dollars 36m with the one-time costs and Dollars 52.1m without them. The comparable figure was Dollars 30.6m before an extraordinary item. RH Macy is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection but last month Federated reached agreement with Macy and its creditors on a Dollars 4.1bn reorganisation plan that would bring Macy's store chains under Federated's ownership. Yesterday Mr Alan Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said he expected the reorganisation and merger to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter. Mr Questrom added that the existing operations would seek to improve profitability further in the second half by keeping costs under control while focusing on an acceleration in store-for-store sales growth in the 3 to 4 per cent range.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF] issued  a statement yesterday in which it said: Since the signing of the  Declaration of Principles [DOP], Israel has pursued a policy of  procrastination on all the negotiating tracks and has continued  to ignore our legitimate rights, stipulated by international  charters and resolutions. Furthermore, it has backed down from  what it agreed on in the DOP. As far as Rabin and his  negotiating teams are concerned, dates are no longer firm nor  sacred. Withdrawal has become a redeployment of Israeli forces,  settlements require military protection and safe roads protected  by the Israeli Army, and so forth.    In fact, this Israeli policy has relied on the absence of  Arab-Palestinian coordination and is trying to deal with the  Palestinian side unilaterally. It has also relied on the PLO's  internal conflicts, bad planning, lack of a negotiating  authority, and confusion between overt and covert negotiations.  This has caused the cancellation of many national constants and  the suspension of others to an unspecified date. The security  agreement is the best evidence of this.    This stage, in which the Israeli tactic coincides with the  policy of economic siege and inhibiting our people, prompts us  to reassess our support for the political process and to review  all its aspects as having been planned and not spontaneous. The  decision to seal the occupied territories, bar Palestinian  workers from earning their livelihood, accelerate land  confiscation, boycott Palestinian agricultural products and  prevent their export, increase roadblocks, intensify tax  collection campaigns, and close off Jerusalem -- all these are  just an economic war. This war has been abetted by some Arab  states which have not only cut off financial aid to our people  in their distress, but have also refused to transfer funds  donated by our sons working in those states. We exclude the  Libyan Jamahiriyah and Iraq because they have been subjected to  an international blockade.    Because of the perils that this stage holds for the cause  and  struggles of our people, the PPSF, which supported the PLO in  the peace process, believes that the peace process has deviated  from its track and has canceled many agreed on national  constants. The PPSF affirms that its consent was conditional on  preserving the national constants and improving the Palestinian  negotiating performance. But what has happened in the security  agreement signed in Cairo indicates that the situation is  becoming worse and that Israel is blackmailing the Palestinian  negotiators. Therefore, the PPSF demands the following:    1. That the Palestine Central Council be convened to review  every agreement that is signed and send its recommendations to  the Palestine National Council [PNC].    2. That the PNC be convened to review all agreements that  have been signed and either approve, amend, or reject those  agreements on democratic bases.    3. That a negotiating authority be formed to determine all  constants and lines that must not be overstepped by any  negotiator.    4. The release of Palestinian prisoners before any new  agreement.    If, however, the current approach continues, the PPSF will  reassess its stance toward the entire peace process.</p>

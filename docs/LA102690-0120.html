			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS PROPOSITION K;  </P> <P> HOUSING MEASURE GETS WIDE SUPPORT  </P> <P> The city's $100-million housing bond measure has attracted so many endorsements  from disparate groups that campaign experts are using "unprecedented" and  "historic" to describe its rise from obscurity in a season of hotly competing  bond measures.  </P> <P> The county Republican Party is featuring Proposition K on its slate mailings  next week, and party officials glowingly refer to the measure as a "Jack  Kemp-style" housing initiative that embraces low-income home ownership and  development of affordable housing by nonprofit groups.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley Boards of Realtors say Proposition K is  "an issue you can't argue with" and the Realtors' statewide political action  committee has given the campaign a hefty $40,000 to prove their point.  </P> <P> At the same time, left-leaning tenant activists such as the Coalition for  Economic Survival, which helped write some segments of Proposition K, are  leafletting hundreds of low-income buildings to get out the vote. The county  Democratic Party and major homeowner organizations also have lent their names  to the measure.  </P> <P> "I don't know if the stars were all lined up in the sky or what, but we have an  unprecedented mix of backers that nobody in the city can recall occurring on a  bond measure before," said Gary Squier, a developer and expert on affordable  housing measures.  </P> <P> The innovative measure would provide $80 million for nonprofit groups to buy  and rehabilitate 6,000 low-income apartment units that are at risk of being  lost to earthquakes, demolition or gentrification. Another $10 million would  build shelters for the homeless, and $10 million would provide loans for  low-wage home buyers shut out of the costly Los Angeles market.  </P> <P> "This is a bond issue Los Angeles can't afford to lose," said Barbara Grover,  campaign consultant to Proposition K's committee, Taxpayers to Save the  American Dream. "This isn't a library bond issue or something else that would  be nice to have. It's critical."  </P> <P> However, because Proposition K would increase property taxes -- by about $4.95  per year for the average homeowner -- the measure needs two-thirds voter  approval.  </P> <P> The only public figure to step forward in opposition to the housing measure is  City Councilman Nate Holden, who wrote the ballot argument against it.  </P> <P> Holden was out of town and could not be reached for comment, but has complained  recently that "voters approve too many bond measures" and that such city  housing problems should be handled by the state and federal government.  </P> <P> For Mayor Tom Bradley and the rest of the City Council, which overwhelmingly  supports Proposition K, the most crucial need is for earthquake renovation  funds. Today, about 40,000 of the city's poorest residents live in aging brick  buildings that engineers say would become death traps in a major earthquake.  </P> <P> "We are talking about 40,000 or more homeless overnight -- if they survive the  quake," said Michael Bodaken, Bradley's housing coordinator. "The mayor is  asking the public to back this badly needed measure."  </P> <P> Carl Deppe, the city's earthquake safety chief, said his agency has fought to  get the city's thousands of brick buildings reinforced since the 1971 Sylmar  earthquake that killed 65 people and wreaked havoc on brick structures.  </P> <P> After years of prodding, most apartment owners have finally complied with a  1981 city law requiring seismic strengthening, which can cost as much as  $10,000 per apartment unit.  </P> <P> According to Deppe, 25,372 units have been reinforced -- but amid a worsening  housing shortage, the city has lost 6,014 low-rent brick units that were torn  down by exasperated owners. More ominously, nearly 11,000 endangered units  still stand, their owners unable or unwilling to comply.  </P> <P> "It's not just intransigent owners; it is owners who really need financial help  to do it," Deppe said.  </P> <P> Proposition K has been endorsed by the Central City Assn. of downtown business  interests; the Countywide Alliance of HUD-Subsidized Tenants; the Coalition for  Economic Survival; the Sierra Club; the Hillside Federation of Home Owners  Assn.; the Lakeview Terrace Home Owners Assn.; the United Paramedics of Los  Angeles and the Los Angeles Countywide Coalition for Homeless.  </P> <P> The business sector, which virtually ignored a similar housing bond measure  that failed by just 2% last year, is giving generously to Proposition K, mostly  in $1,000 and $2,000 amounts, resulting in a campaign chest of $132,000.  </P> <P> In addition to $40,000 from real estate groups, major contributions include:  $10,000 from Maguire Thomas Partners' Nelson Rising, co-chairman of the  measure's finance committee; $10,000 from Arco, whose president, Robert Wykoff,  is also co-chairman of the committee; $10,000 from Maguire Thomas Partners; and  $5,250 from the campaign of state Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti  (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Proposition K's eclectic support proves that nobody wants to see Los Angeles  deteriorate "into a place of have and have-nots," said Bodaken.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Bradley and other proponents are somewhat worried that Holden's  opposition could hurt the measure's chances. Some campaign consultants believe  that the very existence of an opposition ballot argument, regardless of merit,  can draw thousands of votes away from an otherwise popular measure.  </P> <P> This is not the first time Holden has played the role of spoiler. He infuriated  city officials and neighborhood leaders in 1988, when he acted as the lone  dissenter on a bond measure to upgrade and build city libraries -- including  libraries in his own district. The measure failed that year.  </P> <P> In the housing measure's favor, however, is the fact that a similar bond  measure was on the ballot in 1989, so voters will be somewhat familiar with  earthquake safety issues. That 1989 housing bond measure, supported by  contributions of only $21,000, failed by just 3,500 votes.  </P> <P> Analysis of that defeat has shown that San Fernando Valley voters gave it a  lukewarm yes vote of less than 60%. In contrast, many areas of the city --  including Holden's 10th District -- racked up yes votes of well over 70%.  </P> <P> The campaign committee hopes to change the Valley's soft voter attitude toward  the housing crisis. Councilman Hal Bernson, a Valley Republican and fiscal  conservative, has become a leading proponent of Proposition K.  </P> <P> In addition to the nearly 11,000 earthquake-unsafe units that could be improved  in part by Proposition K, the measure makes funds available to save some of the  city's more than 26,000 federally protected apartments whose rent controls  expire in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Without a program to buy out owners of these units, most officials expect  gentrification and steep rent increases in areas where the buildings are  concentrated -- Hollywood, Venice, San Pedro and the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "The lack of supply is driving up the prices and we can't take any more," said  Alice Callaghan, founder of the nonprofit Skid Row Housing Trust, a group that  renovates flophouses to create attractive studio units for the poor.  </P> <P> The message is much the same from the county Republican Central Committee,  which voted 76-2 to endorse Proposition K, the only local bond measure it  endorsed.  </P> <P> "I'm a detective here in the Rampart Division and I deal with a huge homeless  population," said party Vice Chairman Robert Thoreson. "I see children sleeping  in cars with parents, and while I'm not the type of guy who wants government  getting too much into housing, I feel government, in part, has driven up  housing costs with regulations and fees. Now government should help resolve  it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposition K: The Housing Crisis  </P> <P> Rents are skyrocketing in the West, but Los Angeles has borne some of the worst  increases, with the city's poor paying 50% to 70% of their income on rent.  </P> <P> Proposition K would rehabilitate 6,000 low-income apartments that would  otherwise be lost to earthquake-safety deficiencies, demolition and  gentrification.  </P> <P> The measure would cost an average homeowner $4.95 a year in property taxes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Los Angeles average rents  </P> <P> Compared with other regions of the country, adjusted for inflation and  expressed in 1988 dollars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nearly 11,000 units housing the city's poorest residents are in brick buildings  that would become death traps in the event of a severe quake. Although city law  has required since 1981 that buildings be renovated, many owners cannot afford  the costly work. Under Proposition K, owners could be bought out and buildings  fixed. The funds could also be used to maintain lowrents on some of the 26,000  low-income units in the San Fernando Valley, Venice, Hollywood and San Pedro  that are under federal rent control due to expire in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Selsmically unsafe apartment units  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.00IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Council  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> district  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> units  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,493  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 109  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,061  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 47  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 253  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 327  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,168  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 962  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 12  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 13  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,284  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 195  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10,965  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: OFT reports fuel disclosure debate - Serious Money 'THE STRUCTURE and level of remuneration of salespeople and intermediaries may influence the savings and investment advice that is given to consumers, with advice skewed in favour of some products and companies.' These clinical but provocative words are the joint conclusion of two excellent reports written by Helena Wiesner and Jeremy Mitchell and published this week by the Office of Fair Trading. The sentiments will be familiar to FT readers. Having dropped its bombshells, the OFT, making its first foray into the world of consumer finance, said it had not decided whether to accept the reports' recommendations. If it does, it will re-open the most contentious issue facing the consumer finance industry - commission disclosure - which seemed to have been put to rest by the recent Securities and Investments Board review. Understandably, this arouses great anger. Intermediaries, most of whom do an excellent and worthwhile job, feel that both their livelihoods and their honesty are being questioned. Neither is necessarily the case. But the issue will not go away. In her report, Wiesner says that when an independent intermediary arranges a sale he should, before it is completed, reveal in cash terms the commission he will be paid. Why? Because commissions vary from company to company and from product to product, creating conflicts of interest which will be clearer if the commission is visible. Commission is the price of an intermediary's advice. It is, therefore, hard to justify hiding it. But the SIB decided for two reasons against forcing disclosure: first, that the total charges connected to the product (including administration and so on) were more important than the commission alone; and, second, that requiring IFAs to reveal their commission would put them at a competitive disadvantage with direct sales forces which can hide behind incentive schemes that mask the cut they are taking. Both arguments have some merit. But are they sufficient to justify SIB's stance? Wiesner concludes, with devastating logic, that they are not. Total charges are important - there is no point paying a small commission if a life office is inefficient - but that does not mean commission is unimportant. SIB admitted that it erred on the side of 'paternalism' and wanted to prevent consumers being confused by too much information. Perhaps 'patronising' is a better word than 'paternal.' If the information is useful for the consumer, it should not be withheld. But the issue of the 'level playing field' with tied agents and direct salesmen is trickier. The OFT reports show the huge amounts of commission that building societies  -only two of which haveindependent status - rake in from insurance sales. Commission accounted for 27 per cent of profits for the Halifax, tied to Standard Life, in 1990. Tied agents and direct sales forces surely bear the lion's share of responsibility for the present wasteful level of surrenders of endowment policies. But would it be to the disadvantage of independents to have to reveal their commission? Surely not. Independent advice is a more valuable commodity than the salesmanship available at a building society. If it were labelled clearly with a price, consumers might appreciate this more. Then there is the question of agency. Mitchell's report cites an Appeal Court judgment which found it remarkable that a broker 'who is remunerated by the insurance industry, and who presents suggested policies on their behalf' should be treated as the agent of the policyholder. If IFAs are agents for the consumer, and not just freelance salesmen, then Wiesner suggests it is fair to have higher expectations from them. I quote: 'The independent intermediary is the agent of the client. His service should be on a par with other professional services - such as those offered by a solicitor or an accountant - where the adviser would normally charge a fee and, in any event, has a duty to account to his client for any commission received. The tied agent, by contrast, is a salesman for his company and their agent rather than the client's' In other words, IFAs should be on a different playing field from tied agents. A fully fee-based system would remove conflicts of interest at source. Sadly, though, this will not happen in Britain for many years. Most financial products come with commissions built in, the tax system is unfavourable, and the public is not prepared to pay fees. Insurers are generally more reliable as prompt payers than consumers. For the time being, clear and transparent commissions will have to do. If customers can see the incentives, and how much they are paying, much of the conflict diagnosed in the OFT reports disappears. In many cases, a commission will be revealed as a perfectly reasonable price to pay. For the good of independent advisers, whose status would be enhanced, and, most importantly, the consumer, the OFT should urge the government to enforce disclosure of commissions at point of sale.</p>

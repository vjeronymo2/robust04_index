			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF TOWER IS SPURNED;  </P> <P> NEXT NOMINEE: MATTER OF HOW AS WELL AS WHO  </P> <P> Beneath the Bush Administration's determination to stick with defense  secretary-designate John Tower to the end, there is a lively but  still-unofficial debate over who will be next if Tower goes down in defeat on  the Senate floor.  </P> <P> At issue, said sources close to the Administration, is not only who the best  candidate is to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and reform,  but how the President should respond to the Senate in the wake of a repudiation  of Tower, his first choice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Directions  </P> <P> Should Bush's next pick be someone designed to please the very lawmakers who  are bent on dealing his Administration a harsh political blow in its infancy?  Or should the President use the opportunity to show Congress who's boss?  </P> <P> The debate has split Republican strategists, and White House insiders suggest  the rift is reflected among Bush's inner circle of advisers.  </P> <P> The range of candidates whose names are now circulating is broad.  </P> <P> There is a trio of former defense secretaries -- Republicans Donald H. Rumsfeld  and James R. Schlesinger and Democrat Harold Brown.  </P> <P> There is another former lawmaker -- Jack Edwards, the Alabama Republican who  voluntarily gave up a congressional seat and recently co-chaired a commission  recommending the closing of obsolete military bases. And there is a pair of  retired military officers already in the Administration -- Adm. James D.  Watkins, Bush's energy secretary, and Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the President's  national security adviser.  </P> <P> So far, the White House has brooked no public discussion from its ranks about  possible replacements, wary of undercutting the already hard-pressed lobbying  effort to keep Tower's chances alive.  </P> <P> Asked whether any list of candidates exists, one Bush Administration official  said flatly: "None. Zero. None."  </P> <P> But another Administration official familiar with the process said: "It's  absolutely foolish not to be considering alternatives and considering people  for these priority positions . . . I'm sure it's being discussed in little  pockets."  </P> <P> Melvin R. Laird, a former Richard M. Nixon Administration defense secretary who  has advised Bush on transition matters, acknowledged that "advice to the  President has been divided" over how long to stick with Tower and to whom to  switch if the expected Senate rejection comes this week or next.  </P> <P> Sources say there is some support for Bush making his next move a defiant one,  reasserting his primacy over national security issues with a Tower-Scowcroft  switch.  </P> <P> Under that scenario, Scowcroft would slide over to the top Pentagon post and  Tower would become national security adviser, a job that does not require  Senate confirmation. That would allow Bush to keep Tower in a key policy post  despite the Democrats' snub and at the same time not risk a confirmation  backlash against Scowcroft, who is widely respected by both parties.  </P> <P> Two Republican strategists said the idea has been discussed within the  Administration, but acknowledged there is disagreement on its wisdom.  </P> <P> Such a stroke is "the only thing you could do to save political face" after an  embarrassing, personal defeat, said one Administration official, adding: "What  do you do when this guy, your friend, is getting clobbered?"  </P> <P> Bush, while refusing to discuss any second choices, has fed the speculation  about such a counterpunch nomination with his angry rhetoric on Tower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush 'Wants' Tower  </P> <P> There is "the right of the President to have -- historical right -- to have who  he wants in his Administration," Bush said in his press conference Tuesday. "I  want him." And he could have Tower -- as national security adviser.  </P> <P> But other prominent Republicans said they fear such a ploy would only infuriate  Democrats and provoke them to paralyze future Administration legislative  efforts that will require bipartisan support.  </P> <P> Should Bush choose instead to appease his congressional opponents in an effort  to restore bipartisan cooperation, other options might be more likely.  </P> <P> Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the center of the Democratic effort to defeat Tower,  said last week that there are "all sorts of people" who have strong national  security credentials, and no heavy burden of allegations, who would pass  muster.  </P> <P> Making the same point, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) cited Rumsfeld and  Schlesinger as prime choices, adding: "If the President sends another name up  here, it'll be confirmed by a heavy majority."  </P> <P> Such a choice by the President might fall short of a strong statement, however,  and within Bush's circle of advisers those particular men have some problems.  In January, Schlesinger's reputation as an acerbic intellectual with  questionable political loyalties helped cost him the job of energy secretary in  the Bush Cabinet. Schlesinger had served as defense secretary in the Nixon and  Gerald R. Ford administrations and as energy secretary for Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> Rumsfeld, while a Bush adviser in the final phases of the 1988 campaign, began  the race in the camp of Bush's chief rival, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a fact that  Laird said has weighed against him. Moreover, sources say that Bush's relations  with Rumsfeld, who is now a Chicago-based investment banking adviser, remain  strained from bureaucratic battles waged when Bush was CIA director and  Rumsfeld secretary of defense during the Ford Administration.  </P> <P> For his part, Laird said he thinks President Carter's defense secretary, Harold  Brown, would be a good choice. "Brown is a very strong national security  advocate who understands the Pentagon very well. He's not a partisan person  when it comes to defense."  </P> <P> A number of other names have surfaced from the ranks of politics and industry.  </P> <P> Donald B. Rice, president of the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp., would be  unlikely to face a challenge from Nunn, the leader among Democrats in defense  issues. Rice has been an informal adviser to Nunn as well as a golfing partner.  </P> <P> Drew Lewis, whose name was floated for the top Pentagon job before Tower was  named, is a favorite candidate among those who seek a tough budget-cutter and a  hands-on manager with business experience. Lewis, a former Ronald Reagan  Administration transportation secretary, is chief executive officer of the  Union Pacific Corp. and served recently on the congressionally created National  Economic Commission that explored methods of reducing the federal budget  deficit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Requires Law Waiver  </P> <P> Watkins, a retired high-ranking Navy officer held in high regard by both  parties, might be a popular choice for rebuilding a bipartisan spirit. However,  his choice would require Congress to waive a 1947 law that prohibits retired  military officers from serving in the senior defense position within 10 years  of leaving the service. Scowcroft would not face that problem, having left the  Air Force more than a decade ago.  </P> <P> Like Tower, Jack Edwards would bring a knowledge of Congress and an expertise  in the fine print of the defense budget to the Pentagon's top job. But critics  say that unlike Tower, Edwards is no grand policy strategist, an important  trait for that job.  </P> <P> Republican strategists predict that Bush will stick to his Tower pattern by  choosing someone with broad policy vision who would complement his nominee for  Pentagon's second-in-charge, Donald J. Atwood, a former General Motors  executive with strong management expertise.  </P> <P> That might rule out previous runners-up like Martin-Marietta chief executive  Norman R. Augustine and Alcoa chairman Paul H. O'Neill.  </P> <P> But it would allow Bush options for either a defiant gesture or a conciliatory  one, whichever way Bush decides to play the next round in the Pentagon  nomination.  </P> <P> In the end, said one GOP source, Senate Democrats may "rue the day" they  thought they won the Tower battle.  </P> <P> Staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOME CANDIDATES FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  </P> <P> Harold Brown, 61, defense secretary in the Carter Administration.

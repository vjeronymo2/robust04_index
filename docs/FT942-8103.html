			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Labour's beauty contest: You cannot judge politicians by their looks John Smith's body will be laid to rest today. This, apparently, is the cue for the campaign to begin in earnest for the right to succeed the dead Labour leader. As far as the press is concerned, however, the battle has already swung wildly back and forth, and is close to being decided. The day after Smith's death, the 41-year-old Tony Blair was - almost unanimously - declared a shoo-in for the job. He is, it was stated, young, good looking and 'a moderniser'. Two days later, the landscape - with equal decisiveness - had changed. Blair was not just young, but too young. He was not just good looking, but suspiciously good looking, a 'Bambi' figure. The press which had endorsed him the previous day suddenly discovered that it had absolutely no idea what Blair believed in. But Blair's extraordinary physical beauty has still left his rivals struggling, we are told. Robin Cook gained the most votes in last year's elections to the shadow cabinet. He is the party's most consistently brilliant debater in the commons. He would probably eviscerate John Major at question time. He is just about the only Labour politician to have thought seriously about the dangers of European Union. He is in favour of hunting. In short, Cook is, for all his Edinburgh intellectualism, a man in touch with popular sentiment. But he is unelectable as a prime minister because he resembles a garden gnome. Or so we are told by our great opinion formers. Indeed, the Guardian, which ought to know most about such things, tells us that Cook himself, worn down by criticism of his appearence, has conceded that he is physiognomically unelectable in the era of electoral franchise by television. Gordon Brown, aged 43, splits the modern school of political analysts neatly. On the one hand, we are told admiringly, Brown is 'brilliant at television sound-bites'. This means that Brown is capable of spending all day saying the same five words over and over again to a succession of television crews, without going mad. On the other hand, we are told, Brown is blind in one eye, which means that he looks a bit, well, you know, odd. And he is a bachelor, which is apparently risky these days. As with Blair, Brown's political views are deemed to be undetectable. But because he is not so good looking as Blair, this is put down to native Scottish caution rather than vacuity. I am beginning to believe that the election for the leadership of the Labour party should be conducted by Julia Morley, who has vast experience of organising beauty contests, notably 'Miss World'. The contestants would march up and down in a succession of costumes, and then would spend 30 seconds each being interviewed about their hobbies and ambitions ('leading the Labour party') by Michael Aspel. What is so very odd about all this, is that there is no evidence, so far as I am aware, that the British electorate, let alone the members of the Labour party, are decisively influenced by the physical appearance of a candidate. Perhaps there has been research to this effect, and if so I should like to see it. But until then I think we should assume that the vast majority of the British people, if they are the sort who care enough to vote, will do so on the basis of what they think are the opinions and achievements - or lack of them - of those who solicit their support. What tends to happen is that our views of politicians' appearances are conditioned by our growing appreciation of their virtues and vices. Winston Churchill was about 5ft 5ins tall, narrow shouldered, sunken chested and pot bellied. But he appeared formidable, because of what we knew of his achievements. Anthony Eden was a striking physical specimen, as handsome as any prime minister. But now all we see is weakness in that fine face, because we discovered all too quickly what lay beneath the veneer. The Labour party, in other words, should not be frightened of electing someone who looks like a garden gnome. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

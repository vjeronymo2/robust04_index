			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strikes wipe 3.9 per cent off Lufthansa COMPUTER problems disrupted trading in Paris as the Continent returned from its long weekend, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT showed its first sign of nerves about the public sector strikes. The DAX index fell 5.74 to 1,728.29 while the FAZ index lost 1.7 to 699.29. Turnover fell to DM3.8bn from DM5.1bn on Thursday. Lufthansa dipped DM6 or 3.9 per cent to DM147.50 as strikes shut a number of Germany's airports. Unions plan to close Frankfurt today. The airline said that it could lose up to DM40m a day in lost revenue if all its aircraft were grounded. Car stocks were weaker on news of a fall in new vehicle registrations. Volkswagen, which publishes its annual report tomorrow, lost DM1.50 to DM378.80. Schering bucked the trend, gaining DM1.50 to DM819.50 on expectations of positive first quarter results today. Bayer rose DM1.80 to DM281.80 while BASF, after paying a DM12 dividend last Thursday, was down a net DM1.10 at DM239.90. PARIS traded for only 2 1/2 hours yesterday due to a technical problem. The CAC-40 index closed up 10.48 at 2,041.62, inspired by a firm start on Wall Street, in turnover of just 1.2bn. Ciments Francais was re-quoted yesterday after last week's suspension and vaulted FFr78 or 20.7 per cent to FFr455, following news last week that Italcementi would support the price at FFr470. Other gainers included Eurotunnel, up FFr1.15 or 3.1 per cent at FFr38.70, and Elf FFr6 higher at FFr398. But Euro Disney lost FFr2.90 to FFr134.10. MILAN was dragged down by Stet, Italcementi and the banking sector. The Comit index fell 6.67 or 1.3 per cent to 496.21 in turnover estimated at more than L100bn after last Thursday's L113bn. Stet dropped L122 or 6 per cent to L1,899 with an estimated 10m shares traded, following news late last week that the state holding company Iri planned a large share and warrant placement. The fall brought the stock into line with Friday's closing price in London. Dealers said Iri defended the share price, via Banco di Roma. Italcementi dropped another L200 or 1.3 per cent to L14,650 as investors continued to register their disapproval of a big rights issue to finance its purchase of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais. The stock was also harmed by news that Consob planned an investigation into possible insider trading in Italcementi shares. Fears of bad loans and a possible placement by Iri of savings shares in Banca Commerciale prompted a fall of L108 or 3.1 per cent to L3,325. Worries about higher property taxes forced insurers lower, with Generali down L390 at L29,500. ZURICH's SMI index put on 27.6 or 1.46 per cent to 1,907.7. Roche bearers gained SFr130 to SFr4,450 ahead of today's annual meeting while Nestle bearers added SFr100 to SFr9,960 following last week's positive 1991 results. But Swissair bearers lost SFr20 to SFr742 after the airline said passenger numbers fell by 7 per cent in the first quarter. AMSTERDAM extended last week's gains as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 129.9. Elsevier was up Fl 3.60 or 3.1 per cent at Fl 118.40 on strong foreign buying. Philips rose 60 cents to Fl 39 ahead of tomorrow's first quarter results. Hunter Douglas gained Fl 3 or 4 per cent to Fl 76.50 while Fokker rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 36.30 in spite of denying reports that it was in talks with British Aerospace. STOCKHOLM saw Skandia's unrestricted shares rise SKr12 to SKr130 amid speculation that Norway's Uni Storebrand would sell its 28 per cent stake in Skandia, after the latter's takeover bid for Hafnia was rejected last week. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 4.0 to 985.5 in turnover of SKr549m. OSLO saw Den norske Bank jump 17.7 per cent or NKr1.40 to NKr9.30 ahead of today's first quarter results. The all-share index was up 6.58 to 449.48. The Eurotrack 100 index was unavailable owing to the closure of the London Stock Exchange.</p>

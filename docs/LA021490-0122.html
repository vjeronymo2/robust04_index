			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4-AA BOYS;  </P> <P> SHARP-SHOOTING EDISON SINKS WOODBRIDGE  </P> <P> Edison High School sent a message to the would-be tacticians remaining in the  Southern Section 4-AA playoffs -- bring on those gimmick defenses.  </P> <P> The Chargers, a team that has pounded the ball inside throughout the season,  demonstrated that their outside game is just fine, thank you. They dismantled  Woodbridge's triangle-and-two defense for a 70-53 victory in a first-round game  at Edison Friday night.  </P> <P> "To do well in the playoffs, you're going to need good outside shooting,"  Edison Coach Jon Bochert said. "That's the only way you can keep other teams  from packing it in on defense."  </P> <P> Which is just what Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon had in mind Friday night.  </P> <P> The Warriors played man-to-man on 6-foot-10 center Bill Martineau and 6-4  forward Brandon Jessie, while the rest of the team played zone.  </P> <P> "Edison had made only 12 three-point field goals all season," Shannon said. "We  wanted to make them shoot the threes."  </P> <P> Guards Dan Lovelady and Tom Smyser obliged, although not to Shannon's liking.  </P> <P> Lovelady, who had made seven three-pointers all season, made three and finished  with 12 points. Smyser came off the bench and made four of five shots,  including three three-pointers, and finished with 12 points.  </P> <P> The Chargers started strong, making their first five shots. Lovelady made two  of his three-point field goals in the first three minutes, which brought the  Warriors out of their defense.  </P> <P> But, by then, the Chargers (17-9) had a 18-4 lead.  </P> <P> "The were giving us any outside shot we wanted to take," Bochert said. "We just  took what they gave us."  </P> <P> Woodbridge (13-13) made a game of it in the second quarter. Led by guard Toby  Ramos (18 points), the Warriors closed to within 21-18.  </P> <P> The Chargers got into foul trouble in the second quarter, which almost cost  them. Edison had four starters with three fouls by halftime, including its  entire starting front line of Martineau, Jessie and Steve Thobe.  </P> <P> The Warriors (13-13) were able to go inside and stayed close until 3 minutes 15  seconds left in the half. However, Jessie scored five points in a two-minute  span before going to the bench with his third foul.  </P> <P> That helped push the Edison lead to 37-26 at halftime.  </P> <P> "We were a little inconsistent in the first half," Bochert said. "A lot of that  had to do with the our foul problems. But there were times out there tonight  when we played very, very well."  </P> <P> With the Woodbridge defense extended, Jessie (17 points) and Martineau (12  points) dominated inside. Jessie scored 10 points in the second half and  Martineau nine.  </P></p>

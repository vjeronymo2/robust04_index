			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] The first day of talks between the Israeli and  Palestinian delegations in Taba ended in serious disagreement  about the interpretation of the "Cairo understandings," after  some Israeli delegates reiterated that the understandings were  as binding on the Palestinians as an actual agreement.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the  Taba talks, said the Palestinians "once again categorically  rejected the attempt to bind them to the Cairo understandings."  According to him, "instead of making progress, the sides were  busy yesterday with the presentation of documents and  discussions of their interpretation, but on this issue, too, no  agreement was reached."    Sha'th added: "If the Israelis raise the interpretation of  the Cairo understandings once again, I will be certain that  Israel is trying to hold back the talks. Until now, I thought  we may be having trouble communicating, but after today's round  of talks I have serious doubts."    He added: "If the Israeli delegation plans to entrap or  embarrass the other side -- that is us -- or portray us as  fools, I do not see how it plans to sign an agreement with us  afterward." [passage omitted]    Sha'th disclosed to HA'ARETZ all the documents he sent to  Major General Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation  to the talks, and those he received from him. He also disclosed  a document with Prime Minister Rabin's reservations about the  Cairo understandings. "Did you know that Rabin also had  reservations about them? The document contains nine  reservations about the border crossings and the size of the  autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho. Rabin sent me the letter  via Shahaq, and I never mentioned it until this moment," Sha'th  said.    "Here is the famous letter I sent to Shahaq with Yasir  'Arafat's reservations. As you see, 'Arafat has fewer  reservations than Rabin. Therefore, these obviously are fluid  matters. There is no agreement, and this is merely an attempt  to entrap the Palestinians," he asserted.    Sha'th even disclosed that the Palestinians submitted to the  Israeli delegation a 70-page document yesterday containing their  updated versions of the comprehensive agreement and of the  security protocol. According to him, "this is a compromise  between the positions of both sides, based on the protocols of 8  December. It is a serious effort on our part to prove that the  negotiations in Taba can be completed within two to three weeks.  We are now awaiting Israel's response." [passage omitted]    [A report by No'omi Levitzky on pages 1 and 19 of Tel Aviv  YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 11 January notes that the document  presented by the Palestinians yesterday "makes no mention of  their demand to increase Jericho's autonomous area beyond the 55  square km agreed upon in Cairo."]</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Competitive improvement - Legal briefs Significant improvements in the European Commission's handling of competition cases have been called for by the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Committee, chaired by Lord Slynn, the Law Lord and former British judge at the European Court of Justice, is opposed to fundamental structural change such as hiving-off competition investigations to a separate authority, but it calls for changes in Commission procedures. The Lords recommend improved access for businesses to the Commission's file on a complaint or investigation, with powers for the independent official known as the hearing officer to rule on conflicts between access and confidentiality. Where national inspectors carry out 'dawn raids' on business premises for the Commission they should work under identical guidelines to Commission inspectors. When the Commission closes an investigation with a 'comfort letter' indicating, without a formal decision, it does not intend to take further action, it should explain its findings more clearly. There should be more block exemptions from the competition rules covering wide categories of cases to reduce the need for individual companies to apply for an exemption. Reasons for imposing a fine should be set out fully. The Competition Directorate (DGIV) and the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg (CFI) (which handles competition cases) should have better resources. Procedural changes recommended by the Committee include: mandatory timetables to be laid down at the outset of an investigation for a formal decision; appeals against a ruling of a hearing officer to a single judge of the CFI; leave of a national judge required before a Commission decision ordering an investigation is carried out against the wishes of the company concerned; a simplified new procedure leading to a decision by a single Commissioner; investigation and assessment of appropriate cases delegated to national competition authorities; and harmonisation of national remedies, notably on damages, injunctions and interim measures.</p>

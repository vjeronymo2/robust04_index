			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and  Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia emphatically denied that  Armed Forces generals had requested the president's resignation.  A rumor was begun in local circles that generals not linked with  Army Commander General Lino Oviedo had requested Wasmosy's  resignation to protest Oviedo's excessive influence over the  military institution. Foreign media sources, particularly in  Argentina, repeated the rumor.    A rumor circulated during the meeting of the Argentine,  Bolivian, and Paraguayan presidents in Formosa yesterday,  indicating that there was strong dissatisfaction among young  Paraguayan officers for the excessive power that the Army  commander in fact holds.    Wasmosy was asked about the matter after a meeting at the  commander in chief's offices this morning. The president said  the rumor was not true. "It is absolutely false. It seems the  papers are short of real news," Wasmosy said in referring to the  foreign press.    Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia characterized the foreign  press publications as real nonsense. "It is real stupidity. I  do not know where this disinformation might be coming from. It  is absurd to even think that generals could ask for the  resignation of the president of the Republic," Estigarribia said.    The minister said if the information originated locally, it  was just "nonsense," invented by the press interested in  destabilizing the democratic process. If it originated abroad,  it was pure disinformation, Estigarribia added.    Today, Wasmosy travelled to Salvador (Bahia). Not all the  generals -- and not even Oviedo, who usually comes to see the  president off -- were present at the airport. The defense  minister explained that the absence of some generals was due to  the fact that they were carrying out tasks in the interior of  the country.</p>

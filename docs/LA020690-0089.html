			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RCA FINED $2.5 MILLION FOR DEFENSE DOCUMENTS;  </P> <P> PENTAGON: THE PROSECUTOR SAYS MORE FIRMS WILL BE CHARGED FOR TRYING TO GAIN AN  EDGE OVER THEIR COMPETITORS BY TRAFFICKING IN CONFIDENTIAL BUDGET PAPERS.  </P> <P> RCA Corp. on Monday pleaded guilty in federal court to trafficking in  classified defense budget documents and agreed to pay a $2.5-million fine in  the latest conviction in an ongoing probe into illegal trade in Pentagon  papers.  </P> <P> One current and one former RCA employee also pleaded guilty to felony charges  arising from their part in obtaining the confidential Pentagon documents.  </P> <P> The case is part of a six-year investigation dubbed Operation Uncover into how  defense contractors trade secret Defense Department documents to gain advantage  over competitors. "This is a continuing investigation," said Henry E. Hudson,  U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, predicting that "other  individuals and corporations" are likely to be charged soon.  </P> <P> Boeing Co. in November admitted similar crimes and paid more than $5 million in  fines. A former Boeing executive, Richard Lee Fowler, was found guilty in  December of 39 counts of conspiring to use classified military data to help his  firm win Pentagon business.  </P> <P> General Electric Co., which acquired RCA in 1986 as a subsidiary, said in a  statement, "This unfortunate chapter in RCA history is now closed." GE said  that all the activities covered in the case took place before it acquired RCA  and said that it had "cooperated fully" in the government investigation.  </P> <P> General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., is the nation's third-largest  defense contractor, with contracts with the Pentagon worth $5.7 billion in the  fiscal year ending in September, 1988, the last full year for which final  figures are available.  </P> <P> While similar in nature, Operation Uncover is not related to the Ill Wind probe  into corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying. More than 30 companies and  individuals have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes in the Ill Wind  probe, which focuses on bribery of Pentagon officials for inside information on  military weapons procurement.  </P> <P> RCA and Boeing were convicted of trafficking in planning papers laying out in  broad terms U.S. defense strategy and procurement policy, rather than  individuals weapons contracts.  </P> <P> In court documents accompanying RCA's plea agreement, the government said that  from 1978 through 1985 RCA obtained copies of numerous internal Defense  Department planning documents, including the Defense Guidance, the Five-Year  Defense Plan and the Program Objective Memoranda of the military services.  </P> <P> Such reports generally are classified secret and closely held within the  Pentagon. Some volumes of the Defense Guidance, which spells out American  military strategy and future force structure plans, bear the warning "Not  releasable to contractors/consultants."  </P> <P> Prosecutors were vague as to exactly how RCA obtained the documents, saying  only that three company officials had obtained them from representatives of  other defense contractors.  </P> <P> Two of the RCA officials, Leonard C. Kampf and Ronald B. Stevens, pleaded  guilty to "conveyance without authority" of government property worth more than  $100. Both men face a maximum of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.  </P> <P> Kampf, 69, was a manager of marketing information at RCA's Government Systems  Division in Cherry Hill, N.J., until his retirement in August, 1984. Stevens,  49, was a marketing manager at the firm's Aerospace and Defense Division, also  in Cherry Hill.  </P> <P> GE spokesman George Jamison said that Stevens has been suspended pending  sentencing.  </P> <P> Michael J. Costello, a senior official of the Defense Criminal Investigative  Service, which has been assisting in the government probe, said the RCA  executives were involved in a "tightly knit group" of contractor officials who  swapped bootleg Pentagon documents among themselves.  </P> <P> He said there may have been no more than a dozen individuals and companies  involved in the conspiracy. While scores of valuable government planning  documents were acquired from Pentagon sources and exchanged among the  contractors, investigators have found no evidence that any money changed hands,  Costello said.  </P></p>

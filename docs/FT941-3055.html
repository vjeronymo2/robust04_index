			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises to second 1994 high of the week Tokyo Share prices rose as heavy arbitrage buying and purchases by foreign investors overwhelmed selling by companies and investment trust funds, and the Nikkei 225 average climbed 0.8 per cent to another 1994 high in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 168.92 at 20,677.77 after a day's low of 20,518.05 and high of 20,781.98. A rise in the Nikkei futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday prompted buying by futures traders in Osaka. Volume increased to 632m shares from 561m. Overseas investors pursued large-capital stocks, which have been lagging behind the index; dealers and arbitrageurs were also buyers. However, some traders said the substantial volume reflected large-lot arbitrage and dealer activity and did not show real demand. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 10.33 at 1,653.27 and the Nikkei 300 added 1.72 at 304.03. Advances led declines by 747 to 289, with 153 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.22 at 1,369.76. Steel companies were higher on foreign buying. Kawasaki Steel, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y10 to Y373. Chemical and textile shares were perceived as laggards. Mitsubishi Kasei advanced Y27 to Y490, Sumitomo Chemical Y21 to Y489 and Kurabo Industries Y16 to Y432. Toshiba gained Y7 at Y802 on prospects of firm earnings. Sales are expected to rise in the current year to the end of this month, for the first time in three years; profits are expected to increase for the first time in five years in 1994/95. However, corporate profit-taking depressed a few consumer electronics stocks. Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y30 to Y1,810 and Victor Y50 to Y1,530. Some financials lost ground on profit-taking. Nomura Securities declined Y20 to Y2,370 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to Y1,740. Daiwa Bank retreated Y40 to Y1,000. In Osaka, the OSE average was 149.56 higher at 22,587.94 in volume of 145.5m shares. The index gained for the fifth consecutive day on buying by foreign investors. Roundup Regional markets put in mixed performances. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Karachi remained on holiday. HONG KONG fell 1.5 per cent after a rally in the opening minutes, sparked by rises in Hong Kong shares listed in London overnight and positive US economic data, was swiftly reversed. The Hang Seng index closed 142.95 down at 9,720.61, having been 101 points ahead in early trade. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 3.48bn. HSBC Holdings, the day's most active stock in turnover of HKDollars 215.4m, finished HKDollars 1 lower at HKDollars 99. MANILA recovered from an early fall following PLDT's drop on Wall Street, prompting the view that the market was ready to test higher ground. The composite index gained 9.44 at 2,642.90 as PLDT lost 25 pesos at 1,890 pesos. TAIWAN gained ground, boosted by persistent buying of blue chip electronics issues by some new local trust funds. The weighted index moved up 57.10, or 1.1 per cent, to 5,331.34 in thin turnover of TDollars 38.04bn. Among the electronics groups, Acer, also helped by last week's court verdict in a patent dispute, appreciated TDollars 2 to TDollars 53.50. AUSTRALIA finished in positive territory, in spite of some late selling. The market drew encouragement from a rally in bonds, which followed the release of local economic growth figures and modest US inflation data. The All Ordinaries index ended 1.0 up at 2,173.5 after an intraday high of 2,182.8. SEOUL saw persistent consolidation in blue chips, although there was growing interest for low-priced shares. The composite stock index finished 4.90 off at 906.53. Bank shares, however, were generally higher on institutional support and expectations that a number of banks were planning rights issues. Commercial Bank of Korea, which topped the actives list with 2.33m shares traded, rose Won290 to Won8,600. SINGAPORE was easier in spite of a rebound in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.14 to 2,185.81. BOMBAY closed stronger, but few deals were done as the ban on forward trading reduced liquidity in the market. The BSE index advanced 33.68 to 3,791.96. COLOMBO was easier again as the market continued its decline after the 40 per cent rise in the first two months of the year. The all-share index lost 27.59 at 1,240.79.</p>

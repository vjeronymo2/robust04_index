			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 27 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has described the situation in  Yemen as dangerous. He said the main reason for the fighting  between the two parts is that Yemeni unity was not established  on a sound basis, the armed forces continued to be split into  two, and there were two different currencies.    In a statement to the Kuwaiti newspaper AL-WATAN today he  regretted the failure of the UN secretary general's envoy  Lakhdar Brahimi's mission and appealed to leaders of the two  sides to end the fighting and immediately start negotiations  under the auspices of the United Nations or any other party they  agree upon to stem the bloodshed in the country.    'Abd-al-Majid emphasized that the Arab League's primary goal  is to stop the bloody fighting between the two sides. He noted  that the issue of recognizing south Yemen is left for the  future, that the League's documents indicate that the Yemeni  Arab Republic is a unified state, and that any change in status  should be decided at the League Council in light of the northern  and southern parties' views.    Concluding his statement, 'Abd-al-Majid said unity can never  be imposed by force.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Irish Permanent plans listing - Market capitalisation of about IPounds 200m expected in summer float Irish Permanent Building Society, the largest building society in the Republic of Ireland, is to seek a flotation on the London and Dublin stock exchanges in the early summer. The IPBS has 30 per cent of the Irish residential mortgage market, assets of IPounds 2.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn) and reserves of IPounds 156.2m. Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive, said the conversion of IPBS from its mutual status to a plc was 'a strategic issue, to obtain access to the equity market on an ongoing basis.' The company simultaneously reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 29m (IPounds 21.5m) for the year to December 31. Net interest income grew by 33 per cent to IPounds 80.4m, while the cost/income ratio was reduced to 60.5 per cent (64.3 per cent). A target ratio of 50 per cent has been set for 1996. IPBS is the first building society in the Republic to seek conversion, and the move marks a major development in Ireland's financial services industry. Market liberalisation in recent years has permitted banks and building societies to broaden their range of services, such that the distinction between them is becoming increasingly blurred. The resulting intensification of competition has placed building societies at a relative disadvantage to publicly-quoted banks, as their mutual status limits them to raising capital largely from retained profits. Members'approval for conversion of the society's mutual status to a plc and flotation will be sought at the annual meeting in four weeks' time. Conversion will result in the issue of 81m free shares to an estimated 227,000 qualifying members of and a cash distribution of up to IPounds 200 each for a further 100,000 members who do not qualify for the free shares. The flotation, in June 'or soon thereafter,' will raise up to IPounds 50m in new capital with the issue of a further 36m shares. Mr Douglas said the flotation shares would be placed with institutions and offered through subscription rights, rather than an open offer. He added that on completion of the flotation, market capitalisation was expected to be between IPounds 180m and IPounds 200m, giving an indicative share price of 150p to 166p. Growth strategy would focus on the personal savings and lending segment of the Irish market, and the development of a life assurance business.</p>

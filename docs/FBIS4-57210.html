			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 15 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Sandinist People's  Army (EPS) today reported that yesterday they seized a Costa  Rican boat 16 km north of the Costa Rican border for illegally  navigating inside Nicaraguan waters.    EPS spokesman Ricardo Wheelock said that they arrested seven  passengers--three Costa Ricans and four U.S. citizens--and that  the boat was towed to Bluefields on Nicaragua's atlantic coast.    "They probably were sport fishing. It is also a drug  trafficking area, and that it is why there are special EPS  patrols in that area," Wheelock told the press.    Contrary to the EPS report, Costa Rican Security Minister  Juan Diego Castro said that the Nicaraguan patrol boats entered  Costa Rican territorial waters to apprehend two boats, not one,  as Wheelock had said.    Castro said he contacted the Nicaraguan Government Ministry  to work on the release of the people arrested, but the ministry  spokespersons were not available.</p>

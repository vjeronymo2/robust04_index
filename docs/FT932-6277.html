			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (24): It has to be the UK - The special relationship still exists WHEN US companies seek locations in Europe in which to set up, expand, or acquire business operations, the UK has significant advantages. A common language and culture, a shared history and strong political ties, are obviously important. But the UK also sells itself as a place where it is easy to conduct business - there is less bureaucratic interference from government than in many European countries, business regulation is generally light, and labour laws are among the most liberal in the region. Moreover, corporate tax rates are also lower in the UK than elsewhere in Europe, wage costs are competitive, and the workforce is relatively well educated and skilled. Equally important, the political environment is stable. As Geoffrey Robinshaw, whose role as a representative of the trade and investment office in the British Consulate-General in New York is to persuade US companies to locate in the UK, puts it: 'I'm inclined to think that we're in the frame unless we mess it up.' Aidan Walsh, international director at consultancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick in New York, agrees. 'It's almost automatic that US companies will consider the UK first as a possible location.' While many companies consider the UK first, other European countries do not stand aside. Competition for US investment is intense. There was a rush of interest in Europe as a business location in the run-up to the creation of the single market in 1992, and enthusiasm among US companies has intensified in the past year or so. The integration of European markets has led to a new emphasis on consolidation - of manufacturing, servicing, retailing and marketing operations. US companies that once had production or servicing facilities in several European countries realise that the free movement of goods, people, services and capital means they may now need only one central location for their European-based business. Mr Jean Claude Goldenstein, New York-based director of European location advisory services for Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'There is a growing tendency for US companies to disregard the nation-state concept, and instead think Europe-wide for their markets, and regionally for their facilities. The trend is to centralise production, back offices, and customer support facilities in selected regional locations.' European governments recognise how high the stakes are in this game, which is why they offer US and other foreign companies packages of business incentives, which include financial grants and special tax breaks. In this respect, the UK believes it compares well with the rest of Europe. Mr Robinshaw says: 'The UK government does not believe in throwing money at projects. But in terms of grants, what can be available is always subject to negotiation. . . and comparable to anything offered elsewhere.' The UK is at a disadvantage, however, compared with Ireland, which has lowered corporate tax rate to 10 per cent for foreign companies with manufacturing operations or financial services units in the country. Ireland also competes closely in terms of labour costs. Apart from Spain and Greece, it is the only major European economy where these are lower than in the UK. Yet cost is not the only key consideration in assessing locally-employed labour. Education, skill levels and industrial relations are also important. Here, US companies find the UK has both strengths and weaknesses. The French and German state education systems at secondary level generally have a better reputation than Britain's. But in higher education, the UK fares better. US companies seeking well-educated and experienced science, engineering and computing graduates find plenty in the UK. As for industrial relations, the UK has a lead over its European competitors, thanks primarily to the liberalisation of labour laws during the 1980s. This, says a recent Ernst &amp; Young report, has created a 'competitive advantage for the UK, Ireland and Switzerland, which do not have large severance payments or trade union requirements. A number of highly-publicised recent plant locations to Scotland highlight this trend.' By comparison, French and German labour laws frighten many US managers. Mr Walsh, of KPMG, says, for example, that the EC's planned 'social charter', which the UK government is resisting, worries US companies, which do not want to be forced to put workers on their board of directors, or to accept restrictions on firing and hiring. Inter-governmental European politics can also affect the way in which different countries are perceived, although it is difficult to say whether the UK's reluctance to commit itself fully to European economic and political integration deters some US companies from locating in the UK. At least one relocation consultant does not believe US companies are too concerned by the UK debate about its future in Europe. As he delicately puts it: 'Americans are not internationalists. They have no real focus on what goes on outside their country.' Others disagree, arguing that the political battle being fought in the UK over the Maastricht agreement is monitored within the US. Mr Goldenstein says US companies worry that 'the centre of gravity in Europe is shifting south and east'. Even Mr Robinshaw, at the British trade and investment office in New York, accepts that a prolonged internal fight over UK's role in Europe could hurt the country's business prospects. 'The longer these things drag on, the more they will permeate people's consciousness.' A by-product of the UK's problems in Europe, the withdrawal of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism, is unlikely to have deterred US companies from locating in the UK. It could prove a double-edged sword - the sharp devaluation of the pound makes it easier to export UK-made goods, but also reduces the value of US companies' repatriated profits. Companies keen on setting up a central European distribution operation might find other locations more convenient than the UK. Yet, as Mr Walsh of KPMG puts it: 'All a company wants to know is: how far am I from my market?' However, companies measure distance not in miles but in hours. Goods manufactured in the UK can be delivered to most European markets in 24 hours. The completion of the Channel Tunnel should improve transport links - even if, as one consultant says, 'most Americans don't realise yet that you won't be able to drive through the tunnel.'</p>

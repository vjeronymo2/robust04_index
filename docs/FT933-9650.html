			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Jordan warns of skills shortages ENGINEERING companies face imminent skill shortages, says Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union and chairman of the training committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. Mr Jordan is to meet Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, to discuss his concern about the shortage of craft, technical and supervisory skills that will result when demand picks up, and to present a CSEU-led policy initiative on training. The initiative argues for more multi-skilling in engineering and wants to increase trade union involvement in training programmes. It recommends the establishment of joint committees to monitor progress and liaise with training and enterprise councils. The initiative prepared by the CSEU includes trade union involvement in the redesign of National Vocational Qualifications in manufacturing and engineering - some of which it claims have been diluted in their breadth of skills because of costs. Others, it says, are too narrow and task-specific. The confederation, while setting out the respective responsibilities of the government, employers and trainees, ideally would like some form of national levy to cover the cost of the training.

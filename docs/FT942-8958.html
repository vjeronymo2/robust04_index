			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: Booth's 'Wonderlawn' - Dance Barclay's New Stages festival - concerned with the innovative and, we hope, the valuable in theatre and (some) dance - is in its fourth year and at the Royal Court. Several cheers for the enterprise; rather fewer, sad to say, for the major dance offering: Laurie Booth and Company in a commissioned piece. I saw Booth's Wonderlawn on Monday night. I have much admired his solo and duet work (notably in his partnership with Russell Maliphant) for its extraordinary variety of energy - Booth like a calligrapher, brush heavy with ink, making sweeps and flows of dynamics, suddenly twisting the ideogram with a flick of the hand, leaving a bold shape on the retina. His stage persona is often that of guru or of a traveller in quest of spiritual experience. Serenity sought and found is an abiding impression in his best dances. As a creator his most potent work is made for himself, or in tandem with one disciple-colleague, their bond the subtleties of contact improvisation, where every move awakens a spontaneous sequence of activity. His larger creations that I have seen look diffuse. So with Wonderlawn. Three dancers - Ellen van Schuylenburch, John Kilroy, James de Maria - join Booth. Two parts, each just over 30 minutes long. An emollient score by Gavin Bryars for a chamber ensemble, making amiable wall-papery patterns. Elaborate design by Duncan MacAskill. And it is all too much. Focus, precision, even purpose, seem clogged by the rich trappings of collaboration. Booth has, in the past, shown us the beauty of austerity: he is better with a begging bowl than a bank account. What I saw in the first part was dance well done (Booth produced tremendous spirals of energy) but fatally bland. There was a whiff of the orient about it all - T'ai Chi; martial arts, Indian dance - yet it looked more Brummagem than Benares, as if the cast were auditioning for a revival of The King and I. The second, and better, section found the dancers clambering on a vast metal web which was wired for sound so that each move produced a tingling resonance (very welcome to ears sated with Bryars' maunderings). The web flew up, Bryars and his ensemble (dressed, oddly, as druids) were revealed, and for a time Booth's skill gave the dance a bright immediacy. But at curtain fall - too long delayed - I felt somehow cheated. Booth can be more powerful, more illuminating than this.</p>

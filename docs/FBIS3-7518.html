			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- The stock market turned  in a bleak performance in a week influenced by strained  inter-Korean relations and rumors of financial difficulties  among listed firms.    The leading composite stock price index slid 21.31 points in  the week ending Saturday, March 26, from 893.99 the previous  Saturday to 872.68.    Early in the week, share prices took a downturn due to the  buildup of tension over the North Korean nuclear question and an  anticipated financial pinch toward the end of the month.    Late in the week prices rebounded, fueled by rising small-  and medium-sized issues and rumors of additional market  deregulation.    But the rise was short-lived with prices again falling amid  rumors that some listed firms were beset with financial problems  and heavy selling by institutional investors.    Nearly all issues other than fisheries, prefabricated metal  and miscellaneous manufacturing declined. The slide in the  insurance, inland transportation and lumber sectors was  especially steep.    Volume in the week was 180.52 million shares, a drop of 19.9  percent from the previous week when it stood at 216.40 million  shares. The daily average was 30.08 million.    Turnover amounted to 3,091 billion won or 515.2 billion won  a  day compared with 4,232.6 billion won (705.4 billion won a day)  the previous week.    During the week, institutional investors bought more than  they sold while foreign investors did far more selling than  buying.    Institutional investors' selling amounted to 719.4 billion  won or 21.7 percent of the total while their buying came to  794.7 billion won (23.9 percent).    Selling by foreign investors reached 146.4 billion won and  they bought shares worth 42.2 billion won, representing 4.4 and  1.3 percent of the total, respectively. In the previous week,  foreigners sold shares worth 64.0 billion won and purchased 49.8  billion won worth.    Stock players' deposits declined 48.9 billion won in the  week  ending March 24 from 3,320.9 billion won on March 17 to 3,271.9  billion won.    Market analysts said that favorable future factors for the  Korean bourse include the economy's reported entry into a full  recovery course, President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China and  permission for listed firms to purchase their own shares  beginning next month.    On the other hand, adverse factors include strained  inter-Korean relations over the nuclear question, growing demand  for funds by companies toward the end of the month, predominant  selling by foreign investors and an anticipated deterioration of  market demand and supply conditions, the analysts said.</p>

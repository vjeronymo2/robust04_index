At that  time, the State Foreign Exchange Administration will publish  average foreign exchange prices based on the banks' transaction  prices; that is, a floating exchange rate system with controls  worthy of the name will begin, an authoritative figure disclosed.    According to this figure, at present, the Shanghai Foreign  Exchange Transaction Center is making basic preparations for  work in this area; and related state departments will make the  final examination and decision and give approval. The  designated banks would be members [as published] and have the  right to conduct foreign exchange transaction operations. Some  foreign-funded banks might also become members and carry out  such operations should their applications be approved. In  addition, they might entrust members to carry out operations in  this area.    Since 1 January this year, the dual-track foreign exchange  prices have been merged; generally speaking, however, no  floating rates have been seen in the mainland foreign exchange  market as of today. The explanation by this authoritative figure  on this point was: The merger is still at the initial stage,  and in a transition period at that; hence the plan has not been  implemented to the full. The State Foreign Exchange  Administration continues to use the right to fix the average  prices based on the foreign exchange quotations provided by the  18 foreign exchange regulation centers across China, that is,  the previous foreign exchange transaction order is being  maintained. After 1 April, the designated banks will start  foreign exchange transaction operations, and then a floating  exchange rate system with controls worthy of the name will have  been founded; at that time, some minute fluctuations in foreign  exchange quotations might surface. The authoritative figure  especially emphasized that no major fluctuations would arise.    The authoritative figure said that with banks starting to  conduct foreign exchange transaction operations, the existing  foreign exchange regulation centers across China would face two  sorts of conversion: First, the dozen or so major local foreign  exchange centers would become branches of the national foreign  exchange transaction center; and second, some of the foreign  exchange regulation centers would be converted to economic  companies, that is economic companies in the main providing  foreign exchange information.</p>

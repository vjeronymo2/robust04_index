			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEVER TOO LATE TO KEEP IN SHAPE;  </P> <P> AT 73, FOOTBALL HAS PASSED HIM BY . . . BUT NOT FITNESS  </P> <P> Question: At the age of 73, I have given up all hope of becoming a professional  football player. But my son keeps after me to do some walking every day because  he says it will make me feel better. At my age, I feel better doing as little  as possible. Do you see any good that walking would do for someone my age?  </P> <P> Answer: Exercise should be a part of the routine of all people, regardless of  age, although the type of exercise obviously has to be tailored to the  individual's particular needs. From what you write in your letter, your son is  suggesting that you do some walking, not that you become a professional  football player; there is a difference between the two.  </P> <P> Walking can help an older person maintain muscle strength and agility. Not only  can this have a beneficial effect on the person's overall well-being and  quality of life, the physical benefits include a reduction in the risk of  accidental falls, a serious occurrence in the elderly.  </P> <P> Q: I go to a track in a high school in my neighborhood for some walking  exercise a few times a week, and I meet a lot of other walkers and some runners  there. Some of the runners check their pulse while they exercise, and I would  like to know why they do this and what it is that they are looking for.  </P> <P> A: The pulse rate indicates how hard your cardiovascular system is working.  Many people who engage in aerobic exercise check their pulse by obtaining the  rate for 10 seconds and multiplying that figure by six to get the rate per  minute. A healthy 20-year-old, for example, should have a pulse rate after 10  minutes of exercise in the range of 138 to 174.  </P> <P> Q: Professional athletes go where it's warm to get into shape, but very few of  us who work for a living can do the same. I jog during the year and I also like  to keep in shape during the winter months, but I don't know if jogging in cold  weather is a good idea. Can't it hurt the lungs if you breathe cold air?  </P> <P> A: Breathing cold air is not harmful to the lungs because the body warms the  air as you breathe it. If the cold air bothers you, however, you might try  wearing a scarf over your nose and mouth; you may find that this added  protection makes breathing somewhat easier.  </P> <P> If you decide against running outside in the cold weather, there are a number  of alternatives. An indoor track is one possibility, and a brisk walk, which  can even be taken in a shopping center, can be beneficial. A stationary bicycle  and a rowing machine are other possibilities.  </P> <P> Q: I hear more and more about the immune system, especially concerning AIDS.  Would you please explain just what the immune system is or what it does?  </P> <P> A: The immune system protects the individual from infection and takes part in  the regulation of normal processes within the body.  </P> <P> As you might expect, it is a complicated network. It consists of organs,  tissues, cells and regulatory substances that circulate in the blood.  </P> <P> In some diseases, there are changes in the cells. These changes seem to  contribute to the disease.  </P> <P> An immune response can protect a person from infection. In chicken pox, for  example, the immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies that will react  against the virus. Subsequently, on exposure to the virus, the antibodies will  help destroy it. This is the reason it is a rare event when someone gets  chicken pox more than once.  </P> <P> The same sequence of events would occur naturally with a disease such as polio;  however, polio is too dangerous to leave to nature. Therefore, people are given  polio vaccine, which stimulates the immune system without subjecting the  individual to the risk of the disease.  </P> <P> Q: I know someone who was told by her doctor that she had fibrocystic disease  but that it is not cancer. If it is not cancer, can you please tell me what it  is?  </P> <P> A: Fibrocystic disease refers to a variety of benign conditions of the breast.  It is manifested by a feeling of lumpiness or by breasts that are irregular to  the touch. As you note in your letter, fibrocystic disease is not a cancerous  condition, nor does the fact that a woman has fibrocystic disease mean that she  is going to get cancer.  </P> <P> The condition is very common and has been estimated to occur in as many as 80%  of women. In fact, some physicians believe that almost all women over 30 years  of age have some fibrocystic breast tissue.  </P></p>

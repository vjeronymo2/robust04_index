			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / People: Railtrack Christopher Jonas, who stepped down as president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last month, is to lend his property expertise to Railtrack, the new organisation which will soon be responsible for Britain's 10,000-mile railway network. Jonas, 51-year-old senior partner of Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors, is one of the first outsiders to be appointed to the board of Railtrack which is being set up under the chairmanship of ex-BP boss Bob Horton. The new organisation, which will take control of British Rail's track and signalling network, does not come into being until the rail privatisation bill gets royal assent next April. Jonas has therefore been appointed a part-time non-executive member of the British Rail board and the intention is that he will transfer to the Railtrack board on April 1. Jonas began his career with Jones Lang Wootton and became a partner of Drivers Jonas in 1967. Twenty years later he took over as senior partner. A member of the Port of London Authority and the British Rail Property Board, Jonas has been a property adviser to organisations ranging from the British Airports Authority to the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Duchy of Cornwall. Meanwhile, former Rowntree chairman Kenneth Dixon, 63, has been reappointed as a part-time BR board member for two years.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIDE OR PREJUDICE?;  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK DEBATES MAYOR'S PLAN TO ERECT WASHINGTON STATUE  </P> <P> To social studies teacher and Monterey Park Mayor Barry L. Hatch, George  Washington represents everything that's great about America.  </P> <P> So Hatch, mayor of the heavily immigrant community, persuaded his City Council  to approve spending $50,000 on a statue of the first President, adorned with  plaques of the U.S. Constitution.  </P> <P> Many of the Asian and Latino newcomers to Monterey Park, he said, have no  feeling for America's traditions or its hard-earned freedoms. The statue will  serve as a reminder, Hatch said, to immigrants and longtime citizens alike.  </P> <P> But not everyone in this San Gabriel Valley community has welcomed this latest  proposal by Hatch, whose earlier stances in favor of a temporary ban on  immigration and the establishment of English as the official U.S. language have  gained him notoriety.  </P> <P> For one thing, Hatch wants the Washington statue to displace an existing City  Hall sculpture that commemorates the 1984 Olympic Games, an event that promotes  international brotherhood as well as athletic achievement.  </P> <P> Said Councilman Christopher F. Houseman, "It would be unfortunate" if erecting  the Washington statue was a reaction to "something washing up on our shore . .  . so we have to put up this monument and make some statement."  </P> <P> Hatch, a teacher at Bell Gardens Intermediate School, said he simply wants to  boost pride in America.  </P> <P> "I feel like a coach in a locker room at half-time. We have to do something to  win. This country is in more trouble than any time, other than the Civil War."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Real Motive'  </P> <P> But E. George Ricci, a former Chamber of Commerce president, asked: "Why George  Washington? And $50,000! How about Christopher Columbus, for heaven's sake? I  wonder what's the real motive."  </P> <P> If the statue's purpose is to educate new immigrants, asked Councilwoman Judy  Chu, "then why don't we use the $50,000 to set up citizenship classes?"  </P> <P> Beyond the immigration issue, Councilwoman Betty Couch said, is the more  pressing question of whether a city struggling to balance its books can afford  the luxury of spending $50,000 on a statue. And, she added, "I don't have any  lack of respect for my country."  </P> <P> Under Hatch's plan, a statue of Washington will replace a 15-foot-high  sculpture of the Olympic torch and the five interlocking rings. Dedicated in  ceremonies attended by about 4,000 spectators, the Olympic sculpture marks the  path where a torch-bearing runner passed City Hall in 1984 en route to the Los  Angeles Coliseum. Monterey Park hosted the Olympic field hockey competition and  since then has billed itself as "An Olympic City With a Heart."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Standards and Values'  </P> <P> "We're fighting to keep the city an American city," Hatch said, "not by face or  by race, but by standards and values." When Hatch speaks of America, he also  speaks of his town, a microcosm, he said, of the nation's immigration problems.  </P> <P> Since 1985, when Hatch was first active in campaigns to declare English as the  nation's official language, he has been a key participant in the city's  continuing debate over immigration. Elected in 1986 as part of a slow-growth  ticket, Hatch nearly lost his council post two years ago during a bitterly  contested recall attempt.  </P> <P> Last fall, when he took his seat as mayor -- a position that rotates among  council members -- Hatch proposed a temporary ban on U.S. immigration to ease  the burden that population growth puts on schools, freeways, hospitals, prisons  and the welfare system.  </P> <P> Citing the ethnic diversity of Monterey Park, with Asians accounting for more  than half its 63,500 residents and Latinos another third, Hatch said: "These  people need to understand why we are a unique nation. They need to gain the  same pride in this nation that we have."  </P> <P> The City Council on a 3-2 vote earlier this month did approve the statue, but  no decision has been made on whether to follow through with plans to have the  Washington statue created by Culver City's nationally known sculptor  Brett-Livingston Strong, who once carved a Malibu boulder into John Wayne's  image.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Olympic Sculpture  </P> <P> And the council has yet to decide on whether to relocate the Olympic sculpture;  the mayor is the only member who supports moving it. He believes that the  Olympic sculpture is unattractive and should be moved across town to Garvey  Ranch Park.  </P> <P> Said Couch, "We're only going to make enemies if we take that (Olympic  sculpture) out and act like it is unimportant."  </P> <P> And Lily Lee Chen, a former council member who as mayor in 1984 spoke at the  dedication ceremonies, said the Olympic sculpture symbolizes "one of the most  positive reminders" of an international event in the city. "The thought of  having the sculpture removed is something I cannot even comprehend."  </P> <P> Regardless of where the Washington monument goes, Hatch said this is one of his  most important causes since he was elected three years ago.  </P> <P> "I can think of no logical argument against it," he said.  </P></p>

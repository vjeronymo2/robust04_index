			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Arpad Goncz, president of the Hungarian  Republic, announced at a news briefing this morning the date of  the first round of general elections:    [Begin Goncz recording] In accordance with my powers  enshrined in Article D of Passage 1 of Paragraph 30-A of the  Constitution, I declare that parliamentary elections will be  held on Sunday, 8 May 1994. [passage omitted]    I would like to give the points of view that I considered  when making this decision. First, the main requirement is that  the elections should take place as soon as possible in order to  have a stable administration as soon as possible--before the  summer season, if possible--and that the second round could be  held before the start of the spring work. The date of the  second round will not be determined by me but by an election  committee formed by the parliament. [passage omitted]    Second, my consideration was also that it should be as cheap  as possible. A holiday day would have had to be declared if the  election were to be held on a weekday. [passage omitted]    This would have made the elections incredibly more  expensive.  [passage omitted]    My third consideration was that as many as possible should  vote. All parties have an interest in as many voters turning out  as possible. My impression is that a large percent of the  voters will participate in the ballot. In my view, the people  of this country are clear in their mind that they have a stake  in the elections. [passage omitted]    Regarding my being above party politics, I can only say that  this date does not agree--as far as I know--with the wish of any  party. So, if you like, take this as a sign of my being above  party politics. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] Damascus -- On the basis of a proposal by the  Russian Embassy in Damascus, a secret meeting was held on 25 May  in the Syrian capital between a high-ranking Russian delegation  and representatives of the alliance of the 10 factions opposed  to the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel.    The following is a summarized text of the minutes of this  meeting with a prologue drafted by the participants, without any  additions or deletions:    On the basis of arrangements by the Russian Embassy in  Damascus, a meeting was held with Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian  president's envoy and head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's  Middle East Department, in the presence of Zutov, the Russian  ambassador in Damascus, and Charge d'Affaires Bogdanov. On the  Palestinian side the meeting was attended by brothers and  comrades Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy  secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine; Talal Naji, deputy secretary general of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command; Khalid  al-Fahum, leader of the Salvation Front; and Sami Qandil, member  of al-Sa'iqah command.    At the beginning of the meeting, the Russian side stressed  the friendly and comradely relations with the Palestinians. It  lauded the role of national factions as forces who bear the  responsibility of representing the Palestinian people. It also  affirmed the Russian stance toward the present Palestinian  situation and summed it up in the following points:    -- We believe that there are shortcomings in the Cairo  agreement, but it is an important step in the right direction.    -- The PLO is an incomparable political vanguard which is  representing the Palestinian people appropriately.    -- We are conveying our ideas to you as friends. Hence, we  believe the following: Your disagreement with the PLO  leadership will continue, but we hope that this disagreement  will not turn into a conflict in which violence and force is  used. An example of this is Yemen and what is happening there.  All disagreements do not justify infighting.    -- The withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho  and  the entry of Palestinian policemen is a significant achievement.  The attainment of the bulk of your rights will depend on the  degree of Palestinian cohesion.    -- If all factions help President 'Arafat manage affairs  smoothly and if you cooperate together, the scope of those  rights will increase and vice versa.    -- We are convinced that Gaza-Jericho is the starting point  and that more important ones will follow.    -- We received 'Arafat as president and acted in the same  way  toward Rabin in order to maintain the equilibrium.    The response of the Palestinian factions' representatives  was  as follows:    Hawatimah explained the situation with regard to the  settlement track and pointed to 'Arafat's persistence in acting  rashly, destroying the national alliance, striking at the  national program, and excluding the institutions. He said: We  were the first to initiate a national political strategy in  support of international legitimacy. No one has remained with  'Arafat except his party. Even those who participated in Madrid  deserted him in Oslo and Cairo.    Abu-'Ali Mustafa said: We hope that you will not get the  impression that opposition comes only from Damascus. It is a  comprehensive popular state. 'Arafat and his team have chosen a  path that will lead neither to rights, nor to peace, nor to  security. They must bear responsibility for the disaster of the  Palestinian cause. We will not deal with 'Arafat because not  only has he deviated from the national program, but he has  betrayed it. We are opposed to any rapprochement with him. As  for the policemen, we have no police force or authority. All  this is in the hands of 'Arafat and his team. You should tell  him what you are telling us now. 'Arafat is currently facing  three difficult political, economic, and security tests.    Al-Fahum said: Those who signed the agreement are facing a  crisis and the opposition is facing a crisis also. Despite  this, opposition to the agreement is greater. There is  dissatisfaction with the agreement. Do not demand from the  opposition something for which it is not responsible. Rather,  demand that 'Arafat stop making concessions. We hope that you  will play a more active role in the Middle East.    Talal Naji said: You have no role in the settlement.  Everything that happens in the region emanates from the United  States and Israel. You only promote that. I do not know why.  You believe 'Arafat's lies about the opposition while he is  preparing himself to play the role of the Palestinian Antoine  Lahd. We will agree if you apply international legitimacy to  the Palestinian problem, but you will do no such thing. Tell  'Arafat and his group to stop threatening and heralding a new  stage of suppression. Our people accept neither bargaining nor  what the Oslo team has done.    Before the meeting ended, talk reverted to the head of the  Russian delegation's remarks about the need to act under  'Arafat's umbrella. Then Zutov, the Russian ambassador, hoped  that the meetings would continue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief" rubric: "President </F> Surrenders Positions?"]    [Text] As is supposed, Anatoliy Chubays' fate will be  decided in the next few days. Rather conducive to this also is  the premier's vacations that he took to save face, and the  temporary premiership of Oleg Soskovets, who has never been seen  as being fond of Mr. Chubays, while being closely tied to Mr.  Luzhkov. The latter's victory must among other things mean the  end of privatization a la Chubays. One should not, however,  forget that this privatization was publicly approved by Boris  Yeltsin at one time. Thus, Luzhkov's victory over Chubays is  first and foremost a blow at the president and a demonstration  of the Moscow mayor's absolute power.    A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent heard all of the above  from a reliable source in the president's staff whose members  have been of late shedding their loyalty to their present boss  and pondering on who is going to be their next master. In their  opinion, the greatest chances belong to the one who is now  governing Russia's capital in a tough way.</p>

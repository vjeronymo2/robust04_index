Rogozhin said his committee's leadership knew of the  accident  at the 4th reactor of the Zaporozhskaya nuclear power station in  Ukraine on January 12 only five days later from a fax from the  European Nuclear Society HQ in Switzerland to Moscow.    Rogozhin said Russia received information on the accident on  the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania only from the  press.    He pointed out that failures to provide the necessary  information to the Russian Goskomatomnadzor by former Soviet  republics run counter to the official agreement between the  nuclear supervision organizations which was reached shortly  after the break-up of the Soviet Union.    According to Rogozhin, the Ignalina nuclear power station  was  equipped with reactors of type RBMK-1500, which are identical to  those that were installed in Chernobyl. With the lack of  information, it is difficult to speak of the maintenance of  nuclear safety.    Rogozhin pointed to the fact that reactors functioning now  in  former Soviet republics are made in Russia, and Moscow must be  fully informed of even the most insignificant accidents.</p>

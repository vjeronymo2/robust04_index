			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Berlin to launch pay strikes A FIRST wave of official warning strikes among public sector employees is expected to hit Germany today following a call for action yesterday from the leadership of the DAG white-collar workers' union, writes Christopher Parkes. Angered by last week's 3.5 per cent pay offer in the face of its 10.5 per cent claim, the union said government, state and local authorities had inflamed the situation and had 'obviously adopted a strategy of conflict'. Protest stoppages, due to start in Berlin this morning, are expected to spread across the country between now and the next round of negotiations, due on March 19. Rail passengers in the Cologne area were given their first taste of trouble to come yesterday when, according to the local rail authorities, 'a handful' of level crossing and signal box workers delayed nine trains for up to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the government, which is determined to rein in pay increases in all sectors, sent further signals that it is not willing to sacrifice economic and monetary stability to unreasonable pay claims. Chancellor Helmut Kohl told regional party leaders of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) that German stability was important both at home and abroad. 'If we go down on our knees then the (economic) improvements in the new federal states will be further slowed,' he said in Bonn. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said pay awards must be related to the current economic conditions. The minister, who has been widely attacked for his insistence that increases must be held below 5 per cent, said that if demands were not restrained the west German economy faced more than 'short-term disruption'. OTV, the largest of the two main public service unions which together represent some 2.3m workers, said at the weekend that unless the employers improved their offer at the next round of talks the negotiations would be formally ended and a strike ballot called. Its leaders are also expected to call warning strikes within the next few days, adding weight to the DAG initiative.</p>

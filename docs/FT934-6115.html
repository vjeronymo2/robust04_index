			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Economists decline to join chorus on prices The jury is still out on whether excessively high margins are becoming firmly established or posing a threat to the UK economy. Export price inflation peaked in March at about 13 per cent and prices have since fallen slightly. Similar trends are visible in the UK retail sector. Many economists view the jump in margins as a normal and necessary part of the post-recession business cycle and say industry is now right to rebuild its profitability. Mr Walter Eltis, the chief economic adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, recently said that British industry still had to increase its profitability to the level of its most successful rivals abroad. While profitability in the UK chemical industry stands comparison with international competitors, this is not the case in textiles or parts of engineering. Mr Peter Warburton, chief UK economist with Robert Fleming Securities, has calculated that about a third of UK companies recorded a pre-tax loss last year. Only a small minority of UK companies have strong profits and these are generally large. 'We can expect to see profitability going through the roof for a year or so. But that will be fully justified,' he said. Mr Leo Doyle, a UK economist with Kleinwort Benson Securities, believes Britain could follow the experience in the US, where companies raised margins significantly in the early phase of the recovery before increasing employment and investment. The Confederation of British Industry and other business lobbies cite statistics of their own to prove that industry's prices are not fuelling inflationary pressures. In the autumn the CBI's monthly industrial trends surveys showed a small majority of manufacturers expecting to reduce prices in the months ahead. Yesterday's CBI poll, however, showed that on balance 5 per cent more companies expect to raise prices rather than cut them in the next four months. But the picture was mixed, with plans to raise prices concentrated among big companies. The capital goods industry in general and the electrical and instrument engineering sector in particular expect prices to fall. Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's head of forecasting, said that output prices had been rising by about 3 per cent a year rather than the 4 per cent shown in official statistics, which did not take discounting into effect. Nor is the CBI perturbed by a recent steady rise in 'underlying' output prices. These, according to Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI director of economics, tend to lag the full output price figures by two or three months. Both the Bank governor and the chancellor appear to have been firing shots across the bows of businesses to ensure that they do not become addicted to high margins. Significantly, however, Mr George coupled his misgivings with a veiled threat that the Bank would raise interest rates if companies boosted prices and margins over a period of time.  ----------------------------------------------------------------        MARGINS ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN HALF OF MANUFACTURERS'                    OUTPUT-PRICE INFLATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------                  1992   1992   1992   1993   1993   1993   1993                  Year     Q3     Q4     Q1     Q2    Jly    Aug  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Output prices    2.3     2.3    2.2    2.3    2.3    2.4    2.6 Margins          1.2     2.0    1.3    1.4    2.0    1.3    1.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Output price figures show percentage change on previous year.

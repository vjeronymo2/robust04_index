			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada accuses EC over lumber ban THE EUROPEAN Community has banned imports of most kinds of untreated softwood lumber from Canada to protect European forests from a microscopic but voracious pest known as the pinewood nematode. The ban, which was formally notified to EC members last Friday and takes effect on Aug 15, has blown up into the most bitter current trade dispute between Canada and the EC. While EC officials regard the new rules as a plant-health precaution, Canada sees them as a trade barrier. The Canadians accuse the EC of over-reacting to the nematode threat, thereby endangering the livelihood of many sawmill workers in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and British Columbia. The Canadian high commission in London has already made several direct representations to UK prime minister Mr John Major, asking for the ban to be relaxed. The ban affects the bulk of Canada's CDollars 500m-a-year (Pounds 265m) exports of untreated lumber to EC states, of which CDollars 350m is shipped to the UK. Under the new rules, all Canadian lumber exports to Europe, with the exception of cedar, must be either kiln-dried or heat-treated. EC member states agreed earlier this year to allow an exemption for non-pine species until October 1. But the commission's plant-health committee revoked the exemption late last month after UK authorities discovered the wood-boring insects that carry the nematode in two shipments of lumber from Canada. The nematode has devastated large tracts of pine forest in Japan, and Canada has acknowledged that pine exports should be heat-treated or dried. But Ottawa disputes scientific evidence supporting the EC's case for treating other species, such as hemlock, spruce and fir. The EC is unwilling to take the risk of relaxing the ban, but has offered to co-operate in further scientific studies. The Canadians are concerned that the ban will put their timber at a competitive disadvantage to Scandinavian supplies. Canadian mills will be forced to spend substantial amounts to install kilns or heat-treating facilities. The Canadian argument has an ironic twist, in that resource industries have for years been urged to put more emphasis on adding value to commodity exports. But by heating or drying their lumber, the Canadian mills face being excluded from the large market for cheap, untreated lumber used, for instance, for cement moulds on construction sites.</p>

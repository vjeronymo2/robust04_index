			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (13): Consumers must pay more - Water resources Improving the management of its water resources is one of the key challenges that Moroccan planners face over the next decade. Morocco, where per capita renewable water resources are estimated at 833 cubic metres, is currently, in the jargon of specialists, 'water stressed'. By the year 2020 per capita water resources are expected to be halved to 411 cubic metres. The country would then qualify as 'chronically water stressed'. Drinking water reaches only 14 per cent of the rural population, while resources in a number of important water basins are being exhausted as the infrastructure deteriorates. But much has been achieved, in contrast to neighbouring Algeria. Perched on the north-west tip of Africa, Morocco is subject to diverse climatic conditions. The port around Tangier and in the Rif mountain range is very Mediterranean, the south is quite Saharan and the western coastal plains are subject to Atlantic influences. Average annual precipitation levels vary from 750mm in the north to below 100mm in the south. Total rainfall averages 150bn cubic metres a year, 30bn of which replenish surface and ground water flows, the rest being lost in evaporation. Uneven geographical distribution of resources is compounded by uneven and erratic rainfalls. Morocco is susceptible to long periods of drought. Half of Morocco's 26m people live on the land, and agriculture provides the livelihood to 40 per cent of the economically active population, contributing around 17 per cent of gross domestic product. Excellent rainfall last winter explains the 11 per cent expected growth in GDP this year; drought more often than not results in a decline in GDP. Barely 14 per cent of countryfolk have access to safe and reliable supplies of water, for which they pay up to 10 times as much as in town. Contamination of water resources accounts for half of all illnesses in such areas. Agriculture is by far the largest user of water, accounting for 85 per cent of mobilised resources, a figure which is projected to decline to 77 per cent by the year 2020. Drinking and industrial needs account for the balance. The greatest challenge facing the authorities is that of the supply and demand balances. Shortages are already evident in a number of river basins. Moroccan water resources are unevenly distributed between basins. Almost 50 per cent of total resources and 93 per cent of current regional surpluses are concentrated in the Sebou and Oum Er Rabia basins. The Casablanca and Rabat-Sale metropolitan areas, which account for 25 per cent of all residential and industrial water demand today, already supplement scarce local resources with water imported from the Oum Er Rabia basin. Reallocating water resources from irrigation to higher value urban and industrial customers without unnecessary hardship to deprived rural communities is a major issue. Such transfers are inevitable but they need not penalise farming if the efficiency of water use in agriculture is increased. To give but one example, a 20 per cent reduction in water requirements in the Doukkala irrigation perimeter would postpone the need for alternative resources for the Casablanca region until 2050. The creation of tradeable water rights in these circumstances may provide a solution but it leads to some interesting questions. Could Casablanca contribute to improving efficiency in the Doukkala perimeter in order to be guaranteed secure water supplies at a cost below such expensive alternatives as desalination? Another aspect of the challenge is that, faced with higher water charges, farmers may be expected to substitute higher value and less water-intensive crops. However the market opportunities for these crops may be limited, thus raising doubts as to their viability in some irrigated areas. A deterioration in the quality of water constitutes another challenge. Water pollution from domestic, industrial and agricultural sources is approaching critical levels in the two most important river basins. Drinking water supplies have been suspended several times in the Sebou basin and quality problems have occurred in Oum Er Rabia. The constraints on government spending argue in favour of shifting the costs burden more rapidly towards customers. Until recently, the state budgets financed virtually all water investment. Senior Moroccans accept this is no longer possible. Urban tariffs today cover operational and maintenance charges for water supplies and sewage, as well as the financial charges associated with the treatment, pumping and distribution of water. But they take no account of marginal costs, most notably the construction of dams. An even greater imbalance lies in the difference between water tariffs in towns and irrigation, the latter representing one fifth of the former. The deterioration of the infrastructure is yet another problem and the return from existing investment could be significantly raised by improved maintenance. The silting up of dams is a major concern, having already diminished available capacity by as much as one quarter. Conveyance losses in irrigation canals are believed to be as high as 25 per cent. Giving greater weight to efficiency and pricing criteria can thus be expected to yield considerable benefits. Government spending on mobilising and distributing water is projected to rise by 350 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade. Some specialists question whether too many resources are being devoted to the expansion of large-scale irrigation. Some 80 per cent of the Dollars 4.8bn National Irrigation Plan budget up to the end of the century is earmarked for such expansion and a further Dollars 1bn to rehabilitating existing irrigation systems. World Bank experts who have been actively involved in financing the development of Morocco's water resources believe that it remains to be demonstrated that the proposed expansion of irrigated areas will prove competitive in terms of economic, social and environmental returns on investment. They believe the balance of investment should be shifted in favour of rehabilitating existing investments.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: Macho harassment, not management - Television After watching Exposure, Monday night's film in C4's Cutting Edge series, a lot of middle managers must be nervously wondering what might be coming their way. The fashion for executives being sent on survival courses has been around a good while now, but Monday's film showed us the fearsome reality. Cameras followed 24 managers aged 29 to 51 from Rockwater, an international underwater engineering company, as they underwent six days of purgatory devised by the grandfather of management survival courses in the UK, the notorious John Ridgeway. Notorious yet also risible, from the first glimpse of Ridgeway on a grassy knoll in the Scottish Highlands, the autumn wind whipping at his baggy shorts as he fervently declaimed Newbolt's lines 'Play up] play up] and play the game]' But if any of the Rockwater crew felt inclined to titter, they were soon laughing on the other side of their faces. After being ordered to leave most of their gear behind, the teams of six with their hatchet-faced instructors slogged away through the rain. Hours later they had to strip and swim to an island where, blindfolded, they erected tents big enough only for five. One of the tents blew over in the night. Next morning, the weather forecast was terrible, which pleased Ridgeway; bad weather promotes bonding. In a 90 mile-an-hour gale the teams were told to climb a 2,500ft peak. The chap from PR collapsed half-way up and had to be hauled to the top. He was in a funk for the rest of the week . . . Rockwater had asked for an extra-tough course, for which it paid Pounds 25,000, and no physical or mental frailty was tolerated. So you suffer from acute vertigo? You will climb a 70-foot mast] You can't swim? You will dive under the yacht] To refuse means your team loses points, and that is very wrong, and in the evening everyone will sit round in informal counselling sessions and discuss why you are such an uncooperative, non-bonding, wimp. Pain, anger, humiliation and naked fear made for excellent TV. On the last afternoon, a somewhat staged-looking 'mutiny', when the managers refused to plunge yet again into the icy sea on the grounds that it was 'totally stupid', was taken as proof that the course had indeed forged excellent team-spirit. This seemed a curious conclusion. Would the same view have been taken had the managers mutinied on the first afternoon when faced with an equally stupid exercise? The fundamental question was whether a company has the right to ask employees to submit to 'an exercise in sadism', as it was described by one of the victims, a Dutchman. My heart warmed to him. Throughout the week the staunch libertarian voiced his objections to this kind of bullying, just as his stout-hearted ancestors once resisted the tyranny of Louis XIV. So what made him, or any of them, agree to take part? The chain-smoker, the American woman with a grass allergy, none of them looked the type to have commando-style fantasies. Why should someone who performs a cerebral desk-job submit to a punishing physical and mental ordeal merely because his or her superiors (male, I bet) share a mystical belief that such an experience is especially valuable in fostering team spirit? Although the doubting Dutchman's colleagues claimed he did indeed become better to work with, that might have been no less true had they been playing croquet at Cannes all week. We generally like others to suffer as we have done, so the fact that three-quarters of the Rockwater victims said they wanted their staff to do the course only proves why fagging survived for so long in English public schools. Ridgeway and his like may yet flourish in the so-called 'caring 'nineties'. Yet the thought persists that there is a host of attributes which it might be advantageous for a company to nurture in its best people; imagination, cunning, humour, patience, self-reliance, independence of thought . . . Might it not be equally valid to send managers on courses to learn to play the Welsh harp, or chess, or work with Mother Teresa? Sexual harassment may have been outlawed in the workplace, yet it looks as if macho harassment is still OK. The last part of the three-part Assignment Special, Europe on the Brink (BBC 2, Tuesday) was a futuristic account of a European super-state two decades hence, at war with the North American super-state (inter alia) over oil-exploration in the Arctic. What was a neat enough idea perhaps inevitably turned out to be a dull and rather silly exercise easily confused with Yes Minister. Thanks to her manner, which is grave and sincere, Francine Stock is an above average current affairs presenter. Unfortunately, this series suffered terribly from producer's fidgets. An examination of the deep political and economic structure of Europe, it was hardly going to offer much to gnat-brains, who would anyway have been glued to EastEnders. And yet, the view seemed to be that the gnat-brains would be there in force. Each distinguished talking head was duly given a sound-bite of around 40 seconds, often less. Flit, Michael Howard warning of the rise of anti-Islamic racism in Europe. Flit, Karl Otto Pohl on his fears of the east-west gap. Minutes later and back we would flit for another weighty sentence or two. Even worse were the musical fidgets. To accompany a steelworks, a blast of Tannhauser. A second or two of plain-chant for Jacques Delors meeting EC commissioners at the Cistercian abbey of Royaumont. A few bars of Vivaldi for Venice and the bon gusto of Benetton - part two must have sampled around 20 different composers, which was pretentious and thoroughly silly. It is nice that classical music is back in vogue, but a good deal less nice if the result is this kind of wild overdosing. ***** For bad music, one needed to have watched Gallowglass (BBC 1), Ruth Rendell's alias Barbara Vine's thriller which ended ghoulishly on Sunday with Nina's manicured hand sticking up from the forest's ferny floor. First rule of a so-called psychological thriller has to be, find some damn' fine actors. At the centre of this drama was an epicene upper middle-class youth who had a truly fin de siecle obsession with a classy blonde model. She, rather improbably, he had helped to kidnap while studying art-history or the like in Italy, and then set free after a brief bout of terrific sex. This Italian plot needed to be established by endless flashbacks, a convention rarely satisfactory on film, and Gallowglass proved no exception. Paul Rhys, who played the kidnapping fantasist, was decorative but never credible whereas Joe, his nerd-like accomplice, was a much better role played with some subtlety by Michael Sheen. Everyone and everything else was so-so, and no better. On Wednesday, some twenty million people bade farewell to Central TV's Inspector Morse. By now, little more needs to be said about Morse, except to mourn his passing. However, since he was not mown down by one of Oxford's 9,000 deregulated buses, nor decapitated by any of the city's 19,000 ridiculous hanging baskets, at least he is available to return to our screens. A few Turcophiles will have preferred to see what Bookmark (BBC 2) made of Yashar Kemal. The answer was, as the Turks say, hich, nothing. Kemal is a wonderful, extremely enjoyable novelist, and it is baffling he was not given the Nobel prize decades ago. But no one could have divined as much from interminable scenes from an unnamed novel, woodenly acted by a cast of gloomy Anatolian villagers who looked as if they would far rather have been watching TV than making it.</p>

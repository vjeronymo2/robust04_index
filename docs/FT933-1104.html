			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Market regime may be possible, but not necessarily preferable Sir, A single market, let alone a common market or a free trade area, can indeed, as Sir Alan Walters claimed (Letters, September 22), get by without the stable ('pegged') exchange rates, let alone the single currency, he so abhors. But is the one, given convergence on a stability-oriented regime, better off without than with the other? Would the existing US single market, for example, benefit from each of the US federal states sporting a separate currency of its own, and multiple (internal as well as external) exchange rates, in place of the single ('almighty') dollar? Possible, of course, 'like a dog's walking on his hinder legs'. But preferable? Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley, London N3 3AN</p>

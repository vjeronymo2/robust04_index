Syedin, doctor of psychological sciences and  professor: "A Conceptual Breakdown or Defamation the Past (On  the Development and Problems of Russian Military Science)"]    [Text] Major changes in the world also largely affect  military affairs, including problems of military history and  practice.    Above all, I want to express concern over the decrease in  interest of leaders of the Armed Forces and many officers in  methodological problems of military science. Something is also  being developed now. Fresh ideas are also being born. But a not  entirely good tendency of isolating scientific thought from  practical activities is emerging.    This also happened in the past, when much was determined a  priori by political guidelines and the demand for new knowledge  and ideas was rejected. However, today, unfortunately, this no  longer involves only big leaders. At a recent conference of  historians, we did not see even representatives of the editorial  staff of the Military Encyclopedia, who more than others should  be interested in a professional discussion of their problems.  Such an arrogant self-isolation will in time make itself felt by  a decrease in the quality of their labor and can be reflected in  the accomplishment of tasks facing the Armed Forces of Russia.    A conclusion suggests itself. It is necessary, in my view,  to  attract more decisively the attention of the public and leading  military personnel to this problem; constantly and on a high  professional level show what specifically is being overlooked  now due to underestimation of new ideas; and more thoroughly  develop new scientific ideas and submit them for discussion by  experts and the public.    A second problem that bothers me concerns sciences studying  defense problems and war as a whole. Seemingly, scientific  thought has convincingly proven that military science alone  cannot study war as a complex socio-political phenomenon. By  studying armed struggle alone, one cannot understand the essence  and origin of wars. To do this, one must comprehend such matters  as a society's economic system, processes of the birth of  classes, the causes of contradictions between states, and so  forth. But this, as we know, is not the subject of military  science.    Before, in socialist countries it was customary to believe  that general problems of war were revealed in the  Marxist-Leninist doctrine on war and the army; other doctrines  on war were ignored. Thus, the object and subject of knowledge  narrowed substantially, and many very complex phenomena had to  fit into the methodological framework of one doctrine alone. I  am confident that war, like any other phenomenon, can be studied  objectively by studying all doctrines and theories directly or  indirectly concerning it, adopting the best that is in them. In  Western countries, the science studying the general problems of  war (its essence, origin, socio-political and economic  fundamentals of military might, the army's role and place in  society, and so forth) is called the study of war. In discussing  these problems at the conference of historians, O.A. Belkov said  that they could study military politology. It was planned to  legitimize the concept of "philosophy of war" or "general theory  of war." But these terms, in my view, do not fully express the  essence of the problems.    Military politology is legitimate only as a component part  of  general politology. But in the cognition of war one encounters  not only political but also philosophical, economic, and social  problems. Thus, general knowledge about war can be known based  on comprehensive studies of various sciences. The term "general  doctrine on war and the army" is more accurate.    Now about the topic of military science. Recently, people  have appeared who have poor knowledge about the essence of the  question they are trying to interpret in their own way.    There are opinions about the need to include in the topic of  military science political and economic problems and knowledge  of other sciences (physics, cybernetics, geography, and others).  The article "What Is Military Science?" was published in the  journal VOYENNAYA MYSL. In particular, the author writes that to  solve the "entire set of problems facing military science, it is  necessary to know...economic, social, ecological, demographic,  and other aspects of war, and the corresponding sections of  military science engage in this." It further emphasizes: "It is  known that whereas a field of knowledge has an object and  subject for cognition and its own laws, this is a science  according to all parameters, and the social order for knowledge  of this science determines its affiliation--in this case  military."[.sup]1[/] It must be said that we have not  encountered for a long time now any examples of a more dense  ignorance in our military press. If you assume that such an  approach would be adopted by science, this would give rise to  complete confusion in classification of scientific knowledge.    Indeed, it is necessary to know and take into account the  economic, ecological, and other aspects of war. The Ministry of  Defense needs knowledge gleaned from various sciences, and  military science uses it. This is the essence of interaction and  mutual penetration of sciences. But it is impossible and  illegitimate to include physics, mathematics, and other fields  of knowledge in military science just because they are used in  military affairs.    People who react so frivolously to resolving methodological  problems do not understand that sciences must not be classified  arbitrarily. They differ primarily according to the subject for  cognition and those objective phenomena and laws which they are  able to experience.    Warfare, armed forces, methods of preparing and conducting  combat operations by them in modern conditions, taking into  account prospects of development, are the subject of military  science.    War and armed struggle are a two-sided phenomenon in which  both sides deal with common laws, principles, and objective  phenomena. Therefore, military science is unified, and its  previous division into "Soviet" or "bourgeois" is artificial.    Openness of military science, military cooperation with  other  countries, and exchange of knowledge are important today.  Unfortunately, recently we have stopped publishing military  literature in general, and books by foreign authors are not  being translated or published, although even during the  "stagnant" years we had the opportunity to read Manstein,  Guderian, Eisenhower, and others. We need to know foreign  military literature. Without this we cannot acquire full-fledged  military knowledge. I would also like to express the desire that  questions of methodology of military theory and practice be  studied more thoroughly at military academies and thus increase  the overall culture of the officer corps. Moreover, it is  impossible to plan and organize military-scientific work and  scientifically compile training programs without precisely  defining the subject and content of military science and the  military problems of other sciences.    Finally, not only are the methodological reference points  changing. Many new problems of military science are arising  which require the soonest possible study. For example, at the  conference, all the historians agreed that nuclear war is  impossible.    The viewpoint on the unlikelihood of a conventional world  war  in the near future is also well-founded. Achieving political  objectives by using military force will now be accomplished  basically by three methods: setting limited objectives and  accomplishing them successively in local wars; subversive  operations against other countries; indirect strategic  operations.    All our military theory, field manuals, and training  literature are oversaturated with developments of waging nuclear  and conventional world wars. Obviously, the fundamentals of  nuclear planning should also change. In our view, it will have  to be limited to the elaboration of the fundamentals of nuclear  deterrence and methods of armed struggle calling for the use of  armed forces in local wars and in a major conventional war, but  taking into account the threat of possible use of nuclear  weapons.    In this regard, many new questions arise in the area of  organizational development and training of armed forces, on  which, in our view, the main efforts in military-scientific work  should be concentrated.    General of the Army M.A. Gareyev, doctor of military  sciences, professor    Military-historical science (like all historical science in  our country) is in a deep crisis. The problem of cadres of  military historians and also of military-historical work among  personnel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation also  remains acute. The tasks placed before military-historical  science by life are intense, serious, and diverse. Many of them  cannot be accomplished in a few months, but they must not be put  off.    The most difficult problem at this stage is eliminating  "blank spaces" in military history, particularly of the Soviet  period. We also do not now have a complete picture of their  amount, although in recent years quite a bit was said in  articles on historical topics. One of the immediate practical  tasks, in our opinion, is a historiographic assessment of  all that has been done in the area of military history,  particularly recently. Now, when many previously  inaccessible documents have become known, it turned out that the  "official history" was truncated according to a number of  parameters, far from reality. Historians were authorized to work  with those documents and publish those works which "worked" for  the society's political system that existed until recently and  increased its prestige. Everything negative in the life of the  country and army was carefully metered out in doses, and  everything unfavorable was covered up, hushed up. When something  secret suddenly became open, it was denied with persistence  deserving of better use (as was the case with the secret  protocol to the Soviet-German Non-aggression Treaty of 23 August  1939). So, almost everything new in scientific-historical  publications of recent years is the "negative" that was hidden  earlier, which (it is important to emphasize this) is also a  part of our history.    Unfortunately, publication of such facts and documents  earlier unknown to science often resulted in their authors being  labeled as "slanderers" by those who wanted to know only that  history which was presented to us all the preceding years.    It should be noted that today, too, researchers are not  confident that they are writing "the entire truth," since access  to many fundamentally important documents has been made  difficult up to now. As we know, a whole set of facts is often  required in order to prove something, but only one fact or  document is enough to refute this same thing (for example, in  the case of the above-mentioned secret protocol). Therefore, the  likelihood is great that the historical concepts developed today  may prove to be unsound in the near future after the appearance  of new information about which we do not yet know and about  whose scientific importance we cannot even guess. However, this  does not mean that historians have to wait until "everything is  known."    An urgent practical task, in our view, is the creation  of such works which would outline the current vision of problems  of the country's military history, particularly its Soviet  period, based on already accessible documents and  materials. Accomplishing this task, to our regret, is made  extremely complicated by the state of publishing in our country.  But this is the topic for a special conversation.    Of course, the search for new archival documents and  materials with their subsequent publication must be stepped  up to create new works. A beginning has been set for this: the  publishing center TERRA published a transcript of the December  (1940) meeting of the top command personnel of the Red Army. It  was prepared for press by associates of the Institute of  Military History and the Russian State Military Archives. Next  was a publication of collections of documents of the State  Defense Committee, the General Headquarters of the Supreme High  Command, the people's defense commissar, and other leadership  bodies of the USSR Armed Forces during the Great Patriotic War.  These collections will include declassified documents and  materials not published before. Their publication will make it  possible to take a new look at problems which seemed solved long  ago, eliminate many "blank spaces," and help create objective  scientific works about the Great Patriotic War. Certainly,  introducing a huge mass of new documents into scientific  circulation will mean a real breakthrough in elaborating such  works.    As far as military history instruction at military academies  and schools is concerned, the requirements of training programs  to provide students (officer cadets) with "in-depth and sound  knowledge of military history" will remain a good desire. The  number of training hours allotted to a subject (up to 50 hours  in schools and up to 150 hours in academies) does not permit  this. In addition, the unending process of "shortening" the  subject continues. The unsound practice existing at some  military educational institutions, when up to 75 percent of the  training time is allocated to group types of classes, is faulty.  With a lack of new textbooks, they do not produce the desired  results. In these conditions, more time must be allotted  to lectures. For only in this way can we effectively summarize  new material on the military history on Russia and convey it to  the students.    Finally, it is necessary to analyze military history as  a science. For the time being, it is only declared that  military history includes the history of wars, the history of  military art, the history of organizational development of the  armed forces, the history of military equipment, and the history  of military thought, as well as a number of auxiliary  disciplines. However, none of these component parts (other than  the history of military art) so far has been elaborated in  scientific terms and presented not only in the form of a book  but even a good scientific-theoretical article. I think that, in  this regard, an extensive field of activity is opening up for  those who are involved with general problems of military history  and its methodology.    Colonel (Ret) P.N. Bobylev, candidate of historical  sciences, docent    One of the most important component parts of organizational  development of the Russian Armed Forces--military  education--is in need of a scientifically sound concept  today. Successful resolution of this problem is impossible  without combining the efforts of representatives of various  fields of military knowledge. In working up a concept of  education, it is necessary, above all, to take into account the  radical nature and depth of army reforms being conducted and  planned as a whole.    In these conditions, the novelty, complexity, and  responsibility of resolving educational problems lie in the fact  that the efficient and actively operating system of  ideological-political, moral, and psychological training of  servicemen that was developed over decades in the USSR Armed  Forces had actually collapsed. A rejection of many  once-unwavering theoretical and ideological dogmas followed.  Many traditional forms and methods of educational work have been  significantly constricted.    Re-creation of the education system has begun and is being  accomplished with a search for the corresponding spiritual and  moral reference points that are acceptable for the new Russia  and its practically new army. Much from the historical past,  especially the Soviet past, has to be rejected in this process.  At the same time, much inevitably will have to be preserved,  something forced to "remove anew," and enrich the current system  of spiritual values with something.    In terms of content, the spiritual and moral values and  reference points are to draw in, on the one hand, all the  natural and historical experience of education and, on the  other, everything new emerging from modern public life evolving  in the direction of democratization and humanization of public  relations in the country and the world as a whole.    The system of spiritual and moral values and reference  points  of military service have always included moral norms and ideals.  Today, honesty, a high degree of patriotism, heroism,  discipline, and so forth remain the moral norms of the defender  of the fatherland.    In preserving the in-depth fundamentals, the ideals of  military service today need to be freed from archaisms,  pseudo-values, and utopianism. Above all, the patriotic idea of  serving the homeland, enriched with democratic ideals, universal  values, and the principle of the supremacy of human rights must  emerge in a naturally primordial form.    Faith. It is more complicated. But since the human psyche,  including the psyche of a solder, is impossible without faith,  here a very broad field of activity is opening up for military  psychologists. Pluralism of religion is to enrich a soldier's  spiritual and moral ideals.    By no means does the process of freeing a soldier's  consciousness from the syndrome of "class struggle," "class  morality," "image of an enemy," and other ideological guidelines  of communist-totalitarian thinking mean that the emphasis in  educational work with servicemen can be placed only on fostering  loving feelings for everything and a peaceful nature merging  with the worst variants of pacifism.    A soldier is called upon to know, understand, and sharply  sense the watershed between good and evil, nobility and  meanness, true and false patriotism, and identify and understand  such anti-democratic, anti-humane social phenomena as racism,  fascism, terrorism, aggression, and so forth.    Acquiring and assimilating moral norms and ideals by  soldiers  in the process of education can become the basis not only of  their truly patriotic activities but also spiritual immunity  with respect to any irrational misanthropic ideas which may be  in use in the military environment in conditions of the often  vulgar understanding of pluralism of ideas, views, and opinions.    A system of specialized bodies in the Army and Navy, putting  into practice new forms and methods of individual and group  (collective) education, is called upon to serve the new content  of the spiritual and moral makeup of the Army.    In doing so, military researchers have grounds for a most  attentive attitude toward structural elements of educational  work already created or being created or, as it is now called,  work with personnel in the Russian Armed Forces. It seems to me  there is a real danger of a mechanical inheritance of many  organizational principles, forms, and methods of this work from  the recent past, the negative results of which are obvious. In  particular, the primitive didactic principle of education widely  used in the recent past is not very effective and does not reach  the heart of today's young person. It must be replaced by rich  pluralistic information activities and promotion of  self-education.    I am confident that practical resolution of such important  problems of education needs a revival of the progressive Russian  military-pedagogical school and true reform of training military  educators at all levels. Recent political workers in the Army  and Navy from the Marxist-Leninist and communist school were not  notable for their educational ability, since both in schools and  academies they were trained according to the  "jack-of-all-trades" principle. Experts of the human soul of  this sort during the course of reforms must make room for true  professionals of spiritual and moral education of servicemen. In  turn, special educational institutions, faculties, and  departments of a military-pedagogical, military-psychological,  and military-historical orientation are called upon to engage in  training them. At the same time, taking into account the  steadfastness of the principle of one-man command in the armed  forces, commanders of all ranks are to possess  military-psychological and military-pedagogical knowledge and  skills.    The fundamental and multiple-aspect nature of problems of  military education require an initial conceptual basis. The  concept of education in turn cannot but take into account such  factors as the scientific-theoretical substantiation of value  reference points of education, the sum total of spiritual and  moral norms and ideals being cultivated, and, finally, the  qualitative state of the specific object of education. Its  development is possible only on the scale of the state through  the collective efforts of researchers and practical workers. The  basis for this, it seems to us, has been created. Above all, the  new Constitution of the Russian Federation and Russia's military  doctrine must become the legal reference points of military  education as a whole.    Captain 1st Rank (Ret) P.M. Shabardin, candidate of  philosophical sciences    Military psychology is not among the generally recognized  social-humanities disciplines comprising the methodological  basis of organizational development of the armed forces. But at  the same time, it is generally known that a modern army and navy  cannot be built without psychology. The experience of the  Russian Army is evidence of this. It is recorded in the Military  Encyclopedia, published in 1912 in St. Petersburg and edited by  I.D. Sytin, that in view of the complexities of military  affairs, the study of it is broken down into a whole series of  studies comprising the task of specific sciences. This should  include, above all, tactics and military psychology.    Military education "on the one hand, should rely on  conclusions of a person's psychology and physiology and, on the  other, a study of the internal and external nature of  war."[.sup]2[/]    A department of military psychology was formed in the  Russian  Army in 1908 under a society of ardent supporters of military  knowledge. It had the task of developing military psychology as  a branch of general and military sciences studying the best  training and use of the psychic aspect--forces, means, and  methods of armed struggle.[.sup]3[/]    At the same time, I would like to note the paradoxical  aspect  in the development of military psychology in recent years.  Before reforming the political bodies in the armed forces into  military-political bodies and then into structures for work with  personnel at the Military Political Academy (today the Academy  of the Humanities), three educational psychological disciplines  were taught: military psychology--for officer political workers;  military psychology and methods of its instruction--for officer  instructors of military psychology; psychology of higher  military school--for instructors in other humanities disciplines.    Today, the cycle of educational and psychological  disciplines  being taught at the academy includes such subjects as the  history of psychology, general psychology, social psychology,  military psychology, psycho-physiology, age psychology,  psycho-hygiene and psycho-therapy of military service,  experimental psychology, psychology of pedagogical activities,  professiology, and methods of teaching psychology. A number of  special courses have been introduced (psychology of conflicts,  medical psychology, psychology and interrelations, and others).    Skilled training programs and subject plans have been  compiled for all educational disciplines. But here is what is  surprising: at the military academy, the training program and  subject plan were particularly poorly developed for the  "military psychology" discipline. This was the result of the  fact that many topics of a historical-psychological, general  psychological, social-psychological, and other nature "went"  into related educational disciplines, where they also were to be  "registered" according to content. That is, the person "went"  with his psychic phenomena, the collective "went" with the  socio-psychological characteristics, and the content of military  psychology faded.    Such a situation even further increased the need to resolve  the question on the subject of military psychology. Is there a  need for military psychology to include all the topics of  general, social, and other divisions of psychology, having made  only a corresponding verbal balancing act? Experience shows that  the answer is no. Military psychology today as a scientific  discipline is increasingly developing into the psychology of  stress situations. It includes three main divisions: preparing  for the behavior and actions of servicemen in stress (combat)  situations; control and self-control of the mental state of  servicemen, their behavior, and actions in stress situations;  psychological rehabilitation of servicemen after coming out of  stress situations (after stress-causing pressure).    In the course of these directions, a number of original and  interesting studies have been conducted at the department of  psychology at the Academy of the Humanities. Thus, B.I.  Khoziyev, candidate of psychological sciences and docent,  performed work to increase the quality of training (combat  training) of military specialists of various fields. Colonel  S.M. Zakharik defended a dissertation on the theme "Forming  Psychological Stability of Paratroopers to the Influence of  Factors of Modern Combat." Lieutenant Colonel V.Ye. Popov is  successfully studying the problem of psychological orientation  of servicemen after extreme pressure. A number of other works  can also be cited that merit attention.    In conclusion, I would like to note that, in our view,  military psychology is on the verge of a stage of qualitative  development, summarization of earlier results, and breaking up  its content during the course of modern research into a new  scientific discipline--military psychology of stress situations.

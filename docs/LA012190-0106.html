			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: TITLE INSURANCE KEEPS NASTY SURPRISES AT BAY  </P> <P> You found your dream home. It meant forgoing vacations, nights on the town and  a new car, but you managed to finally come up with the down payment and a  mortgage loan.  </P> <P> Before signing on the various dotted lines, you scan the list of closing costs  and notice a charge for title insurance. In fact, after points and prepaid  mortgage interest, title insurance is your largest closing expense.  </P> <P> Home buyers may grumble about buying yet another insurance policy, but without  title insurance, they run the risk of having to pay past-due bills or taxes  left behind by the previous owner or even face the possibility of losing their  new home.  </P> <P> I recently handled a case where a young couple moved into their home, only to  find a $5,000-property tax bill was left unpaid by the seller. Since the home  buyers had title insurance, their insurer paid the taxes. My job was to sue the  seller for reimbursement for the title insurance company.  </P> <P> When property changes hands, all encumbrances not paid through escrow are  transferred to the new owner. If the buyers hadn't purchased title insurance,  they would have been obligated to pay the $5,000-tax bill.  </P> <P> This is where title insurance is invaluable. Title insurance generally  indemnifies the purchaser of the policy that a property's title is free and  clear of liens or encumbrances except for stated exceptions and exclusions.  </P> <P> If an encumbrance later appears, as in the above example, the insurance company  is required to either eliminate the encumbrance or pay for damages. Without  title insurance, home buyers are on their own.  </P> <P> Although California law does not require home buyers to purchase title  insurance, the premiums are minimal (about 10% of closing costs) compared to  the large monetary investment in the property.  </P> <P> Also, lenders do not normally provide funding unless title insurance is  purchased. The one-time premium not only includes a title check, but it  protects you from unknown claims for as long as you own the property.  </P> <P> About 125 title insurance companies are members of the California Land Title  Assn. Of these, about 40 do business in Southern California.  </P> <P> Although most insurers offer similar coverage, the cost of title insurance can  vary. Rates are filed with the state Department of Insurance and some are  priced more competitively than others.  </P> <P> By shopping around, a home buyer can save several hundred dollars in premium  costs for the same dollar amount of coverage.  </P> <P> If your new home has changed hands within two years before your purchase, ask  for the insurer's "short-term rate." Since the title-searching process will not  require as much time or leg work, these rates can be less.  </P> <P> Who chooses your title insurance company?  </P> <P> Most often, your real estate agent. Don't feel obligated to use his or her  recommendation. Remember, your title insurance is in effect for as long as you  own your home, while your relationship with your realtor is usually over soon  after the moving van leaves.  </P> <P> Chances are, you will never need an insurer's legal assistance over a disputed  claim or unexpected lien, but you'll want to select an insurer with a proven  track record, a reputation for service and one that offers prompt handling of  claims if they do arise.  </P> <P> To help you choose a good insurer, ask your real estate agent and local  mortgage companies for the names of title insurers they regularly use. Then do  some investigating on your own.  </P> <P> To determine an insurer's financial stability, request fiscal statements that  show levels of monetary reserves. Also, contact the state Department of  Insurance in Sacramento, (800) 233-9045, to find out if the insurance company  is licensed. And call the California Land Title Assn., (916) 444-2647, to learn  if the insurer is an association member.  </P> <P> Unlike casualty insurers, which assume risk when issuing policies, title  insurers devote most of their efforts, and most of your premium payment, to  researching a title -- to eliminate risk -- before issuing the policy.  </P> <P> A title search can find:  </P> <P>  -- Someone else, besides the seller, laying claim to the property.  </P> <P>  -- A third party's lien on the property to collect payment of a debt.  </P> <P>  -- A judgment against the seller or a prior owner.  </P> <P>  -- An easement running through the lot that the seller failed to mention.  </P> <P>  -- Hundreds or even thousands of dollars of unpaid property taxes or liens.  </P> <P> Title insurers have "title plants" containing millions of public documents. The  insurance company's staff searches these records for "red flags." Title  insurers normally issue a standard policy that ". . . fundamentally protects  only against defects in the title, or encumbrances on the property which are  disclosed by the 'public records.' "  </P> <P> These records can include tax or assessment notices, easements and encroachment  records and court judgments.  </P> <P> After researching the property, the title insurer provides a preliminary report  (usually paid for by the seller) listing any liens or encumbrances. The buyers'  real estate agent then notifies the buyers of the report's findings. Most  titles come up clean, but if a troubling lien appears, the buyers normally have  three options:  </P> <P>  -- Buy the property knowing a lien exists, and assume the obligation and risks  of the lien.  </P> <P>  -- Negotiate with the seller and his or her real estate agent to clear the  lien from the title.  </P> <P>  -- Cancel the transaction. Buyers can legally back out of a deal if the seller  fails to disclose all liens against the property.  </P> <P> If a lien clouds the title and the buyers still want to purchase the home, the  title company will usually issue a policy but will not agree to insure the  detected lien.  </P> <P> Once the preliminary report is accepted by the buyer, the insurer runs one more  check on the day escrow closes just in case other liens have appeared since the  preliminary report was completed. If everything is in order, a title insurance  policy is issued.  </P> <P> Insurers review thousands of documents daily for Southern California property  transactions. No system is infallible and human and computer error occasionally  occur. As a piece of property is bought and resold, its lineage grows and  chances for error or omissions increase.  </P> <P> When an encumbrance slips through the review process and comes to light only  after you have taken title to the property, your title insurance premium  protects your interests up to the maximum of the face value of the policy  (usually the mortgage amount).  </P> <P> As the insured, you must notify the insurance company immediately upon learning  of a claim against your property, or else under law, the insurer may not have  to act.  </P> <P> Once notified, the title insurer will determine if the claim is legitimate. If  it is, the insurer will then pay off the claim, compensate the homeowners, or  take the issue to court if there is a valid reason for objecting to the claim.  </P> <P> Occasionally, an undetected claim on a property will affect the new owners.  </P> <P> For example, upon submitting plans for a family room addition, the new owners  are told an easement runs through the proposed construction site. In these  cases, the title insurer may be required to financially compensate the owners  against any resulting losses or hardship up to the total amount of the title  insurance purchased.  </P> <P> By transferring their property to new owners, some sellers believe they are no  longer responsible for any undetected liens associated with their former  property. This is not necessarily so.  </P> <P> Although the title insurer may have to make good on the claims or remove the  lien to satisfy its contractual obligation to the home buyers, the insurer has  the legal right to seek out the seller and obtain reimbursement.  </P> <P> Naturally, as new homeowners, you want to be assured that your home's plumbing  and heating work and the roof doesn't leak, but these assurances are of little  value if you do not also have the security of knowing your new home is free of  legal encumbrances. Title insurance gives you that security.  </P></p>

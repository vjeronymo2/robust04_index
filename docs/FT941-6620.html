			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Some hedge Hedge funds make splendid scapegoats for the recent turbulence in global markets. But is one of the unstated risks in their frenetic and highly leveraged operations that their importance is being exaggerated? The size of the foreign exchange market is such that it seems implausible that even Mr George Soros of Quantum Fund fame could have extracted sterling from the exchange rate mechanism single-handed - and we only have Mr Soros's word for the amount of profit he made in speculating against sterling. If rumours of huge bond market losses among the hedge funds in recent days are true, the main victims, apart from the managers, will be rich individuals who knew what risks they were taking when they entrusted their money to these off-shore buccaneers. At first sight, then, it may seem odd that the Bank of England, whose concern in these matters is primarily to do with systemic risk, should be looking into the issue. Yet the central bankers cannot afford to ignore the likelihood that hedge funds are often the counterparties of the commercial banks. In that sense they may be systemically important. And the only undisputed facts about these private pools of capital is that their managers borrow to speculate, while revealing little information about their financial activities. Much of what they do takes place not in the cash markets but in derivatives. This, too, is an opaque and highly leveraged part of the global securities system, since much of the dealing takes place in over-the-counter markets. The precise location and extent of the risk is not always easy to identify. There is thus obvious scope for the kind of problem that arose with the collapse of the Herstatt bank in the 1970s or with the difficulties of Drexel Burham in the 1980s, where central bankers felt obliged to help close out the US investment bank's positions. Estimates of hedge fund capital range from Dollars 30bn to Dollars 80bn. With leverage, that could readily imply that they are taking positions in the markets of Dollars 500bn upwards. But since there is no adequate definition of the genus, it may be that such informal industry estimates overstate the sums involved by including funds run by more conventional managers. The immediate need is clearly for information about counterparty risk in the commercial banking system, in order to establish how the banks are controlling their exposure to the hedge funds. If the exercises now being conducted in Britain and the US indicate that the risk is exaggerated, so much the better. If not, and the data permit, the case for tougher capital requirements within the existing capital regime of the Bank for International Settlements will be overwhelming. Where rich individuals are being seduced into speculative mania by hedge fund gurus whose credentials remain obscure, it seems all too plausible that the world's bankers will not be far behind.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRESSURE NOT A PROBLEM IN PLANE CRASH  </P> <P> An air safety investigator said Tuesday that evidence indicates there was no  oil pressure problem aboard the Piper Aerostar that crashed and burned on a  tennis court in Newport Beach on March 31.  </P> <P> That finding appeared to rule out a problem in the oil system as a possible  cause of the crash, which killed a Canadian family of five, said Jeff Rich, an  investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. The oil system had  come to the attention of investigators because pilot Anthony Deis had asked  mechanics at Martin Aviation to check his plane for a possible oil leak three  days before the crash.  </P> <P> Rich also said that the propeller blades on the plane's right engine appear to  have been "feathered" before the crash, which killed Deis, his wife and their  three daughters. Feathering tilts the angle of the blades so that they provide  less drag during an engine failure.  </P> <P> The propellers on the left engine were not feathered, Rich said.  </P> <P> Rich cautioned that it is still too soon to conclude that the right engine  caused the crash or that a foam rubber seal sucked into the right engine's  turbocharger is to blame. "We're still researching the plane's fuel lines and  the investigation is continuing," he said.  </P> <P> NTSB officials disclosed Monday that a lab test found traces of the seal in the  engine's turbocharger.  </P> <P> "We still don't know how significant that is," Rich said Tuesday. "Under some  scenarios it could mean very little would happen but under others it could  produce catastrophic results."  </P> <P> The Deis family had vacationed in Orange County and was on its way home to  Camrose, Alberta, when the plane crashed minutes after taking off from John  Wayne Airport.  </P></p>

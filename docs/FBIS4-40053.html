			<p>BFN     [Text] The emigration of the Russian population from  Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] is a catastrophe not only for the  Republic but for Russia as well, which is unable to receive  hundreds of thousands of its countrymen, President Askar Akayev  said in Bishkek.    Akayev recognized that the main motives for emigration were  socio-political. In particular, the introduction of Kirghiz as  the state language had pushed Russians out of many professional  spheres. He also did not deny cases of discrimination in the  entrepreneurial sphere and displays of everyday nationalism.    In Akayev's view, the outflow of experts from the Republic  is  causing irreparable damage to the republic's economy. Whereas  in 1990 Russians accounted for more than 21 percent of the  population, in four years their number has decreased to 17  percent.</p>

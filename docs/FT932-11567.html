			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Italy bank chief may be named A NEW Bank of Italy governor could be nominated today after a meeting of the central bank's board of directors, Haig Simonian writes from Milan. The extraordinary session of the 13-member board follows last week's nomination of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor for the past 14 years, as Italy's new prime minister. The three most widely tipped candidates are all internal: Mr Lamberto Dini, the bank's director general, and its two deputy directors, Mr Antonio Fazio and Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa. The governorship is among the most coveted in the Italian public service but, in spite of the bank's independence from the political system, its advice has not always been heeded by governments in power.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER COLLEGE, AMERICAN STARS PLAY OVERSEAS -- OR NOT AT ALL  </P> <P> The similarities between Michael Jordan and Cheryl Miller are striking.  </P> <P> They both were consensus All-Americans who led their teams to National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles as sophomores and were named James Naismith  Award winners as juniors. And both won gold medals in the 1984 Los Angeles  Olympics.  </P> <P> But here is where the similarity ends.  </P> <P> Jordan was able to parlay his collegiate success into a career in the National  Basketball Assn. For Miller, however, playing professional basketball in the  United States was no more than a dream.  </P> <P> "I really think it stinks that women cannot continue with their playing careers  here in the United States," said Miller, who has not played competitively since  the 1987 World Championships and is now a broadcaster for ABC Sports.  </P> <P> It's easy to follow the careers of the men who come out of college with big  reputations and earn big paychecks. But those options don't exist for women.  </P> <P> They can find a job in the United States, practice hard and try out for the  next Olympic team. Or they can travel overseas to play professionally in  countries such as Italy, Spain and Japan while retaining their amateur status.  Or they can retire from basketball.  </P> <P> Players such as 1984 Olympian Anne Donovan, who graduated from Old Dominion in  1983, and 1988 Olympian Cynthia Cooper, who graduated from USC in 1986, elected  to continue practicing in the hopes of another Olympic medal.  </P> <P> Eight players on the 1988 U.S. women's team had played their last collegiate  game more than a year before the Olympics, compared to only one (David  Robinson) on the men's team.  </P> <P> Many U.S. players have found a new playing life abroad. Three former USC  players, Cooper and Pam and Paula McGee, are playing in Italy, as are Donovan  and former Cal State Long Beach player LaTaunya Pollard. Cindy Brown, a 1988  Olympian and former Cal State Long Beach standout, is playing in Japan.  </P> <P> Players who compete overseas are still considered amateurs because they are  regarded as employees of the companies that own the teams.  </P> <P> After Cooper graduated from USC, she played for a year in Spain before moving  to Italy last season, when she led the Italian Federation League in scoring  with an average of 40 points for her team, Primizie Parma.  </P> <P> "I love it over here, in that I am not playing behind the shadow of anyone,"  said Cooper, who played on USC's national championship teams of 1983 and 1984.  "I am getting a chance to fulfill a dream."  </P> <P> In Italy, there are no high school or college teams, only clubs. There are  about 30 clubs, divided into several divisions, and most of the Americans play  in the First Division.  </P> <P> "The crowds here are rowdy," Cooper said. "They really get on the referees  here. If they feel that the referees cheated, they throw coins at him and spit  on the opposing coaches.  </P> <P> "The officiating here is pretty weak. They let the Italian players get away  with a lot of physical abuse on the Americans.  </P> <P> "I have to look toward this as a business now, because the physical demand is  so much that the fun is gone."  </P> <P> Cooper is paid well by league standards, about $80,000, tax free, a year.  </P> <P> "Cooper is very important to the team and the league," said team president  Johnny Bertolazzi. "She is a star. She is known all over the country, and  everyone loves her. Everyone wants to meet and be with her."  </P> <P> Cooper has adapted to the Italian life style and can speak the language well  enough to get by.  </P> <P> "It is very frustrating sometimes with the lack of communication," said Cooper,  whose team also plays in the European Cup, a playoff of Europe's top club  teams. "I am glad to be playing, but I plan to play just 2 more years here  before moving on to other things."  </P> <P> In 1983, LaTaunya Pollard was the first West Coast player to win the Wade  Trophy, one of the top awards in women's basketball. She was a two-time  consensus All-American and is Cal State Long Beach's career scoring leader with  3,001 points. But after college, she had knee surgery, which caused her to lose  her spot on the 1984 Olympic team.  </P> <P> Now, nearly 6 years later, Pollard is married, has a 1-year-old daughter and is  playing professionally in Italy.  </P> <P> "It is a shame that you have to go so far away to play," said Pollard, who  spent 1986 coaching at Long Beach while finishing her degree in physical  education.  </P> <P> "When I first came over here in 1983, you could have only one American to a  team, and they didn't pay well. Now, things have changed. With only soccer to  compete with, women's basketball has really taken off.  </P> <P> "I play for one of the richest teams in the league (Sidis Ancona, which is a  grocery store chain). I hope to continue to have a good year so I can ask for  whatever I want next season."  </P> <P> Pollard plays in Ancona, which is a small city about a 4-hour drive from Rome.  It is her third club in the 4 seasons she has been in Italy.  </P> <P> "When you are on a team which does not have a good year, you have a chance to  switch teams, because that team may drop to the Second Division, and Americans  can only play in the First Division," said Pollard, who considers the level of  play in the First Division to be comparable to college Division II in the  United States.  </P> <P> Pollard plans to play at least one more season, but said: "I have said that  after every year."  </P> <P> Another former USC star playing in Italy is Paula McGee. She and her twin, Pam,  are playing for the same club team in Palermo, Sicily.  </P> <P> Paula McGee did not go to Italy right out of college. She first had an  unsuccessful tryout with the Harlem Globetrotters and a brief stint with the  Dallas Diamonds of the now-defunct Women's Basketball League before traveling  to Spain and then Italy.  </P> <P> Although she is in her third year playing in Italy, McGee still has mixed  feelings about it.  </P> <P> "I go back and forth," McGee said. "I have never really loved it, but I am  making a living over here. Some things still bother me, like having washers but  no dryers, but overall, if you make an effort to get acclimated, things are  OK."  </P> <P> McGee still thinks that a professional league can make it in the United States,  but only if presented right.  </P> <P> "First off, you cannot have a team in Los Angeles, because there is too much of  a strain on the fan's entertainment dollar," McGee said. "You have to accept  the fact that you'll lose money at first, but if you keep it in small places  like Norfolk, Va., and Ruston, La., the players would start staying home."  </P> <P> Cheryl Miller, who emerged as the celebrity of women's basketball during her  playing career at USC, was supposed to have an unlimited future. In college,  Miller was called the best female player in the world. She was a three-time  Naismith Award winner and a member of the 1984 Olympic gold-medal winning team.  But she did not make the 1988 Olympic team because of a knee injury.  </P> <P> "It (the time after her last game) was the worst experience of my life," Miller  said. "I had always felt that when I was done with basketball, everyone would  be knocking at my door.  </P> <P> "Here I was, preparing myself to make a tough decision on whether to meet with  Johnny (Carson) or Joan (Rivers) once I returned home from Rome, and the only  call I had was from my aunt, who said she had seen me on television."  </P> <P> Although she had offers from foreign teams, Miller did not want to leave the  United States. So she and her attorney, Arn Tellem, started knocking on media  doors. ABC decided to give Miller a chance to do color commentary and features,  although she had no experience.  </P> <P> "I hated my first year at ABC," said Miller, who also works for ESPN and other  cable networks. "I'm a perfectionist, and I wanted to be the best, but it was  hard.  </P> <P> "I am doing other things now. I was the sideline reporter during the  USC-Stanford football game this season, and I will get a chance to do  commentary on my first men's game in March, and the women's Final Four."  </P> <P> Miller had hoped to conclude her playing career in the Seoul Olympics, but the  knee injury, suffered in April, 1987, kept her from making the team.  </P> <P> "The Olympic trials were a nightmare," Miller said. "I often think that I would  have been better off if I had not tried, but I would have hated myself if I  hadn't."  </P> <P> Despite her efforts, Miller was sent home before the final cut. She denies that  she quit the team.  </P> <P> "For various reasons, I was just not good enough to make the team," Miller  said. "Everything could have been handled differently, but I just want to let  it die. I am glad that the women won."  </P> <P> Miller admits now that her playing career is over.  </P> <P> "I would have loved to continue to play basketball here in the U.S.," said  Miller, who says she never considered playing abroad. "But, there are not any  leagues to do so. The guys just do not know how lucky they are to get money to  play the game they love.  </P> <P> "I used to see myself as flamboyant when I played, but now I am a more private  person. I cherish my time alone at home. I just wish I could have played  longer."  </P> <P> Rhonda Windham, another former Trojan star, also decided to end her basketball  career. She graduated from USC in 1987 and now is coaching in Italy.  </P> <P> "I am a demonstrative instructor in developing players 12 to 18 years old,"  Windham said. "I really like what I am doing. I am getting paid well, and I am  also teaching English in a classroom."  </P> <P> Windham, who won the 1987 Francis Pomeroy Naismith Award as the nation's top  player under 5 feet 6 inches, first tried a career in marketing.  </P> <P> "I did not like working in that kind of atmosphere," said Windham about her  career in marketing, which lasted 3 months. "I knew that I was going to the  Olympic trials in April, so I was just trying to bide time."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Windham, the trials were a disappointment.  </P> <P> "My heart just was not into it," she said. "I did not have the burning desire  to make the team. I had no desire within, and it showed."  </P> <P> After she failed to make the team, Windham went home to New York until she  heard from her agent about a job coaching in Italy.  </P> <P> "Everything happened so fast," Windham said. "In 3 days' time, I was off to  Italy, and things have really taken off."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE THEY ARE NOW  </P> <P> What members of the 1988 women's Olympic basketball team are doing now:  </P>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recommendations of the Advisory Council as a whole were included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a resolution. The resolution questioned the sufficiency of the evidence to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support adoption of the proposed rule and recommended that: (1) The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake negotiated rulemaking or other comparable process for this standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the costs of any rule be considered, both cumulatively and by zones; (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department examine its legal and regulatory authority with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation, if it finds that an installation standard would be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate means of increasing wind safety; (4) the Department consider all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized model codes; (5) the Department make available documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the development of new wind standards; (6) the Advisory Council be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconvened to review public comments and the Department's analysis; (7) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department should promptly complete the process of updating the wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, considering the issues and questions raised by the Advisory Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in public comments; and (8) the Department should prepare an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory impact analysis upon which it can support the decisions to be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on implementation of new standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered the conclusions and recommendations of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council in developing this final rule and the final regulatory impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. The regulatory impact analysis is responsive to several of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council's concerns, while this preamble addresses other points raised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Advisory Council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the other points raised by the Advisory Council, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters also suggested that installation is a crucial factor in the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of manufactured homes. The Department agrees that the installation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured housing units may be an important factor in the safety of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing and is initiating a review of the Department's authority and ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to influence tiedown requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Department does not believe there is any significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantage in, or that the public interest would be served by, reconvening the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advisory Council for the purpose of reviewing the public comments or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's compliance with its statutory responsibilities in the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these standards. Nor does the Department believe there is any advantage to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public interest in undertaking negotiated rulemaking for these standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they have been subject to an extensive notice and comment period and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been discussed with the Advisory Council, a body representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured housing industry, government, and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Major Differences From Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the Department's review of public comments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the Advisory Council, at this time the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided not to pursue substantial changes to the standards in areas of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country not generally subject to hurricanes (Wind Zone I). However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department recognizes that in many areas of the country the Federal standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the design and construction of manufactured housing are far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below standards specified for site-built and modular housing by State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local codes. Thus, the Department shall initiate a new review of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for the rest of the country, and it expects to publish proposals for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these areas next year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has also decided not to include in the final rule the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following items that were in the proposed rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Maximum dimension of 12 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; for roof overhangs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Lower load duration factor than provided in the 1991 National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Requirement for a 1.5 safety factor to calculate resistance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchoring and foundation systems to higher design forces in Wind Zones II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and III;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Manufacturer's design and details for a permanent foundation system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (certified by a registered professional engineer or architect) applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each manufactured home design; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Shortened period for implementation of the standards after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship to Energy Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 25, 1993, the Department published a final rule amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include preemptive standards significantly upgrading the existing energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation requirements (58 FR 54975) (Energy Rule). The effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that rule is October 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several of the provisions to be affected by the Energy Rule are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the rule published today. Because of the earlier effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those provisions in today's rule, the Department will publish technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments to the Energy Rule, before the effective date of that rule, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also will reflect the new requirements imposed under today's rule. In some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor instances, the changes adopted in today's rule already include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that otherwise would have been imposed upon the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Energy Rule. Those changes are identified further in the section-by-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section analysis later in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Problem To Be Addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each year significant damage to manufactured housing is produced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straight winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Damage is primarily in the form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof failure, loss of roof diaphragm material, connection failures, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tiedown/foundation failures. The most predictable areas for wind damage to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured housing are those subject most directly to hurricanes. Last year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki provided dramatic examples of the destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faced by housing in hurricane-prone areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

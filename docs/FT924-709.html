			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Income plan broker is fined Pounds 25,000 FIMBRA, the insurance brokers' regulator, yesterday imposed a fine of Pounds 25,000, one of its biggest, on a broker that had specialised in risky 'home income plans' for the elderly. Such plans involve taking out a mortgage and using the proceeds to invest in a bond that aims to pay the mortgage interest and provide an income on top. The company, Aylesbury Associates of Bromley in Kent, has not traded since July last year when its membership was suspended. It quoted pensioners annual growth rates of between 15 per cent and 25 per cent, far in excess of prevailing regulations. They were not achieved and many clients were forced to sell their homes after the bonds fell in value. Aylesbury was declared in default by the Investors Compensation Scheme in March, and about 250 clients have applied for compensation. More than Pounds 1.1m in compensation has been paid to 49 clients. Aylesbury's Fimbra membership has been terminated. Aylesbury had arranged re-mortgages with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, whose customers were also directed to Aylesbury if they wanted to borrow more money than was available under C&amp;G's own equity release loan. The fine for Aylesbury follows fines of Pounds 10,000 on Acorn Finance and Pounds 20,000 on Fisher Prew-Smith, which were also required to pay Fimbra's costs - often more than the amount of the fine. Solicitors for clients of Aylesbury doubted whether Fimbra's move would help investors.</p>

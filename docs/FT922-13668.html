			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / BAe arms subsidiary buys Astracompany ROYAL ORDNANCE, the armaments subsidiary of British Aerospace, has consolidated its hold on the UK munitions business by buying BMARC, the largest trading arm of Astra Holdings, which went into receivership two months ago. The purchase is understood to involve a payment of just under Pounds 10m, which will go to paying Astra's Pounds 50m bank debt. The agreement announced yesterday comes after a week of negotiations by the receivers, Cork Gully. Royal Ordnance won the deal over several bidders including the French state-controlled arms company Giat Industries and an attempted management buy-out. BMARC, based in Lincolnshire, makes guns and ammunition. Astra bought BMARC for Pounds 35m from Swiss arms company Oerlikon-Buehrle in 1988. Astra was put into receivership on February 3, and BMARC the following day, after the failure of a five-bank consortium to agree on restructuring Astra's debt. The acquisition is expected to come under scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading as it will make Royal Ordnance the sole UK supplier of medium-calibre ammunition, but the group will defend it on the grounds of the Ministry of Defence's policy of encouraging international competition for procurement contracts. The purchase is expected to increase Royal Ordance's estimated share of the world market for medium-calibre guns and ammunition from 7 per cent to 13 per cent. BMARC, which has continued to trade since receivership, is expected to have sales of about Pounds 25m this year. Royal Ordnance said Oerlikon-Buehrle had agreed to continue licensing arrangements covering a range of products and collaboration on future projects. BMARC - formerly British Manufacturing and Research Company - was set up before the Second World War by the British government and Hispano Suiza. Oerlikon-Buehrle bought it in 1971. Astra purchased the company as a main plank of an ambitious plan to become a competitor to Royal Ordnance as a munitions supplier. But it had to contend with interim arrangements guaranteeing Royal Ordnance a large share of Ministry of Defence purchases. Astra announced a Pounds 3.5 pre-tax loss for the six months to September 30. Cork Gully said Astra still had substantial assets in US companies as well as its other main trading subsidiary, the pyrotechnics company Haley and Weller.</p>

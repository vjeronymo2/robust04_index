			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DAY OF REVENGE FOR PANAMANIANS;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATION: EXPATRIATES DISPLAY VIOLENT FANTASIES, BUT SECURITY IS PERVASIVE  OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE.  </P> <P> Many of them told of fantasies of killing Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. Shooting him  between the eyes. Or tearing him limb from limb. Or maybe just getting in a  good punch or spitting into his face.  </P> <P> It was an angry crowd, even in triumph. "If I were to see Noriega, I wouldn't  know what to do, I would need a rifle so bad," said one of them, Carlos  Vallarino, a 35-year-old laborer.  </P> <P> In this city so heavily populated with Latinos, only about 7,000 are  Panamanians. Thursday was their day of revenge. Scores of them circled the  Federal Courthouse downtown, where Noriega -- the man they call "Pineapple  Face" -- was to be arraigned on the ninth floor.  </P> <P> Security was pervasive. U.S. marshals peered into the crowd from rooftop  perches. Police on horseback trotted up and down the surrounding streets. Squad  cars rolled past, sometimes 10 in a row.  </P> <P> Inside, in a basement holding cell, Noriega awaited his first day in court. "I  just want to get one look at him and tell him a few things, that he's an  assassin . . . and that he destroyed our country," said Jose Clement, 25, a  student two years in exile.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Makeshift Placards  </P> <P> But the crowd did not get even a glance at its villain. Instead, the people  stood in small groups, waved makeshift placards and submitted to the  questioning of reporters -- themselves a horde that outnumbered even the  Panamanians.  </P> <P> Miami, as so often before, is the site of a major news story. This time,  however, the city has done little to merit the notice; it is merely the place  where the Noriega charges were filed.  </P> <P> Hundreds of journalists descended. "There are more satellite dishes here now  than there were for the Pope," said Xavier Suarez, the city's mayor. A parking  lot across from the courthouse was filled entirely with TV trucks.  </P> <P> Only a few dozen reporters were permitted into the arraignment; 100 or so  others milled about in a closed-off street, peeking into each others' note  pads, like high schoolers cheating on an algebra final.  </P> <P> From time to time, the crowd provided a tidbit. Once, someone suddenly shouted  "Kill him!" and people began to run. A phalanx of police were pushing a young  Latino toward the nearby Greyhound bus station.  </P> <P> The man was Jose Cepero, a Cuban-American, and the police were ushering him to  safety. He had dared to raise a sign saying "U.S. Hands Off Panama," and the  crowd turned on him.  </P> <P> "I believe Noriega should be penalized," Cepero said as he was hauled off,  trying to clarify his views. "I just don't think the U.S. military should have  gotten involved."  </P> <P> An hour later, the crowd also turned on a drunk who shouted something contrary  to the prevailing mood. Police rushed him away, too.  </P> <P> "It would be better to get our hands on Noriega, but anyone even a little  pro-Noriega will have to do for now," said Silvio Cordoba Quinonez, who had  joined the chase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Celebrating Begins  </P> <P> The celebrating here had begun late Wednesday, as a crowd of 200 clustered  outside the gates of Homestead Air Force Base, about 25 miles south of Miami,  to await Noriega's arrival aboard a military C-130 transport.  </P> <P> No one got a look at him then, either, but the vigil turned into a festive  street party anyway. People placed Noriega-style sunglasses on pineapples and  held the eerie faces aloft. Finally, they smashed the fruit on the pavement.  </P> <P> The plane bearing Noriega touched down in the early morning hours, but he spent  only minutes at the Homestead base before being sped to the courthouse in a  12-car motorcade. The automobiles zoomed into the building's garage in the  darkness of pre-dawn, but some bystanders managed a look.  </P> <P> Mayin Correa, an exiled Panamanian journalist, said she saw Noriega hunched  down in the car, turning away from the lights of the cameras. She will never  forget how he hid his face. And how it pleased her.  </P> <P> "You cannot call him a leader any more," she said. "He gave up like all  dictators, as a coward."  </P> <P> Times researcher Anna M. Virtue contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Polish row over shipyard sell-off A POLISH government decision to suspend the sale of the Szczecin shipyard, at the behest of President Lech Walesa, has provoked strong protests from local unions. Mr Walesa made the move after meeting Mr Marian Jurczyk, the leader of the radical Solidarity 80 union, which wants the yard to be privatised through an employee buy-out. However, the Solidarity union and the local branch of the former communist OPZZ have criticised Mr Jurczyk's proposals and back the original privatisation plan. The shipyard is one of Poland's most successful enterprises. The original plan involved the sale of 30 per cent of the yard's equity to its domestic creditor banks and 30 per cent to the 5,000-strong workforce. A further 9 per cent would be sold to management and 10 per cent would go on public offer. Last year, the yard negotiated a reduction of its near 2,000bn zloty (Pounds 73.3m) debt. Poland's Bank Handlowy has also opened a three-year Dollars 110m (Pounds 71.4m) credit line for the yard. Sales last year reached over Dollars 180m, with the yard, which receives no subsidies, breaking even. Cuts in delivery schedules and low labour costs have made it competitive on the German market, where it is supplying 60 per cent of medium-sized container vessels. The yard's managing director, Mr Krzysztof Piotrowski, called the government's decision 'tragic'. The yard had hoped to establish an 'industrial group' modelled on Japanese giants such as Mitsubishi or even Kvaerner, the Norwegian shipping group. Kidder Peabody, the US investment and brokerage house, has been appointed by Poland as its adviser on restructuring the country's Dollars 12.1bn commercial bank debt. Negotiations on the debt are expected to last until the end of the year.</p>

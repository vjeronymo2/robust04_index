			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets softened yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a moderately small shortage in its money market operations. Short sterling futures also rose slightly, reflecting the prospect of lower interest rates, following rumours of a co-ordinated cut in rates at next month's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. In the sterling cash market, most interbank rates ended the day a shade lower. 1-month money ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent, down  1/8 per cent on the previous day's close. Everything from 2-month to 9-month Libor ended at 10 per cent, compared to 10 1/16 per cent for 3-month money on Monday night. The softening of period rates came as the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 650m in the morning, a figure which the market deemed to be rather small in comparison to the record shortages that it had to cope with last week. In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 300m, which was later revised to Pounds 500m. In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 512m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 650m before taking account of the morning operations. The Bank then purchased Pounds 159m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Short sterling futures rose yesterday after reports that an unnamed International Monetary Fund official had suggested that next month's G7 summit would see a co-ordinated interest rate reduction. In the morning, the September short sterling contract put on 4 ticks to rise to a high of 90.36. But it later slipped back to close at 90.34, after Japanese officials made clear that a cut in the discount rate is unlikely for the present. The closing rate for the September contract suggests that 3-month Libor in September will be at 9.66 per cent. One analyst suggested that the market's slowness was due to uncertainty about this Thursday's Bundesbank Councilmeeting, which will once again consider a change in interest rates. He suggested that sterling rates could soften further if the German central Bank decides not to raise rates.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Smith aims for party consensus on Europe MR JOHN SMITH, Labour leader, must this week steer a perilous policy course aimed at reconciling the widely divergent views on Europe within his party while maximising pressure on the government. Even before the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty was known last night, his officials were preparing the policy options to be presented to the shadow cabinet and Labour's national executive committee on Wednesday. The conclusions that are drawn in the next 48 hours will have a crucial bearing on Mr Smith's ability to keep the party united and to inflict the maximum damage on the government in Thursday's Commons debate on the economy. If he succeeds, he will go to the party conference in Blackpool next week in triumph. But if the wrong tone is set, there is a danger that Labour will suffer the kind of public in-fighting over Europe that is dogging the Conservative party. In recent weeks, the new party leader has faced mounting criticism from some colleagues for not keeping open the option of a sterling devaluation and a British referendum on the future of the Maastricht treaty. A growing lobby - including three leading shadow cabinet members - is now privately claiming that it has been vindicated by the debacle in the foreign exchange markets last week that saw the pound eventually suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism. Yesterday, however, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow heritage secretary and the most prominent dissident, was waiting for the verdict of the French vote. Senior party officials were insisting, however, that Labour continued to oppose a referendum on the ground that the issues were best dealt with by parliament. In addition, it was too early to give a definitive view on how the Opposition should respond to the highly volatile economic outlook, including the future of the ERM, that would be strongly influenced by the French poll. One senior shadow cabinet minister predicted, however, that Labour's likely posture would remain more European than that of the government. 'I don't think we will be ready to make the same volte-face as them,' he said. Mr Smith is aware that he must woo the Euro-sceptics. While out-and-out opponents of the European Community are now a rump within the party, Labour's so-called soft left, including the Tribune group, are growing more vocal in their demands for wide-ranging changes to the Maastricht agreement. In particular, they want to see more democratic accountability imposed on a European central bank and other Community institutions. They are also arguing that the criteria for economic convergence - required before monetary union - should include social goals such as a Continent-wide effort to cut unemployment.</p>

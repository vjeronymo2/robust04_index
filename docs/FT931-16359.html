			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Observer: Holiday gossip Hard to believe, but Lancashire seems set to become the holiday capital of Britain. Admittedly, Blackpool doesn't attract the trippers like it used to, and Southport and Morecambe have seen better days. But when it comes to organising the holiday business, Lancashire is where it's all happening. Airtours' Pounds 221m bid for Owners Abroad is just the latest example. David Crossland, Airtours' 46-year-old chairman who works out of a refurbished mill near Pendle Hill, left school with hardly an O level to his name. Today, he is worth over Pounds 100m and carving up the package holiday industry in much the same way as the cotton magnates of yesteryear used to divide up the empire. A few miles down the road at Chorley, Trevor Hemmings runs Scottish &amp; Newcastle's fast-growing leisure division which owns Center Parcs and Pontins. Hemmings started as a builder's apprentice in Leyland and is now worth over Pounds 100m, tied up mainly in S&amp;N shares he took when he sold Pontins. Richard Atkinson, founder of Manchester's Eurocamp, is not yet as wealthy as the other two but then he started later. So what's the secret? Crossland, anxious not to be compared with fallen leisure superstars, like Sir Freddy Laker or Harry Goodman, stresses that unlike them he has 'stuck to his last' and brought in professional managers. Anything else? 'It's a lot colder up there,' jokes Crossland.</p>

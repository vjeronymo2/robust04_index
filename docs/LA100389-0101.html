			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS JOURNAL PUBLISHER TO HEAD AUSTRALIAN VENTURE  </P> <P> Donald L. Keough, publisher of the Los Angeles Business Journal and a key  player in the development of more than 20 local business newspapers around the  country, has resigned to head a business publishing venture in Australia.  </P> <P> Keough also resigned his post as senior publisher for CBJ Associates, the  partnership headed by Kansas City real estate developer Larry Bridges that owns  the Los Angeles Business Journal, the San Diego Business Journal, and -- since  last month -- the Orange County Business Journal.  </P> <P> Tom Link, associate publisher of the L.A. Business Journal, has been promoted  to publisher, and he said he expected few changes: "We're on such a growth  trend it would be silly to change anything -- our goals were 100% growth over  last year's advertising sales, and we're on that type of track."  </P> <P> No successor has yet been named to assume Keough's responsibilities as senior  publisher for the three CBJ papers in Southern California. In that capacity,  Keough had been helping to overhaul the Orange County paper and searching for  the synergies that he believed lay in having a chain of weekly business papers.  </P> <P> In Australia, Keough will head Regional Business Newspapers Ltd., a new company  that will initially launch a weekly business paper in Brisbane. The company is  backed by Lloyds Bank and private investors, and Keough said he would hold a  25% to 30% equity stake in the firm.  </P> <P> The company will use U.S. city business journals as models in an effort to  build up a chain of publications in Australia and then elsewhere on the Pacific  Rim. Keough was the key editorial talent behind the growth of the American City  Business Journal chain, and he still remains the owner of the San Francisco  Business Times.  </P></p>

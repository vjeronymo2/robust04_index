			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CIRCUS AS ART  </P> <P> Regarding "The Circus as Serious Art" (Dec. 11): Just what qualifies a circus  to be compared to ballet or opera as "art"? No singer or dancer is beaten or  tormented to do totally unnatural acts; no one forces an artist to perform.  </P> <P> The animals forced to do acts that violate nature and their dignity are not  given a choice. I hate circuses because of the suffering, physical and  emotional, the animals endure.  </P> <P> BEATRICE J. SIMPSON  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WORLD OF SHOCK AND AFTERSHOCK;  </P> <P> CHINA: BRUTAL SUPPRESSION  </P> <P> As dawn broke Sunday, a Chinese tank rolled over a luminously white statue of a  woman, her two arms holding a symbolic flame above her head, that had stood for  10 days in the heart of the capital. It is said on Beijing's campuses that the  tank also crushed to death 11 students who had linked arms in a protective  circle around the statue, a figure they called "minzhuzhishen" the goddess of  liberty.  </P> <P> It was a week of indescribable horror for the citizens of Beijing, for the  people of China. The jubilant if weary weeks of pro-democracy protest were  truncated by the tanks and machine guns of China's leadership which, the world  now knows, responded to yearnings for a freer society, with mass slaughter.  This massacre, an act instigated by the brutish primal instincts of a Communist  leadership honed not by debate but by discipline, not by compromise but by  diktat, not by persuasion but by force, has profoundly, and in many ways  indelibly, changed modern China.  </P> <P> In the past decade, volumes have been written depicting China as a nation that  had found itself, a nation that had escaped the devastation of the Cultural  Revolution and was emerging as a society with values and virtues approaching  those of the West. China was becoming a stable, modern country, one that  recognized the need to adhere to international standards of behavior  economically, as well as the more basic humanitarian principles accepted as an  essential component of a civilized society.  </P> <P> Much was done to bolster this image by the United States. In recent years,  visits by U.S. officials, from the President down to mayors of small cities,  encouraged this perception of a China at ease with itself and the world.  Foreign companies looked gleefully at this newly emergent respectability and  fought each other to invest here. Modern hotels sprang up like stands of new  pine. Their restaurants served Chateau Lynch-Bages and goose liver pate. The  U.S. ambassador routinely hailed the stability and wisdom of the leadership to  American reporters, insisting at every occasion that periodic bursts of  repression were anomalous twitches of a maturing polity.  </P> <P> At every turn, suggestions that there were fundamental contradictions between  China's modernizing process, one that favored free markets and  entrepreneurialism, and the rigidities of a Communist Party weaned on  totalitarianism were contemptuously dismissed.  </P> <P> China's students, in those weeks before the tanks thundered down the Avenue of  Heavenly Peace, shared that optimism, that sense that there was no turning back  to the black years of repression and hopelessness. China was becoming more  open, they said repeatedly. In classrooms, students skimmed Karl Marx but they  poured over Adam Smith, Walt Whitman and Sigmund Freud. "There is nothing we  cannot read. There is nothing we cannot write. There is nothing we cannot say,"  a Chinese professor said some months ago. And the students were reassured by  their leaders, doddering men who had learned their politics on the battlefield,  that yes, China would never retreat.  </P> <P> That conviction, that feeling that history's momentum would carry them forward  to a China of genuine liberties and freedoms, guaranteed not by the promises of  self-anointed leaders but by the institutions they created, spurred tens of  thousands of students to demand those rights, and lured hundreds of thousands  of Beijing citizens to follow. If, in their heart of hearts, they suspected the  Communist Party was, in the end, immutable, they never allowed those fears to  surface.  </P> <P> But China's leaders, the senior ranks of the Communist Party could not tolerate  demands on it, demands to loosen its grip once and for all upon the lives of  the Chinese people. Some among the leaders -- former party Secretary Zhao  Ziyang is the one most often cited -- seemed more sympathetic to the students,  but the men who controlled the levers of power, the army, the police, the vast  propaganda apparatus, refused to countenance this challenge to their authority.  </P> <P> The days of marches, the hunger strikes, the encampments on Tian An Men Square  were not, they determined, peaceful petition and protest. This was  counterrevolution. This call for democracy and freedom was a threat to the  survival of the Communist Party itself. And of course, these leaders were  right.  </P> <P> Even as the tanks rumbled into Tian An Men Square, their headlights  illuminating the frail line of unarmed students who stood determined and  frightened before them, there were flickering signs that some in the army, some  in the party, would never stomach the slaughter of civilians. But these voices  of moderation were stifled by the rattle of assault rifles, the clatter of  cartloads of bodies frantically being pushed to overburdened hospitals, the  determination that military dictatorship was preferable to reasoned discourse.  </P> <P> In the days that followed the carnage, underground student presses continued to  churn out broadsheets describing the army's massacre and urging the people of  Beijing, as one put it, "never to forget this blackest day in China's history."  </P> <P> But the army had retaken the city, its buildings and squares, its avenues and  marketplaces. Every night, the crack of automatic weapons fire echoed through  deserted streets as army patrols imposed the new reign of terror. In the  neighborhoods of Beijing, residents would point to ugly dark stains on  sidewalks. "An old man was killed here," a fearful neighborhood resident would  say, "shot in the head."  </P> <P> And now, within the last few days, the army and armed police have turned their  attention in earnest to the instigators of this "counterrevolution" -- the men  and women of China's universities and scholarly institutions, the people who  had fashioned China's intellectual resurgence, its resurrection from the  systematic tyranny over the mind that endured until a mere decade ago. Columns  of troops swept into the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the home for some  of the country's most progressive thinkers -- men such as Yan Jiaqi, Su Shaozhi  and Liu Zaifu -- and began a systematic search for "evidence" of  counterrevolutionary activities. The military occupation of the city's  universities, now nearly drained of terrorized students, is imminent.  </P> <P> There is little question what China will look like in the coming months and  years. Ideas will be displaced by empty slogans, discussion by silence, hope by  fear, humanity by violence. Many, many people will be arrested. Public trials  will be held and executions will be touted as "victories" in the struggle  against counter- revolution. The best of China's minds will be shackled by a  repression this country once experienced during the Cultural Revolution, but  the world ignored.  </P> <P> This time, graphically, the world has seen what China's leaders really are and,  for China, the world will never be the same.  </P> <P> But the men at the apex of the Communist Party and the army simply do not care  what the world sees. That China's economic growth, tied increasingly to  international trade and investment, will be set back a decade or more is  irrelevant to leaders whose sole concern is the preservation of armed power.  That China will no longer sit at the world table as a respected member of the  international community matters not one wit to men for whom the grinding  poverty of authoritarianism is preferable to an affluence of pluralism.  </P> <P> What Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun and Li Peng have won, though, is a victory of  generals, a victory of occupied territory, of secured street corners and  recaptured monuments. What they have not won, what they cannot win, what they  have lost forever, are the hearts and minds of the Chinese people. Two enormous  banners on the gate posts that flank the entrance to Beijing University put it  succinctly: "It is not that the people have no government, it is that the  government has no people."  </P> <P> The soldiers armed with assault rifles that march through that gate will never  see that banner -- the advance wave of party zealots have had it effaced. But  its message will linger for years. Indeed, in the darkest days of repression  yet to come, there will remain vivid memories of the murderous rampage let  loose by China's leaders, and more, the memory that there were better days  before and there may be some still ahead.  </P> <P> A university student riding his bicycle through the war-torn streets of Beijing  pedaled quietly for a while before speaking. But when he spoke, his words,  colored by the tragedy of the week, told of a deeply rooted certainty that the  Chinese people would overcome even this calamity. "There must be blood to have  democracy," he said. "In Chinese history, there has always been blood."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DID VIEW SHAPE ROOS' BILL ON LAKES?  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos, who has allied himself with Los Angeles  residents fighting a proposal to cover 10 open reservoirs and build filtration  plants at five others, is eloquent on the subject of the city's artificial  lakes.  </P> <P> Roos (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill designed to block the city's plans  because the reservoirs are "more than a part of the water system," he said.  "This is the heartbeat of a community, where people chose to live because of  that heartbeat."  </P> <P> He has firsthand experience to back him up. Roos is planning to build a  2,700-square-foot home on an ivy-covered hillside with a commanding view of  Silver Lake, where the water department may build a filtration plant on four to  six acres along the shore.  </P> <P> County land records show Roos bought the land in August of 1988 for $164,000.  He has told neighbors he wants to build a Mediterranean-style house for his  family there. Periodically, he visits the property and inspects the panorama.  </P> <P> "You could think, 'Gee, that's a coincidence,' " said Sam White, who lives  across the street from Roos' lot. "Or you could think he's trying to help the  whole district."  </P> <P> Roos said Tuesday, after the bill passed its first Assembly committee hearing,  that he "thought long and hard" about introducing a measure that could benefit  the value of his property. "I live in Silver Lake very much because of the way  the lake is now," he said.  </P> <P> Roos said that in January, about six weeks before he introduced the bill, he  obtained a legislative counsel's opinion that he would not face a  conflict-of-interest charge with such a bill because he would not have any  greater advantage than other residents near reservoirs.  </P> <P> "I've lived in that community 20 years," said Roos, who lives in a condominium  over a hill from the reservoir. "I haven't had a view of the lake. But the lake  has been a part of my pulse. I'm not a Johnny-come-lately."  </P> <P> Officials from the city Department of Water and Power say the covers and  filtration plants are needed to keep trash, animal waste and carcinogens from  the water supply.  </P> <P> But the reservoir proposals have drawn fire from Pacific Palisades to Elysian  Park. Homeowners' groups, including the Silver Lake Residents Assn., have  formed a coalition to fight the plans. Residents who live near the reservoirs  say that covers could ruin their views and attract vandals, while filtration  plants could be ugly and noisy.  </P> <P> Critics say the water department has not considered alternative measures that  might have less drastic impact on the nature of their neighborhoods. And they  question the need for such measures, because water officials have said the  city's water is safe to drink now, though it may not meet new state and federal  standards expected to be issued later in the year.  </P> <P> Roos' bill would name all public open reservoirs a "public resource" and  require that any alteration or addition "should preserve the recreational and  the scenic and aesthetic values of the reservoir."  </P> <P> The director of the state Department of Health Services would also be  prohibited from ordering that any public reservoir be drained or covered  "unless no other alternative . . . is technically feasible."  </P> <P> The bill was approved Tuesday on a 7-2 vote by the Assembly Water, Parks and  Wildlife Committee. The Ways and Means Committee also must consider the bill  before it reaches the Assembly floor. Roos did not mention his property at the  hearing.  </P> <P> No opponents testified at the hearing, though a city water department lobbyist  said the department may raise concerns at later discussions of the bill. Ellen  Stern Harris, executive director of the Fund for the Environment and an  activist on water issues, spoke in support of the measure, saying, "We need not  choose between clean water and a beautiful environment."  </P> <P> Ronald McCoy, assistant chief engineer for the water system, said department  representatives have met several times with Roos staffers on the reservoir  issue. Roos also called a press conference last week at Silver Lake to discuss  his bill, against a backdrop of residents wearing aqua-colored ribbons that  they said stood for "blue water."  </P> <P> Told of Roos' plans for a house overlooking Silver Lake, McCoy burst into  laughter. "I didn't know that," he said. "I was not aware of that."  </P> <P> One other state legislator, Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), has become  involved in the issue. Polanco has delayed hearings on a bill he authored that  would require the water department to compile a citywide environmental impact  report, rather than individual reports on each reservoir. McCoy said department  officials would like to do just that, but must first discuss it with the Board  of Water and Power Commissioners.  </P> <P> Polanco's district includes Elysian Reservoir, which is in Elysian Park. The  water department would like to install a metal roof over the reservoir there.  </P> <P> Pasternak reported from Los Angeles and Wilson from Sacramento.  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Accounting move may help small companies Hundreds of thousands of smaller companies may escape the requirement to follow existing accounting standards, under radical proposals being drawn up by the profession. Preliminary recommendations to exempt smaller companies from certain standards were drawn up by a working party created by the Accounting Standards Board. They were announced at the annual conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales held in London yesterday. The findings follow widespread calls that generally accepted accounting principles are primarily drawn up forbig companies but must also be followed by smaller companies. Under existing practice, all of the UK's 1m limited companies must obey the accounting rules laid down in law and produced by the board, although many are less relevant and more costly for smaller companies to follow. Ms Danielle Stewart, a partner with Warrener Stewart and a member of the working party, said: 'Financial reporting is all about communication, and I do not believe the communication value of small or private company accounts is improved by the addition of a myriad of disclosure requirements and complex accounting treatments.' She argued that compliance with accounting standards could only be justified when in the public interest - which meant they should apply only to quoted companies or others with substantial public interest. Smaller companies believed the requirement to comply with accounting standards often made their accounts more unintelligible, she said. The working party, which was set up under the auspices of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, representing the leading six professional bodies, is still considering the threshold below which companies would be exempt.</p>

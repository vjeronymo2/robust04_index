			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ ALL ABOUT IT;  </P> <P> FROM ONCE-OBSCURE ASIAN CUISINES TO CLASSIC FRENCH TO THE LASTEST GRAIN CRAZE,  THE VARIETY OF COOKBOOKS AVAILABLE FOR GIFT GIVING SWELLS AS CHRISTMAS  APPROACHES. TO HELP CULL THE BEST FROM THE REST, THE TIMES' FOOD STAFF HAS  REVIEWED THE YEAR'S MOST INTRIGUING COOKBOOKS.;  </P> <P> BERRIES: CULTIVATION, DECORATION AND RECIPES BY MARY FORSELL (BANTAM BOOKS:  $35, 256 PAGES, 200 PHOTOGRAPHS).  </P> <P> There's a lot to be said and done with berries, nature's most cherished food  and adornment. An accomplished writer on gardening and design, Mary Forsell  says it all and more in this lusciously illustrated book. This complete  compendium on the little round fruits covers a wide range of berries -- from  the most common eating strawberries, raspberries and blackberries to their  wilder, or more exotic cousins like lingonberries, cloudberries and extends  farther to berry bearing plants like the pepper berries, holly and rose hips  for ornamental applications.  </P> <P> Gathered from chefs around the country, all the recipes provided make  wonderful, not forceful, application of the berry. Presented with  mouth-watering photos, there's red raspberry tart studded with golden  raspberries from Julia Orenstein of Pacific Heights Bar and Grill in San  Francisco, grilled duck breast with raspberry sauce from Tom Grego of Ventana  Inn in Big Sur, a tangy blackberry chutney from Oouida Dorr. Forsell shares  design techniques to achieve a professional look in berry decorations. She  illustrates how dazzling wreaths, bouquets, topiaries and garlands can be  created by mixing berries with foliage, grapevine, flowers, herbs and other  natural elements.  </P> <P> The book also has a chapter on berry gifts, discussing preserving and drying  for potpourri and bouquets, and storing edible berries for jams. Another  section features cultivating a berry patch as well as designing your garden. A  source information chapter provides an extensive list of suppliers of berry  plants, jams, jellies, decorations and delicacies. MINNIE BERNARDINO  </P></p>

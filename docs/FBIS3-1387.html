A man was shot in the leg, allegedly by  sniper fire, in Jeppe Street at about 8.15 AM as a group of  between 10 and 15 marchers moved down the main CBD [central  business district] thoroughfare in the rush-hour traffic. As  the group was between Delvers and Von Weilligh Streets between  eight and 10 shots rang out. Pedestrians on the pavenments fled  into the nearest doorway or building entrance and within seconds  of the shots being fired the normally busy street was deserted  for the entire block.    One man was wounded in the leg and a motorist, Lawrence  Mavundla -- a priest at the nearby St Mary's Cathedral, had a  narrow escape as a bullet pierced the radiator of his car.    In Commissioner Street at least three people were wounded  when a larger group of marchers travelled down the main street.  Two women and a man were shot outside the Kine Centre as the  marchers approached the giant office and cinema complex. A  policeman at the scene said they were most probably shot by  shopkeepers anxious about destrution of property and looting.  Two of the wounded, a man and a woman -- both shot in the leg,  managed to get to the Market Street entrance to the Smal Street  mall -- a block away. The third, a middle-aged woman, was  loaded into an ambulance in Commissioner Street with unknown  injuries.    When another group of 400 marchers came down Commissioner  Street about six heavy-calibre shots rang out at about 9.30 AM.  As the group marched down the streets informal sector hawkers'  kiosks were robbed.    In Jeppe Street, handfuls of traditional weapons -- heavy  sticks, home-made spears and iron pipes -- were found near the  scene of the shooting and handed to the police. The weapons  were dropped after the burst of automatic gunfire which wounded  one man.    People living in flats in Delvers Street around the scene of  the shooting crowded on balconies to see what was happening as  shop owners closed their doors to barricade themselves in.    Stores and banks in the Smal Street mall were being closed  and evacuated in the wake of the early morning city unrest. A  staff member at the branch of the Allied Bank in the mall, where  a man was to have been treated for a gunshot wound, told SAPA:  "If you want anything, ask head office -- I'm out of here. We  have evacuated the place."</p>

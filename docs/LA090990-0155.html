			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF PERSONNEL AT NIXON LIBRARY  </P> <P> On Aug. 8, Daniel C. Tsang wrote to inform your readers of errors in the way  items in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace were labeled. "The National  Archives would not have committed these faux pas," he concluded.  </P> <P> In fact, since we have not yet hired our curator and recognized that we needed  the assistance of a professional to complete the gift displays, we contracted  with a curatorial specialist -- from the National Archives and selected by the  National Archives -- to oversee all labeling and display of gifts and  artifacts. That individual worked long hours to complete the job, and we are  grateful both to her and to her employers.  </P> <P> But the only substantive error Mr. Tsang pointed to was, in fact, made by the  National Archives. He is certainly entitled to his harsh opinions about our  exhibits, but they should not have impelled him to make correspondingly harsh  and misinformed judgments about the library's staff.  </P> <P> I am proud of what they have accomplished to open the nation's first  non-taxpayer-funded presidential library and birthplace.  </P> <P> HUGH HEWITT  </P> <P> Executive director  </P> <P> Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace  </P></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Smith &amp; Nephew loses Pounds 148m on sale Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare products maker, has closed an unfortunate chapter in its history by selling its worst performing business, Ioptex, for Pounds 11m - about Pounds 150m less than the Dollars 236m it paid for it in 1988. S&amp;N will take an exceptional charge against 1994 profits of Pounds 148m, not far short of last year's pre-tax total of Pounds 171m. Ioptex, which makes eye implants, is being sold to Allergan, of California. As a Pounds 141m goodwill write-off was made against reserves at the time of the Ioptex purchase, shareholders' funds will fall by only Pounds 7m. The share price was barely changed at 159p yesterday. S&amp;N said the sale would 'modestly enhance earnings (before exceptional items) by replacing a small current loss with interest earnings'. The proceeds from the sale will reduce gearing from about 4 per cent to almost zero. The company is due to announce first-half results on Thursday. Forecasts are for about Pounds 90m pre-tax on sales of more than Pounds 500m. Ioptex makes lens implants used in eye surgery. Its profits collapsed in 1990 when the US government changed the rules on paying for intra-ocular lenses, its main product. In 1993, it had sales of Pounds 27m, profits of Pounds 200,000 and net assets of Pounds 18m. In the first half of 1994, it lost Pounds 1m. Mr John Robinson, S&amp;N's chief executive, said yesterday that Ioptex was the only one of the company's businesses to be losing money. It was ripe for disposal because 'it clearly didn't fit'. It was the only acquisition to which S&amp;N had failed to add value. Among other things, Ioptex needed specialist sales staff that did not fit with the company's other product lines. Mr Duncan Moore, analyst with stockbroker Morgan Stanley, said that the Ioptex purchase had been 'a poor investment' which the company had been expected to sell. 'What's happened today is primarily an accounting issue,' he said. 'We knew about the magnitude of the goodwill write-off.' For Allergan, best known for its contact lens fluids, the deal strengthens its position in the intra-ocular lens market. Allergan was the first company that S&amp;N approached, said Mr Robinson. Talks took 'four to five months' with other companies also expressing an interest. S&amp;N has not made an acquisition as big as that of Ioptex since 1988. Instead it has signed collaboration agreements such as that with California's Advanced Tissue Sciences to improve cartilage surgery. Lex, Page 16</p>

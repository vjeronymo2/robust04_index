			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Hong Wen (3126 2429): "Experts Say If China's </F> MFN Status Is Revoked, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Foreign-funded  Enterprises Will Suffer Most"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 12 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Whether  or not China's most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment will be  renewed will be announced in a couple of weeks. Economic  experts point out that if this treatment is withdrawn, it goes  without saying that both China and the United States will suffer  losses. However, those who will really suffer most will be the  Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign investors who have set up  production bases on the mainland. That is why these experts  predict that if the United States genuinely has its eyes on a  development strategy in the Asia region, it will certainly not  revoke China's MFN status rashly.    Dr. Chen Wen-hung, director of the China Business Center at  the Hong Kong Polytechnic, told this reporter that the trade  dispute between China and the United States is, in the final  analysis, a trade balance issue. However, the principal  beneficiary is not China, but foreign investors who open  factories on the mainland and export their products to the  United States using the mainland's export quotas. Most of them  are manufacturers from Hong Kong and Taiwan.    According to the press, the net export value of Hong Kong,  Taiwan, and other foreign-invested enterprises increased  substantially by 45 percent in 1993, which accounted for nearly  28 percent of the country's total export value. It is  anticipated that this proportion will rise to 40 percent this  year. Chen Wen-hung pointed out that China's export growth last  year was basically achieved by relying on foreign-invested  enterprises. Hence, he believes that if China loses its MFN  status, Hong Kong and Taiwan investors will suffer most.    According to a World Bank estimate, if the United States  revokes MFN status for China, the volume of Chinese manufactured  goods exported to the United States will fall by 25 to 50  percent. These are mostly goods produced in mainland China by  Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers. A report from the Hong Kong  Trade Department shows that, under these circumstances, China's  re-export volume to the United States through Hong Kong will  fall by 33 to 46 percent, and Hong Kong profits amounting to  $2.4 to $3.4 billion will be lost. As a result, Hong Kong's  economic growth rate, which has previously been estimated at 5  percent, will be reduced by 2.2 percentage points to 3 percent.  According to an analysis of Tang Ying-yen, vice chairman of the  Federation of Hong Kong Industries, calculated on a per-capita  basis, Hong Kong will sustain the heaviest blow.    As regards Taiwan, according to Taiwan customs statistics,  the proportion of re-export trade between both sides of the  strait in terms of Taiwan's total foreign trade has risen by 2  percent annually in recent years. Li Chien, managing director  of the Hong Kong Taipei Trade Center, said that most of  re-export goods were industrial raw materials, components,  accessories, and so on, a considerable proportion of which are  re-exported to foreign countries after being processed in  mainland China. Among the 100 largest enterprise groups in  Taiwan, nearly 60 of have invested or plan to invest in the  mainland.    In view of the extremely serious impact on Hong Kong and  Taiwan because of the issue of China's MFN status, relevant  experts believe that in consideration of political and economic  factors, the United States, which has shifted its strategic  focus to Asia, will certainly not revoke China's MFN status  rashly.</p>

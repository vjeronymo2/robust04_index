The workers' delegation was received by  representatives of the parliament deputy groups and the Minister  of Health and Social Politics Iliaz Sabriu also joined the  meeting later on.    After the talks the workers from insolvent firms decided to  postpone the general strike until next Tuesday, thus leaving  additional 8 days for the Government to meet their demands. If  no solution is offered by then, the workers announced massive  protest marches.</p>

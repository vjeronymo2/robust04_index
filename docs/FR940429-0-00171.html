			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to public comment, the following sections have been removed from these regulations: proposed &sect;668.16(i) that provided that an institution that serves significant numbers of students with special needs must have and implement plans for providing students with information about how to meet their needs; proposed &sect;668.16(j) that would require institutions to have procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student complaints; proposed &sect;668.16(l), requiring that certain information be made available to students; proposed &sect;668.16(m) that required that an institution have advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that accurately reflect the content and objective of the educational programs offered at the institution; proposed &sect;668.16(o) which addressed the issue of outstanding liabilities; and proposed &sect;668.16(r), which proposed consideration of completion, placement and pass rate standards. The specific reasons for the removal of these provisions are discussed in the section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that addresses administrative capability (&sect;668.16).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, proposed &sect;668.16(k) that requires that an institution: (1) demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of the program and occupational entry level requirements and (2) establish the need for the training has been moved to the program participation agreement section (&sect;668.14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.16(j) has been amended to specify that the significant problems identified in reviews of the institution that the Secretary will take into account in determining administrative capability, relate to the administration of Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;668.16(s), which would have made an annual cohort default rate of 20% in the FFEL programs and a 15% default rate in the Federal Perkins Loan Program immutable standards of administrative capability, has been modified in these final regulations in &sect;668.16(m) as follows. The Secretary accepted commenters' arguments that it would be more logical to use a 25% cohort default rate for the FFEL programs over a three-year period. Further, the Secretary has specified in this section of the regulations that if an institution cannot be determined administratively capable solely because the institution fails to comply with this section, the Secretary will provisionally certify the institution in accordance with &sect;668.13(c). An institution will have the right to appeal noncompliance with this provision by submitting an appeal in accordance with &sect;668.17(d). The Secretary has amended &sect;668.17(c)(6) to specify that this standard will not apply to tribally controlled colleges, HBCUs, and Navajo community colleges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, the Secretary has amended &sect;668.16(l) to provide for the use of net enrollment figures, after deduction of students who were entitled to a 100 percent refund, in the calculation of withdrawal rate. In addition, the Secretary has now restricted the calculation of withdrawal rates to withdrawals of undergraduate students. The Secretary believes that the undergraduate enrollment pattern is an adequate measurement of an institution's ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.17&blank;Default Reduction Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with statute, &sect;668.17(c)(6) has been amended to extend the exemption of historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs), tribally controlled community colleges, and Navajo community colleges from the provisions of &sect;668.17(c)(1) to July 1, 1998. Section 668.17(c)(1) addresses the loss of participation in the FFEL programs for institution's with cohort default rates above the specified thresholds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.17(f) which addresses Federal SLS Program participation has been deleted since the Federal SLS Program is no longer in existence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.22&blank;Institutional Refunds and Repayments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.22(a)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(i), (g)((2)(iv), (i)(1)(i)(B), and (i)(2)(iii) have been revised to reflect that a student who has taken an approved leave of absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of Title IV, HEA program refunds and repayments. This change has been made to ensure the treatment of leaves of absence is consistent for all Title IV, HEA programs. The Federal Pell Grant Program regulations consider a student on a leave of absence to have withdrawn for purposes of receiving Federal Pell Grant Program funds. This was inconsistent with the FFEL programs regulations, which allowed an institution to consider a student on a leave of absence to still be enrolled. The FFEL programs treatment of leaves of absence remains in effect, but only for in-school deferment purposes, not for purposes of Title IV, HEA refunds and repayments. All Title IV, HEA programs will now treat a leave of absence as a withdrawal for refund and repayment purposes. Corresponding changes have been made by removing the language addressing leaves of absence in proposed &sect;668.22(i)(1)(ii), (i)(2), and (i)(3)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.22(a)(2) has been amended to clarify that the institution must provide refund examples to students only upon request, and must inform students of the availability of these examples in the written statement of its refund policy. The language proposed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM was unclear and implied that the required written refund statement must include the refund examples themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.22(c)(2) and (f)(2)(ii) has been amended to include allowable late disbursements of unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans and loans made under the FDSL Program when calculating a student's unpaid charges. This language has also been changed to allow for the inclusion of late disbursements of State student financial assistance, provided the State in question has a standard written late disbursement policy which the institution follows in calculating unpaid charges and provided the student is eligible to receive the late disbursement in spite of having withdrawn. If an institution chooses to count a late disbursement of State student aid in this manner, the institution will be liable for any amount not disbursed within 60 days after the student's withdrawal. If the late disbursement of State aid does not come in, the institution must recalculate the Title IV, HEA program refund and return any additional amounts required to the appropriate Title IV, HEA program accounts or to the lender within the applicable regulatory deadlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The February 28, 1994 NPRM proposed that certain fees could be subtracted from the refund due under a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation. This treatment was consistent with previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> guidance given under the FFEL programs. The February 28, 1994 NPRM pointed out that, as proposed, the calculation included the fees in the institutional costs, allowed the institution to retain a prorated portion of those institutional costs, and then allowed the full amount of those fees to be subtracted from the resulting refund. The resulting ``double-counting'' allowed the institution to retain more than the actual fees that were charged. In response to commenters that supported the elimination of such double-counting, &sect;668.22(c)(4) has been revised to allow an institution to exclude certain fees from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund calculation so that the most an institution would be allowed to retain is 100 percent of an institutional charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

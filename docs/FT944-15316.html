			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / DTI may reform Whitehall pensions The government is considering replacing final salary-based pension benefits for civil servants with less costly personal pensions, it was revealed yesterday. The allegations were made by Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, who obtained a leaked copy of a letter from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The letter, addressed to Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, and circulated to cabinet members, said Mr Heseltine's department would 'look at the issue of portable/personal schemes'. The move comes as the government faces growing embarrassment over its failure to control the mis-selling of personal pensions. Up to 500,000 people may have been wrongly advised to transfer out of sound occupational schemes into personal pensions. While personal pensions are deemed beneficial for the self-employed and for those who change jobs frequently, they are considered less advantageous for those who stay in the same job longer. The letter also says that the Department of Trade and Industry is considering selling off the administration of its own employees' pension scheme. This is in spite of a 1992 report from the Treasury's Efficiency Unit which concluded that the scheme is administered as efficiently as any in the private sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Yong-ku] </F>   [Text] The visit of Choe Kwang, chief of general staff of  North Korean People's Army, to the PRC may well be one of its  regular exchange visits between the two countries, but the visit  is attracting great interest due to the situation and the timing.    Noting that North Korea and the PRC have exchanged military  delegations almost every year, some people think it is not a new  factor of tension. During the past two to three years, the two  countries have intensified military cooperation more than ever.  A North Korean military delegation of functionaries of the  Foreign Affairs Bureau visited the PRC on 28 February this year.  When, delegation leader Major General Kim Hak-san, director of  the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the North Korean Army, met on 2  March with Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the PRC  Army, interests were focused on their "submarine deal" but  nothing concrete was revealed.    However, the majority of the public find analyzes the visit  to be unusual because the delegation is being led by General  Chief of Staff Choe Kwang, and because of the significance of  its timing.    It is suspected that Choe Kwang's trip is a move to prepare  for "an emergency on the Korean peninsula" since he is the one  who controls the general command of "military operations" under  the Supreme Commander and Chairman of the National Defense  Committee, Kim Chong-il.    Even more significant is the North Korean military  delegation's visit to the PRC in a situation where the UN  Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency are  discussing sanctions on North Korea and in which North Korea  announced that sanctions would be regarded as "a declaration of  war" for which it is willing to risk war. This seems to  illustrate the close military cooperation in North Korea's  defensive position concerning the nuclear issue.    Military cooperation between North Korea and the PRC is  significant enough to worry the ROK and the United States under  circumstances where it is uncertain whether the PRC will join in  the UN Security Council's decision to implement sanctions on  North Korea.    While no concrete results are expected to be announced after  the military exchange, as in previous military delegation  exchanges between the two countries, it is not difficult to  speculate that the two parties will assess the effect of  sanctions on the situation of the Korean peninsula and discuss  joint measures to cope with this.    So far, there are no signs that the PRC regards the  situation  on the Korean peninsula as a military emergency. However, it is  highly probable that the PRC will convey the message that "the  development of nuclear weapons is impossible under any  circumstances" during the face-to-face meeting with North Korean  military leaders because the PRC has strongly opposed North  Korea's nuclear weapons development.    On the other hand, since the treaty of friendship,  cooperation, and mutual assistance (military alliance) between  North Korea and Russia was actually invalidated during President  Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia, North Korea is expected to  repeat its intention to maintain and reinforce the treaty of  friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the PRC.</p>

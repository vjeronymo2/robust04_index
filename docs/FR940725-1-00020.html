Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. In a prior Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this docket 58 FR 53169, October 14, 1993, the Commission requested comment on whether it should establish a general cap on the amount of commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) spectrum for which an entity may be licensed in a particular geographic market. The purpose of that proposal is to ensure that no CMRS provider will exert market power by controlling large amounts of spectrum in a given geographic market. Additionally, the Spectrum Cap Notice sought comment on rules for administering a spectrum cap, if the Commission adopted a spectrum aggregation limit. The Spectrum Cap Notice invited comments on whether the Commission should apply personal communications services (PCS) spectrum aggregation and cellular-PCS cross ownership attribution standards, adopted in the Broadband PCS Order, to a general CMRS spectrum cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On June 13, 1994, the Commisson released an Order reconsidering and clarifying the rules for broadband PCS. The Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order retained certain limitations on the amount of PCS spectrum that can be obtained in any geographic service area. Generally, an entity may acquire attributable interests in a maximum of 40 MHz of licensed broadband PCS spectrum. Parties with attributable cellular interests, however, may obtain only 10 MHz of licensed broadband PCS spectrum if the population in the cellular service area overlaps 10 percent of the population in the relevant PCS market. In addition, after January 1, 2000, entities with attributable cellular interests may acquire an additional 5 MHz of broadband PCS spectrum, for a total of 15 MHz of PCS spectrum in their cellular service areas. The Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order also specified certain interests that the Commission would consider attributable interests in order to determine the maximum amount of PCS spectrum for which an entity may be licensed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On June 29, 1994, the Commission adopted an Order establishing competitive bidding procedures for broadband PCS. The Commission adopted a ``Competitive Opportunity Plan'' in the Broadband PCS Auction Rules Order, under which ``entrepreneurs' blocks'' are established as a means of fulfilling the statutory mandate to ensure that businesses owned by minorities or women (or both), small businesses, and rural telephone companies are provided with full opportunities to participate in providing broadband PCS services. The Competitive Opportunity Plan,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> establishes installment payment plans for applicants eligible for entrepreneurs' block licenses, and also establishes a system of bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities or women (or both). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The purposes of this Second Further Notice is to explore whether the Commission should consider additional non-equity relationships to be attributable interests for purposes of applying the 40 MHz limitation on PCS spectrum, the PCS-cellular cross-ownership rules, or a more general CMRS spectrum cap. In addition, we seek comment regarding whether any attribution rules we adopt in this proceeding should apply differently depending on whether the applicant or licensee involved is a designated entity. We also seek comment regarding how much non-equity relationships should be construed in the context of determining whether the designated entity has de facto and de jure control of the licensee. Finally, commenters should address how such relationships in the designated entity context balance the need to allow designated entities to attract needed expertise, capital and infrastructure while avoiding the creation of fronts or shams. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

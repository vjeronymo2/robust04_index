			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INJURED TEACHER PAINED BY SUSPENSION  </P> <P>  "She's an excellent teacher, the best. We've learned so much from her." --  Hana Ogawa, Palos Verdes High School Art Club co-president.  </P> <P>  "She is the best teacher I have ever had." -- Tisha Treherne, Palos Verdes  High School art student.  </P> <P>  "She has consistently been an excellent teacher with high standards and has  the respect and admiration of all her students and colleagues." -- Beth Glavas  and Sara Hackenberg, Advanced Placement art students at Palos Verdes High  School.  </P> <P> </P> <P> These accolades for 57-year-old Chizuko de Queiroz, a teacher for 27 years in  the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, sound as if they might have  been delivered at a testimonial or her retirement dinner.  </P> <P> Instead, the words are from a petition, signed by more than 200 students,  asking the district to give de Queiroz back her job. More than 70 faculty  members have signed a separate petition protesting "the callous way Mrs. de  Queiroz was removed from the classroom" and praising her "outstanding"  accomplishments.  </P> <P> De Queiroz, who has been chairman of the art department at Palos Verdes High  School since 1980, said she was told at a meeting with district officials on  March 31 that she could not continue in her $43,000-a-year job because of a  shoulder and back injury she suffered on the job in 1983.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decided to Fight  </P> <P> At first she tried quietly to get her job back, but when that met with no  success she decided to fight.  </P> <P> "Finally, I realized it doesn't work to just sit back and meditate and hope  everything will work out," she said.  </P> <P> "It was a real blow when they said I couldn't return to work because of this  1983 injury," de Queiroz said, pacing nervously as she talked to a reporter at  her Palos Verdes Estates home earlier this week. "If they had done this back  then, maybe I could have accepted it."  </P> <P> District officials have declined to comment on the case, saying that it is the  district's policy not to publicly discuss personnel matters.  </P> <P> De Queiroz said that when she showed up at the March 31 meeting, she was given  a copy of a letter -- which would arrive at her home later that day -- from the  district's insurance carrier stating that continuing to teach "places you in  danger of seriously reinjuring yourself."  </P> <P> She said the administrators gave her three choices: training for a non-teaching  job, early retirement or disability retirement. De Queiroz said that when she  objected, Assistant Supt. David Capelouto and Personnel Director George  Hardesty mentioned a fourth possibility: dismissal. She is scheduled to meet  with district officials Monday to further discuss her options.  </P> <P> In an interview Thursday, Jeff Younggren, president of the Palos Verdes  Peninsula Unified School District Board of Education, said that generally in  worker's compensation cases, the school district has to abide by the advice of  its insurance carrier. Noting he could not discuss the details of her case, he  added, "It is not that the district is unfeeling or insensitive . . . but we  can't afford to lose our coverage."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hired Attorney  </P> <P> De Queiroz said that after several weeks of unsuccessfully trying to persuade  district officials to let her go back to school, she hired an attorney and  started lobbying members of the community.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize how difficult it would be to have to stay home at this time  in the school year," she said, brushing aside a tear. "I have been frenzied to  think I couldn't be with my students at this most important point, as they go  into their Advanced Placement exam." De Queiroz said that for the last two or  three years, she has been working closely with about 30 students who will earn  10 units of college credit if they pass their Advanced Placement examination  next Thursday. With the examination fast approaching, "they needed me," she  said.  </P> <P> The March 27, 1989, letter to de Queiroz from the insurance carrier --  Tustin-based Greenfield-Thompson Associates -- stated that a medical  examination by Dr. Ray Craemer "indicates that you may not be able to return to  your usual employment because of your 4/28/83 job injury."  </P> <P> The letter states that "Your job duties exceed your medical restrictions, and  returning to these duties places you in danger of reinjuring yourself." Tom  Blake, claims manager for Greenfield-Thompson, declined comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Annual Checkups  </P> <P> De Queiroz said that Craemer had checked her annually since 1983 and certified  her for work every year until now.  </P> <P> She said she sees no reason why he should change his opinion. She has submitted  to the district letters from her physicians, John E. Stratton and Luis A. Chui,  stating that she is able to work as long as she avoids heavy lifting.  </P> <P> "I believe she can continue her work as a teacher as she has done the past  years with job restrictions, specifically no lifting over 15 pounds and no  repetitive bending, stooping or lifting of any type," Stratton said in an April  19 letter to Hardesty.  </P> <P> Chui said in an April 24 letter to Hardesty: "I see no medical or neurological  contraindications for her to continue her job as an art teacher."  </P> <P> De Queiroz's 1983 injury occurred when she lifted some lightweight materials  for an art project at school. Within a few days, she returned to work, treating  her condition with regular physical therapy.  </P> <P> In 1986, she won a $25,800 worker's compensation award, which she receives in  $130-a-week increments. She said she uses the money to hire household help on  tasks she can no longer perform because of her injury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Occasional Relapses  </P> <P> De Queiroz said that at work and at home, she has been careful to avoid  movements that would exacerbate her injury, but occasionally she suffers  relapses and has to take brief periods off from work. She has been paid by  worker's compensation during those absences.  </P> <P> In the past year, she said, she was out of work 10 or 12 days due to her  shoulder, with the most recent absence of seven days in January.  </P> <P> Although officials blame the after-effects of her injury, de Queiroz said she  wonders whether her suspension may have been prompted by a lengthy dispute she  had this year over the district purchasing her art supply order at retail  rather than wholesale prices as she had recommended.  </P> <P> As a matter of principle, she said, she criticized officials for exceeding her  department budget by $500. Finally, the funds were restored to the department  March 27, she said, but it was a short-lived victory.  </P> <P> Four days later, de Queiroz said, she was removed from her job. Until then, she  said, she had no inkling she was to be relieved of her duties.  </P> <P> Over the years, de Queiroz has scored numerous accomplishments, and her  scrapbook includes several clippings from the school newspaper detailing awards  to her and her students. She was a finalist in the district's Teacher of the  Year contest in 1984, and was nominated by the school administration in 1985  for the Bravo Award for excellence in fine arts. In 1984, 1986 and 1987 her  students had winning entries in the U.S. Congressional District Art Contest.  </P> <P> "She is a very gifted teacher," said Lauren Sanders, executive director of the  Palos Verdes Faculty Assn., the union representing district teachers.  </P> <P> In a letter demanding de Queiroz's immediate reinstatement, Sanders said that  to suspend or dismiss de Queiroz the district would have to follow specific  procedures in the state Education Code. "This has not been done," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, should the district consider de Queiroz disabled, federal  and state rehabilitation laws "expressly prohibit the denial of employment  because of a handicap."  </P> <P> De Queiroz said that all she wants to do is to return to her students.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize how much I would miss them," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Telecom leaves Tokyo wary of over-supply - The Japan Tobacco listing is likely to be another casualty Not only has last week's listing of Japan Telecom, the country's third largest telecommunications operator, left investors sitting on losses, but it has also triggered worries among investors towards future initial public offerings. As a result, the biggest casualty is likely to be Japan Tobacco, which floats more than Y900bn worth of stock next month. What worries investors is that together with Japan Telecom, the listing will inject more equity into the market than investors can handle. The concern is that the Telecom listing has come at a time when underlying confidence has been weakened and the supply and demand situation has deteriorated. Such worries stem from continuing sales of shares by companies and banks, which want to spruce up their profits ahead of half year book closing at the end of the month. Another concern is that overseas investors, the biggest buyers in the stock market rally earlier this year, have started to question valuations of Japanese shares. Banks have been especially active in the half-year end selling spree this year, partly due to recent weakness in the bond market. As fund procurement rates have risen in tandem with the increase in long term interest rates, profit margins have been squeezed. The stagnant demand for loans has also prompted lower profit margins as some banks have been forced to 'dump' loans to companies. The decline in profits from loans, as a result, has forced financial institutions to turn to the stock market for profits. On the demand side, domestic institutions, which were expected to come back to the market earlier this year, have remained cautious, although public pension and insurance funds have been pumped into the market by the government to support prices. Some blame the high valuations of stock prices, while others argue that the chances of a triple dip in the economy are still high. The reversal in sentiment among overseas investors has been the fundamental factor in the weakness in demand. Foreigners were the main buyers of Japanese stocks due to expectations of a recovery in earnings and the economy. However, many fund managers have lost their patience over the lack of movement in prices, especially with a price/earnings ratio of more than 90 times for the Nikkei. 'Foreigners who started buying shares around 16,000 are questioning the extent of the recovery discounted into current share prices,' says Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel. He adds that European and US investors are once again looking to shift to the US and markets in south east Asia. While earlier this year many overseas investors were expecting a sharp earnings recovery due to restructuring and the fall in depreciation costs, opposition to this theory is asserting itself. Mr Alexander Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley who is forecasting a mere 8.3 per cent rise in profits for the current year to next March, argues that the effects of cost cutting will be muted since Japanese style restructuring still frowns on aggressively cutting overhead. He maintains that since depreciation only accounted for 3.27 per cent of non-financial companies' sales in 1987 and 3.60 per cent last year, it can hardly be the main reason for the profits plunge, while a decline in depreciation over the next few years does not necessarily point to a sharp recovery in corporate earnings, as some foreigners had hoped. However, analysts are divided on the outlook for corporate earnings. Mr James sees a 15 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits for the current business year and expects companies to revise their profit projections upward in the coming earnings announcement season in November. Some investors seem to agree with such views and stocks that are usually active at the start of the earnings cycle have started to move. Basic materials such as steels, cement and paper have gained ground and could receive a further boost later in the cycle as commodity prices rise. Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, believes that foreigners, many of whom made the mistake of selling their holdings last autumn, do not want to take the risk of making the same mistake again. He says there is a historical case for not selling now. Looking back a few decades, investors in the Tokyo market who have bought in November and sold in May have seen far higher profits than those who have bought in May and sold in October. Meanwhile, fears over Tobacco persist among many investors. The bear argument over the negative impact of the two JTs triggering another downward spiral is supported by Nikko Research Institute, which claims that share prices are placed under extreme pressure when equity financing by listed companies is greater than 15 times the average daily turnover. The extra injection of funds from the two issues will raise a total Y5,700bn, substantially more than 15 times the current daily activity. Mr James says, however, that investors, who have learned their lesson from the East Japan Railway fiasco last year, have been selling futures to hedge their portfolios ahead of the Tobacco listings, prompting arbitrage unwinding. The Tobacco flotation on October 27 will not cause the market to plunge like last year's JR East listing, and could eventually trigger a rally. Although the Nikkei index is likely to move in the 19,000-20,000 range over the next month, share prices are likely to recover in November, as hedging in the futures is unwound by institutions and with the expected spate of upward earnings revisions following the listing.</p>

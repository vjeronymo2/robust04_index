			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAMMER OUT AGREEMENT ON FUNDS  </P> <P> The city and school districts of Escondido, overcoming the last hurdles in a  bitter battle over redevelopment funds, will vote on a proposed agreement  within two weeks, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We have met to clarify the last two major issues, and the agreement will be  sent to our respective boards in final draft within two weeks," said Jim Lund  of the Escondido Union school board after a meeting attended by two members  from each of the two school boards and the city councils.  </P> <P> The agreement, whose precise wording has yet to be hammered out by attorneys,  ends a four-year battle, including a lawsuit filed by the schools last May  against the city.  </P> <P> In dispute has been when the elementary and high school districts will begin  receiving their share of the tax-sharing redevelopment agency funds, projected  to be $1.4 billion over the 45-year life of the agency.  </P> <P> School officials had claimed that they were due over $1.6 million in revenues  from the agency, but city officials disagreed.  </P> <P> Mayor Jerry Harmon said the settlement includes $3 million to be divided among  Escondido Union, Escondido Union High and the county schools in lieu of office  space that they were entitled to in a yet-to-be-built regional office building.  </P> <P> The Community Development Commission, the arm of the city that administers the  redevelopment program, also will delay repayment of a $15-million loan from the  city, instead funneling those funds to the schools as early as 1991, Harmon  said.  </P> <P> "The schools would be receiving money long before the year 2000, which  initially would have been the time frame if the city had demanded that it be  paid back first," Harmon said.  </P> <P> The last sticking point dealt with property-development taxes, an issue that  the board and council members agreed in principle to separate from the  discussion of redevelopment funds, Harmon said.  </P> <P> "We're working in harmony in meeting the needs of the community as opposed to  battling each other," said John Laing, a member of the Escondido Union board.  </P> <P> Laing declined to specify when the agreement would go to a vote of his board,  saying that detailed wording of the agreement has yet to be worked out.  </P> <P> "We're not committed to a time frame as much as we are to getting an accurate  document," Laing said.  </P> <P> It was misunderstanding of the precise wording of the redevelopment plan that  first led to the conflict between the schools and the city.  </P> <P> The redevelopment agency, which was created in 1985, froze assessed property  values and property taxes within a district, and as the city developed,  property tax revenues that exceeded the frozen level went to the city-run  redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> The school districts are entitled to nearly two-thirds of the revenues that go  to the redevelopment agency, after certain conditions have been met.  </P> <P> The school districts had claimed that those conditions -- which include funding  for the building of the new City Hall and the city's proposed cultural arts  center -- had been met, but city officials disagreed.  </P></p>

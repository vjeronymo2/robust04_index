The Ministry had received a list, very close to one sent  last  month by a private defense institute, of arms and equipment that  it was willing to include in such a deal on Jan. 19, they said.    To make the offer formal, Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin  sent a signed letter with it, they said.    Talks are expected among Foreign, Defense and Finance  Ministry officials to decide whether Russian arms are compatible  with Korea's current weapons and to weigh the pluses of Moscow's  proposal.    Seoul agreed on 3 billion U.S. dollars in aid to Moscow but  delivered only 1.47 billion dollars and suspended the rest after  the collapse of the Soviet Union.    When Shokhin was visiting the Taejon Expo last year, he  suggested that his country pay back the loan in military goods.</p>

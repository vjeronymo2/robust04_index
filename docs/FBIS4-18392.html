			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Bang Nielsen: "EU Skeptical as to Danish </F> Job-Creation Reform"]    [Text] The Danish reform of the job market is far from  solving Danish unemployment problems, according to a EU  [European Union] report concerning the Danish economy.    Even though the Danish labor market reforms and the new  annual leave system have considerable merit, they will not  permanently solve Danish unemployment problems, according to a  report on Danish economic conditions written by the EU  Commission.    "The system of unemployment compensation and the entire  social welfare system overall are behind many of the structural  problems in the Danish labor market system," it says in the  report.    The advantages of the Danish labor market reforms, according  to the EU report, are that the unemployed are forced back into  the labor market at an earlier stage than before. However,  Denmark needs to go farther in liberalizing its labor market  system, the report says.    In general an optimistic note is struck concerning the  Danish  economy. As an open economy, Denmark has the best opportunity to  take advantage of the integrated European economy and thus lower  unemployment, according to the report.    Should the EU be expanded to include the other Nordic  countries and also open closer economic ties to the East  European and Baltic countries, Denmark's role as an investment  target for foreign companies will increase. As regards domestic  consumption, the EU does not see any great opportunities for  growth. The Danish economy will grow in future years due to  growing Danish exports, according to the report.    The weakness of the Danish krone on the European currency  market, however, will continue to create problems for the Danish  economy. For years Denmark's real interest rate has been much  too high (that is, the real price of borrowing money after  making adjustments for the effect of inflation) compared to the  strength of the Danish economy, according to a survey in the  report.    If the currency rate of the Danish krone is to be maintained  relative to the German mark, that will necessarily be harmful to  the growth of the Danish economy, it is stated.</p>

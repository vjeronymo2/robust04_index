			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Robinson to quit as American Express group chief executive MR James Robinson, embattled chairman and chief executive of American Express, the US travel and financial services group, yesterday said he would resign as chief executive next year, as soon as a successor had been chosen. He would not be drawn on whether he will also surrender the position of group chairman. Mr Robinson denied that he was being forced out because of losses at the company's credit card business, reduced profits and pressure on its stock price. He claimed he had never wished to serve more than 15 years in the job. However he agreed with some recent criticisms of his management by Wall Street analysts. Mr Robinson made the announcement after Fortune magazine issued a press release foreshadowing a story which claimed the resignation had been dictated by the American Express board 'in a quiet coup' that began last September. Members of the board, which includes Mr Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, closed ranks immediately after the Fortune story was announced. Mr Rawleigh Warner, former chairman of Mobil, yesterday denied reports he had led a boardroom coup. Mr Frank Popoff, chief executive of Dow Chemical, said that to characterise Mr Robinson's departure as a coup was 'totally inaccurate." Mr Robinson said he told the board of his plans for succession in September, the day before a board meeting. 'I said I did not want to stay on past the age of 60 and that it was time to develop the succession process. We had a good, long and rigorous discussion about succession at the board meeting the next day,' he recalled. Mr Robinson, who is heading the search committee, said, however, that he would probably leave the chief executive's post during 1993, when he will be 58.

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / So far, so good - but so fragile: There are hopes for Russia's economic progress, but only a few The progress of Russian economic reform is as fragile as the first strand of a spider's web. It can so easily be destroyed, and perhaps will be as early as this week, when the Sixth Congress of Russian Peoples' deputies meets to debate where Russia now stands. The announcement last week of a Dollars 24bn aid package from the Group of Seven countries was timed to bolster reform with proof of western intentions: 'a decisive signal of political and economic support', according to Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. A signal it is, but not decisive: western aid, even on a large scale, is marginal so long as the economy, and the main actors within it, do not respond to the new climate that the government is struggling to create. For those, inside and outside Russia who wish for its success, there is little to say that is optimistic. But there are some important signs of hope. The economic strategists within the Russian cabinet, headed by Mr Yegor Gaidar (now clipped of his finance portfolio), are committed reformers - the first and so far the only group of this kind to emerge from under the rubble of the Soviet Union. However they arrived at their present liberalism, they hold to it strongly - so strongly that even orthodox western economists murmur that they are over-rigid. Unlike earlier economic reformers who could not, or were never given the chance to, reform, they pursue change without falter or excuse. They have liberalised most of the prices of commodities, and intend to raise energy prices soon, grasping a stinging nettle where previous administrations under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev had only gingerly tugged at it. In so doing, they have established the essential precondition for market relations and cut into the vast 'rouble overhang' of unspendable roubles in banks or below the bed. The Russian Central Bank has stemmed the flow of the automatic credit extended to enterprises - with the result that these latter have racked up more than Rbs600bn of unpaid bills and loans, and are screaming to be bailed out. Mr Gaidar held out for more than two months: 'Our policy of restructuring is aimed precisely at denying credits to those who should be thrown on to the market as quickly as possible,' he said in a recent interview. He will have to loosen now: credits of between Rbs100bn and Rbs200bn are already agreed for agriculture and industry. But he said last week: 'None of this means a retreat.' Last week, the Gaidar team scored a notable success in persuading the International Monetary Fund's executive board to admit Russia into membership with a quota of 3 per cent, thus allowing it to borrow up to Dollars 4bn when it becomes a member - probably at the end of this month. The IMF had been originally minded to keep them to a level of 2.5 per cent, and the extra half a percentage point means much in terms of prestige, if less in terms of resources. Most importantly for their own survival, they have so far had the solid support of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the central prop of its politics - a support he repeated yesterday in a speech to followers. Mr Yeltsin is always described as a populist: certainly, he is piling the pressure on his cabinet to deliver something tangible in the way of a better life. But, so far, he has not criticised them in public: in contrast, he has openly patronised his carping, nationalist-inclined deputy, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, who had set himself up as a foe of 'Gaidarism'. So far, so good: but so good, so precarious. The indicators remain stubbornly awful. The government's own forecasting unit expects production to drop further, between 25 and 30 per cent this year: oil production to go down by 14 per cent, or 64m tonnes. Mr Gaidar himself predicts 6m unemployed in the same period. The forecasting unit expects prices to go up by 10 or 11 times by the end of this year over the previous one. Hard currency of about Dollars 20bn has fled the country, leaving the Russian government - and the other post-Soviet states - with almost none. Western bankers and governments are resigned to not receiving any of the principal due on the Dollars 70bn foreign debt of the former Soviet Union for up to a decade - and are presently not receiving any interest, either. The nature of the crisis, however, is deeper than that: it is embedded in the structure of the society and the economy which the Russian government, like its counterparts all over the former Soviet empire, have inherited. Here, little has been done - either in the six years of Mr Gorbachev's perestroika, or in the three months of an independent Russian power. The banks and the fledgling stock markets (on which very few stocks are traded) remain hopelessly weak and dependent. Only some 20 banks are licensed to conduct foreign currency transactions and do so in (by international standards) small volumes. Roubles can be converted into hard currency and vice versa at market rates - but only at certain times, and in certain places. Even internal convertibility seems a distant dream. Nearly all property remains a monopoly of one or other level of the state. Privatisation is barely started: so far it generally comprises managers or workers or both together taking over the assets of the enterprise or shop in which they work with or without the permission of the nominal authorities. Mrs Elena Kotova, head of privatisation at Moscow City Council, resigned earlier this week, saying: 'It was pointless simply rubber stamping this process and calling it privatisation.' Privatisation by sale is unpopular: most people see it as the rich or the criminal (no strong distinction is made) getting their hands on property - indisputably true, in the short run. Thus the voices against the creation of capitalists are strong, and take on increasing moral force: Dr Boris Kurashvili, a juridical expert, told a meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences last week that 'the basis of a market economy must be collective enterprises - for which state property should be transferred to the workers'. It will take a lot of political will to push through genuine privatisation, and to face down the complaints of the majority of non-owners. However, no one believes that the large companies, responsible for the bulk of production, will soon be privatised on any system: and the heads of these  -as Mr Gaidar noted - stubbornly refuse to act in a market fashion. They have very large inventories on which they have put very high prices: rather than pull down their prices to get sales, they sit on the inventories and beg for cash. 'They do not believe the present economic reform will last,' says Mr Alexander Ruptsov, a consultant and member of the newly created Presidential Council of Entrepreneurs. 'They just carry on in the old way. If this goes on for just a little longer, there will be huge redundancies.' The manoeuvres the government is now making have been forced upon it by an unbeatable coalition of forces. Powerful voices, which claim still to support the government and whose support it needs, have been raised in the past week to say: enough. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Professor Yevgeny Yasin, his chief economist, have both made clear that more credit must be made available to their members. Mr Yeltsin, who has long tried to get Mr Volsky inside his tent but has so far failed, had to take heed: Mr Gaidar, against his wishes, had to relax his severity. This may be no more than a sensible manoeuvre in the face of opposition which cannot be faced down and social consequences which cannot be tolerated. Or it may be the first slither on a slope which spirals down to hyperinflation and industrial stasis. In either case, the view that market reform is a long drawn-out affair, during which a step forward will be succeeded by a stride backwards, is becoming common currency between the ever-widening circle of western experts and the reformers. 'Don't take the market too seriously: none of us in the west do' is the (rather confusing) message now being insinuated into the policy debate, most recently by a group of distinguished social scientists who spent many hours with the senior figures in the Russian government. The problem, say the western experts in their hotel dining rooms in the evenings, is that these people do not know real markets, only what the textbooks say. Finally, the sheer scale of modernisation required by this economy is staggering. Mr David Roche, the director of global strategy at Morgan Stanley International, recently calculated that if a reform programme were not to be abandoned mid-stream for lack of funds (worse than not being attempted), the west would need to supply each year: Dollars 18bn-Dollars 30bn in direct aid; Dollars 15bn-Dollars 50bn in rebuilding infrastructure, particularly transport; Dollars 25bn-Dollars 45bn to the energy industry to stabilise output (especially of oil); Dollars 5bn-Dollars 15bn on the modernisation of power stations; Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn on agriculture and distribution; Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn on training and welfare payments to the unemployed; and Dollars 3bn-Dollars 7bn on supplying consumer goods. This excludes money for the cleaning up of the polluted environment, and for rouble stabilisation: the total hovers somewhere between Dollars 76bn and Dollars 167bn a year. Utopian? Probably. Having announced Dollars 24bn, most politicians in the west will think they have done enough for some time. But, as Mr Roche says, foreign private capital is actually leaving, not coming to, Russia: the failure of Vnesheconombank, the foreign affairs bank, has cut off any further hard currency loans. If the west is to stay engaged, the bill will rise: if it does not pay it, say the experts, there will be one or other kind of explosion which will wreck the 'common home' of which Mr Gorbachev used to speak in his lyrical moments. This has echoes of a vast blackmail: 'Nice world you've got: pity if the Russians were to wreck it.' But they possess the potential to do just that: hence the urgency of their reform's success.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 RUSSIA: TIGHTENING THE BELT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOOD PRODUCTION PRODUCT               AMOUNT           1991         1992 (forecast) Meat               '000 tonnes        4,933         3,860 Butter                  "               722           630 Cheese                  "               390           335 Sugar (beet)            "             2,063         2,500 Conserves          Million jars       3,354         3,000 Oil                '000 tonnes        1,116           830 Flour              million tonnes        18.4          19 Cereals            '000 tonnes        2,455         2,050 Fish                    "             3,741         3,300  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HARD CURRENCY IMPORTS PRODUCT               AMOUNT           1991         1992 (forecast) Meat               '000 tonnes          849         1,086 Butter                  "               290           356 Oil                     "               696           960 Refined sugar           "             3,000         3,779 Medicines         Dollars million     2,151         1,242  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Russian government forecasts  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The decision was made in  connection with the coming into force of the law on the  principles of special control over foreign trade in commodities  and know-how on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said today.    Long-term efforts by Polish diplomacy to get free access to  advanced Western know-how scored success. This decision should  result in further improvement in Poland's economic cooperation  with states having the latest know-how, the Foreign Ministry's  Press and Information Department said.    According to the Ministry, the COCOM decision is also of  political significance, showing recognition for Poland's active  and responsible policy in the non-proliferation of mass  destruction weapons and facilitating Poland's integration  strivings.</p>

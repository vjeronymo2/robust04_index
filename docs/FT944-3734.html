			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: New York bans smoking New York City took a big step last week towards enacting one of the US's toughest smoking bans. The city council's health committee voted to approve the ban and the entire council is expected to approve it on December 21. Under the ban, smoking would be limited to the bar area in restaurants seating more than 35 people, and nearly eliminated in office buildings. It would also prohibit smoking at open-air sports arenas and zoos. Outdoor cafes must provide no-smoking areas.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Latin America: exports hit by slow pace of reforms Latin America's export performance in the last half-century has been miserable. According to Mr Moises Naim, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington and a former Venezuelan industry minister, the region's share of world exports sank from more than 12 per cent in 1950 to 3.6 per cent in 1992, the lowest this century. 'Years of under-investment, protectionism, and technological backwardness have made Latin America's manufacturing firms utterly inadequate to meet the exacting requirements of international markets,' he argued in an article in Foreign Policy journal last year. Exporters have been hobbled by poor infrastructure, high labour taxes, weak financial systems and unreliable contract enforcement. 'Most of these obstacles are slowly being removed. But the lag in the reforms crimps the international competitiveness of Latin American exporters.' New studies, for example a report published last month by the consultancy McKinsey, suggest that economic reform is helping to improve the competitiveness of Latin American companies. This is supported by trade statistics showing some shift away from traditional dependence on raw material exports, and rising exports of manufactures. Yet the rise in manufactures is often from a low base, and imports have been soaring. Poor trade figures have widened the region's current account deficit, and although this was financed easily last year by capital flows, this year capital inflows have been more uncertain - underlining the continued vulnerability of some countries in the region to payments problems. In the long term, the sustainability of these payments imbalances will hang on how the capital inflows are used. If capital inflows are financing productive capacity (as they emphatically did not in the 1970s), then exports should grow. But it is as yet unclear what proportion of the capital inflows is financing consumption and what is financing investment. The quality of investment is also unclear - though with capital importers now largely from the private sector, investment may well be more efficient than the state-driven investment of the 1970s. Even if investment is substantial, the time lags before the benefits flow through to exports and growth could leave economies vulnerable either to a financing crisis or a change of direction politically. Governments throughout the region are under strong pressure from domestic business to adopt policies to help local industry, despite the poor record of similar policies in the past, which, according to Mr Naim, did little more than 'enrich the few shareholders of companies in 'priority' industries and a few bureaucrats'.</p>

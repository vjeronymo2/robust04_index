			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Reinsurers eager for drama to become crisis: The popularity of catastrophe reinsurance means rates may fall After floods in Europe, fires in Australia and a freeze in the eastern US, last week's Los Angeles earthquake has again reminded reinsurers of the scale of the risks to which they are exposed. Yet although the final bill is not yet known, early indications show that the markets have remained relatively unscathed. Overall economic losses from the earthquake are provisionally estimated at more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), at least double the toll of the San Francisco earthquake in 1989. But with much of the damage uninsured, claims are expected to amount to no more than Dollars 3bn. Also, because two of the biggest US insurers in California - Allstate and State Farm - buy very little reinsurance, analysts expect reinsurers to pay at most only Dollars 1.5bn of that bill. Casual observers would expect reinsurers, especially those exposed to high level catastrophe losses, to be relieved. After all the string of catastrophe losses, which shook the world between 1989 and 1990, has caused considerable grief to reinsurers, especially at Lloyd's, where the impact has ruined hundreds of Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - and been one of the main factors in the market's recent problems. Yet in London, at least, some reinsurers wish that the loss could have been bigger. 'Not big enough, old boy. We needed 8 1/2 ' on the Richter scale which measures earthquake intensity, was one typical comment last week. Indeed many on the market suspect that rates are likely to fall later this year. Underpinning this ostensibly perverse rationale is a simple calculation. The catastrophes sandwiched between the European storms of 1987 and hurricane Andrew of 1992 caused losses of more than Dollars 40bn, drove many smaller players out of the market and - as the mechanics of supply and demand for reinsurance shifted in favour of the seller - led to sizeable increases in reinsurance rates. Lloyd's of London said last year that catastrophe reinsurance rates had risen by between 133 per cent (for US companies), 450 per cent (for UK companies) and 780 per cent (for Japanese companies) since 1990. In addition, insurers buying reinsurance covers have generally accepted much more risk on their own accounts, with 'deductibles', or excess points, rising by between 75 per cent in the UK and 500 per cent in Japan. This movement has transformed the underlying profitability of catastrophe reinsurance and attracted billions of dollars back into the business. Last year institutional investors pumped more than Dollars 4bn into new reinsurance ventures, based mainly in the lightly and flexibly regulated Bermudian market. More than Pounds 800m in institutional funds have been injected into Lloyd's, where Names strong enough to continue trading have also increased their commitments. Capacity at Lloyd's - the amount of premium which Lloyd's syndicates are allowed to underwrite - will increase to at least Pounds 10.5bn in 1994, compared with Pounds 8.7bn in 1993. As a result capacity shortages in the catastrophe reinsurance market have substantially eased. For buyers the recent renewal season - most US and UK insurers renegotiate their catastrophe reinsurance protections towards the end of each year - was the easiest for some time. Many brokers completed deals much earlier than in either 1992 or 1993. With more capital chasing better risks and creating what one Lloyd's underwriter describes as a 'feeding frenzy', reinsurers have found it difficult to underwrite as much business as they want. 'Last year you would have got 10 per cent of a risk. This year you will be lucky to get 6 per cent,' said the underwriter, who specialises in US business (most business in London is underwritten on a subscription basis with several underwriters writing an agreed percentage of a policy). So far rates have been firm. Indeed, according to Mr Charles Bray, reinsurance broker with Willis Corroon, many larger US insurers paid increases of about 15 per cent this year - although smaller companies buying lesser amounts of cover were able to renew at existing rates. 'There is a lot of posturing at the moment. A lot of buyers would like to see reductions in their prices but no one is giving them,' said Mr Bray. However, brokers and underwriters are expecting rates to come under pressure later this year. Japanese and Australian insurers renew their catastrophe programmes in mid-year and could be the first to benefit. 'I think rates will drop by July. The Japanese book will come under tremendous pressure,' says another Lloyd's underwriter, who expects cuts of up to 15 per cent. Mr Charles Kline, of Centre Cat, one of the new catastrophe reinsurance companies formed in Bermuda, also expects prices to fall. 'Prices will go down, probably dramatically in some cases. But whether they go down by that crucial amount which makes the business untenable, that is really an unanswered question. Much will depend on underwriters' discipline.' Increasingly analysts believe that only a very large loss will stymie these inexorable pressures. Hence the cynicism in London about Los Angeles. According to one specialist reinsurance broker: 'We may have seen the peak of catastrophe pricing unless the world starts blowing, shaking and burning again.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mayra Chirino Ochoa] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez denied that  other banks were confronting liquidity problems and reiterated  that those institutions in which the government had intervened  will resume operations on Monday.    The explanations were a result of the wave of rumors that  have arisen with respect to other financial institutions  confronting problems. According to public opinion, there is a  list of institutions facing bankruptcy that have been rejected  for intervention by the finance minister.    In brief statements to the press, the finance minister  overruled the Banking Superintendency's stance with respect to  the banks' opening again in two months time and said: "Take  notice of what I am saying, they will open [words indistinct]."    Sosa Rodriquez was also asked about repayment schedules, to  which he reiterated that up to 4 million bolivares would be  paid, as established by law, and not the 10 million bolivares  recommended by the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund  (Fogade). Nevertheless, the finance minister expressed his  confidence that account holders will not "withdraw 4 million  bolivares in one single blow."    The minister did not explain how they intend to cover the  funds once the banks begin to operate, since it had already been  reported that the funds would be obtained through a 150 billion  bolivar bond issuance as approved by the Public Credit Law,  better known as the Emergency Law, which includes a total sum of  400 billion bolivares. This total amount is intended to be  enough to reimburse 90 percent of the account holders of the  eight institutions in which the government intervened this past  Tuesday.    Finally, Julio Sosa Rodriguez was asked about the censure  vote proposed by the Radical Cause Party parliamentary bloc,  which, if supported by two thirds of the vote, would force the  minister to resign. The minister refrained from commenting,  smiled, and only recalled that a censure vote had already been  passed against Andres German Otero, an engineer such as himself.  Mr. Otero was finance minister during the first government of  former President Carlos Andres Perez. Congress is scheduled to  vote on the censure motion this coming Tuesday.</p>

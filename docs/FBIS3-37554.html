No details have been  reported so far. There are every grounds to think, however,  that St. Petersburg television is rapidly being taken over by an  international information tycoon, one of the richest Italians --  Silvio Berlusconi, who was one of the first to have launched his  commercial television network in Europe. Berlusconi's  representatives have spent the past two years working on  Petersburg chiefs starting with Mayor Sobchak. They seem to  have succeeded by finishing before other rivals who are eager to  get the Neva [St. Petersburg] airwaves. Incidentally, the  tycoon also owns the "Milan" soccer club. Does this mean they  are not going to say anything good about "Spartak" on Channel  Five?</p>

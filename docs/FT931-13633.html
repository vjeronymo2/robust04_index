			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Life business rise at Sun Alliance SUN ALLIANCE, the insurance group, announc-ed increased new UK life business for 1992 yesterday. Total annual premiums fell slightly, from Pounds 75.5m to Pounds 74.9m, while single premiums increased by 71 per cent to Pounds 556m. Annual premiums were harmed by a fall in mortgage-related endowment sales, from Pounds 19.78m to Pounds 16.47m, while single premiums were boosted by sales of pension annuities, which more than doubled from Pounds 109.3m to Pounds 288.3m. Business outside the UK was helped by the depreciation in sterling, and rose from Pounds 75m to Pounds 113m. This included a rise in annual premiums from Pounds 39m to Pounds 54m. London and Manchester Group, the life assurance group, announced a 2 per cent increase in new life business for 1992. Annual premiums fell, in line with the industry trend, by 18 per cent to Pounds 41.3m, while single premiums increased by 92 per cent to Pounds 220.3m. The company attributed the poor annual premiums figure to a significant reduction in the life broker division network, and said rising unemployment was 'likely to limit the prospects for immediate recovery in 1993'. Growth in single premiums came mainly from personal pensions and transfers from company schemes.</p>

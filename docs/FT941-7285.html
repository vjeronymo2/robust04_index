			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why the cost of dying is rising Sir, It's not just living but the cost of dying which will be outside many people's reach ('Rule change may push up funeral costs', February 22). Nor do I believe Europe can be blamed for a possible increase of Pounds 100m in our funeral costs. It is more likely the result of over-zealous interpretation by our public officials of rules and regulations made under the Environmental Protection Act. The fault lies not with Brussels but with the UK government, which has allowed the civil service far too much latitude. Nor can we wait for the passing of the deregulation bill, currently before Parliament; the bill's teeth are yet to be sharpened let alone tested. Anthony Steen, House of Commons, Westminster SW1A 0AA</p>

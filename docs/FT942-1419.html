			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Racal offshoot escapes action A subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK data communications and network services group, has escaped legal action from the Office of Fair Trading after giving assurances on its policy for supplying equipment to dealers. The OFT said yesterday that Racal Health and Safety had given the assurances to Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, after notice of his intention to start legal action under the 1976 Resale Prices Act. The company is a leading UK manufacturer of respiratory equipment and the world's biggest producer of powered respirators. The case arose after Protec (Manchester), a distributor of industrial protective equipment, complained to the OFT last summer. Sir Bryan subsequently alleged that the Racal company had breached the act by threatening to refuse to supply Protec because it was giving excessive discounts. The act makes it unlawful for a supplier to withhold goods if they are sold below a specified price, or to notify dealers of a price stated, or calculated to be understood, as a minimum price. The Racal offshoot has assured Sir Bryan that it was not company policy to notify minimum prices to its customers and that it would not contravene the act. Sir Bryan said yesterday: 'I take breaches of the Resale Prices Act very seriously. I am glad that in this case supplies to Protec were not interrupted. 'It is important that all of Racal's distributors should know that in the pursuit of profitability they are free to sell, advertise and display for sale products from Racal and other suppliers at whatever price they choose.' The OFT said legal action in such cases was very rare, and most cases were settled after assurances from the company against which the complaint had been made. Protec said last night that the threat of legal action by Sir Bryan had helped secure the future of Protec Direct, its discount direct mail operation. Mr Jonathan Prest, managing director of Protec, said: 'The success of Protec Direct has proved that the market is looking for established brand name products at low prices.'</p>

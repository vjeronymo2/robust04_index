			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Thyssen units see profits in next two years THYSSEN Industrie, the capital goods division of Thyssen, hopes to bring all of its divisions back into the black in the next two years, according to Mr Eckhard Rohkamm, management board chairman, Reuter reports from Essen. Mr Rohkamm said that if all divisions were able to remain profitable under difficult economic conditions, the company would be able to lift its sales to earnings ratio. He declined to say which companies would post a loss in the current year but said automotive supply and engineering were hit hardest by the slump in car and steel industries. Orders on hand were about DM9bn (Dollars 5.6bn) but group incoming orders would be down 10 per cent from DM8.4bn a year earlier.</p>

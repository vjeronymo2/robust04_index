			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NON-SENATOR FOR A NON-STATE  </P> <P> On Nov. 6, Jesse Jackson will be elected by voters here as a "shadow United  States senator" for the District of Columbia.  </P> <P> This does not mean that Jesse Jackson is on the verge of becoming a real U.S.  senator. For that, he would need to be elected by a state.  </P> <P> In fact, the "shadow senator" seat Jackson seeks here is designed not for  lawmaking but lobbying. The only reason District of Columbia voters are being  asked to choose two "shadow senators" and a "shadow congressman" this November  is to give the district three high-level advocates for statehood.  </P> <P> Jackson holds a much grander notion of the job, of course. He's made it clear  that from the day he is elected he expects to be treated like a member of the  United States Senate -- admission to the floor, membership in the Senate  Democratic Caucus and the right to participate in public hearings. He has no  intention of limiting his new job description to that of lobbyist for D.C.  statehood. Just like any senator, he will want to speak out on any issue,  domestic or foreign, that engages his or the nation's attention.  </P> <P> Watching Jackson pull this off will tell us a great deal about the relative  strengths of the old, coalition-built Democratic Party and the new media-built  politics of racial polarization.  </P> <P> Let's be clear on this. If the Democrats were a self-confident party in the  1990's, if they knew who they were and were willing to act on it, the whole  notion of the Senate Democratic leadership extending the trappings of  membership to a lobbyist for the District of Columbia would be ludicrous. If  Jesse Jackson were not both confident and fluent in the race-sensitive politics  of the same 1990's he would not have the chutzpah to demand these things, not  having earned them.  </P> <P> Should Jackson succeed even partially with this exasperating "shadow senator"  gambit, the spoils of victory will be great. Just seconds after we see or hear  Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell treat him like a senator, we will  probably hear Dan Rather start calling him by that title. The term "Sen. Jesse  Jackson" will be part of the nation's boilerplate.  </P> <P> Yet Jackson will not really have proved himself in public office. To win the  credential he still needs for the Democratic presidential nomination, all  Jackson has to do is to create the pretense of having won such a high-prestige  position as U.S. Senator. In reality, he will be nothing more than a  non-senator from a non-state. He will have the best of both worlds: a title  without a job and a constituency without a record to defend.  </P></p>

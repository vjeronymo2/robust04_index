			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo warns over PSBR MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night stressed that the elements in Britain's Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement attributable to cyclical factors would not automatically unwind as the recession ended. Before the Finance Bill was given its third Commons reading by a majority of 37 (311-274), Mr Portillo warned that the constraints on public expenditure agreed by the cabinet were more challenging than was realised by some Conservatives. Mr Portillo thanked those Tory MPs who had supported the government in taking the unpopular decision to extend VAT to domestic fuel, and he hoped they would also support the specific measures which would be needed to ensure that the spending totals would not be exceeded.</p>

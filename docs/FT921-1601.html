			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (22): A guide for would-be corporate leaders FRONTIERS OF LEADERSHIP by M Syrett and C Hogg Blackwell Pounds 45/Pounds 22.50, 600 pages MANAGERS are always keen to learn more about leadership. They believe it offers them the promise of greater personal success and perhaps enhanced organisational effectiveness. This belief is itself sustained by a business press which often focuses on the contribution that particular individuals make to successful enterprises. The shelves of business bookshops groan with manuals telling you how to become more like Lee Iacocca, John Harvey-Jones or other business leaders. Whether this obsession with successful individuals is really connected with organisational effectiveness usually remains untested. Here at least is a book laced with a healthy scepticism about leaders and the effects they can have which at the same time recognises the importance of leadership to organisations large and small, not least to the individuals inside them. It attempts to bring together a variety of approaches to a series of core questions: What do leaders do? Whatever it is, can it be learnt or developed? How can we recognise those with leadership potential? The contributors come from academia, consultancy, journalism and business, which inevitably means that the collection is varied in style ranging from fairly academic scholarly papers to semi-autobiographical insider accounts from such as Jan Carlzon and Michael Edwardes. It must also be said that the quality of the contributions varies considerably. There are stimulating, even provocative pieces from Charles Handy, John Harvey-Jones and Rosabeth Moss Kanter. In contrast, the entire section on leadership and creativity includes essays far too brief to develop any sustained argument or offer much practical advice. This is partly the responsibility of the editors who have pared some contributions too near to the bone. What does the book offer as insights into the often muddied water of distinguishing leadership from management? Kotter argues that we must think of these as two distinctive, yet complementary, kinds of activity. One, management, is essentially about coping with complexity, the other, leadership, is about setting a direction, or building a vision. The former uses a battery of administrative measures, - planning and budgeting, controlling and organising - while the latter is concerned with motivating, empowering and gaining commitment. Clearly, organisations need both kinds of activity and we should be cautious not to be seduced by leadership and forget the less glamorous but equally important activities of management. This argument may offer comfort to those inside organisations who feel the personal risks of becoming a leader are not for them. At the same time potential leaders are encouraged to develop and communicate their vision for the organisation or for their part of it. If this particular description of what leaders do convinces, what can we do to develop such behaviour? Part II of this book deals with a series of issues around developing leaders and placing them effectively within organisations. Conger's paper argues convincingly that qualities of leadership do not spring from a set of intricate characteristics. Rather, organisations can create processes which develop and nurture potential leaders, or they can act to discourage or even punish those who could lead effectively. Organisations which stifle creativity, punish dissent and drain enthusiasm drive leadership out of the system while those that welcome unconventional thinking and a willingness to take risks encourage it. If Conger is right, then internal processes of management development are critical for future success. Gratton usefully summarises current practices and trends in identifying high-potential individuals. However, the whole philosophy of 'fast-tracking' particular individuals is subject to withering criticism from Wendy Hirsh, who argues that such processes are usually unsuccessful and act as a demonstration for those not selected for the fast-track. An interesting alternative to this notion of a leadership cadre is explored in the contributions dealing with organisational learning. Charles Hampden-Turner and Bob Garratt are both persuasive in suggesting that it is the individuals and organisations who possess the possibility of continuous learning that are most likely to survive and prosper in a dynamic business environment and that visionary leaders 'stuck' in one mode of thinking are more of a problem than an asset. This book may thus prove useful for those intrinsically interested in conceptions of leadership and for those professionally concerned with managerial and leadership development. A number of doubts remain. We still need evidence about leadership effectiveness and we need an explanation of why we seem so obsessed by the subject. Its attraction my be a dangerous seduction. Finally, the reader is not helped by the construction of the book. There is no bibliography, not even suggested further reading; some papers contain incomplete references which makes it difficult to follow-up interesting ideas; and there is no description of several of the contributors. Nevertheless, the lure of understanding leadership will take this book on to many bookshelves.</p>

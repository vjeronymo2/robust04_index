			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Putting some numbers on David and Goliath - New stock indices that show the relative performance of large and small companies Since the 1987 stock market crash, there have been some striking differences in the share price movements of the biggest companies and their medium and smaller-sized rivals. This trend is highlighted by new Large Cap and Medium-Small Cap series which are being calculated from this week as part of the FT-Actuaries World Indices. The new indices are calculated by Goldman Sachs and NatWest Markets, who produce the World Index series in conjunction with the FT and the UK's Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. The new indices split companies in the FT-Actuaries World Indices by market capitalisation. The Large Cap series covers companies that make up the largest 75 per cent of each country's market capitalisation. The Medium-Small Cap series, covering the remaining 25 per cent, provides performance information on the medium and smaller-size companies within each country. The chart of the overall World Large Cap and Medium-Small Cap indices shows the new indices moving closely in parallel in the years immediately before the 1987 stock market crash. After that, there was a period of sustained underperformance by the largest companies. Then, from the summer of 1990, larger companies did better. From the end of that year the two indices moved sideways, in relative terms, before a pick-up in the smaller companies' index from the beginning of 1993. Although, in very broad terms, this pattern is shared by most of the individual countries that make up the World index, there are big differences in how extreme the movements have been. In the US, for example, the outperformance by smaller companies after 1987 was less than in the world as a whole, and the subsequent underperformance by this group was much larger. The relative recovery by the US Medium-Small Cap index started sooner, however, and has gone further than in the world as a whole. In Germany, smaller companies outperformed consistently throughout 1986-1990, and since then the reversal of trend has been weak. There has been little sign, as yet, of a reversion to outperformance by smaller companies. In Japan, as the chart shows, there was a brief period of outperformance by larger companies in late 1986 and early 1987. Since then, however, the pattern has been similar to that in Germany: small-company outperformance until 1990, followed by weak outperformance by larger companies, with little sign of the market switching back to favouring smaller ones. There are a number of possible reasons for differences in the relative performances of companies of different size. In general, small companies are more exposed to the performance of the domestic economy than their larger rivals, and less subject to the impact of currency movements. They are also more vulnerable to recession. Periods of localised economic hardship are thus more likely to affect small companies than larger ones. Investors have better information about larger companies, and the markets in their shares are typically more liquid. International investors, in particular, often concentrate only on the very largest companies within any individual economy, so in those markets where swings in international investor sentiment are important, this may translate into differential performance by larger companies. It is hoped to publish a weekly summary of the performance of the Large Cap and Medium-Small Cap indices in the FT, probably each Monday. Publication will start once the necessary technical arrangements have been made. Further details of the two indices can be obtained from Mark Zurack and Barbara Mueller of Goldman Sachs in New York (tel: 212-902 6777) and Symon Bradford of NatWest Securities in Edinburgh (tel: +44 (0)31-243 4258).</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television There is a lot of ambulance chasing on television today: 999 Lifesavers at 8.00 on BBC1 is followed by Blues And Twos on ITV at 8.30. And in case you still feel deprived of material about the emergency services, in Critical Eye, on Channel 4 (9.00), policewomen speak their minds about 'the gender war behind the thin blue line' and Inside Story is about a police squad hunting for stolen cars (10.00 BBC1). Radio 4 offers an enticing evening. The Document series returns with a programme about 'The Voice Of Britain', described as 'Goebbels-style broadcasts' to Egypt at the time of the Suez fiasco (7.20). That is followed by Entente Cordiale in which Sir Charles Powell, foreign affairs adviser to Margaret Thatcher, examines relations between the UK and France (8.00). In Classic Storylines PD James, famous for her own whodunnits, discusses the book often credited with being the first detective story: The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins (8.30). A new six-part drama series starring Donald Pleasence begins at 11.00: 21st Century Blues, was written by Steve Walker, who is best known for the children's series The Animals Of Farthing Wood.</p>

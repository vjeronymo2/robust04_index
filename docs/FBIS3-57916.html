Solana described the visit as very useful from all  points of view because it permitted progress to be made in the  various fields of cooperation. Before concluding his visit,  Javier Solana was received today by Tunisian President Zine El  Abidine Ben Ali, with whom he discussed matters such as  bilateral relations, the situaton in the Maghreb countries, and  the common desire to proceed toward formulas which would permit  greater security in the Mediterranean.    The Spanish foreign minister said that another component of  this visit to Tunisia was related to the peace process in the  Middle East, for which reason he had a meeting with Palestinian  leader Yasir 'Arafat.</p>

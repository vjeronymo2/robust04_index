			<p>BFN     [Text] "We will never say to Berlusconi: Either you give us  that ministry or we are not staying. We are not going down the  same path as the Northern League because they are behaving like  the old parties. We will instead ask for absolute clarity about  the program and we are sticking to our guns on this." This was  said by Gianfranco Fini [leader of the National Alliance] during  the the MSI-AN [Italian Social Movement-National Alliance]  central committee meeting.    According to Fini, the MSI and AN should be "the  government's  engine," and the government's program will have to contain clear  commitments concerning "national unity, north-south solidarity,  support for the weak, economic incentives, and a fight against  waste and party power."</p>

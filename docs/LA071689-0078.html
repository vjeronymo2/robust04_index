			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The state of Alaska wants Exxon to continue cleaning up its spilled oil during  the long northern winter and to resume cleanup operations in spring, according  to letters from state officials to the Coast Guard. Exxon wants to pull out of  Alaska in two months, on Sept. 15, according to plans submitted to the Coast  Guard, and a company official said that Exxon was going ahead with  demobilization plans. The state wants containment booms maintained at salmon  hatcheries and sensitive bays in Prince William Sound, where the Exxon Valdez  spilled about 11 million gallons March 24. State officials also want Exxon to  collect oily debris and continue shoreline cleanup, especially at heavily oiled  beaches, as long as weather permits.  </P></p>

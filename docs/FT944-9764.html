			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilts market faces a busy week, with traders awaiting a host of UK economic statistics and a potential rise in US interest rates. The prices data will the focus of most attention, with producer price details out today and consumer prices on Wednesday. The Bank of England expressed concern in its last inflation report that higher input prices (reflecting the rising costs of raw materials) might be passed through to producer output prices and then to the consumer. With October's input prices expected to show an annual rise of 7 per cent, the gilts market might take inflationary fright. Retail price inflation is also expected to edge up in October, with the headline figure rising faster than the underlying, because of the recent rise in mortgage rates. Recent statistics have pointed to continued economic strength, and Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks third-quarter gross domestic product figures, released on Friday, will be revised up to 0.8 per cent growth from the previously estimated 0.7 per cent. Whatever the UK news, the gilts market will find it difficult to escape the influence of the US. Ms Peters thinks the market would respond better to a substantial rise in rates, of say a full percentage point, which would show that the Fed is ahead of the game.</p>

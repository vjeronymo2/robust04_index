			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Le Roi malgre lui - Opera de Nantes Chabrier's comic opera Le Roi malgre lui has won an almost mythical reputation among musicians in spite of a daunting degree of inaccessibility. Revivals have been scarce, the vocal score has long been out of print. The first and only complete recording was released in 1985. Further reasons for inaccessibility are the burning down of the Paris Opera-Comique a few days after the premiere in 1887, and the notorious weakness of the libretto. Opera failures are frequently blamed on the book - rightly so in this case. This cultivated, eminently literate composer was impetuous when it came to choosing opera texts. For Le Roi malgre lui he chose an old Palais Royal vaudeville which he asked two librettists, de Najac and Burani, to turn into a comic opera. The result was so poor and so confused that he called in the poet Richepin. When Richepin gave up Chabrier himself finished the job as best as he could. He had no illusions about the outcome. There remains an ambiguity of style and tone: inside this score stuffed to bursting with marvellous music (grand opera parodies, echoes of Berlioz, Gounod and Bizet, all filtered through his own strong personality) there is surely a romantic opera struggling to get out. Chabrier himself described it as 'an operetta in fancy underwear'. One wonders how Opera North will attack the identity problem with the English version it is preparing for next season. Meanwhile Nantes, as usual enterprising and discriminating in choosing from the native repertory, has mounted its own production for four performances. But first, back to the libretto. The king in question is Henri de Valois, third son to the ambitious, scheming French Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici. Henri, longing to rebel against his formidable mama but lacking the courage to do so, does not want to stay in Poland and not all the Poles want to have him. Light-heartedly he passes himself off as his closest friend, the Comte de Nangis, who in his turn is made to play the king. Among Henri's suite is a Venetian intriguer, Fritelli, married to a Polish lady, Alexina, with whom Henry had lately had an affair in Venice - neither being aware of the other's identity. Alexina is niece to Laski, the chief plotter against Henri. One of Laski's serfs, Minka, in love with Nangis, passes information about the conspiracy. It becomes increasingly difficult to remember at any given moment who knows the real identities of Henri and Nangis - and except for the girl Minka none of the characters is, so far as the drama is concerned, interesting or even particularly sympathetic. Musically they are sharply drawn. Finally Henri, poised to escape over the Polish border, learns that the alternative candidate for the throne has withdrawn and promptly decides to stay - presumably to be near Alexina, whose husband Fritelli is conveniently sent on a mission to France. The real-life Henri succeeded his brother as Henri III and scuttled back to home, mummy and the mignons. One may sympathise with a producer trying to bridge the chasm between this tedious imbroglio and a score overflowing with robust tunes, vital rhythm, succulent harmony and kingfisher orchestration. At Nantes Oliver Desbordes (producer), Patrice Gouron (sets and lighting) and Jean-Pierre Capeyron (costumes) plastered over the crack a sugary coating of pantomime cuteness. A sadly misconceived first act, a snow-scene like a Disneyfied Nutcracker, contained two unforgivable sins - curtain up during the splendid prelude to show clowning in the snow and (believe it or not) comic skating during the entirely serious, meditative introduction to Henri's beautiful lament for France. The second act was better; the third act was mixed. At least, no concept or social comment. Much of the best solo music falls to Minka. Natalie Dessay was bright, strong and agile, sometimes a little hard. Elizabeth Procuronoff's Alexina was an effective foil (the two women's ravishing Nocturne in the last act was a major pleasure). Henri was Franck Leguerinel, a pleasant light baritone who phrases musically but, condemned by the producer to a childish skittishness, was unable to hold the centre of the stage. The accomplished tenor Leonard Pezzino had the style for Nangis but not enough bite. The potentially unfunny buffo role of Fritelli was saved by Marc Barrard's expert delivery of his two solos. Serge Bernard played the conspiring Laski as a Dracula-figure. The conductor, Valentin Reymond, controlled the tricky ensembles with aplomb and blended the lustrous colours in the orchestra adeptly. One or two speeds I thought marginally too staid. It is accepted wisdom to praise this score for not being 'too Wagnerian'. I am not so sure. Behind those scrumptious chords of the ninth and that constant flow of invention, cannot one hear the sanity, humanity and exuberance of Die Meistersinger? Anyway, this revival proves that in spite of the book, Le Roi malgre lui can work in the theatre.</p>

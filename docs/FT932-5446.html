			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The main wool selling seasons in the southern hemisphere are in their final month and offerings at auction are tailing off. Last week's South African sale was cancelled because of inadequate offerings, and a New Zealand sale was recently abandoned for the same reason. Australia meanwhile is a steady market, with finer merinos still in keen demand. Prices gained a little ground compared with last week but subsequently have just remained steady. The AWC market indicator is 455c/kg compared with 453 a week ago.</p>

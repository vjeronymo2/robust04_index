After the disruptions of the 1970's, diagnoses of the  disease  by microscope resumed in the late 1980's with the provision of  equipment and laboratory training by foreign relief agencies.  Now, about 120,000 cases are confirmed microscopically each  year; nonetheless, they don't really indicate the incidence of  malaria because so many people are treated without blood tests.    The Ministry of Health has estimated that as many as 500,000  Cambodians may contract malaria each year, resulting in between  5,000 and 10,000 deaths. In contrast, Thailand, with a  population almost nine times larger, registers only about  300,000 cases annually and about 3,000 deaths.    Cambodia has a National Malaria Center, but administrative  activities are decentralized, with provincial and district  health committees determining how best to combat the disease.  They have yielded some data on the effectiveness of  anti-malarial drugs.    In northwestern parts of the country, the resistance of the  most deadly malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to  traditional remedies is progressing at an alarming rate.  Chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyremethamine appear to be totally  ineffective for treatment in these areas, according to studies  by a French agency, Action Internationale Contre Faim (AICF).  Although only recently introduced in the northwest, mefloquine  (marketed in Thailand as Lariam) is following a pattern set in  Thailand in the 1980's; parasites present in the blood of more  than half the patients in one AICF study showed resistance to  the drug.    In remote areas, such as Rattanakiri province in the  northeast, malaria is much more responsive to traditional drugs.  But Chus Alonso, an AICF epidemiologist, said she had her  doubts about the scant data sent by medical workers in the  northeast. The Khmer Rouge and other security threats forestall  any thorough studies. Security problems also have made it  difficult for medical personnel and drugs to reach affected  people, including ethnic minorities.    When 300,000 Cambodian refugees returned home from the Thai  border, it was inevitable that they would carry the resistant  parasite along with them. Just as likely, the mosquitoes  bearing the parasite were waiting for them.    In fact, while Thailand has earned a bit of international  notoriety from its chloroquine-resistant parasites, they may  have originated in Cambodia in the late 1950's and early 60's.  At that time, northwestern Cambodia had a peculiar malaria  prevention programme whereby table salt was laced with  chloroquine. Scientists speculate that prolonged exposure to  low levels of the drug enabled parasites to build up immunity to  it.    Nonetheless, falciparum malaria in Cambodia differs from the  Thai version in a way that makes it especially difficult to  fight. The mosquito carrying the parasite is called Anopheles  dirus. Its preferred breeding ground is in the forest, in pools  of water, including those created by an animal's hoof prints.  This explains why malaria rarely occurs in Cambodian towns or  in the heavily populated areas surrounding the vast Tonle Sap  Lake.    People clearing forests for farmland or working in forests,  therefore, are most vulnerable. What worries public health  officials is that the numbers of such transient people have  surged with the relative peace of the past two years. They  include the gem miners in the Pailin area and woodcutters along  both the Thai and Lao borders. Often they are accompanied by  their families.    Assistance from AICF and the World Health Organization (WHO)  in the past few years has upgraded the national center's  treatment services. But a large grant from the British Overseas  Development Administration coupled with increased access to the  countryside now has made a much wider control effort possible.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Systems groups push for more cash from the EC  -SIX says money should be switched from research Europe has been pondering for almost a decade on the need to develop community-wide computer networks to promote and encourage its local information technology industry. It was the troubled hardware manufacturers, Siemens Nixdorf, of Germany, Groupe Bull, of France, and Olivetti, of Italy, which seemed the most likely beneficiaries of plans to build a computer-based 'nervous system' to co-ordinate government activities in the EC. As multimedia and the information superhighway have grown in importance, things have changed. Now it is the computing services companies which are claiming the right to build Europe's information future. The SIX (Services Informatics Expertise) Advisory Group represents Europe's top computing services companies - Cap Sogeti Gemini and Sligos, of France, Sema Group and Logica, of the UK, Finsiel, of Italy, and six more. They are asking the commission to divert funds intended for pre-competitive research into hardware and software development into support for projects such as a system for the exchange of environmental information covering some 15,000 databases. Pier Paolo Davoli, chairman of SIX and chief executive of Finsiel, argues that a new model, involving close collaboration between governments, companies and customers, is necessary to develop applications for the superhighway. SIX believes that it is in a unique position to understand the kind of systems - applications - which would be of value, because services companies traditionally collaborate closely with their customers. They have to understand their business needs in order to develop effective software and systems. Computer hardware suppliers and telecoms operators have rarely formed such close links. The group argues that Europe's taxpayers have not had value for money from the EC's 'Framework' research programmes. These traditionally provide 50 per cent funding to encourage companies and educational establishments to collaborate on pre-competitive research, basic research which can be used by any of the partners to develop commercial products. The EC has already agreed to spend Pounds 2.6bn over the next five years on basic research in information technology, as part of the fourth Framework programme. Davoli says there is no need for research to develop more computer hardware or software. Technology already in existence is adequate to build systems which will meet the needs of Europe's citizens and act as models for tomorrow's information society. He gives as an example the Europe-wide Social Security Network (SoSeNet). This was developed by a consortium, including Cap Volmac, of the Netherlands, Finsiel and Sema, with the aim of facilitating the free movement of people, especially migrant workers, through improved exchange of data between Europe's administrations. The network is now up and running, although exchanging limited data at present. Davoli says: 'It is time for industry, the European Commission and investors to unite to realise an information society for Europe.' He adds that the SIX's plans do not involve new money; he envisages pump-priming funds being diverted from the existing Framework programme. The SIX proposals are contained in a submission to Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, who earlier this year issued a report setting the scene for the development of multimedia and the information superhighway in Europe. The SIX is in broad agreement with the Bangemann report, which emphasised that time was short and that nothing would happen automatically. It also said that the private sector and market forces should be responsible for the creation of the information society, adding that existing public funding should be refocused to target the new requirements. The SIX group makes four specific proposals: Ways have to be found to bring together, at an early stage in a project, groupings of users and suppliers to identify priorities, establish market demand, define applications and test the feasibility of applications with potential customers. SIX is floating the idea of a 'User Club' as one way forward. SIX argues that new partnerships will have to be established between customers, suppliers and investors if large projects are to be realised. It is, however, against the conventional consortia approach, led by Europe's large companies, which lacks flexibility and entrepreneurial flair. It says there must be a clear customer for each project, to drive it forward and ensure it is commercially attractive. This touches on the argument at the heart of the superhighway debate: what services will customers be prepared to pay for? SIX says: 'Where market research suggests demand will be there, but customers are not ready for the service, then the EC or a supplier must act as a 'customer' throughout the project. It is vital for Europe to take the opportunity soon.' Funding is, SIX accepts, a difficult issue. It has to support and stimulate the players without simply subsidising them. It says the present practice of part-funding research and development projects will not create the momentum needed for commercially-realistic pilots and trials which could be expected to grow into full-scale superhighway applications: 'There needs to be more EC funding at the start of projects, to establish momentum. After this, the private sector will be better placed to invest,' SIX concludes.</p>

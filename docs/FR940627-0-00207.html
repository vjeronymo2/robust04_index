			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) The Atypical Methanol category consists of methanol fuels and associated additives which do not meet the criteria for either the Baseline or the Non-Baseline Methanol category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ethanol Categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) The Baseline Ethanol category is comprised of ethanol fuels and associated additives which contain at least 50 percent ethanol by volume, no more than five (5) percent by volume of substances other than ethanol and gasoline, and no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and copper. Baseline ethanol formulations shall contain no more than 0.004 percent by weight of sulfur, 0.0004 percent by weight of chlorine, and/or 0.07 mg/L of copper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The Non-Baseline Ethanol category is comprised of fuel blends which contain at least 50 percent ethanol by volume, more than five (5) percent by volume of a substance(s) other than ethanol and gasoline, and meet the baseline limitations on elemental composition in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The Atypical Ethanol category consists of ethanol fuels and associated additives which do not meet the criteria for either the Baseline or the Non-Baseline Ethanol categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methane Categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) The Baseline Methane category is comprised of methane fuels and associated additives (including at least an odorant additive) which contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur, and contain no more than 20 mole percent non-methane hydrocarbons. Baseline methane formulations shall not contain more than 16 ppm by volume of sulfur, including any sulfur which may be contributed by the odorant additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The Non-Baseline Methane category consists of methane fuels and associated additives which conform to the specifications in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) of this section for the Baseline Methane category except that they exceed 20 mole percent non-methane hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The Atypical Methane category consists of methane fuels and associated additives which contain one or more elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur, or exceed 16 ppm by volume of sulfur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Propane Categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) The Baseline Propane category is comprised of propane fuels and associated additives (including at least an odorant additive) which contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur, and contain no more than 20 percent by volume non-propane hydrocarbons. Baseline Propane formulations shall not contain more than 123 ppm by weight of sulfur, including any sulfur which may be contributed by the odorant additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The Non-Baseline Propane category consists of propane fuels and associated additives which conform to the specifications in paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(A) of this section for the Baseline Propane category, except that they exceed the 20 percent by volume limit for butane and higher hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The Atypical Propane category consists of propane fuels and associated additives which contain elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur, or exceed 123 ppm by weight of sulfur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fuel/Additive Groups. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fuel/additive groups are subdivisions of the fuel/additive categories. One or more group(s) are defined within each category in each fuel family according to the presence of differing characteristics in the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. For each group, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation (either a base fuel or a member fuel or additive product) is chosen to represent all the member products in the group in any tests required under this subpart. The section which follows describes the fuel/additive groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Baseline Groups. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) The Baseline Gasoline category comprises a single group. The gasoline base fuel specified in &sect;79.55(b) shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve as the representative of this group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The Baseline Diesel category comprises a single group. The diesel base fuel specified in &sect;79.55(c) shall serve as the representative of this group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The Baseline Methanol category includes two groups: M100 and M85. The M100 group consists of methanol-gasoline formulations containing at least 96 percent methanol by volume. These formulations must contain odorants and bitterants (limited in elemental composition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine) for prevention of purposeful or inadvertent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption. The M100 base fuel specified in &sect;79.55(d) shall serve as the representative for this group. The M85 group consists of methanol-gasoline formulations containing at least 50 percent by volume but less than 96 percent by volume methanol. The M85 base fuel specified in &sect;79.55(d) shall serve as the representative of this group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The Baseline Ethanol category comprises a single group. The E85 base fuel specified in &sect;79.55(e) shall serve as the representative of this group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The Baseline Methane category comprises a single group. The CNG base fuel specified in &sect;79.55(f) shall serve as the representative of this group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

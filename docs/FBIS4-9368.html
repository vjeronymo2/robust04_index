			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Komadina: "Who Is Eavesdropping on Whom?"] </F>   [Text] After the scandal that happened at a reception  at the Germany Embassy in Zagreb, in which Seks and Budisa  participated, our public's attention has been drawn again to the  work of the Croatian secret police.    When Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks set out for the  evening reception that was arranged by Horst Weisel on 24 March  in the German Embassy, he probably expected a relaxed  atmosphere, choice wines, a well-spread table, and comfortable  small talk with the diplomatic and other political elite. He  certainly did not expect an awkward scandal. That is precisely  what happened, however. The next day, on 25 March, Drazen  Budisa, president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS]  and a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies, wrote an open letter to  Prime Minister Valentic, which was carried by all the daily  newspapers in the country. The letter states that after dinner,  during a conversation in which Slovene Ambassador Matija  Malesic, Deputy Finance Minister Bozo Prka, Milan Djukic, SNS  [Serbian National Party] president, and Presidential Adviser  Nenad Porges participated, Seks stated that he knew what Budisa  had said at a recent HSLS meeting in Virovitica. In response to  Budisa's inquiry about how he knew that, Seks answered that he  had recordings that the police had delivered to him.    "I ask you, esteemed Mr. Valentic, to give me and our public  an answer as to whether the police are recording HSLS meetings  with your instructions and approval, and if not, I request that  you urgently inquire who is doing it and on whose instructions,"  Budisa's letter said. It also expressed the hope that the  government's policy did not include police monitoring of  opposition parties.    Four days later, on 29 March, Vladimir Seks answered  Budisa's  open letter with an article entitled "Drazen Budisa's False  Misinterpretations." Categorically denying Budisa's statements,  at the same time Seks also explained Budisa's motives: "It is  quite unlikely that I would make such a statement to Mr. Budisa,  and his request that the conversation be translated for the  German ambassador obviously indicates Budisa's intention of once  again indicting, accusing, and denouncing the Croatian state,  while portraying himself as a politician who, as a democrat,  ought to be president of the republic in accordance with alleged  foreign `tastes.'"  <H5>  Valentic's Quick Response </H5>   Who said what to whom and how it was interpreted is not that  important, because only Seks and Budisa know the real truth  about the course of the conversation. Far more serious is the  mention of the alleged secret recording being done by the  police. It is therefore not surprising that there was a quick  response from Prime Minister Valentic, who said in connection  with Budisa's accusations, "The Service for Protection of the  Constitutional Order of the Republic of Croatia is not  operationally interested in meetings of political parties, or in  communications among them. Consequently, any sort of recording  of the meetings of the HSLS or any other party is out of the  question. I therefore reject any possibility of that the police  acted in Virovitica in the way stated by Mr. Drazen Budisa. At  the same time, I strongly protest the reference to the police in  this context, whoever made it, because those allegations are  unfounded and untrue."    Zdravko Zidovec, the interior minister's chief of staff,  said  about this: "The claim that the police recorded an HSLS meeting  in Virovitica is ridiculous. I categorically reject that  possibility."    Regardless of the content of the conversation between Seks  and Budisa at the German Embassy, attention really has been  drawn to the work of the secret services. "The state sees all,  the state hears all," is the well-known slogan of the  totalitarian regimes with which the communist authorities  frightened us for 45 years. It is therefore not surprising that  the Croatian public is sensitive to references to secret  recording, monitoring, or the wiretapping of telephones. The  fact is that the Croatian state inherited many of the former  regime's institutions, and thus also a large police apparatus. A  thorough restructuring of the intelligence services was  therefore one of the first steps that Croatia took. The Service  for Protection of the Constitutional Order [SZUP], which is the  best-known "secret police," was created, and intelligence  services are also possessed by the Defense Ministry (the SIS  [Security-Information Service]) and the Foreign Ministry  (Section 8), along with the youngest Croatian Information  Service [HIS]. The legal framework regulating their powers and  operation, as well as control over those services, was supposed  to be modeled after that of other democratic countries. Their  work is based on the constitution and special laws, for example,  the Law on Internal Affairs (the SZUP).  <H5>  Internal Regulations </H5>   It is thus said of the SZUP that it is "one of the police  services within the Republic of Croatia's Interior Ministry,"  and that "in accordance with the constitution and the law, it  handles matters related to protecting the order established by  the constitution, within the framework of which it collects  information and intelligence, and undertakes other necessary  measures to detect and prevent activities aimed at undermining  or destroying the order established by the constitution and  threatening the country's security." It therefore focuses its  activity on those criminal acts that are, in principle, prepared  in secret and in an organized manner, such as terrorism,  espionage, and so forth.    Some occurrences in the past two years, however, drew the  public's attention precisely to the work of those services. This  has to do primarily with wiretapping certain individuals. The  first such accusation was uttered by the controversial Nikola  Viskovic, a deputy in the last Assembly. The second case, which  was exploited even more by the media, is, of course, the "case  of Manolic's special telephone," through which he could obtain a  direct connection with any continent, and which someone  regularly blocked two days out of the week. Both cases once  again revived the question of where the limit to the secret  services' work actually was. In the end, wiretapping is not any  kind of bogeyman if it is conducted strictly in accordance with  the law, and if all possibilities for abuse are eliminated.    The powers of the SZUP, however, are not based exclusively  on  the constitution and the law. As we have unofficially learned,  there are also internal regulations, which are classified at  such a level that even SZUP employees cannot read them until  they pass all the tests, take the oath, and receive official  identification. It seems that through the unnecessary  mystification of their work, those services are actually doing  themselves a disservice. It is precisely for that reason that we  will list some of the devices used by similar services in the  world.  <H5>  Eavesdropping Devices </H5>   A laser system for eavesdropping on inaccessible premises  consists of a transmitter that sends a focused beam to the glass  of a window, while the receiver catches the modulated beam in  the form of the vibrations resulting from speech and turns it  into an audio signal, filters it, and amplifies it. There is  also a probe for surveillance and eavesdropping: Through at  least an 8-mm opening, a probe is inserted, at the end of which  is a sensitive microphone and a lens with a 90-degree field of  vision; an ordinary camera, video camera, or tape recorder can  be installed on the other end of the probe. These two devices  are among the most modern ones in the world, and are said to be  highly sophisticated instruments.    A simple instrument for eavesdropping on telephone  conversations consists of a tape recorder and a device for  recording the operation of the telephone dial. That kind of tape  recorder is activated whenever the telephone rings or when the  phone is picked up. The numbers dialed from the telephone that  is being tapped are also recorded on a separate tape. The  biggest producers of this and other eavesdropping equipment are  Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United  States. Today the TRM series from 0040 to 0045 are among the  best-known and most highly valued eavesdropping devices. The TRM  0040 is a microcassette recorder with a size of 119 x 55 x 17 mm  and a weight of 160 grams. Thanks to this, it can be camouflaged  very well in a pack of cigarettes, for example. It can record a  conversation at a distance of up to 10 meters. It also has a  remote control attachment, a tape counter, and a memory button.  It is equipped with an additional device for voice activation,  so that only so-called active speech is recorded. These are only  a few of the eavesdropping devices that can be bought in West  European countries in any well-equipped store selling technical  goods.    Information is power. The one who has it and who can get it  before others has more power, and more authority. Playing with  that power is dangerous, and that is why control mechanisms  exist. Any indication of possible abuse of that power is useful  and welcome.  <H5>  [Box, p 26] </H5> <H5>  Vladimir Seks, Croatian deputy prime minister: "Budisa Is </H5> Making a Provocation"    [Seks] You can associate this story of Budisa's with the one  that the Croats destroyed a mosque in Livno. Budisa knew very  well that everything bad that was done in the areas that are  under the control of the Croats in Bosnia would be attributed by  world political factors to the Croatian government. I understand  political rivalry, competition, and scoring political points,  but this shows his great impatience and goes beyond all bounds  of fair play. Budisa's use of such misinterpretations in front  of another country's ambassador is irrational and unclear. One  can conclude precisely from that that this is a deliberate  political provocation through which Budisa tried to discredit  the government, the Interior Ministry, and me personally in  front of the German ambassador. It really is ridiculous that I  would make such a statement. Budisa and I have been friends for  many years, but obviously his desire for a political  breakthrough knows no bounds.    [Komadina] At one time you were also the state attorney. Did  you ever encounter cases in which the police secretly  eavesdropped on or recorded any party's meetings?    [Seks] Never.  <H5>  [Box, p 27] </H5> <H5>  Drazen Budisa, HSLS President: "Seks's Inventions" </H5>   [Budisa] It really is quite improbable, as Mr. Seks said in  his statement, that he said what he did. Unfortunately, a lot of  things in Croatia that are quite improbable are real and true,  and so is Mr. Seks's statement.    In the conversation that we had the next day, after that  dinner, Seks did not deny his words, but only stated that he was  joking, and it seems that that is how the other participants in  the conversation also perceived it. I do not have any  appreciation for HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] wit,  however. Consequently, the truth is precisely what I wrote to  Prime Minister Valentic. On the contrary, it is not true that  there was any discussion that evening about my representing  myself as the future president of the Croatian state. Those are  really Mr. Seks's absurdities and inventions. Now I am only  considering what the people who participated in the conversation  that evening are thinking about Mr. Seks.    [Komadina] Had you already had similar information about  your  meetings being recorded?    [Budisa] No. We did not even refer to that. I do not know  about any recording, and that is precisely why Seks's statement  was shocking--especially because he told me about it, if it is  being done.</p>

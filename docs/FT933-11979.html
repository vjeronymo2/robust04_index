			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Letter: Only way to compete effectively Sir, Without spending Pounds 40 to buy the report, it is hard to understand why 'The impact of Japanese firms on working and employment practices in British manufacturing industry' is given sufficient credence and status to merit a front page story in the Financial Times ('Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices', July 19). The management methods which have made Japanese industry and Japanese-owned industries in Britain and other countries so successful - attention to quality systems, quality products, statistical process control, flexible manufacturing, empowering workers to control and improve process and, above all, loyalty by employers to employees - have been adopted by successful British companies for years. The argument about the benefit of 'Just-in-time' supplies - that reduction of storage space, reductions in working capital, and early discovery and correction of faulty inputs far outweigh the risks of inherent disruptions - was settled some 25 years ago. It is too complacent to imply that old British work practices are less likely to lead to worker resentment and disruption than today's world-class best practice, whether of Japanese or any other origin. As for the danger to health and life of working too hard, has the risk of death through overwork been compared with the well-documented increase in illness and death in the UK resulting from unemployment? The most likely consequence of not adopting competitive management styles and work practices is no work at all. John Farago, 121 Church Road, Wimbledon, London SW19 5AH</p>

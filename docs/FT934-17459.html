			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UN warns of aid calamity for Bosnia BOSNIA is 'looking into the jaws' of a humanitarian disaster this winter, the United Nations said yesterday, warning that its aid operation for the former Yugoslavia faced a cash shortfall of more than 50 per cent. The warning comes amid fears that the Bosnian parliament's virtual rejection of the peace proposals on Wednesday will set off further fighting across the region. In an effort to salvage the peace process, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, yesterday met in Geneva and spoke to Bosnian, US and UN representatives. The Bosnian parliament has said it will accept the peace deal, which would turn Bosnia into a loose union of three ethnic mini-states, only if land seized by force is returned. Diplomats warned that it was uncertain whether the mediators could produce fresh diplomatic initiatives rapidly. The reponse from the Serb and Croat leaders remained unclear. Although UN sanctions against Serbia have left the Serb leaders in Belgrade keen for a settlement, the Serbs have insisted they will not yield any more land. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said the Serbs would continue to build their state. He accused the Bosnian Moslems of seeking to stall the process. As tensions rose across Bosnia, Gen Rasim Delic, commander of the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army, yesterday said he had ordered his troops to cease military actions against the Croats. Most ceasefires to date in Bosnia have broken down rapidly, and some observers suggested that the move might have been prompted by fears of a renewed Serb assault. As Serb forces renewed their sporadic shelling of Sarajevo, Gen Delic warned that Serb forces were massing in northern and eastern Bosnia. Meanwhile, the Bosnian government also appeared to be under fresh attack from its own people, after thousands of Bosnian Moslems had taken to the streets in the north-western enclave of Bihac to protest against a military crackdown ordered by Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic after Mr Fikret Abdic, Bihac's leader and Mr Izetbegovic's rival, declared the enclave autonomous. Bosnian troops were reported to be advancing on the town of Cazin, where civilians had seized the local radio station in a gesture of defiance against Mr Izetbegovic. Yugoslavia today will strike six zeros from its dinar notes because of soaring inflation. After the redenomination, 1m dinars will be equivalent to one dinar. One kilogramme of meat yesterday cost 20bn dinars (DM10 or Pounds 4.10).</p>

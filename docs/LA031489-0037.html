			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DREXEL FINANCE CHIEF SHIFTED TO 'JUNK BOND' UNIT  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has moved its West Coast finance chief, John  Kissick, over to work full time in the firm's "junk bond" department in Beverly  Hills, underscoring the probability that he will replace Michael Milken as head  of the department when Milken leaves Drexel.  </P> <P> The likelihood that Kissick would be named to succeed Milken if Milken's legal  problems forced him out of the firm was first reported several months ago.  Under terms of tentative settlement agreements that Drexel has reached with the  federal prosecutors in New York and with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, Milken will be required to leave Drexel.  </P> <P> Drexel also announced some related personnel moves, including the appointment  of Herbert Bachelor as a vice chairman with responsibility for investment  banking and related activities. Bachelor previously was head of corporate  finance at Drexel. Bachelor is among the executives Drexel promoted in an  effort to retain after the firm's internally divisive decision to settle with  prosecutors and the SEC.  </P> <P> The others include Arthur Bilger, an investment banker at Drexel's Beverly  Hills office; Leon Black, head of mergers and acquisitions, and John Sorte,  head of the New York investment banking office. All three were named co-heads  of corporate finance, filling Bachelor's old position. In addition, Bilger was  appointed to take Kissick's place as head of West Coast corporate finance.  </P> <P> Drexel on Monday also said that Arthur S. Kirsch, senior vice president and  head of research, had been named director of the firm's U.S. institutional  equity operations. A Drexel spokesman said Kirsch would take over the  responsibilities formerly held by Alan Greditor, who had been the firm's  managing director in charge of equity trading. Greditor was killed in an  automobile accident in 1988. SCOT J. PALTROW  </P></p>

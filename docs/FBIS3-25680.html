Four days after  the second round in the country's first multi-party elections,  voters are still waiting to see which party is to form the new  government.    President Gnassingbe Eyadema has ruled Togo since 1967.    In a statement to journalists Commission President Garba  Sipohon acknowledged that all the votes had been counted after  Sunday's poll. "The results will be sent to the Supreme Court  for evaluation," he said. But Sipohon disclosed the outcome in  only 19 of the 24 contested districts, which when added to the  winners of the first round give opposition parties a one-seat  lead over the former sole ruling pro-Eyadema Togolese People's  Rally (RPT). Sipohon said the opposition had won 38 seats  compared to 37 for the RPT. Transitional Premier Joseph  Koffigoh who stood as an independent also won a spot in the  81-seat assembly.    Both the opposition and the RPT have claimed victory in the  poll. Sipohon said announcement of the counts in five districts  had been held back because of the "circumstances" in which  voting had taken place. Violence marred the poll Sunday when  polling stations in two districts were forced to close and the  count was later disturbed in three others.    The court has 72 hours to issue an official declaration on  the results, with challenges having to be presented within the  subsequent five days. The court will then have a further 10  days to rule on the challenges.    The opposition parties, made up of Action Committee for  Renewal (CAR) and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), have  already claimed victory in the five disputed districts -- which  would give them an overall majority in the parliament. But on  Tuesday the RPT accused the opposition of "fraud," alleging it  had been responsible for the violence.    In a statement late Wednesday it claimed victory saying the  Supreme Court would "confirm its success." "The moment has come  to form the country's government," the RPT added, declaring  itself "ready to play its due part" and collaborate in a "large  national unity government." The commission is made up of four  pro-presidential sympathisers and four opposition supporters.    The four opposition commission members complained Wednesday  that their colleagues and "outside personalities at a high-level  in the state" had pressured them into not publishing the full  results. They said they had threatened to resign if the results  were not published in their totality.    Under the terms of the Constitution Eyadema must name a  prime  minister from the ranks of the new majority parties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Turmoil in Afghanistan"] </F>   [Text] It is extremely painful that the internecine  fighting in Afghanistan has assumed the form of a war causing  widespread damage to property and loss of lives. In the  struggle for power between different groups, hundreds of  civilians have been uprooted from their homes and are fleeing in  panic to safe places. In the latest round of fighting which  broke out on the New Year's Day for control of the Afghan  capital Kabul, dozens of people have been killed and more than  1,700 injured. Those involved in the affray are troops loyal to  Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his newfound ally. Gen.  Dostam who are pitted against those loyal to the government of  President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The latter has reportedly fled  the capital.    Since infantry battles are raging not only around Kabul but  also in the northern province of Balkh, rockets and shells are  raining down on the Afghan capital at the rate of six or seven a  minute, and military aircraft are carrying out bombing raids on  different locations, the destruction the country is facing can  well be imagined. At the same time, the death toll is likely to  reach alarming figures. Food and medicines are already in short  supply in the country and if the fighting prolongs, the Afghan  people would suffer tremendously. Although a large number of  those who had fled their homes during Soviet occupation have  returned to Afghanistan, the present fighting there may again  cause outflows to Pakistan and India and other neighbouring  countries. It is unfortunate that neither the world community  nor the organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) has taken any  serious notice of the civil war in Afghanistan and done nothing  to bring it to a halt. It is only Pakistan which has expressed  its grave concern at the situation, made an appeal to Afghan  leaders to stop fighting and renewed its earlier offer to  mediate a settlement between the rival factions. It has warned  that military success by one faction over the other would be of  a transient nature and may enlarge the fighting undermining  national unity. The only happy news from Afghanistan is that the  warring factions have agreed to a truce in response to an  Iranian offer to evacuate some of the wounded from Kabul. The  Afghan leaders must realise that the use of force is not a  viable option to resolve political differences and disputes.  Having taken the initiative, Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff  Ahmed Ali should visit Afghanistan as soon as possible and make  every effort to bring about cessation of hostilities in that  country and help the rival factions to settle their differences  through peaceful means.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (m)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Actions on attestations submitted for filing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An attestation which meets the established criteria set forth in this &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .310 shall be accepted for filing by ETA on the date it is signed by the Certifying Officer. ETA shall then follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (m)(1) of this section. An attestation submitted by a facility proposing alternative criteria or steps for the first and/or the fourth attestation elements, and/or proposing to take only one timely and significant step, and/or claiming a bona fide medical emergency exemption from the fourth attestation element shall be reviewed by ETA, and a determination shall be made by the Certifying Officer whether to accept or reject the attestation for filing. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), and (k)(3)(iii) of this section. The Certifying Officer may request additional explanation and/or documentation from the facility in making this determination. If the Certifying Officer does not contact the facility for such information or make any determination within 30 days of receiving the attestation, the attestation shall become accepted for filing. Upon the facility's submitting the attestation to ETA and providing the notice required by the sixth attestation element (see &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .310(i)), the attestation shall be available for public examination at the health care facility itself. When ETA accepts the attestation for filing, the Certifying Officer shall forward the attestation to the ETA National Office, where it shall be available for public examination. Information contesting an attestation received by ETA prior to the determination to accept or reject the attestation for filing shall not be made part of ETA's administrative record on the attestation, but shall be referred to ESA to be processed as a complaint pursuant to Subpart E of this part, and, if such attestation nevertheless is accepted by ETA for filing, the complaint will be handled by ESA under that subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) If the attestation (and any explanatory statements that may be required) meet the requirements of this subpart, ETA shall accept the attestation for filing, shall, in the case of a facility intending to file a visa petition as the employer of an H&hyph;1A nurse, notify INS in writing of the filing, shall return to the facility one copy of the attestation form submitted by the facility, with ETA's acceptance indicated thereon, and shall forward one copy of the attestation with ETA's acceptance indicated thereon to the ETA National Office. The facility may then file a visa petition with INS for alien nurses in accordance with INS regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) DOL is not the guarantor of the accuracy, truthfulness or adequacy of an attestation accepted for filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appeals of acceptances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If an attestation which is subject to a determination under paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), or (k)(3)(iii) of this section is accepted for filing, any interested party may appeal ETA's determination(s) on the element(s) that have been reviewed. Appeals of acceptances shall be filed with the BALCA, no later than 30 days after the date of acceptance, and will be considered under the procedures set forth at &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .320. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appeals of rejections. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the attestation is not accepted for filing, which may occur as a result of a determination under paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), or (k)(3)(iii) of this section, ETA shall notify the facility in writing, specifying the reasons for rejection and quoting the language of &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .320(a)(1). Any interested party may appeal such rejection to the BALCA, no later than 30 days after the date of rejection. Appeals of rejections shall be filed and considered under the procedures set forth at &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .320. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date and validity of filed attestations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An attestation becomes filed and effective as of the date it is accepted and signed by the Certifying Officer and accepted thereby for filing. Such attestation is valid for the 12-month period beginning on the date of acceptance for filing, unless suspended or invalidated pursuant to &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .320 or subpart E. The filed attestation expires at the end of the 12-month period of validity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Suspension or invalidation of filed attestation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Suspension or invalidation of an attestation may result from a BALCA decision reversing an ETA acceptance for filing; from investigations by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, of the facility's misrepresentation in or failure to carry out its attestation; or from a discovery by ETA that it made an error in its review of the attestation (in those cases where ETA performs such review pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (g)(1)(i)(B), (g)(1)(ii), (k)(3)(iii) of this section) and that the explanation and documentation provided and maintained by the facility does not or did not meet the criteria set forth at &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .310 (a) through (k). If an attestation is suspended or invalidated, DOL shall notify INS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Result of BALCA or Wage and Hour Division action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If an attestation is suspended or invalidated as a result of a BALCA decision overruling an acceptance of the attestation for filing, or is suspended or invalidated as a result of a Wage and Hour Division action pursuant to subpart E, such suspension or invalidation may not be separately appealed, but shall be merged with appeals of BALCA's or the Wage and Hour Division's determination on the underlying violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Result of ETA action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If, after accepting an attestation for filing, ETA discovers that it erroneously accepted that attestation for filing, and, as a result, ETA suspends or invalidates that acceptance, the facility may appeal such suspension or invalidation pursuant to &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .320 as if that suspension or invalidation were a decision to reject the attestation for filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

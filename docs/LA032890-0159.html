			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MONEY TALKS: POLITICAL SLOGANS ON CHECKS  </P> <P> The nation's second-largest check-printing company is offering checks with  personalized, political messages for consumers who care about abortion, AIDS  and other issues.  </P> <P> Any of 21 messages offered by John H. Harland Co. can be printed on a banner in  the middle of the check.  </P> <P> On abortion, people may opt for "Pro Choice" or "Pro Life." Those interested in  the environment may proclaim "Stop Nuclear Power" or "Alternative Energy."  Other messages include "Stop Child Abuse," "Attack AIDS" and "Seniors Have  Style."  </P> <P> "It's been proven that they will pay for rainbows and puppies (on checks). It's  not that far-fetched," said Harland spokesman Bruce Danielson.  </P> <P> The checks were first offered March 1 and sales have not been reported, he  said.  </P> <P> Stu Alexander, spokesman for Deluxe Check Printers Inc. in St. Paul, Minn., the  nation's largest check-printing company, said he doubts that consumers will go  for the concept.  </P> <P> "Affinity" checks, which allow people to state their loyalty to a school or  organization, have not been big sellers, he said. "While they seem like a good  idea at the time, people tend to support their organizations (in other ways),"  he said. "Someone who is gung-ho on that will open their checkbook and write a  check for that organization."  </P> <P> "People are putting their views on bumper stickers. Why not on their checks?"  said Charlie Elberson, vice president of Price-McNabb, an Asheville, N.C.,  marketing and communications firm.  </P></p>

W. de Klerk, African National Congress  [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela and Inkatha's Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    In a faxed letter to Mr de Klerk on Monday, the Zulu monarch  said he was experiencing difficulties with the days proposed for  the meeting. King Zwelithini said it would be "inappropriate"  for him to talk about the future of his kingdom before victims  of Monday's violence in Johannesburg were buried. He also  expressed fears about an appropriate and safe venue.    The Zulu king further said he was concerned about  "commencing  very difficult discussions and negotiations during this week  which is a holy week in the Christian calender".    "There is also the fact that the kwaZulu Legislative  Assembly  has risen until April 7." He proposed that the meeting be  postponed until "the week after Easter" provided violence abated  sufficiently and simmering anger in Zulu communities subsided.</p>

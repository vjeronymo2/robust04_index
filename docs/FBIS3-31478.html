			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 17 Feb--The opening of a new chapter in  Polish eastern policy was announced by Foreign Affairs Minister  Andrzej Olechowski at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Affairs  Commission on Thursday. Olechowski presented the main  assumptions of this policy.    The Polish foreign minister declared that the group of  states  of special interest to Poland was made up of Russia, Ukraine,  Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova, and Kazakhstan. According  to him, these countries are important from the point of view of  Polish political and economic interests as well as from the  point of view of Poland's security.    "We are vitally interested in the strenghtening of national  identity and democratic and promarket transformations of these  states," stated Olechowski. At the same time, he added that  Poland "would not be prejudiced against close ties between these  countries" if these were established without violence or  violations of democratic procedures.    "We want a clear warming up of the climate in our relations  with Russia," Olechowski declared. Among joint actions that  Poland intends to propose to Russia, he mentioned diplomatic  consultations, exchange of experiences in the fields of local  democracy and agriculture, and coordination of struggle against  organized crime.    The minister emphasized that this policy of "openness and  friendliness in relations with Russia" would depend on whether  Moscow respects the "strategic options of Polish foreign  policy"--that is, Poland's striving to participate in the  European Union, NATO, and the Western European Union.    According to Olechowski, friendly relations between peoples  in this part of Europe could be threatened by intolerance. "We  are noticing symptoms of such intolerance in Russia," the  minister said. According to him, the neo-imperial option in  Russian foreign policy, which results from unwillingness among  parts of the political and military elites to change traditional  methods of thinking and acting, should be treated as a real  threat.    Olechowski said that the independence of Ukraine had a  "strategic dimension" for Poland. "We will act for this country  getting its due place in international politics, corresponding  with Ukraine's potential," he announced.    The head of Polish diplomacy underscored that the support  for  political and military stability in the neighboring region was  an important part of the Polish policy, which would contribute  to the building of European security. "Poland resolutely  supports the process of linking the East and the West into one  whole," Olechowski said. He underscored that, by participating  in Partnership for Peace, Poland not only strives after  membership in NATO but also wants to use the initiative for  cooperation with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania.    According to Olechowski, the creation of new possibilities  for economic cooperation is an important part of Poland's  Eastern policy. He announced that he would recommend to the  government the undertaking and the implementation of programs  supporting relations between individuals conducive to creating  mutual capital links, supporting Polish exporters and making  possible a better use of Poland's geographical position.    Olechowski also announced a program for supporting the  development of the market and democracy in the countries  encompassed by the Eastern policy. To coordinate this policy,  the minister plans to appoint a plenipotentiary for Eastern  policy in the Foreign Ministry and intends to suggest to the  government to set up an Eastern policy council.</p>

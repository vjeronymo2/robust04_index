			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Personal View: Ratify, then modify As an entrepreneur who has always sought to contribute to the construction of an integrated, competitive Europe, I am alarmed by the current crisis in the process of European unification. I am chairman of an industrial group that has always taken a European and international perspective in conducting its activities. I have made great efforts to help remove the many barriers that divide European markets and create a truly integrated European system. The process of Europe's integration now seems to be grinding to a halt. The enthusiasm generated by the drive for European economic and monetary union, the fall of the Berlin wall and the opening-up of east European markets has been overtaken by a wave of Euro-pessimism. The change in mood is reflected in Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the uncertainty over the French referendum on Sunday and in the growing conflicts of interest among Community members, which have been aggravated by the recession in many economies. A Yes vote in the French referendum could restore faith in the process of integration. If I were a Frenchman I would vote Yes. A truly European entity, supported by a common political structure, is essential if the Community's member states are to play an active role in today's increasingly unstable world. A No for Maastricht would be an enormous setback. But we have to make Europe possible. This means facing the fact that some of the conditions of the treaty actually make Europe impossible. No one would deny that significant changes have taken place in the economic and political climate this year, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The guidelines and timetables for monetary and economic convergence laid down by the treaty have to be adjusted accordingly, or the whole edifice could collapse. First, the world economic situation has changed. For years, our main worries were recession or an inflationary explosion. But the problems have changed. With the prices of property, shares and many industrial goods falling, deflation - not inflation - has become the real enemy, and this could lead Europe into depression. The US has thus been applying reflationary monetary and foreign currency policies for months. But recovery is still a long way off. US deflation has deep economic and social roots, and will be difficult to eradicate because the range of cures available is limited. Expansionary fiscal policies are not an option because the budget deficit is at an all-time high. A second big change is in Germany. The costs of reunification are rising daily. The 1990-91 consumer boom awakened fears of inflation, something that has always terrified the German authorities. They responded in July by raising the discount rate, a move designed to brake internal demand, attract foreign capital and unload some of the costs of reunification on to Germany's neighbours. Only now are many distinguished voices, both inside and outside Germany, beginning to realise that the country has gone into recession, that deflation and depression are the real dangers, and that the rigid monetarist approach of the Bundesbank has actually harmed the Germany economy. Weak international economic conditions and the slide of the dollar - with its impact on European competitiveness - have made German policy an unbearable burden for the rest of Europe. An urgent review of German and European monetary policy is therefore necessary. The immediate goal is to avoid depression, not to bring about a quick return to growth. This weekend's realignment of the European Monetary System - and specifically, the devaluation of the lira - in part reflects the severe problems which have plagued the Italian economy for years. While there is no doubt that Italy is the weakest link in the EMS chain, the high level of real interest rates, imposed as a consequence of German unification, will soon become unsustainable for other European countries as well. The small cut in interest rates which the Bundesbank made yesterday is far from consistent with the deflationary environment which the world currently faces and far from consistent with the recession which is quickly spreading throughout Europe, including Germany. A third significant change in the economic climate has been the dramatic situation in eastern Europe. The slowdown in growth in the west has clearly amplified the crisis in the east. Shrinking markets for eastern exports have slowed the flow of western capital (direct investments and loans) to the east, and have exacerbated political disruption, particularly in the Balkans. We cannot ignore these changes. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty is vital to keep the idea of European union alive and prevent a return to national chauvinism. But adjustments reflecting the changes in the international climate must be made if the treaty is to become an instrument for growth and a project which the governments and citizens of Europe can regard as their own. The treaty was geared to an economic growth scenario which assumed the persistent threat of inflation and a strong dollar. This is why its guidelines for convergence basically require a deflationary approach. Last year the treaty, as it stands, offered an effective means for stimulating growth. In the current conditions, it has become a perverse mechanism pushing Europe towards depression. The convergence guidelines have to be rethought; they must provide greater flexibility and cater for national differences. A drastic deflationary policy in one country must not be allowed to limit growth in the whole of Europe. The launch of the treaty's second phase, which would create the European Monetary Institute - a forerunner of the European Central Bank - should be brought forward. The institute should also be given greater powers to monitor monetary harmonisation and review convergence targets. Finding the technical solutions to make convergence a more flexible process is a job for the experts. But the solutions they define should not underestimate the difficulties of reviving the European economies nor cause an uncontrollable acceleration in current deflationary trends. The rise in European tensions in the wake of the dollar's recent slide shows that the process of European monetary integration must be part of a wider co-operation agreement between the Community and the US. In the past few months, co-operation on monetary policy has been nearly non-existent. Finally, the process of European integration cannot ignore the problems of the east. The issue here is not so much to negotiate the future EC membership of the east European countries as to take decisive action to open up western markets to eastern goods. This step is bound to create difficulties, but it is necessary to slow down immigration from the east and break away from the narrow political vision of European Union as an elite club for top performers. For all these reasons, it is my belief that while ratification of the Maastricht treaty by all the EC countries is necessary, a review of certain conditions for union is equally vital. We must approve Maastricht if we want to modify it. Ratification and modification are not incompatible; on the contrary, they are two essential steps for the relaunching of Europe.

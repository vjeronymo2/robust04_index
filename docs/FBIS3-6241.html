The 25 companies were found to have violated the  antimonopoly  law by rigging bids on orders from the Tokyo Metropolitan  Government, 15 municipal and town authorities in Osaka  Prefecture and 16 municipal, town and village administrations in  Fukuoka Prefecture, the officials said.    Among the 25 firms were the Tokyo-based Kimmon Mfg. Co., the  Nagoya-based Aichi Tokei Denki Co., the Kyoto-based Nitto Seiko  Co., and OKK corp. and Toko Co., both based in Osaka.    Over the years, the 25 firms held meetings to conspire in  determining who would be awarded orders from local  administrations and what prices would be set on equipment.</p>

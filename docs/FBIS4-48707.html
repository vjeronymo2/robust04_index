			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Nelson Mandela at the opening of </F> parliament in Cape Town on 24 May -- live]    [Text] Madam speaker, and deputy speaker, president of the  Senate, and deputy president, deputy presidents, chief justice,  distinguished members of the National Assembly, and the Senate,  provincial premiers, commanders of the security forces, members  of the diplomatic corps, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen.    The time will come when our nation will honor the memory of  all the sons, the daughters, the mothers, the fathers, the youth  and the children, who by their thoughts and deeds gave us the  right to assert with pride that we are South Africans, that we  are Africans, and that we are citizens of the world.    The certainties that come with age tell me that among these  we shall find an Afrikaner woman who transcended a particular  experience and became a South African, an African, and a citizen  of the world. Her name is Ingrid Jonker. She was both a poet  and a South African. She was both an Afrikaner and an African.  She was both an artist and a human being. In the midst of  despair she celebrated hope. Confronted by death, she asserted  the beauty of life. In the dark days when all seemed hopeless  in our country, when many refused to hear her resonant choice,  she took her own life. To her and others like her we owe a debt  for life itself. To her and others like her we owe a commitment  to the poor, the oppressed, the wretched, and the despised.    In the aftermath of the massacre at the anti-pass  demonstration in Sharpeville, she wrote, and I quote: The child  is not dead, the child lifts his fist against his mother, who  shouts Africa! The child is not dead, not at Langa, not at  Nyanga, nor at Orlando, nor at Sharpeville, nor at the police  post at Phillippi where she [as heard] lies with a bullet  through his brain. The child is present at all assemblies and  law giving. The child peers through the windows of houses and  into the hearts of mothers. The child who only wanted to play  in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere. The child, grown to a man,  tracks on through all Africa. The child, grown into a giant,  journeys over the whole world without a pass, unquote.    And in this glorious vision she instructs that our  endeavors must be about the liberation of the woman, the  emancipation of the man, and the liberty of the child. It is  these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our  presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of  the seat of government. And so we must, constrained by and yet  regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical  background, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want  to make of our shared destiny.    A government had the honor to lead, and I dare say, the  masses who elected us to serve in this role are inspired by the  single vision of creating a people centered society.  Accordingly, the purpose that will drive the government -- this  government -- shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human  fulfillment, the continuous extension of the frontiers of  freedom, the acid test of the legitimacy of the programs we  elaborate. The government institutions we create, the  legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these  objectives. Our single most important challenge is therefore to  help establish a social order in which the freedom of the  individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual. We  must construct that people centered society of freedom in such a  manner that it guarantees the political liberty and the human  rights of all our citizens. The provisions expressive of these  noble goals already exist in the transitional constitution. It  will be the task of the Constitutional Assembly to revisit this  issue to ensure that we have all the necessary constitutional  instruments that will guarantee that none can take away or in  any way restrict the freedoms and rights of any of our people.    As an affirmation of our government's commitment to an  entrenched human right culture, we shall immediately take steps  to inform the secretary general of the United Nations that we  will subscribe to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In  addition, we will take steps to ensure that we accede to the  international covenant on civil and political rights, the  international covenant on social and economic rights and other  human rights' instruments of the United Nations. Our definition  of the freedom of the individual must be instructed by the  fundamental objective to restore the human dignity of each and  every South African. This requires that we speak not only of  political freedoms. My government's commitment to create a  peoples-centered society of liberty binds us to the pursuit of  the goals of freedom from want, freedom from hunger, freedom  from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from  suppression, and freedom from fear.    These freedoms are fundamental to the guarantee of human  dignity. They will therefore constitute part of the centerpiece  of what this government will seek to achieve, the focal point on  which our attention will be continuously focused. The things we  have said constitute the true meaning, the justification and the  purpose of the reconstruction and development program, without  which it would lose all legitimacy. When we elaborated this  program, we were inspired by the hope that all South Africans of  good will could join together to provide a better life for all.  We were pleased that other political organizations announced  similar aims. Today I'm happy to announce that the covenant of  the government of national unity has reached a consensus not  only on the broad objective of the creation of the  peoples-centered society of which I've spoken, but also on many  elements of a plan, broadly based on the Program for  Reconstruction and Development.    Let me indicate some of the more important agreements.  Annually in the combined budgets of central government and the  provinces, we will provide for an increasing amount of funding  for the plan. This will start with the appropriation of 2.5  billion rands in the 1994/95 budget that will be presented next  month. This should rise to more than 10 billion by the fifth  year of the life of this government. Government will also use  its own allocation of funds to the Reconstruction and  Development Plan to exact maximum leverage in marshalling funds  from within South Africa and abroad.    In this regard I am pleased to report that we have been  holding consultations with some of the principal business  leaders of our country. Consequently, we are assured that the  business sector will make a significant contribution toward the  structuring and management of such reconstruction and  development funds toward the effective identification and  implementation of projects, and by supporting the financing of  the socioeconomic development effort.    I am also pleased to report that many of our friends abroad  have already made commitments to assist us to generate the  reconstruction and development funds we need. We thank them  most sincerely for their positive attitude which arises, not  from objectives of charity, but from the desire to express  solidarity with the new society we seek to build. We accept the  duty of coordinating the management of the total resources that  will be generated without seeking to prescribe to other  contributants or undermining the continued role of  nongovernmental organizations and community based organizations.    The initial 2.5 billion rands will be found from savings and  the re-direction of spending as included in the preliminary  1994/95 budget proposals presented to the cabinet. I would like  to thank all the departments of state for their cooperation in  carrying out this adjustment to their planning at short notice.  As we allocate larger amounts in future we shall require  further adjustments by departments, partly to correct the bias  in the spending patterns which are a legacy of the past. The  longer period should allow such changes to be properly planned,  but they will still make great demands on the managerial  capacity and spirit of cooperation of the cabinet and the whole  civil service.    [Begins speaking in Afrikaans] We are truly confident the  state service is inspired by the desire to serve the community.  That it will carry out its responsibility with dedication,  zealousness and enthusiasm, including the building up of greater  efficiency and greater productivity. This government is  therefore bound to ensure that this period will be properly  utilized, and will include community structures in the  decision-making process. [ends Afrikaans]    This will include the trade union movements and civic  organizations so that at no time should the government become  isolated from the people. At the same time steps will be taken  to build the capacity of communities to manage their own  affairs. Precisely because we are committed to ensuring  sustainable growth and development leading to a better life for  all, we will continue existing programs of fiscal  rehabilitation. We are therefore determined to make every  effort to contain real general government consumption at present  levels and to manage the budget deficit with a view to its  continuous reduction. Similarly we are agreed that a  permanently higher general level of taxation is to be avoided.  To achieve this important objective will require consistent  discipline on the part of both the central and the provincial  government. Furthermore, this disciplined approach will ensure  that we integrate the objectives of our Reconstruction and  Development Plan within government expenditure and not treat  them as incidental to the task of government marginalized to the  status of mere additions to the level of expenditure.    There are major areas of desperate need in our society. As a  signal of its seriousness to address this the government will,  within the next hundred days, implement various projects under  the direct provision of the president. Let me briefly explain  this. Children under the age of six and pregnant mothers will  receive free medical care in every state hospital and clinic  where such need exists. Similarly, a nutrition feeding scheme  will be implemented in every primary school where such a need is  established.    A concrete process of consultation between the major stake  holders in this area will be organized immediately. A program  is already being implemented to electrify 350,000 homes during  the current financial year. A campaign will be launched at  every level of government, a public works program designed, and  all efforts made to involve the private sector, organized labor,  the civics, and other community organizations to rebuild our  townships, restore services in rural and urban areas, while  addressing the issue of job creation and training especially for  our unemployed youths. Many details of the overall  Reconstruction and Development Plan remain to be discussed,  agreed and put in place, but I believe that the broad outline I  have given, and the immediate initiates I have mentioned will  allow you to share my joy at the progress already made by the  government of national unity with regard to this important  matter. We shall carry out this plan within the context of a  policy aimed at building a strong and growing economy which will  benefit all our people.    I'd like to deal with a few matters in this regard. In  support of sustainable economic growth and the macro-economic  objectives, it will remain the primary objective of monetary  policy to promote and maintain overall financial stability. The  Reserve Bank has the important function of protecting the value  of our currency and striving for relative price stability at all  times. We are pleased that Dr. Chris Stals will continue to  serve as governor of the Reserve Bank.    The battle to reduce the rate of inflation will continue.  The realization of many of our objectives for a fair and equal  treatment of all our people will not be possible unless we  succeed in avoiding high inflation in the economy. We also face  a major challenge in reentering the global economy, while stable  prices are vital to the restructuring of our industries and  dealing with the critical issue of job creation. We are  blessed with a heritage of a sophisticated financial sector.  Our financial markets are well palced to play an important part  in the allocation of scarce funds to give effect to our economic  development program. It is however also necessary that we think  in new ways to meet the challenges of reconstruction and  development. We therefore welcome recent developments that  provide for the creation of community banks. We would also like  to encourage the greater participation of established financial  institutions in the important area of black economic empowerment  and support for the development of small and medium business.  The latter two areas of economic activity will receive the  greatest attention of the government because of their importance  in deracializing and democratizing the economy and creating the  jobs which our people need. So we will pay attention to the  important matter of consumer protection, to shield the ordinary  people of our country from unscrupulous business practices.    It is also clear that we must pay increased attention to  tourism. The jobs and privileges, the jobs and foreign currency  which tourism generates will strongly influence our economy.  The active and imaginative intervention of all stake holders in  this area of our national life must take advantage of the  excellent atmosphere created by our peaceful transition to  democracy to make tourism a major positive force in the future.    We look forward to the private sector as a whole playing a  central role in achieving the significantly high and sustainable  rates of economic growth to which we have referred. We are  convinced that the growth prospects of this sector will be  enhanced by the measures of fiscal discipline contained in our  approach to the Reconstruction and Development Program, by the  continued steady course of monetary policy. Furthermore, as  growth proceeds, more domestic savings will progressively become  available to finance increased investment at reasonable rates of  interest. The government is also acutely conscious of the fact  that we should work firstly to return the capital account of the  balance of payment to equilibrium and in due course to ensure a  net in flow of resources consistent with the experience of other  countries that enjoy more rapid growth rates.    The present situation of a dual currency and the existence  of  an exchange control apparatus is a direct result of the conflict  in which our country was embroiled in the past. As the  situation returns to normal, these arrangements will be  subjected to critical scrutiny. It should be possible to match  the steady growth of confidence at home and abroad with other  confidence enhancing modifications to everybody's benefit. The  government will also address all other matters that relate to  the creation of an attractive investment planning for both  domestic and foreign investments. Conscious of the fact that we  have to compete with the rest of the world in terms of  attracting, in particular, foreign direct investment. I'm  pleased that we've already started to address the important  questions of our trade policy guided by our GATT commitments and  the determination systematically to open the economy to global  competition in a carefully managed process. Soon we will also  begin trade negotiations with amongst others, the European  Union, the United States, our partners in the in the Southern  African Continent Customs Union and our neighbors in the  Southern African Development Community to provide stable and  mutually beneficial framework for our international economic  relations. We will also be looking very closely at the question  of enhancing South-South Cooperation in general as part of the  effort to expand our economic links with the rest of the world.    Consistent with our objective of creating a people-  centered society, and effectively to address the critical  questions of growth, reconstruction and development, we will  together with organized labor and the private sector, pay  special attention to the huge issue of human resource  development. Both the public and private sector will be  encouraged to regard labor as a resource and not a cost.  Education and training must therefore be looked at very closely  to ensure that we empower the workers, raise productivity levels  and meet the skills, needs, of a modern economy. Important work  will have to be done in and significant resources devoted to the  areas of science and technology, including research and  development. Government is also convinced that organized labor  is an important partner whose cooperation is crucial for the  reconstruction and development of our country. That partnership  requires, amongst other things, that our Labor Law be reformed  so that it is in line with international standards, apartheid  vestiges are removed and a more harmonious labor relations  dispensation is created on the basis of tripartite cooperation  between government, labor and capital.    The government is determined forcefully to confront the  scourge of unemployment, not by way of handouts, but by the  creation of work opportunities. The government will also deal  sensitively with the issue of population movements into the  country. To protect our workers, to guard against the  exploitation of vulnerable workers, and to ensure friendly  relations with all countries and peoples the government is also  taking urgent measures to deal firmly with drug trafficking,  some of which is carried out by foreign nationals who are  resident in the country. We must end racism in the work place,  as part of our common offensive against racism in general. No  more should words like kaffirs, Hottentots, coolies, boy, girl  and boss be part of our vocabulary. I also trust that the  matter of paying the workers for the public holidays proclaimed  in order to ensure their participation in the election and the  inauguration ceremonies will now be resolved as a result of  recent consultation. This will be a welcome demonstration by  the private sector of its involvement in the beautiful future we  are all trying to build.    We have devoted time to a discussion of economic questions  because they are fundamental to the realization of the  fundamental objectives of the Reconstruction and Development  Program. Below I mention some of the work in which the relevant  governments are already involved to translate these objectives  into realities. The government will take steps to ensure the  provision of clean water on the basis of the principle of water  security for all and the introduction of proper sanitation  sensitive to the protection of the environment.    We are determined to address the dire housing shortage in a  vigorous manner, acting together with the private sectors and  the communities in need of shelter.    Health also remains the fundamental building block of the  humane society we are determined to create through the  implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Program.  We must address the needs of the aged and the disabled, uplift  disadvantaged sectors, such as the women and the youth, and  improve the lives of our people in the rural communities and the  informal settlements. We must invest substantial amounts in  education and training and meet our commitment to introduce free  and compulsory education for a period of at least nine years.  Everywhere we must reinculcate the culture of learning and of  teaching, and make it possible for this culture to thrive. We  must combat such social fatalities as widespread poverty, the  breakdown of family life, crime, alcohol, and drug abuse, the  abuse of children, women and the elderly, and the painful  reality of street children. We are giving urgent attention to  the long waiting list for the payment of social grants which  have developed in some areas owing to lack of funds. I am  especially pleased that we have a ministry dedicated to the  issue of the environment. Its work must impact on many aspects  of national activity and address the question of the wellbeing  of society as a whole and the preservation of a healthy  environmental future, even for generations not yet born.    As we begin this address, we borrowed the words of Ingrid  Jonker to focus on the plight of the children of the country. I  would now like to say that the government will, as a matter of  urgency, attend to the tragic and complex question of children  and juveniles in detention and prison. The basci principle from  which we will proceed from now onwards is that we must rescue  the children of the nation and ensure that the system of  criminal justice must be the very last resort in the case of  juvenile offenders.    I have therefore issued instructions to the departments  concerned, as a matter of urgency, to work out the necessary  guidelines which will enable us to empty our prisons of children  and to place them in suitable alternative care. This is in  addition to an amnesty for various categories of serving  prisoners as will be affected in terms of what I said in my  inauguration address two weeks ago.    In this context, I also need to make the point that the  government will also not delay unduly with regard to attending  to the vexed and unresolved issues of an amnesty for criminal  activities carried out in furtherance of political objectives.    We will attend to this matter in a balanced and dignified  way. The nation must come to terms with its past in a spirit of  openness and forgiveness and proceed to build the future on the  basis of repairing and healing. The burden of the past lies  heavily on all of us, including those responsible for inflicting  injury and those who suffered.    Following the letter and spirit of the constitution, we will  prepare the legislation which will seek to free the wrongdoers  from fear of retribution and blackmail, while acknowledging the  injury of those who have been harmed so that the individual  wrongs, injuries, fears and hopes affecting individuals are  identified and attended to.    In the meantime, summoning the full authority of the  position  we represent, we call on all concerned not to take any step that  might, in any way, impede or compromise the processes of  reconciliation which the impending legislation will address.    The problem of politically motivated violence is still with  us. We depend on our country's security forces to deal with this  problem using all resources at their disposal. In this, and in  their efforts to deal especially with criminal violence, they  have our personal support and confidence.    We have also directed that all relevant ministries should  engage the structures set up in terms of the national peace  accord so that these can be invigorated to pursue their noble  mission in the context of the changed circumstances in our  country.    The government will otherwise not spare any effort in  ensuring that our security forces enjoy the standing they  deserve of being accepted by all our people the defenders of our  sovereignty, our democratic system, the guarantors of a just  peace within the country and the safety and security of all  citizens and their property.    Let me also take this opportunity to reiterate our assurance  to the rest of the public service that the government is firmly  committed to the protection of the rights of all members of this  service. We are also determined to work with the organisations  of the service to ensure that we have the democratic,  non-racial, non-sexist, honest and accountable corps of public  servants which members of the public service themselves desire.    In this context, we must also make the observation that the  government will not waver from the principle of achieving parity  in remuneration and conditions of service among all workers in  the public sector.    The youth of our country are the valued possession of the  nation. Without them there can be no future. Their needs are  immense and urgent. They are at the center of our reconstruction  and development plan.    To address them, acting with the youth themselves, the  government will engage the representative organisations of the  youth and other formations, among other things to look at the  siting of a broad-based national commission on youth development  among the structures of government. Building on this base the  government and the commission would then work together to ensure  that the nurturing of our youth stands at the centre of our  reconstruction and development, without being consigned to a  meaningless ghetto of public life.    Similar considerations must attach to the equally important  question of the emancipation of the women of our country. It is  vitally important that all structure of government, including  the president himself, should understand this fully that freedom  cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from  all forms of oppression.    All of us must take this on board that the objectives of the  Reconstruction and Development Programme will not have been  realised unless we see in visible and practical terms that the  condition of the women of our country has radically changed for  the better and that they have been empowered to intervene in  all aspects of life as equals with any other member of society.    In addition to the establishment of the statutory gender  commission provided for in the constitution, the government  will, together with the representatives of the women themselves,  look at the establishment of organs of government to ensure that  all levels of the public sector, from top to bottom, integrate  the central issue of the emancipation of women in their  programmes and daily activities.    Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the dream of Ingrid Jonker will  come  to fruition. The child grown to a man will trek through all  Africa. The child grown to a journey will journey all over the  world -- without a pass!    Tomorrow, on Africa Day, our new flag will be hoisted in an  historic ceremony at the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa, with  the OAU having already agreed to accept us as its latest member.  [applause]    Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the UN Security Council will meet  to  lift the last remaining sanctions against South Africa and to  position the world organisation to relate to our country as an  honoured, responsible and peace-loving citizen.    As such, the government is involved in discussion to  determine what our contribution could be to the search for peace  in Angola and Rwanda; to the reinforcement of the peace process  in Mozambique; to the establishment of a new world order of  mutually beneficial cooperation, justice, prosperity and peace  for ourselves and for the nations of the world.    Yesterday the cabinet also decided to apply for our country  to join the Commonwealth. This important community of nations is  waiting to receive us with open arms.    We have learnt the lesson that out blemishes speak of what  all humanity should not do. We understand this fully that our  glories point to the heights of what human genius can achieve.    In our dreams we have vision of all our country at play in  our sportsfields and enjoying deserved and enriching recreation  in our theaters, galleries, beaches, mountains, plains and game  parks, in conditions of peace, security and comfort.    Our road to that glorious future lies through collective  hard  work to accomplish the objective of creating a people-centred  society through the implementation of the vision contained in  our Reconstruction and Development Plan.    Let us all get down to work!    I declare this session of Parliament formerly open.</p>

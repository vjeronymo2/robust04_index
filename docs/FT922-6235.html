			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Hiroshima airport terminal SCHAL ASSOCIATES INC, a Bovis Inc company, has been awarded a contract for construction of a Pounds 60m terminal building at the New Hiroshima Airport in Japan. It is the company's second major airport contract in Japan and the third contract in Japan this year and brings the value of Japanese construction work in which Schal is currently involved to more than USDollars 800m (Pounds 437m). The 390,000 sq ft terminal building will be of three-storey reinforced concrete design, incorporating wings for domestic and international passenger operations as well as cargo facilities. It is due for completion in September 1993. Schal will construct the terminal as part of a joint venture with Takenaka Corporation. New Hiroshima will replace the downtown airport, which lacks space for expansion. The new airport, 25 miles east of the city centre, is being constructed by a massive cut and fill operation in rural hill country. It will be connected with the city by a newly completed expressway. The Hiroshima airport terminal is being designed by MHS/Austin JV, a Japanese-American joint venture. Schal is also constructing the control tower and administration building for the New Kansai International Airport in Osaka. Schal Associates is a subsidiary of New York-based Bovis Inc, the US construction arm of P&amp;O.</p>

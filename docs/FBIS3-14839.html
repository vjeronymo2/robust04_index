			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Aldona </F> Svirbutaviciute in Vilnius on 9 February: "President -- Already  or Only a Year?..."; first paragraph is TIESA introduction]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Svirbutaviciute] A year  after the presidential elections on 9 February, I asked  President A. Brazauskas how he would today reply to the question  as to what path Lithuania has chosen and what course it will  continue to follow.    [Brazauskas] This will be the continuation of the  course that Lithuania followed last year. We are conducting  reforms and trying to make well-considered moves. One must  always see our weaknesses and losses. I pose very many  requirements to the executive power, because state management is  difficult. These issues are difficult to resolve, although some  people used to think differently in the past. It does not  matter what people will be in power in the future. The  important thing is that the state must be run by professionals.  Decisions of the executive power, their quality and rate of  adoption -- this is what the authorities must care about.  Recently, there has been much talk about government officials.  I have become strongly convinced that we must not only speak  about them but also create a basis for the adoption of  government decisions. I am speaking about the activities and  the quality of the executive power. I do not maintain, however,  that we must replace the latter and elect a new one. I am for  the stability of the government and its institutions. If one  cannot perform one's duties well today but wants to learn this,  he or she must receive support. I see from many facts that we  are unable to do many things, but we are willing to learn. My  goal is to achieve considerable improvement in this sphere in  1994. I want us to adopt the law on government officials and  other indispensable acts, impart responsibility, and define the  functions of ministries and departments. [passage omitted]    [Svirbutaviciute] The president, as number-one person in  Lithuania, is often observed as if through a magnifying glass.  This observation started long before the Seimas and,  particularly, the presidential elections. It has continued  until now. How have you managed to reconcile this, and how do  you assess the reprimands concerning the rejected draft law on  the declaration of property and income of government officials  and employees?    [Brazauskas] By using the right of legislation, the  president's office is currently drafting a new law. We intend  to promulgate it. This law must correspond to the spirit of the  Lithuanian Constitution. One cannot single out one group of  persons, think that they are "swindlers," and prepare the law  specially for them. This is not the case in the world. We are  drafting it based on the experience of the world where the  declaration of property is commonplace. I have always said that  I will be the first to declare my property and income. I  suppose that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction in  the Seimas [parliament] did not adhere to its principles in  voting for this law. Such a law cannot exist. The concept of  family is particularly confused there. It follows from this law  that both my parents and my children, who have not lived with me  for more than 15 years already and who have their own families,  are accountable for my property. It is paradoxical that even  minor children must declare their assets: The pants that a  mother buys for her son will have to be declared. The majority  of those who accuse me most blatantly for rejecting this law  have never read it. For example, during my visit to Klaipeda I  asked the people there whether they had read it, and the reply  was negative. So why are they accusing me? All people must  declare their property and income. This is not easy and cannot  be achieved immediately. Let us adopt this law by stages and  steps. The president, the government, and Seimas deputies must  declare their income in the first place, and later be followed  by others. This law is not an instrument for catching crooks.  The target of such laws throughout the world is to collect  taxes from citizens which they owe the state. That is why I  vetoed this draft law. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Observer: Goldman wonder If all private partnerships suffer from envy, Goldman Sachs must have an acute case; the rank and file always feels the partners keep the goodies all to themselves. At Goldman, where 150 partners are reputed to have earned more than the rest of the 9,000 staff last year, the problem has reached its most extreme form. Perhaps that explains why the US investment bank has just opened the partnership door a little wider. The firm has elevated 58 staffers to the ranks of the fabulously wealthy, compared with 35 in the previous biannual promotion. But for every new partner there will be dozens of ambitious types who will be bitterly disappointed that they were overlooked. If not made a Goldman partner by your mid-30s, the chances are pretty slim you will make the grade. Add in the fact that an increasing number of the privileged few are retiring early and the average age of retirement is now down to 47, it's easy to see why Goldman veterans who have been passed over for partnership could easily become demoralised. So far in 1994, Goldman's profits are reckoned to be running at little more than a quarter of last year's. Hence the gap between the earnings of the partners and the also-rans is not quite so startling as last year. However, the problem has not gone away. With roughly a third of Goldman's partners now being new boys, it's hard to believe they will want to change the increasingly anachronistic payments system.</p>

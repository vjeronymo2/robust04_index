			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / US drug makers in anti-trust move MAKERS of pharmaceuticals in the US are to ask the Justice Department for an exemption from prosecution under US anti-trust laws so that they can discuss ways to control drug prices. The drug industry has come under attack in recent weeks from Congress and from the Clinton administration. It is confronted by claims that its products are more expensive in the US than in other countries, and that it has failed to fulfil pledges to limit price rises to the rate of US consumer price inflation. But, at a meeting with White House officials this week, representatives of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association and of the major drug companies endorsed President Bill Clinton's blueprint for reforming the US health care system and gave their support to specific measures to curb price increases. The drug-makers' association will send a letter to the Justice Department by the weekend to ask for permission for companies to discuss price restraints and enforcement mechanisms. Such discussions would ordinarily be outlawed by US anti-trust laws. The association also urged the administration to seek commitments to price restraint from individual companies. Already ten leading US manufacturers, representing about 40 per cent of the market, have independently made such pledges. At the meeting this week with Mr Ira Magaziner, a senior White House adviser on domestic policy issues, the industry representatives gave their support to the 'managed competition' approach which Mr Clinton has adopted to health care reform. They also supported the inclusion of prescription drugs in the standard insurance benefits package which would be a component of the managed competition approach.</p>

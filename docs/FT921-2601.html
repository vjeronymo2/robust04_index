			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Toyota and GM strike Australian joint venture deal TOYOTA of Japan and General Motors of the US yesterday announced a merger of some of the activities of their Australian subsidiaries in a joint venture company - United Australian Automotive Industries (UAAI). UAAI will co-ordinate the design, engineering and model-sharing activities of General Motors-Holden's Automotive (GMHA) and Toyota Australia. However, the Australian subsidiaries will maintain separate corporate structures and their manufacturing and sales activities will remain largely unchanged. The deal falls significantly short of early indications that the venture would take control of both companies' production facilities in Australia. UAAI, formed in 1988, was intended to run the two companies' production from July 1989. The more modest agreement is thought to be the result of corporate differences between the two groups. Toyota has also committed itself to building a ADollars 420m (USDollars 315.70m) manufacturing plant on a greenfield site in Melbourne. GMHA has no plans for expansion. Senator John Button, the Australian industry minister, said the completion of the agreement was an 'historic decision' which would enable the companies to achieve economies of scale and efficiency savings. However, the agreement appeared to offer little progress towards the government's objective of a more streamlined industry capable of competing in an open market against overseas imports. The joint venture proposal emerged after the announcement in 1985 of a government rationalisation plan for the industry, in which five foreign-owned manufacturers compete for a market of 17m people. The plan provided for tariff protection to be progressively reduced from a nominal rate of 57.5 per cent in 1985 to 35 per cent from January this year. The government announced last May that tariff protection would be cut by a further 2.5 points a year from next year, to a target of 15 per cent by 2000, to force the companies to speed up rationalisation. New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated (NUMMI), the US-based joint car-making venture between GM and Toyota, said its board has approved a Dollars 339m investment for the production of the 1993 Toyota Corolla model and the Geo Prizm, writes Alan Friedman in New York. A top Ford Motor executive has called for trade restrictions aimed at Japanese car-makers. Mr Allan Gilmour, who heads Ford's worldwide automotive division, said Ford would like to see Japan limit exports to the US to about 1.3m vehicles a year. This would compare with current Japanese exports to the US of about 1.7m units a year, well below the 2.3m limit agreed by Japanese car makers and the Japanese government.</p>

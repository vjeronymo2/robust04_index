			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mixed results for US retailers MIXED fortunes in the US retail sector were apparent yesterday when JC Penney, the large department store group, and The Limited, the specialty retailer, reported second-quarter earnings. Penney, based in Dallas, fared better, posting after-tax profits of Dollars 80m in the 13 weeks to July 25. This compares with Dollars 31m in the same period a year ago, and is scored on sales of Dollars 3.79bn, up by 9.6 per cent on the same period a year earlier. This takes Penney's sales in the first half to Dollars 7.58bn, a 10.1 per cent advance on the first six months of 1991, and net profits to Dollars 216m from Dollars 111m. The figures were helped by a Dollars 15m drop in interest charges to Dollars 61m, thanks to a debt restructuring programme. Mr William Howell, Penney's chairman, said sales of autumn merchandise were 'particularly encouraging' in the latter part of the quarter. He added that Penney still expected 'favourable results' during the second half. By contrast, The Limited, the fashion retailer which takes in Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, had a 'disappointing' second quarter. After-tax profits were flat at Dollars 80.1m compared with Dollars 79.2m, while sales stood at Dollars 1.49bn against Dollars 1.35bn. This takes the group's profits for the first six months to Dollars 131.6m, little changed from the previous year's Dollars 130.1m, with sales totalling Dollars 2.9bn up from Dollars 2.66bn. Mr Leslie Wexner, The Limited chairman, admitted that consumer uncertainty had persisted, but blamed the figures on 'below standard merchandising decisions'. He added that he was encouraged by early customer acceptance of the fall fashions. 'While we will be able to develop a better understanding of fall when we analyse the last half of August and early September sales. I am guardedly optimistic.' Later, Nordstrom, the west coast-based fashion retailer, released the sector's worst figures for the day. It revealed that second-quarter profits after tax fell from Dollars 49.9m to Dollars 41.7m, on sales of Dollars 951.6m (Dollars 904.1m). This takes profits for the six months to end-July to Dollars 63.2m, down from Dollars 75.5m in the same period of 1991. The company said existing stores were keeping pace, in sales terms, with the previous year, but there was no sign of 'any marked increase in consumer spending'. Nordstrom shares tumbled Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 . Penney shares, which have risen strongly, dipped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 , while The Limited lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 , close to their 52-week low.</p>

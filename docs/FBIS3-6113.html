			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Where Is Japan Leading the Situation To?"] </F>   [Text] The Japanese authorities are blocking the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Recently, Japanese  Foreign Minister Hata unprecedentedly picked on us by raving  that we are going to produce nuclear weapons, that we are  suspected of possessing one or two nuclear bombs, and that if  North Korea refuses inspections again, or takes a vacillating  attitude, or uses the nuclear card in a strange manner, Japan  will take a staunch countermeasure within the boundary of the  constitution.    We cannot but take it seriously because Japan's top  diplomatic authority personally came out to make such remarks.  The Japanese foreign minister's remarks, which were made at a  time when Japan's nuclear armament has actually reached a danger  line and the Japanese reactionaries are seeking a legitimate  pretext for nuclear armament, are in fact no different from an  official announcement that Japan will openly proceed with  nuclear armament.    The problem is serious because Japan's nuclear armament is  one of decisive obstacles that block the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula. For the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula to become truly meaningful, it has to be able to  guarantee peace and security of the region. However, under the  condition that Japan's nuclear armament is becoming dangerous in  actuality, even if the Korean peninsula is denuclearized, it  will be useless being not able to guarantee peace and security  of the region.    Particularly, Japan's attempt to legalize the nuclear  armament is bringing about a crisis of invalidating the Joint  Declaration of Denuclearization between the North and the South.  The objectives of the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization  between the North and the South are to remove the risk of a  nuclear war by denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, to form a  favorable condition and environment for our country's peace and  peaceful reunification, and to contribute to peace and security  of Asia and the world.    Japan's nuclear armament is bringing about an opposite  result. Japan's nuclear armament is aggravating the nuclear  threat on the Korean peninsula and forming a situation of  tension.    Since long ago, we have felt that the Joint Declaration of  Denuclearization between the North and the South is useless as  long as Japan's nuclear armament attempt is not withdrawn. The  more Japanese authorities take issue with our nuclear issue in  an attempt to legalize their nuclear armament, the stronger such  a feeling grows.    Because of this, we cannot but raise the question whether or  not the Joint Declaration of Denuclearization between the North  and the South is necessary. Judging from all these, we may face  a situation of having no choice but to reconsider our position  regarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. [urinun  choson pandoui pihaekhwae taehan chagiui ipchangul chaegoryo  haji anulsu omnun chongse-e chohage toelsudo isumnida]    If this happens, the situation will flare to an  unpredictable  one and this will not benefit the United States and South Korea  either. The Japanese authorities should take all the  responsibilities. The Japanese authorities should carefully  think about the dear price their remarks and behavior have to  pay and act with discretion.</p>

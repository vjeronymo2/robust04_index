			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS LEARN TO REACH OVER CULTURAL LINES  </P> <P> Theresa Pro's Southeast Asian students spoke so softly that she could barely  hear them. Vivienne Bocarsly had to tell her Latino students, "Look me in the  eye." Juliet Beacham didn't know why Asian kids smiled when they bumped into  someone in the hallway.  </P> <P> Margarita Castaneda said her first-graders from Central America were  unnaturally spooked at loud noises, such as a whistle blown on the playground  or a book dropped on the floor.  </P> <P> Such behavior, which may seem strange to Americans, is popping up more and more  as students from other cultures enroll in the Los Angeles Unified School  District. In response, the district has instituted cross-cultural training  seminars at 14 elementary and junior-high schools in the San Fernando Valley  and has scheduled more in other areas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Showing Respect  </P> <P> At a session at Lanai Road School in Encino, teachers learned that looking down  and speaking softly are signs of respect in Southeast Asian and Latino cultures  and that a smile can be an apology in some Asian cultures.  </P> <P> Erica Hagen, a former television actress who conducts the workshops for the  school district, said remnants of students' days in war-torn countries may crop  up at school. Teachers have told her, she said, of times when an airplane would  fly over or a car would backfire, and Salvadoran and Vietnamese students would  dive for the floor.  </P> <P> Hagen, from the Immaculate Heart College Center in Los Angeles, demonstrated  common gestures that are offensive to students from other cultures.  </P> <P> A curled index finger, she noted, beckons another person in the United States  but is reserved for beckoning animals or for challenging someone to fight in  several Asian countries. In Iran, a thumb-up gesture is "extremely obscene,"  she said.  </P> <P> Halloween, she said, can be a horrifying holiday for Southeast Asian children,  who are raised to believe in good and evil spirits. Their parents "use ghosts  to control kids; if you're not good, ghosts will get you," she said.  </P> <P> Children often get contradictory messages at home and at school. Smiling is  undignified for Korean men, so while teachers might instruct a Korean boy to  smile for his class photo, his parents demand a stoic countenance, Hagen said.  </P> <P> What parents may demand as respectful conduct, teachers may regard as rude, she  said in the seminars. Children are to speak softly and lower their eyes before  elders in some Asian and Latino cultures, but U.S. teachers often believe such  behavior means that children are not paying attention, she said.  </P> <P> "We need to value diversity," Hagen said, suggesting that teachers say: "I  understand it's rude to look in adults' eyes in your culture, and it's  important to continue doing that in your culture. But with American adults, you  may want to practice looking into their eyes."  </P> <P> This year, about 61,600 students, or 10.4% of the district's total, are  immigrants who have attended U.S. schools less than three years, up from 51,000  or 8.7% last year, said Lila Silvern, coordinator of the district's programs  for immigrant and refugee children. The nation's second-largest school district  has a fourth of the nation's immigrant students and a third of the state's, she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Years in U.S.  </P> <P> Region E of the district, which covers the Valley south of Roscoe Boulevard and  includes students bused into the area, has 7,434 immigrants in kindergarten  through eighth grade. These students -- 12% of the region's total -- have been  in U.S. schools three years or less, Silvern said.  </P> <P> The district tries to help immigrant students adapt, with six-week crash  courses in American culture and English, and with bilingual classes. But the  six-week courses will accommodate only about 13,000 students this year --  one-fifth of those who need them, Silvern said.  </P> <P> Another tactic is to help the teachers adapt through the cross-cultural  workshops. The sessions are funded in the Valley by Immaculate Heart center --  an independent, nonprofit organization that promotes education of immigrant  students -- the school district and Pacific Bell, district officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Telling Differences  </P> <P> "Many teachers can't distinguish between a Mexican immigrant from a little town  and a Salvadoran from a war-torn country," said Maria Casillas, operations  administrator for Region E. "But the conditions they came from are different,  so the way they respond in the classroom is different."  </P> <P> Hagen, who taught in refugee camps in Thailand for a year and a half, noted in  the workshops that education is stressed in Asian cultures and that a student's  poor performance can bring shame on an entire family.  </P> <P> Pro, a third-grade teacher at Hazeltine Avenue Elementary School in Van Nuys,  said such values might explain why some Southeast Asian parents cried when she  criticized their children for such minor infractions as talking loudly in class  or skipping homework.  </P> <P> Bocarsly, also a Hazeltine teacher, said that her Latino students called her  "teacher" or "maestra," and she told them, "I would like to be called Mrs.  Bocarsly." She later learned at a workshop at her school that the students  believed it would have been a sign of disrespect to address her by name --  students can only address peers by name.  </P> <P> Many children of war bring survivor guilt with them, Hagen said in one seminar.  "They ask, 'Why did I survive when my family died?' They can't talk about this  at home, so ask them about it," she urged teachers.  </P> <P> Some teachers said they do not have to ask. Pro said her Laotian and Cambodian  third-graders will suddenly raise their hands and blurt out tales of witnessing  their fathers, sisters or other family members die.  </P> <P> Castaneda, a bilingual teacher at Encino School, said one of her pupils will  start sobbing quietly in a corner of the classroom. "The children tell me  so-and-so is crying. I console them, and then the story comes out."  </P> <P> "It's as if they just had to get it out," Pro said. "Maybe they're searching  for answers."  </P> <P> At Hazeltine, where the student body is about 55% Latino and 23% Southeast  Asian, some of the experiences emerged in an assignment to write a story,  complete with dedication and author's notes. An 11-year-old Cambodian boy wrote  an adaptation of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," in which, instead of  porridge, the bears eat rice soup.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brothers, Sisters Dead  </P> <P> His autobiographical note read: "I have five sisters, but three of them died.  One more of my big sisters is in Thailand with my grandmother. I also have four  big brothers. Three died, and one is in Thailand with my grandmother. That made  me sad and angry."  </P> <P> Mary Douglas, who mainly teaches Cambodian children at Hazeltine, recalled that  when the 1987 Whittier earthquake hit, "within an hour, all the Cambodians came  to get their children -- because they'd been through so much, they wanted to  get their family together as quickly as possible."  </P> <P> In her seminars, Hagen called for understanding -- and for patience. The  average time a teacher gives a student to answer a question is two seconds, she  said.  </P> <P> "Even for American kids, it's not enough time," she said, noting that  immigrants have to "translate the question into their native language, think of  the answer, then translate the answer back to spit it out in English.  </P> <P> "If the child thinks the teacher is going to move on to another kid, he's not  even going to bother to think of the answer," she said.  </P> <P> But some teachers are reluctant to embrace Hagen's message: "I feel that we do  the best we can and that we are in the U.S. and have our own customs that all  should assimilate to. Other countries would not do it for us," a Sherman Oaks  Elementary School teacher wrote on a critique form.  </P> <P> Mickey Mandell, a Lanai Road School teacher, said that since the Valley's  student population is no longer "lily-white" and fluent in English, "I've got  to become a psychologist, interpeter and remember all the different ways to  talk to people."  </P> <P> Regina Sahani, a teacher at Sherman Oaks ELementary School, said  misunderstandings between cultures have hit home. Sahani and her family  immigrated from India in 1985. Two years ago, she said, a Valley magnet school  director said her son, who wears a turban for religious reasons, could not  attend the school because "we don't accept funny hats." The conflict was  eventually resolved, and the boy attended the school.  </P> <P> But students, as well as teachers, are adapting, school administrators said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Feeling More Secure  </P> <P> A few years ago, Southeast Asians at Hazeltine would cry at the sound of sirens  screeching, which to them was a sound of war, Principal Nathan Glickman said.  </P> <P> Now, he said, the crying has stopped. The Asian population at school and in the  neighborhood has increased, and many of the children have older siblings who  have gone to Hazeltine. "There seems to be a much more secure feeling."  </P> <P> Six years ago, Glickman said, he discovered a Cambodian boy with red stripes on  his back and abdomen. The marks were reported to authorities as child abuse,  but after consulting with Southeast Asians, Glickman discovered that the  stripes resulted from a home remedy called "coining." (To treat such ills as  chest congestion, balm is applied to the skin and a coin is rubbed in a  pattern, which breaks capillaries.)  </P> <P> Glickman said such unusual practices are a thing of the past at his school  nowadays. "Parents are assimilating. They probably give a couple of aspirin  now.  </P> <P> "It's all part of the growing process -- on our part as well as theirs," he  said.  </P></p>

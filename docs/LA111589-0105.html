			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: LOTTERY AUDITED HEAVILY AND OFTEN  </P> <P> Question: Your earlier column about the California Lottery was excellent, but a  great number of Lottery players (since the beginning) are starting to harbor  some suspicions concerning the handling of the monies taken in and disbursed by  Lottery officials. Does anybody audit their activities and is there a regularly  published report? If so, where and how can we get a copy of it? If there is no  published information, would you take this on as a project? I think the public  is entitled to detailed knowledge of their activities.  </P> <P> L.K.  </P> <P> Answer: If auditors were termites, the California Lottery building in  Sacramento would be under a perpetual extermination tent.  </P> <P> "Boy, are we ever audited!" is the reaction of Joanne McNabb, the Lottery's  communications manager. "You wouldn't believe it." The curious structure of any  state's lottery makes it a natural for far more auditing than a comparable  private business would require or, for that matter, tolerate.  </P> <P> "While it's like a private business in many ways, since it is selling a  product," McNabb says, "it's also a public entity, so there's a real need for  extra-thorough auditing." The Lottery has its own independent auditing  department, which periodically moves in without warning and audits the books of  all units handling the Lottery.  </P> <P> On top of this, McNabb said, the State Controller's office maintains a  permanent staff of 16 auditors "right here in our building, and the Lottery  pays all of the salaries and other expenses involved in the activity."  </P> <P> Furthermore, auditing the entire operation on a quarterly and annual basis is  the national accountancy firm of Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "And," McNabb says, "of course, anyone who wants a copy of the latest statement  can get one from us at any time."  </P> <P> Just write to: Public Affairs Office, California State Lottery, 600 N. 10th  St., Sacramento 95814. You can expedite this by including a magazine-size  manila envelope.  </P></p>

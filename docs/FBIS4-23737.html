			<p>BFN     [Text] Government troops are far from stopping their  barbaric acts. Today at around 0600, while representatives of  the two armies were meeting at the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda [UNAMIR] headquarters, government soldiers and Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for  the Defense of the Republic militias abducted 32 people from  their refuge at the Saint-Famille parish in Kigali. When this  information reached the Rwandan Patriotic Front representatives,  they left for the Saint-Famille parish in the company of UNAMIR  officials to obtain details of the incident. This doubtlessly  forced the abductors to release their victims. Evacuation  operations, which were affected today by the barbaric acts of  government soldiers, will resume tomorrow.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Suspicion remains rooted in opposing communities - The reactions of Protestants and Catholics in Belfast In the Berlin Arms on the Shankill Road in loyalist west Belfast yesterday, John, a 68-year-old retired postman and one-time Irish fusilier, turned his back on the television image of a British and Irish prime minister and gazed into his pint of stout with an air of disgust. 'This is a lot of eye wash. They're not being straight with us. We are ready to fight here. And they had better bloody believe it.' A sense of suspicion if not betrayal about what lies behind the declaration appears to run deep through the unionist grassroots. The Berlin Arms is just a block away from the scene of a recent IRA bomb attack. The pub, protected by a security door, is a place of assembly for Protestants who feel threatened not just by the IRA but by the concept of Irish unity they suspect is the real purpose behind the complex wording of the declaration. Mr Major may seek to reassure this community with his constitutional guarantees, but the Shankill's history has bred gut reactions rather than political analysis. John, who would not give his full name for fear of IRA reprisal, showed me his Orange Cross - a loyalist identity card with the following statement: 'I am a loyal British subject pledged to uphold the constitution of our country against republicanism and subversion.' Next to him, 30-year-old Mr Brian Warnock, a motor mechanic, admitted to having 'some Catholic friends' and not being opposed to Sinn Fein being brought into talks if the IRA renounced violence 'for ever'. But he echoed the older man's deeper sentiment. 'I am suspicious because Dublin is involved. I think that means we could get sold down the river.' Elsewhere in Ulster, some Catholics were disappointed with the agreement, and thought it might not persuade the IRA to stop. One man admitted: 'When you see the unionists on television smirking and telling us they're happy enough, you begin to think: 'Right, they are going to screw us, aren't they?' 'I want the peace. I could take you to 10 houses right now, and nine of them agree with me. They've had enough. It's the guy in the tenth house I worry about. He may not be ready to pack in.' Mrs Joyce McCartan, a 65-year-old Catholic who has lost 12 family members in the violence, was more optimistic: 'We have a real chance here, and if people like Paisley and Robinson keep their mouths shut, then we can get the peace we all desire.'</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE BOXING;  </P> <P> RAMOS HOTDOGS, BUT CAN'T CUT MUSTARD WITH LOPEZ  </P> <P> Pablo Ramos tried to show off a little Monday night, but all it did was set off  Ben Lopez. Lopez of Upland landed a short but powerful left to the chin of  Ramos at 1:33 of the third round to end the super featherweight bout in front  of 1,142 at the Irvine Marriott.  </P> <P> Both fighters attacked, and Lopez had the better of the first two rounds, but  Ramos offered some additional incentive. At one point in the first round, he  dropped his gloves out to his sides and smiled to show Lopez the punches didn't  hurt much.  </P> <P> In the second, Ramos stopped and rested on the ropes with another smirk after  Lopez finished a pair of combinations. Other times, Ramos (18-5) leaned his  head forward with a giant grin to taunt Lopez as he moved around the ring.  </P> <P> "It got me a little more upset," Lopez said of the antics. "It made me want to  knock him out more . . . In the first round I just sat back and took punches. I  was testing his power.  </P> <P> "After that, I knew he couldn't hurt me so I just went after him. I wanted to  work on my right, but the left is my baby and it was there."  </P> <P> After Lopez (16-6) threw the final punch, he tripped over Ramos as Lopez went  across the ring. It was the 11th knockout for Lopez, who is the state super  featherweight champion. This was a non-title defense.  </P> <P> "I wanted to follow him," Lopez said. "I wanted to make a face at him before he  went down, but it was too late."  </P> <P> Ramos was on his back for about two minutes but left the ring under his own  power.  </P> <P> The main-event knockout completed a sweep of sorts Monday night. There were six  knockouts in six fights.  </P> <P> In earlier bouts: Shane Kaplan, who is becoming a crowd favorite, scored an  impressive third-round knockout. Kaplan of Irvine floored Kelly Green of  Ontario at 155 pounds as several stood to cheer.  </P> <P> Kaplan also brings a following of some 20 or so friends, much like the noisy  group that supports John Armijo, the fighting lifeguard from Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Kaplan made his professional debut last month at Irvine and scored a  first-round knockout.  </P> <P> Jesus Castenada of La Habra scored a first-round knockout over Carlos Valdivia  of San Diego at 182 pounds. Castenada (5-5) dropped Valdivia (0-1) at 2:30 into  the first round, then continued his attack until he got the knockout with one  second left in the round.  </P> <P> Joey Martin of Anaheim also scored a knockout, this one coming in the third  round. Martin (2-0) stopped Steve Turchetta 30 seconds into the third round of  the 141-pound bout.  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> Ernie Chavez of Santa Ana takes on Mario Solorio of Ventura in the next main  event, Sept. 27 . . . The bouts switch to Thursday night for the rest of the  year, so as not to compete with Monday night football telecasts. Besides Sept.  27, fights will be held Oct. 25th and Nov. 29.  </P></p>

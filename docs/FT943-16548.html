			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Someone to sail the trade winds: The new World Trade Organisation leader will shape its role on the international stage Wanted: dynamic leader for new international institution. The ideal candidate will possess global strategic vision, yet be at home with technical complexity, while combining a diplomat's finesse with proven administrative skills and the instincts and forceful leadership of a seasoned politician. This superman - or superwoman - is being sought to head the World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade early next year. The new body will have a more formal structure, stronger disciplinary powers and, potentially, a far more wide-ranging role than its 47-year-old predecessor. Governments and trade policy experts worldwide have expressed optimism that the WTO will develop into a pre-eminent forum for international policymaking, which will take the lead in creating a framework for the orderly management of global economic change into the next century. It is widely agreed that the WTO's influence will depend critically on the choice of its first director-general. 'Whoever does this job, and does it well, will leave a mark on history,' says Professor John Jackson of Michigan University, a leading authority on international trade law. That prospect has triggered a race in which the declared candidates so far are President Carlos Salinas of Mexico; Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister who has also been canvassed as a possible president of the European Commission; Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister. More names may emerge before the lists close at the end of this month. Much as trade policy purists may wish the appointment to be decided solely on merit, political manoeuvring is set to play a big role. The final choice, expected to be reached by informal consensus in late autumn, will be heavily influenced by the interplay of national pride, regional rivalries, economic self-interest and mutual suspicion among Gatt's members. Already, the competing Mexican and Brazilian claims on the post have divided loyalties in Latin America. An even more bruising confrontation  - or a stalemate - may develop if the US bats strongly for Mr Salinas, and the European Union digs in behind Mr Ruggiero. The decision also risks becoming entangled in wider horse-trading over other heavyweight international appointments this year. Besides the presidency of the European Commission they include the top jobs at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Western European Union. All this points to a much more complicated choice than last year's appointment of Mr Peter Sutherland as Gatt's director-general, a post he will vacate soon for personal reasons. Mr Sutherland's candidacy swiftly gathered support because he was widely perceived as the right man to tackle the biggest challenge then facing the world trade system - completion of the protracted Uruguay Round negotiations. The WTO head will be handed a far less clear-cut mandate. Views on the body's role and the job's functions vary widely, reflecting the differing political interests and economic priorities of those who will have a say in filling it. The WTO was inspired by plans in the 1940s for an International Trade Organisation, intended as a stablemate for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. When the US Congress vetoed the idea, the Gatt was set up on a 'provisional' basis. But the ITO was conceived in a world far different from that in which the WTO will be born. While the original design was drawn up for about 50 countries, most with war-shattered economies, the new body will start with more than 120 members, ranging from super-rich to dirt poor. Gatt has coped with this diversity by allowing countries to opt out of some of its commitments. But every WTO member will be required to sign up to almost all its obligations. Furthermore, in contrast to the IMF and World Bank, where voting power is weighted in favour of wealthy countries, each WTO member will have an equal vote. Gatt has an impressive record of forging consensus, which has satisfied big countries without trampling on small ones. But some observers believe that will be harder in future. 'Creating consensus in the WTO will be enormously difficult,' says Mr William Brock, a trade policy consultant who served as President Ronald Reagan's top trade negotiator. The organisation's cohesion will be tested by a growing array of challenges, which reflect the changing focus of trade policy and shifts in the structure of the world economy. They include: The thrust of liberalisation efforts into largely uncharted territory, such as the treatment of foreign direct investment and services. Pressure to address links between trade and complex - and often highly emotive - questions such as minimum labour standards and environment policy. The impact of sudden capital market and currency fluctuations from which, some experts fear, countries could seek to insulate themselves through trade barriers. The accession of about 20 further countries, led by China. Mounting stresses within countries, particularly in the industrialised world, as they face increasingly fierce global competition. 'All the instincts of the main industrialised countries are to seek security and slow the pace of change,' says Mr Brock. 'Only the really aggressive emerging economies will have a free hand in pressing ahead. Everyone else is constrained by problems at home.' The head of the WTO can potentially wield much influence over how these problems are tackled, and over the future global policy agenda. However, the job enjoys limited formal powers and resources. The Gatt secretariat, which the WTO will inherit, has a SFr94m (Pounds 45m) budget this year and only 175 professional staff. A proposal to add 50 is under discussion. By common consent, the WTO head will need to rely heavily - as Mr Sutherland has done with great success - on his personal qualities and skills to make an impact. But there is less agreement on what these should be. Some experts think a master of policy detail is required, who will establish the organisation's authority by perfecting its mechanics - notably its new dispute settlement procedures - and broking behind-the-scenes deals in Geneva. Others, however, want someone with a high public profile, who will focus on broader strategic issues and deal directly with government leaders. Mr Ruggiero and Mr Salinas personify some of these differences in approach. The former has emphasised his credentials as a capable administrator with wide international experience, gained in Brussels, the Gatt and at world economic summits. But sceptics ask whether he has enough vision and stature for the job. Mr Salinas's biggest attraction is his boldness in presiding over sweeping liberalisation, which has made Mexico a model of developing country reform. However, some wonder whether, as a head of state, his style is too grand and authoritarian for the WTO. Regional ties are also an issue. They are aggravated by mutual suspicions between the industrialised powers which have long dominated Gatt's affairs, and the developing countries which make up most of its membership and account for an increasing share of world trade and economic growth. Mr Ruggiero must convince doubters that Brussels' backing will not make him a champion of narrow EU interests. Mr Salinas's origins may have wider appeal - but only if he can show clearly that he is not beholden to patronage from Washington. Whether any candidate can meet all, or most, of the requirements on the wish-lists circulating in Geneva and world capitals looks doubtful. But with more names likely to enter the race, the pace of international wheeling and dealing is set to quicken. The final choice may call for all the negotiating skills and talent for last-minute compromise which the Gatt can muster.</p>

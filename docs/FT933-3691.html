			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: Hospitals fill up as protests hit the streets - Tony Walker is among the wounded in fighting at Ramallah The scene in the emergency ward of Ramallah Hospital was like the worst days of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Doctors and nurses worked feverishly to save the lives of badly-wounded Palestinians, some of whom had been shot in the abdomen, in the chest, and in the head. The floor of the casualty station, all of whose beds and stretchers were occupied, was awash with blood from those shot by Israeli soldiers seeking to control demonstrations that had turned the centre of the Arab West Bank town into a war zone. At least two Palestinians died yesterday and scores were injured. A day after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed mutual recognition, the mood on the streets of Ramallah, other West Bank towns and in the Gaza Strip was far from peaceful. In Ramallah, on a sunny day, Palestinians associated with the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas and the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine fought pitched battles with tough Israeli border police in streets scarred by nearly six years of conflict since the intifada erupted in December 1987. The militant Palestinians also clashed in Ramallah and other places with loyalists of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, who is under threat of assassination after his momentous decision to conclude a peace deal with Israel. The Ramallah disturbances, in which youths threw rocks and broken bottles, were one of the bloodiest demonstration on a day of violence in areas where militants have their strongholds. The violence was a warning of the enormous difficulties ahead in efforts to convert agreements on paper into reality on the ground. Opposition to the peace accord burns fiercely in the hearts of many Palestinians, no less than it does among Israelis of the right and the militant settler movement. My own experience in Ramallah, when I was shot in the leg by what I believe was a ricocheting live bullet fired by an Israeli soldier into a crowd of Palestinian demonstrators, was a reminder of the sheer unpredictability of events in the Middle East. I had travelled from Jerusalem into the West Bank to sample opinion among influential Palestinians, and on my way back to my hotel I had stopped almost on a whim to observe the Ramallah demonstrations, which were following a pattern familiar to those of us who had reported the intifada from its earliest days. Palestinian youths, some with their heads swathed in keffiyehs, were throwing rocks towards Israeli soldiers, clad in riot gear and armed with rifles and tear-gas launchers. Suddenly, without warning, there was a fusillade of shots and observers of the scene rushed for cover. It was at that moment that I felt a thud in my leg, much as if I had been kicked by a mule. Fortuitously, two young Palestinians, noticing my plight, helped me into the back seat of a passing taxi which headed through the narrow, crowded streets of the old Arab town towards a nearby hospital. At the Ramallah Hospital, where I had gone several times before as an observer during the early days of the intifada, I was greeted by chaotic scenes as cars and ambulances disgorged the wounded into a tiny casualty station, filled to overflowing. While there, I saw at least one dead Palestinian carted away from the emergency ward with mourning friends and relatives chanting 'Allahu Akhbar, Allahu Akhbar' - 'God is great, God is great'. My experience on Saturday was but a microcosm of what has been happening in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for nearly six years, and looks set to continue for the moment until things settle down, if they ever do.</p>

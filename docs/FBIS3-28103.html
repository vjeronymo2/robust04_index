			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the </F> Social Democratic Party of Japan, at the Diet building -- live]    [Text] [Dean of the press corps] Now, if there are  questions to be asked, please go ahead.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Murayama] That is the way I think.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Murayama] No, since there will be a meeting of the party  Central Executive Committee [CEC] tomorrow -- I mean today. We  will reconfirm the party position at the committee meeting, and  inform the prime minister. We will have to draw a clear line  one way or another. That will be the steps we will take, I  think.    [Reporter] Naturally, cabinet members [of the party] then  will entrust you with what to do. Will you pull them out of the  cabinet?    [Murayama] I have their understanding that they will follow  -- in unity -- the party's policy decided on at the CEC meeting  tomorrow [today]. So, that can happen.    [Reporter] Is it possible that this will not happen?    [Murayama] Well, that would never happen unless the prime  minister changes his mind.    [Reporter] If this situation persists, it is possible that  the cabinet will resign en masse or the Diet will dissolve for  another general election. Of course, you have arrived at this  decision after thinking about all this, right?    [Murayama] At the joint meeting [of coalition party  representatives], I said that the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] cannot agree [to the prime minister's decision] and  that a forthcoming decision by the party can affect the  cabinet's foundation. I asked him if he was aware of all this  when making the decision -- even though the prime minister's  response to the question was that he was asking for the SDPJ's  cooperation so that such a thing would not happen.    [Reporter] Had there been no prior consultations on the  matter of raising the consumption tax to 7 percent? [words  indistinct]    [Murayama] No, not at all. Actually, I have heard him speak  negatively about raising the consumption tax. I have never  thought, even in my imagination, that he would make such a  decision. It has a new name of public welfare tax, but is, in  substance, just a general revenue source. It is not different  from the consumption tax. Only its name has changed. Even when  the consumption tax was first instituted, the government  insisted time and again that money therefrom would be used for  welfare. That precedence is only being repeated indeed.  Nothing has changed in substance.    [Reporter] Is there no room for the SDPJ to reconsider its  position as long as [words indistinct]?    [Murayama] First, the government should present its vision  on welfare, and then submit a list of funds needed to carry out  projects under such a vision. It should say how much money can  be raised from insurance and how much money should come from tax  revenue. If this step is taken, maybe the people will be able  to agree on the need for the money. But in his announcement,  there is no mention of such a thing, and only a tax rate is  presented. However hard he may try to explain it, the people  will accept it as raising the consumption tax rate, using a new  name -- the public welfare tax. I told him so.    [Reporter] To keep the coalition government in power, your  party supported the political reform bills even though some in  the party were against it. Will not some of your party object  to the party's stand on the tax this time?    [Murayama] As long as the prime minister does not change his  mind, that sort of thing will not happen, I think.    [Reporter] That means that as long as the prime minister  does not change his stand, the SDPJ will come to act as an  opposition party [several words indistinct]?    [Murayama] Either way, tomorrow -- I mean today -- the party  will decide on a policy. I will talk about that after that is  done.    [Reporter] Will your party object to a budget formulated by  the government?    [Murayama] I think it will if the government formulates the  budget's taking the tax into it.    [Reporter] Is it impossible for the SDPJ to rethink its  policies on such issues as the rice market liberalization,  political reform, and so forth now that [words indistinct]?    [Murayama] That is something we can think about -- only in  the future.    [Reporter] As far as only this tax issue is concerned,  is the party in complete agreement?    [Murayama] The CEC makes a decision only with a unanimous  agreement. The committee will reconfirm the party policy on  that in a unanimous agreement, and then will entrust the party  chairman and general secretary with the decision making.    [Reporter] Do you think there are some party Diet members  who will not agree to the CEC decision?    [Murayama] No, I think we can make a decision unanimously  this time. [laughter from reporters]    [Reporter] In passing the political reform bills recently,  even though you disagreed with some government concessions to  the Liberal Democratic Party, you decided to support the bills  eventually. Is it possible that your stand on the political  reforms will now change again?    [Murayama] Our party would like to make a judgment on other  matters only after the party's decision on this question has  been set. [NHK breaks off relay of the news conference here]</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK WRITERS OF SOAPS  </P> <P> I take exception to George Blaine Jr.'s April 7 letter concerning finding black  writers for the NBC soap "Generations." Blaine seems to assume this should be  easy.  </P> <P> "Call the Writers Guild," he suggests.  </P> <P> That's the problem. Call the Writers Guild and they will tell you -- there are  no black writers in daytime TV.  </P> <P> When "Generations" became the first soap to establish a central black family,  head writer Sally Sussman felt it was essential to include black writers on her  staff. Finding them wasn't easy. Even experienced writers have trouble adapting  to soaps. It's unlike writing for anything else, and it's relentless. Writers  turn out five scripts a week -- 52 weeks a year. The scripts are 90% dialogue,  and they require working from another writer's outline -- a major adjustment  for any writer.  </P> <P> "Generations" is lucky enough to have two terrific black writers. Hopefully  there will be more.  </P> <P> Most importantly, the group at NBC Productions has made every effort to provide  jobs for blacks in every field. Just this year, under the aegis of the Writers  Guild of America, "Generations" established a minority writers program to  create more opportunities for black writers, addressing just this problem. And  this month NBC, in association with the National Negro College Fund, instituted  the "Generations" Scholarship, for young blacks interested in pursuing a career  in the arts.  </P> <P> MEG BENNETT  </P> <P> Writer, "Generations"  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / BA seeks to assure workers on jobs BRITISH AIRWAYS is telling its 45,000 UK employees that it will do everything it can to safeguard their jobs. However, it warns that it will continue cutting costs as the only alternative to closure or disposal of loss-making UK operations. The move follows the airline's concern that it may face mounting industrial action. It believes union positions are hardening over its globalisation strategy and its efforts to create low-cost subsidiaries for its UK regional services and the Gatwick-based European operations it acquired from Dan-Air last year. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said in Mexico City yesterday that BA was not seeking to reduce employment nor cut staff pay. 'We are doing the opposite. We are enlarging and growing the company and using the benefit of globalisation to ensure we achieve this.' He said BA's growth strategy had seen UK employment rise from 37,000 to nearly 49,000 during the past 10 years. In a letter to all BA managers yesterday, Mr Ayling said: 'It is not our intention to seek any reduction or deterioration in pay or conditions of employment, except in the wholly exceptional circumstances where this is the only alternative to closure or disposal of parts of BA which are making unsustainable losses.' This was the case with the UK regional operation and the Dan-Air business He acknowledged that the globalisation strategy had created uncertainties among staff. Mr Ayling said: 'I wish everyone to know that we will do everything we can in the years immediately ahead to ensure that the number of people employed by British Airways in this country is not diminished.' BA is facing industrial action from pilots, cabin crews and ground staff. The unions fear BA's strategy could be the start of a broader policy to reduce pay and conditions throughout the company.</p>

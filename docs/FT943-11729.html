			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Lira touches new low The political woes of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday drove the lira to a new low for the year, writes Philip Gawith. News that an arrest warrant had been issued for Mr Berlusconi's brother intensified speculation about whether the government would survive. Political uncertainty prompted selling of Italian assets by foreigners, and this drove the lira to a low of L1,007 against the D-Mark. It closed in London off the low at L1,006 from L996.7 on Tuesday. UK dealers reported that the Bank of Italy had intervened to support the lira around L1,005. Trading conditions in the foreign exchange markets remained thin. Analysts said the market continued to be dominated by interbank day traders, with medium and long term investors mostly absent. Eurosterling contracts fell sharply as the mixed reception given yesterday's gilts auction, the weak US Treasury market and fears about UK interest rates rising, all preyed on sentiment. The sterling index remained unchanged at 78.6, the lowest level since March 1993. Analysts were pessimistic about the outlook for the lira, with most predicting that it will retest the low of L1,010 against the D-Mark, reached last December. The catalyst for lira weakness was the story about Mr Berlusconi's brother. This follows the recent controversy about a government decree which sought to curb magistrates' powers of detention, and renewed criticism about the unresolved conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's business interests and the office of prime minister. Although the origin of lira weakness may be politics, it has also focused the market's attention on Italy's economic problems. Mr James Cornish, European strategist at NatWest Markets, commented: 'The market is worried that we are either plunged into early elections or, if Mr Berlusconi stays on, that he won't be able to get decisions on the 1995 budget.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London said 'International investors are taking the view that the shelf-life of Mr Berlusconi's government is limited.' In the past when the lira has fallen below L1,000, it has tended to attract buying interest and recover. According to Mr MacKinnon, buying interest has this time been absent. 'It now increasingly looks as if the lira is comfortable above the L1,000 level.' The Citibank analyst predicted that the risk premium that attached to Italian assets meant there was a risk of a considerable further downside for the lira. This view was endorsed by Mr Stephen Yorke, chief European analyst at Chase Manhattan in London. He said that the market's fear was not so much that the Berlusconi government would fall, but that it would stay in office and 'drift', without getting public spending under control. The poor sentiment in the gilt market contributed to some of the sharpest price movements seen in short sterling for a number of weeks. The December contract traded over 30,000 lots to settle 18 basis points lower at 93.67. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, commented: 'The problem is that everybody is long. There is no room left to buy the stock.' Selling pressure was not aggressive, but buyers were absent. A number of factors weighed on the market. These included: press reports suggesting that UK interest rates would rise further this year, the low coverage in the morning gilt auction, and the weakness in the US bond market. The dollar moved down to test the technical trend line of DM1.5740 - in place since July 12 when the US currency started to recover from a low of DM1.52 - but bounced off it to finish at DM1.576 from DM1.5865 on Tuesday. Currency weakness was a spillover from the fall in US bond prices after the release of the June durable goods figures. Orders rose by 1.3 per cent, compared to market expectations of a 0.6 per cent increase, raising fears that a monetary policy tightening might become necessary. The June increase in durable goods orders, without transport, was the thirteenth consecutive rise, the longest sequence on record. Mr MacKinnon said he remained sceptical about the durability of the dollar's recovery and expected the bear trend to resume. The US currency finished at Y98.01 against the yen from Y98. Any recovery is being impeded by fears that the Sunday deadline for progress in US/Japan trade talks may be broken, raising the prospect of US sanctions. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 650m liquidity after forecasting a similar shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 5 3/8 per cent. In Germany, call money firmed to 5/5.10 per cent from 4.95/5.05 per cent with money in short supply after a fairly tight liquidity injection at the fixed rate repo tender. Traders said rates would probably rise towards the Lombard rate of 6 per cent today as pension payments are made.</p>

Imports totalled $600 million last year, up by $100 million  on the previous year and almost twice 1991's figure, according  to ministry statistics.    And China's re-entry into the Gatt (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) will bring a lot more sophisticated foreign  medicines onto the home market in direct competition with  domestic products, said the ministry.    Imported medicine accounted for 7-10 per cent of the  domestic  medicine market last year. And joint venture products claimed a  35 percent share.    "Imported medicine may bring in products that domestic  plants  cannot manufacture and enhance our pharmaceutical technology,"  the ministry spokesman said.    Over 2,000 foreign medicines have been submitted for  official  approval since the registration system for imported medicine was  set up in 1987.    About 400 applications have been approved so far.    "Joint ventures have played a big role in increasing China's  medicine production," the spokesman said.    Xian-Janssen Pharmaceutical Limited, China's biggest  pharmaceutical joint venture, reported sales of 820 million yuan  ($94.3 million) last year, 150 million yuan ($17 million) up on  1992.    The figure is almost that of China's largest domestic  company, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, which reported 1  billion yuan ($115 million) sales last year.    About 60 per cent of China's one thousand plus joint  ventures  are engaged in medicine production.    Most of the pharmaceuticals imported were for the treatment  of blood and digestive system diseases cancer and everyday  infections. Antiinfection medicine accounted for 30 percent of  imports.    China's pharmaceutical output hit 72 billion yuan ($8.3  billion) last year, a 13 per cent increase over 1992.    Medicine products accounted for a solid 70 percent of total  output.    Exports from China's largest State run medicine trader,  China  National Medicines and Health Care Products Import and Export  Corporation, reached $78 million last year.</p>

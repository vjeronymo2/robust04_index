			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gustavo Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Caracas, 5 May -- Eight more military officers, who  were charged with participating in the second military coup  attempt, were released after President Rafael Caldera signed  their discontinuances.    Rear Admiral Luis Cabrera Aguirre, the highest-ranking  officer still being held, left San Carlos Garrison accompanied  by Colonel Higinio Castro, Air Force Col. Jorge Garrido,  Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Delon Romana, Lt. Col. Jose  Villarroel, Major David Monagas, Maj. Oscar Perez Escalona, and  Navy Captain Carlos Reyes Rodriguez. A large number of relatives  were at the doors of the stockade waiting for the order to be  carried out.    The soldiers reported to their commanding officers to submit  a six-month leave request of sorts. During this six months the  officers will remain under the orders of the Defense Ministry  and will not be given operational duties of any kind. The terms  of the discontinuance orders state that once the leave period is  up, they may request their discharge. Because of this, the  soldiers refused to make any statements to the media.    Rear Adm. Luis Cabrera Aguirre said that the defense  minister  gave them his word of honor that he would allow other implicated  soldiers to return to active duty. Maj. Pedro Alastre and Lt.  Eliecer Otaiza accepted the leave order.    [Alastre] We have left active duty and are simply going on  leave.    [Otaiza] The leave is for six months and I will decide on  whether to request dismissal or not later. My generation  retires in January of next year.    He said that the minister of defense is studying the current  situation of other officers involved in the second coup attempt.  It boils down to whether President Rafael Caldera agrees to  sign these new acquittals.    Col. Higino Castro is in the Military Hospital suffering  from  a difficult illness.    In Fort Tiuna's Lino de Clemente Battalion there are six  officers under arrest who could receive their discontinuances in  the next few hours.</p>

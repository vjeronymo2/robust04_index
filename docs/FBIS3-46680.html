Airlines are experiencing delays of over an hour to their  scheduled departures from Narita Airport, the air gate to Tokyo  some 70 kilometers to the east.    Two or three JAL flights a day are being delayed for more  than an hour each day. JAL officials said they are resorting to  emergency measures to ensure passengers are able to transfer to  other flights at their destinations despite the delays.    Russia says the flight restrictions, sent as a formal  "notice  to airmen" on December 28, are a safety measure following a  deterioration in the reliability of radio communications  equipment and will last until March 27. The restrictions limit  the number of civilian flights out of Japan and passing near  Khabarovsk to a maximum of six per hour, one third of the  previous frequency.    Between 40 and 50 flights use this route into and out of  Narita each day but each must now await clearance from Russian  authorities even if all passengers have boarded and they have  completed departure procedures.    Aviation experts in Japan said the deterioration in the  radio  link could be due to cracking in equipment because of freezing.</p>

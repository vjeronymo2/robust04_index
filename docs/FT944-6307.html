			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Norway 'faces a tough future': Brundtland warns of difficulties in wake of No vote on EU Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, said the country faced a tough economic and political future yesterday after voting in a referendum on Monday not to accept membership of the European Union. 'We are in a very serious situation,' she warned. 'It will now be more demanding for us to reach our goals, more demanding to be heard internationally . . . We will now have to work even harder to secure our country and safeguard our welfare society.' Norwegians rejected EU membership by a majority of 52.2 per cent to 47.8 per cent, in spite of approval won in Austria, Finland and Sweden, its fellow applicant countries. It was the second time Norway had turned its back on Brussels, having voted No to membership of the European Economic Community in 1972. Most EU leaders expressed dismay at the result. Denmark, Finland and Sweden had hoped for a strong Nordic front within the EU. 'The weight of Nordic countries will be less within the EU for defending the issues dear to us, like the protection of the enviroment and the fight against unemployment,' said Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister. A senior EU diplomat predicted that Norway would have to wait until the next century for another chance to join the Union, probably at the same time as the most advanced economies in central and eastern Europe. But the Commission stressed that Norway's No would only mean technical adjustments to the accession treaties negotiated earlier this year, and there would be no need to delay enlargement to 15 members. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said the No result would affect the future status of the European Economic Area, the halfway house for members of the European Free Trade Association leading to full EU membership. Mrs Brundtland said a priority for her minority Labour government was to ensure that the EEA remained intact. The accord, giving non-EU members access to the EU internal market, now applies only to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Financial markets reacted calmly to the vote, as they had mainly discounted a No result. But the result provoked a chorus of dismay and concern from Norwegian business. Mr Rolf Saether, chief executive of the Norwegian Shipowners Association, said the outcome had created 'serious uncertainty'. Norske Skog, the country's biggest forestry products company, said it now had a weaker position than its Swedish and Finnish competitors.

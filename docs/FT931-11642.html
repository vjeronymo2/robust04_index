			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: Scientists warn of rise in jobless URGENT government action is needed to regenerate British industry, an all-party alliance of politicians, industrialists and scientists warned yesterday. The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee said: 'Without change, we shall at best become a manufacturing arm of Japanese, American and German companies, whose governments have for years taken a more positive attitude to science and technology and to manufacturing industry than UK governments. At the worst, this will lead to chronic mass unemployment with ensuing community unrest and instability.' The committee does not usually directly advise the government but it has sent its report to the prime minister and ministers responsible for industry, science and education. Its warning follows a conference on Japan's emerging lead in technology, which the committee organised with the Royal Society. Sir Gerard Vaughan, chairman, said: 'The message from the conference was clear and extremely disturbing: unless we make major changes, this country will become largely a labour market for other countries, without an adequate manufacturing base of our own. This will be disastrous for our future prosperity.' The committee points out that the combined research and development expenditure of five Japanese companies - Hitachi, Toyota, Matsushita, NEC and Fujitsu - matched all such private-sector spending in the UK. It says: 'The government must manifestly exert leadership in promoting recognition that science and technology are a crucial part of manufacturing industry and that both are essential for this country's future.'</p>

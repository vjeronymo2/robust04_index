			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Election Results Confront Moscow </F> With Difficult Choice"]    [Text] The first round of the presidential elections held  in Crimea last Sunday confirmed that the majority of the  peninsula's inhabitants do not want to remain in Ukraine and are  seeking affiliation to Russia.    Although the name of the Crimean president will not be known  until 30 January, when round two is due to be held, there is  hardly any doubt that Yuriy Meshkov, who supports the  peninsula's separation from Ukraine, will win. His rival in  round two will be Nikolay Bagrov, the present chairman of the  Crimean Supreme Council, and the only one of the six candidates  who has consistently advocated that the peninsula remain in  Ukraine. The popularity of this idea among the population there  can be judged from the number of votes cast for Bagrov -- 17.5  percent.    What will happen next? The future president's first step has  already been decided -- Meshkov plans to organize a referendum  on the peninsula's future on 27 March, the same day as the  parliamentary elections in Ukraine. The outcome of that  referendum is virtually predetermined. After 27 March Meshkov,  backed with the people's support, will in all likelihood launch  the campaign to change the status of Crimea.    Russian diplomacy is going to have some serious problems to  tackle. On the one hand, public opinion cannot be ignored: The  majority of Russians cannot accept the loss of Crimea, which was  won for Russia by Catherine the Great's military commanders.  The State Duma, under the influence of the Communists and  liberal democrats, will surely follow the example of  Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet and adopt a resolution taking under  Russian jurisdiction not just Sevastopol but the whole  peninsula. In Crimea, of course, this will cause an explosion  of exultation and will trigger a wave of demonstrations under  red flags and tricolors.    At the same time, by casting doubt on the territorial  integrity of its neighboring state, Russia will set a most  dangerous precedent, canceling out the Helsinki accords and its  own commitments within the CSCE framework. In addition, the  affiliation of Crimea can at best bring moral satisfaction but  will not improve either the economic situation in Russia or  relations with the CIS countries, which will interpret this as  visible confirmation of Moscow's "imperial ambitions."    Nor should it be forgotten that the agreement on scrapping  Ukraine's nuclear weapons has still not been ratified by  parliament, and a sharp deterioration of relations between  Moscow and Kiev could make President Kravchuk change his  position too.    Judging by the initial statements of Russian diplomats, the  Foreign Ministry prefers not to draw far-reaching conclusions  from the Crimean election results.    Unless it clearly and unambiguously states that it renounces  its territorial claims on Ukraine, Moscow could repeat the sorry  experience of Belgrade. By giving unconditional support to  fellow countrymen in Crimea, Yeltsin runs the risk of becoming a  hostage to separatist leaders, as happened with Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic.    Moscow's open interference in the emerging conflict between  Kiev and Simferopol will do irreparable damage to the reputation  of Russian democracy. The question is whether the Kremlin's  leaders will manage to resist the temptation of trying to boost  their own popularity at their weakened neighbor's expense.</p>

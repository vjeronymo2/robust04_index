			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic by Robert Hochner in Vienna; Silajdzic statements in  English with superimposed German translation -- live]    [Text] [Hochner] I welcome Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic in the studio. Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister.    [Silajdzic] Good evening.    [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, the Muslims and Croats have  agreed on a constitution in Vienna but not on a new map. What  will be the next step -- talks on a new map, or talks with the  Serbs on the return of territories?    [Silajdzic] Well, let me tell you first that we are very  glad that these negotiations are taking place in Austria, in  Vienna, because the Austrian Government has spent a great deal  of time and energy on this peace process. To answer your  question, we are not yet discussing maps. We have to talk to  the Serbian side to achieve a final settlement.    [Hochner] It looks as though the Muslims and Croats might  form a military alliance. Can you imagine that Croats and  Muslims might take joint action against the Serbs and recapture  the territories which they claim if no agreement should be  achieved on a new map, for example?    [Silajdzic] We believe that this draft constitution is a  victory for peace and not for war. But everything is possible  after two years of violence. After a very difficult situation  of suffering, everything is possible. Yet, as I said, we  sincerely hope for peace and not for war. We hope that the  human rights mentioned in the draft constitution will have real  meaning -- the right to life, the right to freedom, the right to  free movement, the right to think, and the right to think  differently. We hope that these things will be respected. They  are all stipulated in the constitution.    [Hochner] The Russians have recently intervened in the peace  process in Bosnia. They reportedly cooperate very closely with  the United States. However, there are also fears that a new  East-West border will be established politically in the middle  of your country. How do you assess the influence of the  Russians?    [Silajdzic] Well, I was in Moscow three days ago, and I  openly spoke about our worries concerning this kind of Russian  engagement. We cannot ignore one fact: that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy visited the occupied part of Bosnia-Herzegovina a  few weeks ago, and that he gave nationalistic and incendiary  speeches. A few weeks later, Russian troops came to Bosnia  without being invited. The Bosnian Government was not  consulted, and the troops were deployed on some lines in  Sarajevo. We are afraid of a division of Sarajevo. We are  afraid of a new Berlin Wall there. We will naturally do  everything possible to prevent another Berlin Wall there. But  we are worried.    [Hochner] The UN embargo against the rest of Yugoslavia  might be used as an instrument to exert pressure on the Bosnian  Serbs. Do you believe that a lifting of the embargo might be  promised to the rest of Yugoslavia to achieve a compromise among  the Serbs in Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] Are you talking about the arms embargo?    [Hochner] I am speaking about the economic embargo.    [Silajdzic] Yes, of course. But that should be done very  cautiously. It must be done strictly in accordance with the  withdrawal. I think that this is the only effective instrument  in the hands of the international community. Unfortunately, the  civilian population is affected by the embargo. That seems to  be inevitable in order to make the Belgrade regime behave.    [Hochner] Let me ask you a final question, Mr. Prime  Minister. The Croats and the Bosnian-Muslim army of the  government waged a bloody war against each other. Negotiations  are now being held. How stable is the new basis of trust between  the two ethnic groups? Do you think it might break again?    [Silajdzic] As I said, everything can happen. Yet a direct  and very important result of these talks is a stable cease-fire,  particularly in Sarajevo and Mostar. This encourages us and  gives us hope to continue. We hope for the best.    [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the interview.    [Silajdzic] Thank you.</p>

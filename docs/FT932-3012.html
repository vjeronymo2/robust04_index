			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Organic progress behind Volex advance to Pounds 7.3m VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company whose chief executive was headhunted by Farnell Electronics in May, doubled profits in the year to March 31. The shares rose 18p to 405p. The rise from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 7.34m was struck on turnover up from Pounds 81.6m to Pounds 106.1m. Mr Ken Hooper, finance director, said it was difficult to say how much of the advance was organic growth and how much derived from acquisitions because of the way the new companies had been woven into the group. However, Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said that the result contained a 'good amount' of organic progress. During the year, Volex spent Pounds 8.5m on acquisitions. It added Icontec in July 1992 and Component Manufacturing Systems in January 1993 to its Cable Products operation in the US. In October 1992 it also bought a 60 per cent stake in Mayor, the Singapore-based maker of data and power cord assemblies. Guided by Mr Howard Poulson, the outgoing chief executive described by Mr Goodall as 'a good strategic thinker', Volex has become a worldwide supplier of cable assemblies to the computer, medical and instrumentation markets. Mr Goodall said this global strategy was a lesson learned from the wiring systems side, which supplies the automotive industry. Here Volex has withdrawn from supplying volume car manufacturers - which opted for global suppliers - and has instead targeted markets such as off-road and agricultural vehicles, sports and specialist cars, Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin. The division is being restructured and the St Helens factory was closed. There was also a Pounds 654,000 bad debt provision from Leyland DAF taken as an exceptional charge. Some 40 per cent of the growth at Pencon, the UK maker of power cords, was organic, the company said, and Pounds 3m of the group's Pounds 7.8m capital expenditure allowed capacity to be increased. Legislation for the pre-fitting of plugs to electrical appliances is expected this year. January's Pounds 17.5m rights issue helped increase shareholders' funds to Pounds 38.7m (Pounds 29.5m) and at the year-end, Volex had net positive funds of Pounds 5.9m. The final dividend is lifted to 11.35p for a 17.85p (17p) total, payable from earnings of 22.5p (14.9p) per share.</p>

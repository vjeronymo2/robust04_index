			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Peter Maxwell Davies's Violin Concerto - Concert SOME seven years ago, Isaac Stern gave the premiere of Peter Maxwell Davies's Violin Concerto at the composer's St Magnus Festival in the Orkneys. Then he introduced it to some larger centres, and in due course recorded it for CBS. It was the first time that Maxwell Davies had composed a work expressly for a soloist of international renown; in the event, however, the great violinist sounded neither very sympathetic nor very well-practised in the piece. The prospect of hearing Gyorgy Pauk take it in hand on Sunday, with the original orchestra - the Royal Philharmonic - conducted now by the composer instead of Andre Previn, was full of promise. Pauk is a prince among senior musician-violinists. Again and again, he has put his superlative technique, his sterling musicianship, his pellucid address and his Strad at the service of new music, when he might be devoting an easier life to the Classical / Romantic repertoire. This time, however, Pauk's unstinting devotion set Sir Peter's Concerto in an unflattering light. He illuminated the solo role with grace and searching finesse, especially in the soberly beautiful two-part writing in his extended cadenzas ' but what was the orchestra doing? Nothing like enough. The brief moments of vivid exposition got no energetic follow-up. The ruminative first movement, denied the recapitulation it wants, instead declined sidewise into a mild Adagio; that, in turn, swung into a pallid 'Scottish' rondo with a deflated coda. Perhaps the RPO had had too little time to find its feet with the piece; or again, Davies as conductor may have been too intent upon cultivating his trees at the cost of any wider view of the woods. The effect was of a luminous solo voice bobbing over subfusc, under-argued support. It may be relevant that this concerto was a transition, a prelude to Davies's continuing series of 'Strathclyde' Concerti for various principals of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which are mostly introspective studies. The Violin Concerto may mark an uncertain juncture between Davies' old lust for violent solo expression, and his newer interest in neo-classical form. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the time of his neo-Expressionist fame, his dramatic progressions were spelt out with lurid clarity. Now, Davies strives after 'symphonic development' of a more traditional kind; but his ears remain atonal and serialist, and the old 'development' procedures (essentially tonal) do not ring true. We can barely hear them.</p>

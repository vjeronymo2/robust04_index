			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): All change for recovery - Business support organisations and the government are striving to create a more streamlined and effective network The 1980s was a decade of rapid upheaval for small businesses in Britain. The 1990s look likely to see an equally fundamental shake-up of the organisations that support business; the chambers of commerce and of trade, the enterprise agencies and the most recent arrivals, the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs). Change is being driven by a rethink of government attitudes; by the recession which has cut a swathe through the membership rolls of many groups; and by a realisation that business support must become more professional. It also reflects the limited number of people capable of running the voluntary business agencies. Experienced individuals often find themselves sitting on the board of their chamber of commerce as well as playing a role at their local Tec. An important catalyst for change was the launch, three years ago, of the nationwide network of 82 Training and Enterprise Councils to provide training and small business support on a local basis. Uncertainty persists over just how well the Tecs will adapt to the enterprise part of their brief but there is no doubt that they have succeeded in galvanising existing organisations into improving their level of service. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce (ABCC), whose chambers represent 83,000 businesses, is 18 months into an ambitious programme to boost membership and the quality of service that chambers provide. Evidence of the success of this policy, and of the pressures of the recession, came last week with news that the National Chamber of Trade, representing chambers and trade associations with a total of 150,000 members, is seeking a merger with the ABCC. The two, which have been rivals for more than 90 years, hope to complete their merger talks in the autumn. A merger of the two chamber organisations would significantly reduce the fragmentation of small business support networks. But it would still leave the chambers and Tecs uneasily vying for market share in some parts of the country. The two organisations have held talks about closer co-operation though it is unclear whether this might ultimately lead to mergers. Earlier this year, it looked as though the business support picture was going to become even more confused with the announcement of a plan for a network of business clubs. Tom Moffat, founder and chairman of the Durham Small Business Club, had hoped that his network would become operational in April with 20 members, but it is taking longer to get started. He now hopes to launch it with a dozen members towards the end of the year. Moffat maintained from the outset that his clubs would form part of a three-tier network, sandwiched between the enterprise agencies and the chambers of commerce. The proposed chambers' merger has prompted Moffat to suggest to the ABCC that the two organisations devise a joint strategy. While the chambers and business clubs try for strength through unity, the 300-plus enterprise agencies are faced with the need to create a new national organisation from scratch. Business in the Community, which has acted as an umbrella organisation for the agencies over the past 10 years, is working on plans to end this special relationship. In future BITC intends to provide backing on a more even-handed basis to the whole range of business support organisations including the Tecs and the chambers. Quite what sort of national organisation will emerge to take on the role of BITC in co-ordinating support for the agencies and representing their views to government is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the agencies may establish links with the Tecs or the chambers. But whatever the business groups themselves decide, an important role will be played by the government. Previous government involvement has appeared ad hoc and unfocused and the creation of the Tecs angered some of the existing business groups which felt they should have become the channels for government action. Michael Heseltine, whose trade and industry department has taken over responsibility for small firms policy from the department of employment, is known to be more interventionist in his approach, though it is not yet clear what this means in practical terms. There have been signs recently that the government has become willing to use existing business networks. It is employing enterprise agencies to run five pilot schemes to encourage private individuals - 'business angels' - to invest in business. It also plans to use trade associations for three test schemes on how to tackle the late payment of debt. If government and the business organisations can make the right choices, then Britain will have a more streamlined and more effective network of business support by the end of the decade. If the chances are missed, networks will remain patchy, fragmented and businesses will suffer.</p>

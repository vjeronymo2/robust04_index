"The leaders of the two nations have agreed on the need for  a  cooling-off period for the Japan-U.S. economic talks," the top  government spokesman told a news conference. "We expect the  U.S. Government to act sensibly."    Takemura's comments came a day after U.S. President Bill  Clinton said he expects to have policy recommendations drawn up  in the next few days to slash Japan's vast trade surplus with  the U.S.    The policy options under consideration reportedly include  the  renewal of a U.S. trade law that allows retaliatory measures  against countries which refuse to change what Washington deems  unfair trade practices.    U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the  Super 301 trade measure through executive order is imminent,  possibly by Thursday.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to narrow  differences  with Clinton during a summit meeting last Friday over U.S.  demands for cutting Japan's trade surplus and boosting the sale  of foreign goods in Japan.    Takemura said Hosokawa will convene a meeting Thursday  afternoon of Japanese officials who negotiated with the U.S. in  the economic talks held under a bilateral trade framework accord  concluded last July.    A meeting joined by cabinet ministers will also be held  sometime in the immediate future, the chief cabinet secretary  said.    Asked about a proposed dispatch of a special envoy to the  U.S. to break the deadlock on the strained bilateral trade ties,  Takemura said, "it is a thinkable option."    Ichiro Ozawa, a senior leader of Shinseito and the main  strategist of Hosokawa's ruling coalition, suggested in a press  interview that the government send an envoy to Washington in  March to restore trust in the Japan-U.S. relations.    Takemura said Tokyo has just unveiled a new economy-spurring  package and is not considering additional pump-priming measures  right now.    But he also spoke of the need for efforts to reduce Japan's  trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars last year,  including about 60 billion dollars with the U.S.    "As the Japan-U.S. ties are most important to us, the  government should do its utmost to solidify the relations once  again," he said.</p>

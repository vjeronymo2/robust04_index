			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Zinc prices slide as production cut hopes fade - Market Report ZINC prices fell sharply again yesterday under pressure from investment fund selling and dwindling hopes of production cuts. The London Metal Exchange three months price added Dollars 20.50 to Tuesday's Dollars 20.25 fall to reach Dollars 983 a tonne. The selling was influenced by a statement from Outokumpu of Finland saying it had no plans to cut production. Also European Union zinc producers had yet to deliver the promised smelter closures, dealers noted. The ALUMINIUM market meanwhile showed signs of losing its recent upward momentum, with the three months price closing Dollars 6.75 lower at Dollars 1,288.75 a tonne. The closure threat at Tajikistan's Tursunzade smelter that had helped to steady the market on Tuesday receded slightly with news that a small delivery of alumina had been received this week. But an official said reserves remained minimal, while doubts remained about further deliveries from Uzbekistan because of failure to pay for earlier shipments. Compiled from Reuter</p>

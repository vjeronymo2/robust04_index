			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: The  Greek Presidency of the European Council wants to confirm that  the accession of Cyprus and Malta will take place during the  next phase of the European Union's [EU] expansion. He added  that the Republic of Cyprus already meets the nominal criteria  of the Maastricht Treaty. Mr. Venizelos praised the statement  of outgoing European Parliament President Egon Klepsch, who  pointed out the need for Cyprus and Malta to be included in the  next phase of the EU expansion within a specific time limit.    Mr. Venizelos further noted that at the noon meeting of the  EU summit participants discussed the European election results,  the French-German initiative to combat racism and xenophobia,  and the questions pertaining to the so-called Third Pylon --  cooperation, internal issues, matters of justice -- that are  provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.    Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou pointed out the phenomenon  of extreme diaspora of votes to parties that do not belong to  the European Parliament and the fact that in our country voting  is compulsory. The prime minister said: The low turnout of the  European Election should give us reason to think.    After the Greek prime minister finished, French President  Francois Mitterrand took the floor and referred to the  French-German initiative to combat racism and xenophobia. The  next speaker was British Prime Minister John Major who referred  to the need for cooperation between the police authorities of  the member states. In his address, European Commission  President Jacques Delors referred to the problem of political  indifference that was noticed during the European Election.</p>

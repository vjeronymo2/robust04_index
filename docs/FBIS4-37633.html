			<p>BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, June 21 (AFP) -- A new party was formed  here Tuesday [21 June] by a group of Bhutanese to push for human  rights and an independent judiciary in their homeland.    The Druk National Congress (DNC), made up of people from the  north and eats of the country known as Druks, plans to fight for  free speech, freedom from oppression, among other things, DNC  Chairman Rongthang Kunley Dorji told a press conference here.    "You are all aware that these freedoms do not exist in  Bhutan  and it is this fact that has left us with no other recourse  except to launch a body whose aim is to bring recognition of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Bhutan and also protect  these rights under ... an independent judiciary," Dorji said.    "Due to lack of human rights and an independent judiciary,  the situation in present day Bhutan has deteriorated to such an  extent that the citizens are treated as 'oxen without horns' and  forced to live under very oppressive conditions by the regime,"  he said.    Dorji said they had formed the party in Nepal instead of  India as New Delhi has an extradition treaty with Bhutan.    "If we were found raising voice against the Bhutanese king  or  the government, we may be immediately deported to Bhutan to be  handed over to the Bhutanese Government," he said.    More than 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepalese descent are  currently  living in refugee camps run by the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees after fleeing their country following  the imposition of laws forcing them to adopt Bhutanese customs  or face punishment.</p>

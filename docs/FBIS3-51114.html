			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by Darci Higobassi] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso stated  on 10 January in Sao Paulo that the government has approved the  importation of 1 million metric tons of Canadian wheat as a  strategic action under its policy of supervising the  availability of foodstuffs on the market, something that will  have a positive effect on the price of bread and manioc meal.  The importation of the wheat, which is under the control of a  pool [preceding word in English] of flour mills, could amount to  1.2 million metric tons at a cost of $15 to $20 per ton, a price  much lower than Argentine wheat.    "There is no risk of a lack of foodstuffs because the  Finance  and Agriculture Ministries are carefully supervising the  agricultural market and there will be no disruption of the  harvest," Cardoso guaranteed. He also believes the estimate of  42-percent inflation in January is pure "speculation. I am  going to repeat what I have already said: The number 42 is a  shoe size; therefore, there is no room for it." He said there  will be no advance implementation of the real value unit (URV),  explaining that the government will not begin to think about  the URV until Congress approves the budget. Cardoso made these  remarks during the morning of 10 January when he was interviewed  on the "Business [preceding word in English] Program" broadcast  over Manchete Television, which will be aired on 16 January.    The minister indicated that on 13 January he will meet with  the board of directors of the National Bank for Economic and  Social Development (BNDES) in order to define the new policy for  the northeast, which has an estimated $1 billion for the  construction of highways, the planning of hydraulic resources,  and general infrastructure services.    Cardoso also indicated that during January, President Itamar  Franco will approve the creation of a permanent working group  that will draft an extended administrative reform. The Planning  Ministry, the Federal Administrative Secretariat, and the  Civilian Household have been charged with this task under the  Finance Ministry's supervision. The Social Welfare and Regional  Integration Ministries will disappear, but other offices will be  transferred to other areas.</p>

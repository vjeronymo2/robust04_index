			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Philippines aid 'not all disbursed' THE PHILIPPINES has made surprisingly little use of aid pledged by international donor countries, according to an official report. Of pledges totalling Dollars 2.87bn (Pounds 1.67bn) made in 1989, some 39.4 per cent or Dollars 1.13bn had been disbursed by the end of 1991, and of pledges of Dollars 3.23bn at the 1991 meeting, only 19.6 per cent or Dollars 633m had been disbursed as of December. The slow rate of use will be the main focus at the next session of debt talks, chaired by the World Bank and beginning in Hong Kong tomorrow. Donors are expected to review the performance of the outgoing administration of President Corazon Aquino. Elections are due on May 11. Leading donors are likely to commit themselves to continued support at least in the transition period to the new administration. The World Bank is expected to pledge up to Dollars 900m of new financial assistance. Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, is expected to explain that the government was hamstrung by a delay in congressional approval for last year's budget and difficulties in raising local counterpart financing for foreign assistance. He will seek financial support for a debt reduction programme recently agreed with leading commercial bank creditors. Over the long term, he will seek commitments to programmes including power and water projects, environmental issues and poverty alleviation.</p>

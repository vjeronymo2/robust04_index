			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Trouble bubbles on the Y-front: Europe's soap powder war may get dirtier Attentive readers of Europe's popular press in the past few days will have noticed some slightly odd full-page advertisements for well-known brands of washing powder. There are no smiling kids and mums, no ugly stains before and after: just sober, reassuring text. Persil Power, says the UK advertisement, does less damage to clothes than competing powders. Omo Power, Dutch and Austrian readers are told, carries a full money back guarantee: if you are worried, ring this number. For the owner of the brands, the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever, this is the latest stage in an increasingly hectic attempt at damage limitation. The new brands are in fact identical, and represent a major offensive in Unilever's age-old war against Procter &amp; Gamble of the US for dominance of the world detergents market. According to Procter, Unilever's claims are the reverse of the truth: the new powder, under whatever name, is unacceptably harmful to clothes and should be withdrawn. For the public, the debate has so far been mostly knockabout: lurid photographs of tattered boxer shorts, and tabloid headlines about froth, lather and dirty linen. But the issue is deadly serious, and is preoccupying both companies at the top level. Procter's first assault, in late March, was made by no less a figure than Mr Edwin Artzt, Procter's chairman, who flew from Cincinnati to London to accuse startled Unilever executives of their product's failings. Since the dispute became public a month later, at least one of the blizzard of hostile press releases from Procter has borne the imprint of Mr Artzt's second-in-command, Mr John Pepper. At Unilever, the affair has been absorbing boardroom time for many weeks, particularly that of Mr Niall Fitzgerald, head of worldwide detergents and strongly tipped as the group's next joint chairman. Procter's case is technical in nature, and the argument has become tangled. The essence, however, is simple enough. For many years, the detergents industry has sought to improve its products by incorporating manganese, which makes powders more powerful but tends to damage fabric. Unilever claims to have hit on the answer in 1988. The resulting manganese-based catalyst - dubbed the Accelerator - has been incorporated in a new generation of concentrated powders for the European market, sold in different countries as Persil Power, Omo Power and Via Power. Procter has retaliated by producing apparently damning evidence - backed by the findings of independent research institutes - that the manganese in the Accelerator, far from being kinder to clothes, does them serious damage. Unilever rejects the claims as meaningless. First, it says, the laboratory tests which produced Procter's results bear no relation to real life. Second, in the long run it is the consumer, not the laboratory technician, who decides whether the product succeeds or fails. What Procter has done, Unilever claims, is stand one of the industry's time-honoured tricks on its head. If you want to prove your product superior to a competitor, you pick the exact specifications - type of fabric, type of dye, type of stain - which show it in the best light and the competitor in the worst. You then commission independent tests to those specifications. The result is another of those standard TV commercials showing that new X washes whiter than Y. But the reverse is obviously possible. Pick a thin cotton garment which is heavily dyed, for instance, and wash it repeatedly. By the time the bleach in the detergent has finished removing the dye, there will be little left of the cotton. Unilever claims to have produced this kind of result with Procter products, but dismisses the fact as irrelevant. Any bleach-based detergent would do the same. Procter may or may not have been adopting this kind of tactic. Either way, it is generally felt to be guilty of bad form, since it is giving the whole testing game away. At least one reputable British research institute finds itself in the embarrassing position of having tested Persil Power for both parties, with predictably opposite results. Unilever's case, however, suffers from one crucial weakness. It is now bringing out an amended version of the powder with less Accelerator in it. The plain implication is that when confronted, Unilever has blinked first. The company is defensive about this. It had already decided on the change, it says, as a means of broadening the product's usage. Originally conceived as a heavy-duty detergent, the powder has proved so successful that it is worth re-launching in a diluted version for more delicate fabrics as well. At the same time, this is a simple way of spiking Procter's guns. Well, perhaps. But this brings us to the second strand of Unilever's argument: that the verdict on the product rests with the consumer. While undoubtedly true, the argument is double-edged. Whatever the technical merits of Procter's case, if it succeeds in alarming consumers it will have achieved its object. So far, the row has largely been conducted through the business press, thus having little impact on the mass of Unilever's customers. But it is starting to spill over into the tabloids, thus forcing Unilever to contemplate a full-scale campaign of rebuttal. In itself, this risks making Procter's point. There are few worse ways of introducing a new product to the public than to deny there is anything wrong with it. The big question is what Unilever stands to lose if, in a worst case, the product had to be recalled. Long-established brands such as Persil would be damaged, but the immediate financial effect would be scarcely material to a company of Unilever's size. Several hundred million pounds have been spent on developing and promoting the product, but that is sunk cost spread over a decade. Unilever's total sales of concentrated detergent powders in Europe - all of which are being replaced by the new product - are only around Pounds 300m, which is just over 1 per cent of group turnover. Stocks sold into the trade so far probably total around Pounds 25m. The real risk is one of lost opportunity. It seems clear, if only from Procter's reaction, that the Accelerator - whether flawed or not - poses a real technological threat. Its chief property, as emphasised by this week's advertisements in the UK, is to wash at lower temperatures. In the world outside Europe and North America, clothes are typically washed in cooler water, or even cold. The developing world is the real growth market for detergents, and it is one in which Unilever historically has the edge over Procter. An Accelerator-based powder has just been quietly introduced into Thailand and is claimed to have had huge initial success. The ultimate opportunity could be an attack on the US market. Unilever's record in US detergents is one of deep gloom enlivened by fitful success, and its market share has of late slipped disastrously. The US market is different from Europe's in numerous ways, and the Accelerator technology is not immediately relevant. But one can assume - as Procter doubtless does - that Unilever is looking for ways to change that. All this suggests that neither side can easily back down. There may also be a personal element. Mr Artzt of Procter, on his way to retirement, will badly want to win. Mr Fitzgerald of Unilever, with the chairmanship dangling before him at the young age of 48, can hardly afford to lose. The soap wars could get nastier yet.</p>

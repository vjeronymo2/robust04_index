			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Property prospects worsen CONFIDENCE in the recovery of the UK commercial property industry has diminished during the past three months, according to a survey by Gallup, the research group. More than half the property companies and funds questioned did not expect an upturn in the market for at least one to two years. The survey found that 64 per cent of respondents believed conditions would improve and 9 per cent believed they would worsen. Last October 75 per cent of respondents thought conditions would improve and 3 per cent thought they would worsen. Most respondents expected the retail property market to recover first. The market considered least likely to lead a recovery was business space for light industrial and office use, closely followed by offices. The City of London was the least popular area in the country with property investors. British Land, the property company headed by Mr John Ritblat, was considered by nearly a quarter of respondents to be the most successful property company of 1991. Land Securities, the largest UK property company, was rated the most successful by 5 per cent of respondents. Gallup, which carried out the survey with Chartered Surveyors Weekly, an industry magazine, interviewed 98 directors of large property companies and funds which control Pounds 59bn of property.

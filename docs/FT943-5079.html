			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Expect the unexpected - Hidden costs can mean the difference between success and failure Starting a business is a dream for many people. But turning that dream into profitable reality is much tougher than anyone ever admits. The biggest difficulty for the new business is invisible: hidden costs. These unexpected expenses cannot be budgeted for and can mean the difference between survival and going under. 'None of the business advisers that I spoke to gave me any hint that huge bills can suddenly be slapped on you,' says Christina Simons, managing director of Simons Communications. She launched her Surrey-based public relations company in February 1993 and won the Lloyds Bank Award for Best Financially Controlled Business in Sutton in May 1994. For Simons, cost control is critical, but hidden costs undermine that control. 'With no idea of what you face in advance, there is no way you can plan what you need precisely. You can't calculate your set-up costs accurately.' I launched a small company in 1993, the Journalism Training Centre, and borrowed Pounds 20,000 from Barclays for computer equipment. The bank was unable to tell me the precise cost of arranging the loan until just before we signed the agreement. It turned out to be Pounds 300. Another cost arose because the Loan Guarantee Scheme is available only for companies with no security for the loan. So Barclays demanded I sign a debenture, establishing a charge over my assets. For arranging the debenture, the bank charged an additional Pounds 175. I challenged this cost and it was eventually waived. To discover the total expense forced on the centre over the past 18 months, I analysed all of its set-up costs. Of the Pounds 80,000 spent equipping it, I discovered that hidden costs accounted for a quarter - more than Pounds 20,000. The largest hidden cost occurred when the centre moved into a three-storey unit in a modern business park in Mitcham, Surrey. The Sun Alliance insurance company demanded the installation of security equipment to protect the computers. A security consultant recommended extra door and window locks, as well as an infra-red sensor system on all three floors. I was advised to mark all electronic equipment indelibly and to install metal shutters on the ground floor. Another hidden security cost was revealed when the alarm was linked by telephone line via a monitoring station to the police. British Telecom charged Pounds 150 to install the line and Pounds 450 annual rental. This was a surprise, and brought security costs to Pounds 5,400. Office telecommunications also proved surprisingly expensive: eight lines for the switchboard and a fax line cost Pounds 1,350. Visits by BT engineers to check the system cost Pounds 25 each. The installation bill - excluding switchboard, fax and handsets - amounted to Pounds 1,570. While BT and other public utilities cost more than expected - extra power points, for example, and inaccurate heating estimates amounted to further costs of Pounds 3,825 - another hidden extra arose from our suppliers. One of my colleagues says he is especially annoyed by the poor service most suppliers provide. It always involves extra costs, he claims. Simons, too, is angry over suppliers' service. 'However long suppliers say delivery or installation will take, it always takes twice as long. And many of them foul up.' The worst suppliers in her experience are computer dealers and telecommunications suppliers. 'BT cut us off by accident on our second day of trading,' she says. 'It took me hours to sort out. And that's another hidden cost - management time.' The most costly supplier setback at the Journalism Training Centre was the late delivery of a computer system. The hardware was delayed by nine days, forcing me to borrow software and rent machines for the trainees. It cost Pounds 2,100. The software never arrived. I am now in dispute with the supplier. If you are going to have to rely on a piece of equipment, be sure to allow extra time for delivery. What is disappointing is that so little of the small business literature, and so few consultants, prepare the entrepreneur for hidden costs. Even with the best of present advice, up to a fifth of all small businesses in the area, the London Borough of Sutton, go out of business in their first year. A third or more - 30 to 40 per cent - go down in the second year. John Wren, former executive director of the Sutton Enterprise Agency, says: 'When I review any business plan I look to have a contingency figure in there. People ask what it is for and I tell them: 'If I knew what it was for, it wouldn't be a contingency.' There rarely is enough there to cover the hidden costs.' For many entrepreneurs, on the threshold of creating their business dream, unexpected expenses can be a recurring nightmare. To minimise these surprise extras, businesses can try to follow this checklist: Shop around for suppliers, but remember that a short-term gain from a cheap supplier could be a long-term loss. Cost control is an important key. Simons says: 'If it isn't vital for life we don't buy it.' Get every detail of every deal with every supplier in writing. Before you launch a business, talk to someone who has already done it. Ask what their hidden costs are. Build in a contingency factor: add an extra 33 per cent to your most accurate quote on everything.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hidden costs of starting a business  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BANK                                                        463 Includes loan arrangement fees  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPUTERS                                                 6,750 Includes disputed overpayment, emergency rental costs and maintenance contract with new supplier  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COPIER                                                    1,430 Extra lease payment as security  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION                                   3,825 Includes connection, installation of power points and difference between initial power quote and actual invoice value  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LANDLORD                                                  1,250 Includes rent deposit and cost of planning application  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SECURITY                                                  5,400 Includes locks, alarms and sensors; registration and monitoring fees; metal shutters; security marking labels  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TELECOMMUNICATIONS                                        1,570 Includes installation costs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL HIDDEN COSTS                                       20,688  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NB All figures exclude VAT and budgeted capital expenditure, eg computers, switchboard and copier  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

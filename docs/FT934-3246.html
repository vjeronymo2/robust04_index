			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Broad demand for Argentina The Republic of Argentina's widely-expected Dollars 750m global bond offering dominated a busy day of new issuance in the international bond market yesterday. Joint lead managers Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers said that a good portion of Argentina's 10-year deal had been pre-placed as a result of an international roadshow which finished on Monday in New York. Although demand for the bonds was reported to be widespread, a large proportion is likely to flow into the hands of US investors, who have a bullish perception of Argentina's credit. The sovereign borrower is currently rated B1 by Moody's and BB - by Standard &amp; Poor's. Both these ratings are speculative grade but there is a view in the market that Argentina could be awarded an investment grade rating within a couple of years. Yesterday's deal, which could be the last significant international bond offering of the year, further extends the range of maturities available in Argentine paper. Prior to its first global bond offering, Argentina's longest maturity was seven years. The bonds are scheduled to be priced today to yield between 280 and 285 basis points over US Treasuries. The scale of demand raised hopes that the bonds would be priced at the tighter end of the range. Elsewhere, activity in the Euroyen sector picked up as the Kingdom of Sweden and LKB Baden-Wurttemberg took advantage of arbitrage opportunities in the 10-year area of the yield curve. Sweden raised Y50bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds priced to yield 16 basis points over the No 157 Japanese government bond, the current 10-year benchmark. Syndicate managers said that Sweden's bonds looked expensive when compared with LKB's Y40bn 10-year issue, which offered investors a yield spread of 20 basis points over JGBs. LKB is rated triple-A by both Moody's and S&amp;P while Sweden is rated Aa2 by Moody's and AA plus by S&amp;P. An official at Yamaichi, which arranged the Sweden deal, said that the spread on the bonds was justified by their zero risk weighting, as opposed to the 20 per cent risk weighting on LKB's bonds, and also by their greater liquidity. In addition, he said that many investors regarded the Kingdom as an improving sovereign credit. When Sweden's bonds were freed to trade, they slipped to 99.70 bid from an issue price of par and the spread widened slightly to 18 basis points over JGBs. By contrast, LKB's issue, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating D-Marks, was not freed to trade by late yesterday. Syndicate managers expect more issuance in the Euroyen sector in the near future as borrowers take advantage of the low interest rates in Japan. The Republic of Finland is expected to launch a Y45bn offering of five-year Eurobonds today, via Daiwa, and Salomon Brothers is likely to launch a Pounds 100m, 10-year Eurobond offering for itself priced to yield between 125 and 135 basis points over 10-year gilts.</p>

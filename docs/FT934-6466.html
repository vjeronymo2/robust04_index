			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Dutch paper group falls to Fl 9m loss in third term The continued weakness of European economies pushed KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, into a net loss of Fl 9m (Dollars 4.7m) before extraordinary items in the third quarter of 1993, compared with a net profit of Fl 7m the previous year. The figures took results for the first nine months to a net loss before extraordinaries of Fl 25m, compared with a net profit of Fl 168m the year before. KNP BT, which was formed from a three-way domestic merger in the Netherlands earlier this year, has already said that it plans to take a Fl 300m charge in 1993 to cover a restructuring. The company said that market conditions were similar to those of the first two quarters. The paper sector continued to suffer from overcapacity and price pressure, while the graphic systems sector was still feeling the effects of reduced demand in southern Europe. However, the company said that there were some signs of a hesitant improvement in business conditions. The figures, which were slightly better than analysts had forecast, were released after the close of trading in Amsterdam. Last week, the company's shares fell after a Belgian newspaper said that KNP BT's single biggest shareholder, Macmillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forest products group, wanted to sell its 16 per cent stake. Macmillan Bloedel said yesterday that it would sell its stake 'when the price is right'. Mr Glen Ferguson, Macmillan Bloedel's vice-president and treasurer, said the sale of the KNP stake would depend mainly on market value and 'it may be quite a way down the road'. In September, the Canadian company took up its share of a KNP BT rights offer, for CDollars 55m (USDollars 41.5m) to maintain its 16 per cent stake.</p>

This was  stated in an interview with foreign journalists by Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy. He said that  the document signed by the two presidents in Massandra last  September is not an agreement, merely a protocol of intent.  According to V. Bezkorovaynyy, this issue was studied but was  rejected. Both sides have agreed to set up a commission to take  an inventory of the ships and other Black Sea Fleet property  with a view to dividing it up.</p>

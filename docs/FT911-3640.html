			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Arts: Dutchman's dream of Italy The lure of the Classical South proved irresistible to countless generations of Northern landscape painters inspired by Claude and Poussin to bask in the golden light and antiquity of the Roman campagna. Claude's poetic handling of warm southern light was to have a significant effect on the Dutch painters who migrated south during the 1630s, '40s and '50s. It even influenced those who stayed at home, such as Cuyp. The work of these Dutch Italianates is perhaps the most neglected aspect of the Golden Age of Dutch painting. A small, predominantly loan exhibition at Richard L. Feigen &amp; Co (6 Ryder Street, SW1, until June 7) focuses on Adam Pynacker. After Jan Both, and along with Nicholaes Berchem, he is arguably the most important of the second and most interesting generation of Dutch Italianate landscape painters. The show is the first devoted to him. It serves as a reappraisal and as a reminder of the enthusiasm for 17th century Dutch painting in mid-18th century Britain which was to have a profound influence on the course of landscape painting in this country, from Richard Wilson to Turner. Pynacker's first biographer, Arnold Houbraken - his latest, Laurie Harwood, has curated this show - states that the artist spent three years in Italy. It seems likely that he was there 1645-48, and that he was travelling on his father's behalf as a wine merchant. The paintings executed on his return are the results of remembered experience. There are 11 paintings on show. With the Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'Bridge in an Italian Landscape' of around 1653, we catch our first glimpse of Pynacker's mastery. The clarity of its unifying light is breathtaking. The low-lying sun illuminates the underside of the bridge, catches the water and spangles the slender-leafed long grasses, the tree trunks and hanging vines with silver and gold. The muleteer and goatherd, who strike up conversation on the bridge surrounded by their stock, are naturalistically grouped; the figures and the dog are softly silhouetted against the bluish mountains beyond. Already various elements of the Pynacker repertory are established: the serpentine contortions of the overlapping trees (derived from Both); gnarled birch stumps invaded by fungi; and silver-tinted long grasses. An open, luminous sky around the light source fills one half of the canvas and acts as a foil to the dark woody hills of the other. Pynacker is probably best known for the larger canvases he painted in Amsterdam in the 1660s, examples of which can be seen in the Wallace Collection (which cannot lend) and the Dulwich Picture Gallery. This small but delightful show, especially if augmented by visits to Hertford House and Dulwich, probably serves Pynacker better than an exhibition of 100 paintings. Another Dulwich picture takes a bow at the National Gallery, in the first of its new series of Brief Encounters (until April 28). The aim of the series is to explore the relationship between two paintings closely related in technique, style and subjectmatter, one from the permanent collection and the other a loan. What better start than the Samson and Delilahs by Rubens and his disciple Van Dyck, the latter seen for the first time in Britain since its cleaning for the recent exhibition in Washington. Mantegna's treatment of the subject is misogynous; Rembrandt's is brutal; Rubens, in contrast, allows Delilah a moment of reflection. The shorn hero is still asleep in her arms, the soldiers at the door. She looks down at her doomed lover with an expression of triumph tinged with tenderness and a hint of regret. The pose of the two figures echoes a pieta. Rubens painted this glowing, opulent and dramatic tour-de-force after his return from Italy, in 1609. A decade later, the 20-year-old Van Dyck borrowed the composition and reversed it. In every respect, his reworking of the subject makes for a disappointing contrast. Rubens's penetrating psychology is lost. He was to prove much better at being Van Dyck than Rubens.</p>

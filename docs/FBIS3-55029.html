"All this  can be easily checked against bank documents. As for Aleksey  Zuyev, elected deputy of the State Duma from the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, he never worked for GMM and no work  agreements were concluded with him. The position of "adviser to  the president," he indicated, has never existed in the  company...."    According to our information, GMM will take action against  Mikhail Leontyev and the newspaper SEGODNYA tomorrow. At this  stage the firm plans to hold a series of consultations with the  Central Bank, which has suspended GMM operations. Mr.  Shakhovtsov, head of the Central Bank banking supervision  section, has said that in the absence of legislation on trust  companies, the operation of GMM pertains equally to that of a  trust and of a banking company.    In Zhirinovskiy's headquarters, it was said to our request  for comments on the situation that the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia absolutely did not care about GMM's problems, and that  the party was busy devising plans to destroy Germany, which had  refused its leader an entry visa.</p>

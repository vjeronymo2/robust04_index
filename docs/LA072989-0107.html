			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO VOTES ON PORTER RANCH PLAN  </P> <P> Recent events regarding the development of the North Valley should disturb all  of us!  </P> <P> A huge Century City-type commercial development is seeking approval from the  city. It would generate more than 160,000 car trips a day. Most days the air is  nauseating. This will make our air deadly! The size of this development is  unacceptable. Every other council member is fighting to zone down commercial  property. The councilman is fighting to increase the zoning thirty times over.  An effort to recall him is under way.  </P> <P> The proposal is bad with regard to traffic, the air, the schools and the  quality of life here.  </P> <P> ROGER STRULL  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

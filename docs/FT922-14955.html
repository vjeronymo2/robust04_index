			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Beregovoy replaces Cresson as French PM MR PIERRE BEREGOVOY was yesterday named France's new prime minister by President Francois Mitterrand in an attempt to reverse the declining fortunes of the Socialist party. After a week of intense speculation, Mr Beregovoy succeeded Mrs Edith Cresson, whose 10-month tenure was the shortest in the history of the Fifth Republic and who broke all records for unpopularity. She resigned following the Socialists' catastrophic defeats in regional and local elections last month. Mr Beregovoy, 66, a self-taught economist and long-serving finance minister, was quick to announce new policy initiatives. 'The first big priority is the fight against all forms of unemployment with new and bold initiatives,' he said. A slimmer and younger cabinet was announced last night, though some ministerial posts were unchanged. Mr Michel Sapin, 39, former junior justice minister, was a surprise appointment as finance minister - an indication Mr Beregovoy wants to retain strong influence in his old domain. Mr Roland Dumas remains foreign minister and Mr Pierre Joxe defence minister. Mr Bernard Tapie, 49, the millionaire businessman who fought a pugnacious Socialist-backed campaign in the regional elections, entered the government as urban affairs minister. Few expect Mr Beregovoy to give dramatic new directions to policy. He is an economic liberal, while his predecessor was an enthusiastic interventionist. He can be expected to steer clear of government activism in industrial policy experiments. Much of his time is likely to be taken up in trying to reverse the decline in the Socialists' standing in opinion polls. It has had an uninterrupted fall ever since Mrs Cresson was appointed little more than 10 months ago. He also has to prepare for general elections due inside a year. His most immediate practical problem is to get legislation through parliament. The Socialist government does not command an absolute majority, and Communists and centrists are likely to be more awkward than before. As the first woman to become prime minister in France, Mrs Cresson's appointment in May last year created a shortlived media sensation. Almost immediately she began to sink in the opinion polls. Her poor standing was attributed by many to her contentious and combative attitude, and her tendency to make crude and graceless political remarks. In one celebrated interview she characterised the Japanese as 'ants' and a quarter of British men as 'homosexuals'. Mr Beregovoy, by contrast, is a model of self-control and moderation and can be counted on to avoid any public faux pas. He has long been a close associate of Mr Mitterrand, serving as his secretary-general in the Elysee Palace during the first years of his presidency. Though Mrs Cresson's resignation became inevitable after the regional elections, it was delayed by four days of consultations by Mr Mitterrand. He is reported to have considered other candidates, including Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Mr Beregovoy's long tenure of the finance ministry and his achievements both in bringing down inflation and in liberating financial markets are bound to be reassuring in business circles. He told a party meeting yesterday his priorities were economic recovery and the fight against unemployment, the maintenance of law and order, European integration and protection of the environment.

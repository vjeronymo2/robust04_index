			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ifil to bid for 33% of Rinascente IFIL, the Agnelli family's stock market listed investment group, is to bid for 33 per cent of Rinascente, the Italian stores chain, as part of the financial restructuring of the Fiat group. Fiat currently holds 58 per cent of Rinascente's capital. The restructuring plan for the motor group, unveiled last week, includes a cash injection through the sale of the stores stake in two stages, culminating in Ifil acquiring control. However, it was not made clear whether Ifil would absorb the full Fiat stake or sufficient shares to take control. Over the weekend, Ifil revealed it was offering to pay L12,500 per share for 52.1m Rinascente shares, equivalent to 33 per cent of the ordinary capital. The offer will open on October 29 and close on November 19. Ifil already has substantial cash reserves, but will help pay for the deal by a one-for-five rights issue raising L492bn (Dollars 309m). Acquiring the 33 per cent stake in Rinascente is expected to involve Ifil in a total outlay of L650bn. Although Fiat's sale of its Rinascente stake 'in house' in its restructuring arrangements has aroused the most comment, Ifil was reported over the weekend as saying it was not over-burdened by the deal.

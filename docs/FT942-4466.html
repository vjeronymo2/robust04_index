			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Accounting rules for US options delayed US accounting rules for stock options granted to executives are being delayed to consider the issues raised. The rules, the first part of which was intended to have been introduced at the end of this year, have provoked a fierce reaction from companies in the US, particularly smaller ones. Under a draft issued for comment last summer, the Financial Accounting Standards Board proposed that companies should disclose more information about the value of stock options granted to executives, and the cost of the options to the company should be taken as an expense against profits. The proposals have angered many fast-growing smaller companies. Unable to match the salaries and cash bonuses paid by large companies, these companies seek to attract talented executives by issuing options which give the holder the opportunity to make big capital gains. If taken as an expense, these would add substantially to the reported costs of many US companies. Mr Dennis Berisford, chairman of FASB, said yesterday: 'All the provisions of the exposure draft, including expense recognition and measurement, will be reconsidered by the board.' However, Ms Diana Willis, project manager at FASB for the stock option rules, said this did not imply that the board was backtracking on the proposals. The board always reconsidered all rules after receiving comments from interested parties, she said. FASB said it was delaying the first stage of the rules, which would have required additional disclosure relating to stock options in companies' 1994 financial statements. The reconsideration of the draft rules is 'not expected to be completed before the first quarter of 1995', it added. FASB had hoped to publish final rules by the end of this year.</p>

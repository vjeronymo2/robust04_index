			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / EC cartel office urged GERMAN and British competition officials yesterday called for the European Commission to establish an independent cartel office to reduce the risk of sensitive competition decisions being distorted by political considerations. Sir Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), said the Brussels competition directorate should split its investigative and prosecution functions as a first step towards establishing an independent tribunal. Such a panel would take decisions on pure competition grounds, Sir Sydney told a Brussels seminar of the new pro-Community think-tank, European Policy Forum. Commissioners would be able to overrule the tribunal in exceptional cases.</p>

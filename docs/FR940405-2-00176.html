The Multifamily Project Demonstration must be administered by a public housing agency or Indian housing authority (HA), and located in a unit of general local government of under 50,000 population. Selection of an HA to carry out this Demonstration is limited to eligible HAs in the HUD Boston Region which includes the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice presents the Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines and announces the availability of funding of up to $6,172,250 in section 8 budget authority which will support project-based certificate assistance for an estimated 75 to 150 units. In addition, up to $1,012,500 in supportive services grant funds will be made available by HUD to the selected HA to provide program participants who are frail elderly persons with services appropriate to their needs so they may continue to live independently and avoid premature or unnecessary institutionalization. The selected HA must match the HUD supportive services funds with at least 50 percent of the total cost of the supportive services estimated to be necessary by the HA and approved by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to determine the feasibility of using section 8 project-based certificate assistance to assist frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in a single multifamily housing project specifically designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons, and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in the provision of supportive services. The Multifamily Project Demonstration is a five-year demonstration; however, the initial term of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract is renewable for three additional five-year terms at the option of the HA and subject to the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NOFA contains information concerning the deadline for filing applications; eligibility of applicants; available amounts; selection criteria; and the application and selection process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 requires that any HA receiving additional section 8 rental voucher or certificate program funding must administer a family self-sufficiency (FSS) program. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), participation in the FSS program is optional. The FSS program regulations were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 27, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (56 FR 49592). Any rental voucher or certificate funding reserved in FY 1993 or subsequently, including funding made available under this NOFA, will establish or increase the minimum size of an HA's FSS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NOFA is substantially similar to the NOFA published on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50768), and withdrawn on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63181). The principal differences between this NOFA published in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the September 28, 1993 NOFA, are that this NOFA increases the availability of funding with amounts remaining from the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, and opens up occupancy in the multifamily demonstration project to near-frail elderly persons, as this term is defined in this NOFA. Although eligible near-frail elderly persons are permitted to reside in the multifamily project, supportive services grant funds are still restricted to funding services for only the frail elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NOFA provides for a two-tiered competition based on: (1) The proposal for supportive services and the proposal to construct or rehabilitate the housing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The competitive selection criteria identified in the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NOFA also increases the fair market rents (FMRs) published April 24, 1991, by two percent per year to adjust for inflation and corrects the FMRs previously published in Appendix 10 to reflect section 202 FMRs for housing designed for elderly persons and persons with disabilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The due date for submission of applications in response to this NOFA is July 5, 1994.

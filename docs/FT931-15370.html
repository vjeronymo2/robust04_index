			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Flood of recriminations after leak THE power of the newspaper leak has rarely been deployed to greater effect. On Friday a report by Sir David Calcutt QC, advocating the creation of a statutory Press Complaints Tribunal, was delivered to Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary. By yesterday, thanks to two devasting leaks, Sir David's report was sinking almost without trace before it had even been published. 'It looks to me like game, set and match (to the press),' Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission said yesterday with a certain glee. Lord McGregor, who denies all knowledge of or involvement in the leaks, was particularly scandalised at yesterday's leak: his own letter to Sir David, which was printed verbatim in The Guardian. It suggested that, far from being exploited by the press, the Prince and Princess of Wales had recruited national newspapers to carry their own accounts of their marital rifts. In the letter, Lord McGregor said his information had been obtained at a private dinner with Lord Rothermere, the proprietor of the Daily Mail, and asked that, whatever happened to the rest of the letter, that paragraph should not be published. 'I am absolutely scandalised that the letter was circulated all over Whitehall. It must have been circulated through Calcutt's office,' Lord McGregor said. The PCC chairman is still fuming at the second and third chapters of the new Calcutt report, devoted to the work of the self-regulatory body. 'It was reeking with prejudice and malice,' said Lord McGregor, who was not prepared to discuss it with Sir David. He insists: 'But I didn't leak a word about it.' Someone who has seen the new Calcutt report insists that the leaks in the Sunday newspapers are 'close but not that close.' While there is little doubt that Sir David has recommended the replacement of the PCC with a statutory tribunal, it will probably be Friday before details become available when the report is published. Thanks to high-level briefings on the leaks - which may or may not have been politically inspired - it is now clear that Mr John Major, the prime minister, has no intention of introducing a statutory tribunal chaired by a judge with or without the power to impose fines on errant newspapers. All that is good news for Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun. He told a radio phone-in show: 'I don't fancy a month in the Scrubs (prison), but if it was something that we believed in then I can see editors going off to jail - no doubt about it.' Legislation against electronic eavesdropping and recording private telephone calls without serious public interest is now considered inevitable.</p>

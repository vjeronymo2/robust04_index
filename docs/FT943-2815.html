			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / EU action on textiles pact 'a travesty' The European Union, the world's largest textiles and clothing importer, appears set to take only token steps to open its market when it starts implementing a landmark Uruguay Round accord to liberalise trade in the products from the start of next year. Though permissible under the Uruguay Round, the approach currently favoured in Brussels was described by one European government official yesterday as 'against the spirit of the Gatt.' The Uruguay Round agreement brings textiles and clothing for the first time under Gatt rules and commits the body's members to eliminate by 2006 the Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which tightly restrict the Dollars 240bn (Pounds 154bn) annual world trade in the products. Under the deal, countries have to subject at least 16 per cent of their textiles and clothing imports to Gatt disciplines in the next three years. This is the first of three phases in the planned dismantling of the 20-year-old MFA. However, the Commission is proposing - with apparent backing from most EU states - to carry out this commitment in a way which would leave the range of products covered by MFA quotas virtually unchanged until 1998. The Commission plans to do this by subjecting to Gatt rules products which are mostly exempt from MFA quotas. Many will be chosen from a list which includes items such as hats, umbrellas, car seat belts and parachutes, but excludes mass-market products such as cotton garments. The EU imported about Dollars 51bn of textiles and clothing products in 1992, mostly from developing countries. The World Development Movement, a Third World lobby group which has analysed the Commission proposals, estimates they would result in the EU lifting restrictions on only 0.1 per cent of products on which it imposes quotas. It said the EU's move was 'a travesty' of the agreement to phase out the MFA. Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are pressing for a more liberal approach but are strongly opposed by southern European EU members, which have politically powerful textile industry lobbies. Gatt members must submit final proposals for implementing the accord to the organisation by October 1. The US, which also has many textiles quotas, has yet to announce how it plans to meet its Gatt commitment. But President Bill Clinton has said it will not move quickly to lift curbs, and many US textiles producers and importers believe his administration will adopt an approach similar to that of the EU. Countries which do not remove MFA quotas will nonetheless be required by the Gatt to gradually lift ceilings on imports covered by the restrictions. Japan and Switzerland are the only industrialised countries which do not impose MFA quotas. Though heavily influenced by domestic political motives, tough EU and US attitudes are partly intended to press developing countries to open their textiles and clothing markets. Officials in Geneva say the two trade powers are co-ordinating their efforts closely. Under the Uruguay Round, most developing countries are required to lower the often punitive tariffs they impose on imports. However, India and Pakistan, two of the world's leading textiles exporters, have so far balked at liberalising their import regimes. Producers in the US and Europe believe that they could sell large volumes of clothing to middle-class consumers in India and Pakistan if they had freer access to their markets.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Employers warned on attendance Employers may be breaking the law if they force workers to take holiday or unpaid leave because of travel disruption caused by the rail dispute, the Industrial Society warned today. The society, an independent advisory and training body and an authority on employment practice, urged employers to be 'firm, but fair' about absenteeism caused by the strikes. It said it had heard of several cases where workers had been told that they should take a day's holiday or unpaid leave if they could not get to work because of the strikes. Ms Sonia Pearson, personnel expert at the society, said: 'Bosses who are forcing workers to take holiday, or even unpaid leave, on days when they genuinely cannot travel to the office could be breaking the law if this power is not included in their employment contracts. As well as creating ill-will they are not solving the immediate absence problem.' She added: 'But that does not mean they should tolerate absences from people who could make it to work with reasonable effort - and employees have a duty to make every effort to come to work, which includes finding alternative routes.' The society suggested ways that absence could be reduced, including contributing to extra expenses incurred by staff who made the journey into work, such as parking fees or taxi fares, so long as they had been agreed in advance.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU law needs enforcing Sir, Emma Tucker's report, 'Brussels to name single-market laggards' (May 23), reveals how out of touch is the law-making perspective of the European Commission. Welcome though a league table of the performance of member states in adopting EU single-market legislation might be, it is not the adoption but the implementation and enforcement which matters. Countries with legal systems that allow them to 'copy out' numerous directives into national law en bloc have little difficulty in adopting EU legislation. The flaws and gaps in the single market occur where the legislation has been transposed but fails to be executed on the ground. UK regulators appear to be among the most efficient in Europe. This is where a league table would be really useful. Richard Brown, deputy director-general, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QB</p>

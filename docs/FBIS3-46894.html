			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii dismissed reports Thursday [6 January] that a new economic  package may be further delayed, and reaffirmed the government's  plan to compile it by around the middle of this month. Fujii  said there was no change in the timing of the package which  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa instructed Economic Planning  Agency Director General Manae Kubota late last year to compile  by "around mid-January."    Reports of a possible delay in the package circulated after  the fourth gathering Thursday of ministers and coalition parties  leaders to discuss economic problems failed to come up with a  timetable. "I didn't get such a nuance" from the meeting, Fujii  said, adding that the mood was to decide on the schedule.    Concerning an income tax cut which is reportedly the major  issue in the discussions, Fujii said that a decision on whether  or not to include it in the new package has not been made but  will come by mid-January, as Hosokawa pledged to the Diet.    Asked about the dollar-yen rate, Fujii declined to comment  on  remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sounding a  warning on the yen's recent setback against the dollar.    Fujii said the finance ministers of the Group of Seven  industrial nations agreed in September that exchange rates  should reflect economic fundamentals.    The agreement "has not changed and should not be changed,"  Fujii said, adding that he is "closely watching the market  situation."    Bentsen said Wednesday that "allowing the yen to slide is  not  an acceptable way out of recession for Japan." His comment  followed remarks by a Japanese Government official, speaking  anonymously, who called for a rate of 115 yen to the dollar  because a cheaper yen would have a "favorable impact" on the  Japanese economy.</p>

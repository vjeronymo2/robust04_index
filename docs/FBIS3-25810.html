How  to implement the system in which state-owned enterprises go  bankrupt? How to make arrangements for the placement of  unemployed workers following enterprise bankruptcy? How to  control the current situation of heavy losses of state-owned  assets?    At the news conference held by the State Council Press  Office  today, domestic and foreign reporters repeatedly asked officials  of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System of  China questions on the structural reform of state-owned  enterprises, which is the key to China's economic reform this  year.    As introduced by Hong Hu, vice minister of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, the objective  and orientation of state-owned enterprise reform in China is to  set up a modern enterprise system. This year, the State Council  will select 100 large and medium state-owned enterprises in  China as experimental units to implement the new system and  gradually transform the mechanism of state-owned enterprises in  various forms according to different categories. At present the  name list has not been fixed and is being discussed by the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economic System and the State  Economic and Trade Commission.    Small state-owned enterprises will be transformed in such  forms as leasing, contracting, selling, and leasing as well as  renting out. Enterprises which are always in the red, which are  unable to pay their debts, and which can never be reinvigorated  will declare bankruptcy according to law.    According to statistics, from the end of 1988 to the first  half of 1993, law courts at all levels in China accepted and  heard 948 cases of all kinds of enterprise bankruptcy, of which  480 have been wound up.    Hong Hu pointed out: To set up a modern enterprise system,  touching on the reorganization of property rights is inevitable.  The act of declaring enterprise bankruptcy according to law is  an effective way to readjust the industrial structure and  achieve the reorganization of property rights, but it is not the  only way. He said: Since we cannot issue planned targets of  bankruptcy to organs at lower levels, we cannot estimate how  many enterprises will go bankrupt in the reform of state-owned  enterprises.    Speaking on the placement of unemployed workers from  state-owned enterprises in China, Hong Hu said: At present, the  proportion of redundant personnel in the total number of  employees in China's state-owned enterprises is from 15 to 20  percent, and this proportion is subject to constant change due  to changes in the situation of operation and production in these  enterprises. Last year, the State Council worked out the method  of making arrangements for the placement of redundant personnel  in state-owned enterprises, and now the work has been started.    As stipulated in the method of unemployment insurance of  state-owned enterprise staff and workers, which was formulated  by the State Council last year, enterprises must withdraw 0.6 to  1 percent of total wages earned by their staff and workers to  set up unemployment insurance funds; and staff and workers  employed by enterprises which go bankrupt, which are on the  verge of bankruptcy, or which have stopped production for  reorganization are covered by the unemployment insurance scheme  so that the living of unemployed workers can be basically  guaranteed.    The current situation of heavy loss of state-owned assets in  China has also aroused much concern. Hong Hu said: The  "Regulations on the Supervision of China's State-Owned  Enterprise Assets" will be introduced soon, and we are now  tackling such technical problems as how to make the regulations  converge with the Company Law.    Hong Hu said: The introduction of the regulations has an  important bearing on stopping the loss of state-owned assets  during the current process of setting up a modern enterprise  system, transferring property rights, and reorganizing  enterprises.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils bought Strong buying of oil shares on Wall Street overnight followed through into London, where US houses were aggressive buyers of the majors. The latest burst of US support for the sector again unnerved big UK institutions, which for the most part are underweight in the sector, especially in BP. US broking houses have been steadfast supporters of the UK oil majors for many months, focusing particularly on the recovery potential at BP. The latter's shares were the sixth best performer in the FT-SE 100 during the first quarter of the year, outperforming the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index by 18.3 per cent. BP took the honours yesterday, just managing to outpace Shell. BP closed 5 up at 306 1/2 p on 8.3m traded, while Shell rose 9 to 586 1/2 p. An element of uncertainty was injected, however, after Kuwait warned fellow Opec members that abuses of oil output quotas could lead to Kuwait lifting its production. The threat drove crude oil prices lower in London. Burmah Castrol shares suffered turbulence, caused by the placing by Cazenove of a block of 4.5m shares (2 1/2 per cent of the enlarged issued capital) at 705p apiece to help fund its acquisition from ICI of Tribol, the industrial lubricants manufacturer. The placing was said to have been oversubscribed 2 1/2 times. 'The deal looks sound and sensible and fits in neatly with Burmah's current strategy,' said one analyst.</p>

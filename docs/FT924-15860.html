			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Bombay Securities Scandal: Hiten Dalal, all the figures in his head Hiten Dalal, a distant cousin of Bhupen Dalal, is neither debonair nor flamboyant. He doesn't need a calculator or paper to handle figures. Widely acknowledged as a financial wizard, this unassuming broker appears to have all the numbers stored in his head. He lives so simply that he does not even have a telephone at home, zealously guarding his privacy. The broker with the largest dealings with Standard Chartered Bank was not even listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, having acquired his trading authority from the northern town of Kanpur, though he has no other apparent links with the place. Standard Chartered Bank executives say four cheques worth Rs780m were found in the office drawers of Arvind Mohan Lal, the treasury manager in the bank who first alerted the bank to the irregularities and was later dismissed. The cheques were made out to SCB from Hiten Dalal's account in Andhra Bank, but they bounced when they were presented.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Black buys options in Fairfax MR Conrad Black, the Canadian and UK publisher, has begun to implement plans to raise his interests' shareholding in John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group, to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. Fairfax directors announced last night they had been notified that Vanderkneep Holding, an associate of Mr Black's The Telegraph, had purchased a parcel of options in Fairfax from Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank, and its associates. The purchase, at a cost of about ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.5m), gives Mr Black's interests the potential to increase their total stake in Fairfax to about 21 per cent. The options, exercisable by the end of the year, are unissued participating convertible notes which can convert into shares. The purchases had been expected following a decision by the Federal government earlier this year to allow Mr Black to increase his Fairfax stake to 25 per cent, and to limit foreign ownership in the company to 30 per cent. The deal observes that position, with Hellman and Friedman's stake in Fairfax reduced to 5 per cent. Mr Black is expected to purchase Fairfax shares on the market to take his interest in the company to the allowable 25 per cent. Fairfax shares fell 6 cents to ADollars 2.16 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday after closing at a peak on Wednesday. The other large shareholder in Fairfax is Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media operator, who recently revealed a 10.45 per cent stake. Following the sale of Mr Packer's near 10 per cent interest in Westpac Banking Corporation earlier this week for more than ADollars 500m, speculation has intensified that he may move to increase his Fairfax stake. A partner in Hellman and Friedman, Mr Andrew Barger, said he was confident of Fairfax's future and Hellman and Friedman expected to continue to be an active participant in the company. Meanwhile, the Federal opposition yesterday called on the Federal government to release the advice it received before approving Mr Black's request to raise his Fairfax stake.</p>

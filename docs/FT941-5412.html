			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A captive of recession and high expectations - The European single market still has much to prove The European market exists. The question is: Does it work? The single market, freeing movement of goods, services, capital and people across the EU, came into effect in January last year. It was extended this year to four Efta countries - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Most countries in the newly-formed European Economic Area carry out 70 per cent of their foreign trade with the rest of the region - a very high level of integration. For several reasons, however, the market has not met expectations. Companies criticise the bureaucratic intricacies of the new regime for collecting and monitoring value added tax, as well as continued technical barriers to trade. The main reason for the sour reaction to the single market is that it has come into operation during deep recession. Low business confidence feeds on itself - helping explain why, according to last month's FT opinion poll, 77 per cent of European companies say they have registered no benefits from the single market. Mr Bruce Ballantine, a BP executive on secondment to Unice, the European employers organisation, says the survey exaggerates disappointment with the 1993 programme. The 'real effects' of the measures have been obscured by recession - but he admits: 'Expectations were far too high.' The easing of constraints on distribution of goods has been undeniable. Around 70m customs documents used annually to monitor cross-border trade were abolished on January 1 1993, leading to a 3 per cent saving in time taken for moving goods around Europe. However, the single market's main effect in boosting cross-border investment came in the years immediately after the project was launched in 1985. Since then, the investment effort - and its effect on growth - has petered out. Mr Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), says many German companies 'anticipated' the single market by building up Europe-wide production and distribution networks during the late 1980s. The Delors white paper on growth and competitiveness even suggests late 1980s single market optimism, by contributing to economic overheating, may have added to the severity of the subsequent recession. At the European Commission, some officials show frustration at criticism of the single market. They admit the programme has been a victim of its own advance publicity. An optimistic Commission report in 1988 predicted it would add 4.5 per cent to Europe's gross national product in the medium term. Brussels officials now claim the programme has added an average annual 0.4 percentage point to growth since 1985. But the single market programme is incomplete. The main areas where the Commission wants to fill the gaps are: Abolition of passport controls. Checks were supposed to end on January 1 last year, but even the most federally-minded EU members have not met deadlines for ending them. Implementation and enforcement of proposals and legislation. Some 95 per cent of the original 282 proposals have now been agreed by member states, and 87 per cent of the relevant measures have been transferred into national law. Removal of technical barriers. Niggling regulations still hamper cross-border trade, particularly for smaller businesses. Liberalisation of 'closed' sectors. Important sectors such as energy, telecommunications and postal services were left out of the original 1985 programme. Proposals to introduce more competition here have made slow progress. Enforcement of procurement legislation. The Commission wants to enforce rules opening public authority and utility contracts to free competition. Meanwhile, the Commission is resigned to criticism. Without more evidence of how the project is working, one senior official says it will be difficult for Brussels to strike a balance between 'misguided complacency and an exaggerated view of the problems'.</p>

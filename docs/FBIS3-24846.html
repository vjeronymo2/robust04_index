They broke the windows of some residential buildings  and damaged some vehicles passing on the streets, including  those of the law enforcement forces. In performing their  legitimate duties and in order to restore law and order, the law  enforcement forces therefore intervened and began dispersing  these people and arresting the disruptive elements.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Rabin and Arafat to hold Cairo talks BARELY three weeks after reluctantly shaking hands with Mr Yassir Arafat on the White House lawn, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, is due in Cairo today to hold a first working meeting with the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader to discuss the logistics of the autonomy plan for the occupied territories. At the hastily arranged meeting the two are expected to try to agree on a venue for lower-level talks next week on the autonomy details, as well as to discuss the escalating tension in the occupied territories since the joint declaration of principles on autonomy was signed in Washington on September 13. PLO officials in Tunis said Mr Arafat would specifically broach the issues of Palestinian refugees, 'removal of Jerusalem's isolation' from the peace process and 'the end to daily repressive measures' in Gaza and the West Bank. Mr Arafat, who flew into Cairo yesterday afternoon, is certain to reiterate his protests about the recently intensified Israeli army crackdown on violent Palestinian activists in the territories. In Gaza yesterday, Israeli undercover troops shot dead a gunman loyal to Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO. Witnesses said he had dropped his weapon and was stuck on a barbed wire fence when the soldiers opened fire. Two other Palestinians were killed last weekend, several dozen have been arrested, and this has in turn triggered a number of attacks on Israeli targets, including the suicide bombing of an Israeli bus in the West Bank on Monday. Mr Arafat wrote to complain to Mr Rabin at the weekend about the military operations and said on Monday in Algiers that Israel had offered to meet the PLO to 'get the situation in hand'. Mr Rabin is understood then to have suggested today's quickly-organised meeting in Cairo. The PLO said it was hoped the Rabin-Arafat meeting, arranged at the Israeli prime minister's initiative, would mark 'a new starting point for the negotiations, after the spirit of the peace accord was violated by the Israeli army's repressive measures'. Israeli officials said merely that Mr Rabin wanted to meet Mr Arafat in person 'to dispel any illusions or misunderstandings' relating to the autonomy deal and 'smooth the start' of next week's negotiations. Mr Rabin has repeatedly dismissed PLO charges the offensive against 'wanted' Palestinians undermines the accord, arguing it is in the interests of both sides that violent opponents of the accord be subdued. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in Cairo he would join the meeting and 'if anything is needed, we are ready to help'. Today marks the 20th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the last conflict between Egypt and Israel before Mr Mubarak's predecessor, the late Mr Anwar Sadat, embarked on the path that led to the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace accord.</p>

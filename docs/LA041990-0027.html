			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> While I commend The Times for recognizing the vitality of grass-roots efforts  in my hometown ("The Spirit of Los Alamitos," editorial, April 10), I feel  compelled to mention some important aspects about Measure K, which continue to  be downplayed.  </P> <P> Your editorial glosses over the purely political decision by bond supporters to  exempt property owners 65 years or older from the $4.50-a-month tax.  </P> <P> The flawed rationale for the exemption, allowable under California state law,  is that senior citizens will not derive benefits from well-maintained schools.  </P> <P> However, elderly citizens within the boundaries of the Los Alamitos Unified  School District, among the most affluent and able to pay for such a tax in  Orange County, will certainly derive more attractive property values from a  town with relatively respectable educational facilities.  </P> <P> It is a sad commentary that bond supporters, in order to ensure political  survival, omitted a whole class of citizens unlikely to give back to the  community. From this perspective it appears that one generation is being pitted  against another; and I would not advise that for any community interested in  following Los Alamitos' grass-roots activism.  </P> <P> SCOTT RABER  </P> <P> Berkeley  </P></p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Flat-rate pension rebates 'too costly' TAX REBATES to encourage young people to opt out of the state earnings-related pensions scheme (Serps) should be reduced and larger rebates offered to older people, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The institute concludes in a study of financial arrangements for personal pensions that the present system of flat-rate tax rebates costs the government more in forgone revenue than it can ever save on social security payments. 'There is no particular reason to favour younger workers over older,' the institute concludes. By the time an individual has reached the late 40s, it is no longer advantageous to hold a personal pension and policyholders would be well advised to opt back into Serps, says the institute. The age at which the advantage disappears depends on whether the personal-pension holder is male or female and on the assumptions of investment returns earned on contributions. The government has ruled out age-related rebates, arguing that they would not provide enough incentives for young people to opt out of the system and that they would be too confusing. Much of the life assurance industry, which markets personal-pension plans, opposes any move to age-related rebates. The government has said it will offer additional incentive payments only to personal-pension holders over 30 from April next year. The rebate will still be insufficient to discourage older people from rejoining the state scheme, the study says. Pension scheme sponsors need to increase contributions as members of schemes grow older, the institute says. Thus lower contributions are needed for younger members and higher ones for older members. The government's present flat-rate rebates allow young people to buy a more generous personal pension plan than they could achieve by remaining in Serps, but the contribution is too small for older people to maintain personal pensions. The institute also notes that transaction costs on personal pensions can significantly reduce returns to policyholders. The institute concludes that between a third and a fifth of contributions to a scheme can be eaten up in charges. The Personal Pensions Stampede.

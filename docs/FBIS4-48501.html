			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The man often assumed to be the power behind the  throne in Malawi is Minister of State in the Presidency's Office  John Tembo. On the line last night, I asked him whether him  whether the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] had yet conceded defeat.    [Begin recording] [Tembo] Actually, depending on the figures  which were coming in yesterday, UDF [United Democratic Front]  were ahead in polling. The figures were in their favor; but  naturally the final figures were not out yet. We should be  getting them sometime this morning or late afternoon today. Our  reaction to it is that there is a normal electoral process and  we accept the victory of the UDF or any other party which wins  in this election. It is part of a system which we set in motion  to do.    [Unidentified reporter] But surely, if this trend does  continue and the UDF indeed win, it must come as rather a bitter  blow to you that the MCP has suffered such a heavy defeat?    [Tembo] Well, naturally any party which loses, it feels sad,  but if you accept, in a multiparty system, a democratic process  and the right for people to choose a party of their choice, you  must also accept that you can lose or win and the Malawi  Congress will accept.    [Reporter] So, why do you think the results have been so bad  in fact?    [Tembo] Well, I don't consider them that bad. I mean,  considering the fact that the Malawi Congress Party has been in  power for the last 30 years. It is natural that people in the  transition we are going through, not only in Malawi but  elsewhere, have the right to choose the party they want to  govern them at that time. So, it is not really a shock or that  bad.    [Reporter] Overall, have you been happy with the conduct of  the election, that it has indeed been a peaceful and free and  fair vote?    [Tembo] Yes, so far as the process is concerned, it has been  very free and very fair. There has been no problem. No report  of any intimidation. There is no report of any problem at any  station. There has been some report of confusion in some polling  stations because of the existence of two (?discarded) boxes, but  otherwise it has been very, very quiet, and the atmosphere has  been extremely good.

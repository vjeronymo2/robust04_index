			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The focus of the German government bond market this week will be the figures on new manufacturing orders and industrial output. Attention will also be directed towards the next government auction, expected to be of 10-year bunds, which is scheduled for early June. After the Bundesbank was forced to call off its auction of four-year treasury bills last week due to lack of bids, analysts think this next sale will be a good test of the market's health. Most analysts reckon there will be enough demand for the auction to go ahead successfully. Economic data will be scrutinised for signs of stronger economic growth. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi, thinks final figures for industrial output in March could show a marked upward revision in manufacturing output, which would set a more cautionary tone for the week. Some analysts say there is potential for further falls in German bonds amid continuing fears that short-term interest rates are not about to fall further. However, Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt, is more optimistic. He was surprised bunds did not fall further than they did on the back of Friday's slide in US Treasuries, and says this bodes well for this week.</p>

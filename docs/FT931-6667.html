			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Schubert, with 'piano' foibles ON Tuesday Richard Goode played Schubert sonatas on the South Bank; on Wednesday there were Schubert impromptus in Nikolai Demidenko's Wigmore Hall programme, the third of six in his 'selectively subjective' conspectus of the historical repertoire. These pianists, American and Russian, had little else in common but their formidably intelligent address - and a couple of foibles. They both allowed their Steinways heavy, carnivorous roars in the bass, which no instrument that Schubert and his contemporaries knew could have emitted. Sometimes that incurred real musical distortions: in Goode's sonatas D537 and D840, and in Demidenko's otherwise splendid account of the Weber Sonata no. 2, which was often bottom-heavy. Contrariwise both pianists were shy with lyrical piano passages, which tended to have wan expressive profiles, treated with the caution of connoisseurs handling Faberge eggs. In everything sturdier, they had their own quite different virtues. Every sound that Demidenko makes has been polished to his own exalted standards of perfection, every sequence tailored to its context, keyboard-balance finely calibrated - except in Weber] - and the whole planned to the hilt. That is his way of realising his chosen scores. Goode, a Classicist of rapidly widening reputation, goes more aggressively for dramatic sense. His Schubert had some hard, unlovely moments, but also a wealth of hard-forged ideas, and urgent purpose. Goode was generally very sparing with the pedal - perhaps on advice, for too generous pedalling will blot in the Queen Elizabeth Hall; but the tantalisingly incomplete D840 did sound uncomfortably lean in places, and its dramatic turns rudely abrupt. All in all, he seemed to play Schubert as if he were Beethoven, which was illuminating but not the whole story. The Beethoven cycle we are promised from Goode next year should be the real goods. Demidenko gave us Beethoven, the C major Sonata op. 2 no. 3; it was as good as expected - clean, elegant, virtuosic - but not excitingly better. As for his four Schubert Impromptus, D935, it was strange to find the familiar magical passages simply disappearing beneath such superbly refined pianistic dress. After the interval, however, Demidenko made brilliant amends with his Czerny (the Variations on 'La ricordanza'), his Vorsek Fantasia, and to be fair his Weber sonata too. Not only were the required digital feats brilliant as could be, but he melted warmly, almost expansively, into the sentiments of all that music - partly, no doubt, because they are so explicitly rendered in the figuration and the arabesques. Given those express demands, Demidenko revelled in them; and so did we all. A prickly, oblique artist he may be, but also a master pianist with few peers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Sailhan] </F>   [Excerpts] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- French troops in Zaire  were poised Thursday [23 June] to move into Rwanda in the first  stage of a two-pronged operation to help Tutsis at risk behind  Hutu government and militia lines, senior military staff said.    The soldiers on Thursday would move into Rwanda's  southwestern Cyangugu district to help some 8,000 Tutsis at  three or four sites, the military sources said.    The French humanitarian mission to prevent further slaughter  in Rwanda's ethnic bloodbath would also involve intervention on  Friday or Saturday in the Gisenyi region of northwestern Rwanda,  they said.    Gisenyi, north of Lake Kivu, is across the border from Goma,  one of two Zairean towns with Bukavu, where up to 2,000 French  troops will eventually be based for a UN-mandated, two-month  humanitarian operation. [passage omitted]    General Raymond Germanos, operations chief in the general  staff, said the mission will include a medical rapid  intervention force of some 60 men, located between Bukavu and  the Rwandan border.    The team would include medical, surgical and dental units,  he  said.    A military field hospital to care for Rwandan civilians will  also be installed between Goma and the Rwandan border, he said.  French medical staff will also cross into Rwanda with troops to  assess needs.    French chief of general staff Admiral Jacques Lanxade stated  that a total of up to 600 troops should muster in Goma and  Bukavu Thursday. [passage omitted]    In Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, some  1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Goma, French troops packed  their kit and mechanics checked over light armour. An AFP  correspondent at the French airbase, which has become a major  operations centre, saw rows of lorries and other vehicles  awaiting an airlift.    On Wednesday, three huge Russian cargo planes arrived  carrying French Puma helicopters essential to the operation.    French air force Jaguar fighters flew from Bangui to  Kisangani airport in northeastern Zaire to play a support role  in Operation Turquoise, military sources said. [passage omitted]</p>

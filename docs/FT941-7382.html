			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / 'More to Japan-US relations than targets': There is too much at stake, Tokyo's senior foreign ministry official tells William Dawkins Japan's senior foreign ministry official yesterday warned that the US-Japan trade row, if mishandled, could harm one of the world's most important bilateral relationships. 'If badly handled . . . those trade issues have the danger of affecting our overall relations,' warned Mr Kunihiko Saito, vice-minister for foreign affairs. He was 'quite embarrassed and even worried' by the Japanese press applause for prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's refusal to accept US demands for a fixed target for a decline in Japan's record trade surplus. Japan had turned down US demands before, in negotiations on fishery and aviation rights, and Mr Saito did not wish the government to be thought to have become assertive towards the US. 'We failed to reach agreement on only three specific areas in all the many aspects of our relationship . . . so we should not lose sight of the vast perspective,' said Mr Saito, in an interview in which he showed a sharp contrast to the bombastic recent line taken by US officials. Mr Saito admitted that the row had caused some damage and that Washington appeared to be 'mainly interested in improving trade relations with Japan' at a time when Tokyo was trying to reduce the weight of economic interests on its overall foreign policy. 'We are getting more and more aware that we cannot continue to pursue only an economic role for ever and we have to try to meet expectations held by the rest of the world,' he said. Despite the dispute, Japan believed its US relationship was 'essentially sound' and accorded more importance than ever to keeping close links with Washington, not least because of its value as the guarantor of security in Asia, he said. 'Japan depends on the US for its defence . . . . Although the Cold war is now over, the potential threat to our security continues to exist and we have no wish whatsoever to develop our military capability. All Asian countries, particularly members of Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations) think that that the US-Japan relationship is essential for the safety, security and prosperity of the whole region. In that sense, Japan and the US have a responsibility to try to remain friendly,' Mr Saito said. Whether the US continued to place such importance on Japan since the collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the most uncomfortable questions facing the Tokyo government's foreign policy planners. There may be 'a few people' in the US government who did not share Japan's view of the paramount strategic value of the relationship, Mr Saito feared. 'We hope that the number of these people will not increase in the future. Perhaps we need more efforts now than at the time of the Cold war to convince the Americans of the importance of our bilateral relations,' he said. Mr Saito drew a distinction between Japan's unchanging desire for close co-operation with the US and its preparedness to alter policies towards other countries, in the light of post-Cold war changes. 'Of course we have introduced some adjustments in our relations to other countries, but with the US we will be happiest if we can maintain our former relations,' he said. Despite the risk of the dispute spilling over to other aspects of US-Japan relations, the government planned to stand firm against numerical targets. He understood why the US wanted to try new methods of reducing the Japanese trade surplus in the light of the failure of many previous attempts. Accepting a precise target 'may alleviate the present pressure but it will only postpone the problem one year or two years', said Mr Saito. Other governments, not just the US administration, would be tempted to blame Japan for missing such a target and might then restrict Japanese imports on the pretext of helping Tokyo to meet the goal, he argued. Japan would stick to this position, not because it was being assertive, said Mr Saito, but because it believed this was the right thing to do.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALTICS REFUSE TO JOIN TALKS ON FORMING FEDERAL STATE;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THEY WILL PROCEED WITH SECESSION. GORBACHEV SUFFERS A SETBACK.  </P> <P> The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declared Saturday that  they will not participate in the negotiations to transform the Soviet Union  into a federal state with broad autonomy for its members.  </P> <P> The three Baltic presidents, meeting in the Latvian beach resort of Jurmala,  said their republics instead will proceed with talks on their own independence  from the Soviet Union and on their future relations with Russia and the other  republics that remain in the federal union.  </P> <P> The three presidents -- Arnold Ruutel of Estonia, Anatolijs Gorbunovs of Latvia  and Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania -- also agreed to negotiate jointly with  the Soviet central government or, if Moscow does not agree to this  "three-plus-one" formula, then to coordinate their talks on independence.  </P> <P> The Baltic decision, while expected, will undermine President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's efforts to hold the Soviet Union together in the face of the  centrifugal pressures of growing nationalism in virtually all its 15  constituent republics.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who is struggling despite increasing challenges to maintain the  Soviet Union's integrity as a state, had hoped that the Baltic republics would  at least join the negotiations on the treaty establishing a new federal union  even if they did not join the union.  </P> <P> Their decision not to remain even as observers could add to sentiment, already  considerable in republics such as Armenia, Georgia and the Ukraine, that the  negotiations as now constituted are futile and should be abandoned in favor of  open-ended talks without preconceptions of the result.  </P> <P> The Baltic drive for independence was appreciably strengthened by an agreement  reached Friday by the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian presidents with Boris N.  Yeltsin, the populist president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, on  continuing cooperation as they secede from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> A series of treaties will be drafted in the next two months that should go a  long way to ensuring a smooth transition -- as well as recognizing the  independence of the Baltic states because this will be part of the preamble of  each agreement.  </P> <P> In the agreement reached with Yeltsin, the three Baltic presidents said  negotiations will begin immediately on long-term cooperation in economic  development, trade, science and technology and cultural relations. Citizenship,  repatriation and welfare benefits will also be included in the treaties.  </P> <P> In terms of Soviet politics, the agreement puts Yeltsin well ahead of Gorbachev  in coping with the country's impending disintegration, for Russia under Yeltsin  will be playing a larger and possibly more effective role in shaping the new  relationship than the central government under Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "Latvian independence must definitely be recognized in the first, the political  section of our treaty," Yeltsin said in an inter view with Latvian television.  </P> <P> Yeltsin met with the Baltic presidents at Jurmala, where he has been  vacationing, and then joined them and their wives for a dinner of fish that he  and Gorbunovs had caught. Landsbergis, a concert pianist and professor of  musicology, played the piano to entertain the party, and Yeltsin's wife  assembled the participants for a group photo.  </P> <P> As shown on Latvian television in a report from Jurmala, the convivial and  relaxed Yeltsin was a marked contrast to Gorbachev, usually tense and irritated  when dealing with Baltic questions. The effect of the report, probably  intended, almost seemed to be one of reassurance that here was a man with whom  the republics could work.  </P> <P> Gorbachev earlier this month called a new union treaty vital to his plans to  transform the country's centrally planned, state-run economy into one in which  the market forces of supply and demand and entrepreneurship predominate.  </P> <P> In their declaration, issued Saturday after a meeting that continued well past  midnight, the three Baltic presidents said their republics have no territorial  or other claims on each other.  </P></p>

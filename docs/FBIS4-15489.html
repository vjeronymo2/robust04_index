			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Attempts To Halt Emigration in </F> Kirghizia"]    [Text] The Kirghiz Government has formulated a program to  reduce the level of emigration.    It contains a package of documents aimed at creating the  requisite legislative base for emigration based on international  legal norms as well as proposals to create joint ventures and  production units, interstate investment funds, and a balanced  cadre policy. The package also includes documents examining the  full-fledged use of Russian within the system of public  education, science, technology, and culture. A considerable  part of the program is devoted to tightening up administrative  and criminal liability for fueling interethnic enmity. What is  more, special measures have been formulated to avert a "brain  drain."</p>

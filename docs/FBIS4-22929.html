			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Konorov: ``Will There Be Any Newtons for </F> Us?'']    [Text] A round table has been held in the Ministry of  Science and Technology Policy.    In opening the discussion, Head Minister Boris Saltykov  stressed that the basic goal of State policy in the area of  science and engineering is to retain the best part of the  scientific-technical potential of Russia under conditions of  economic collapse.    Boris Saltykov bitterly noted that all last year, due to the  lack of adequate funding, scientists had to think about holding  on to science rather than development.    However, we managed to do quite a bit even under these  difficult conditions. Forty one State scientific-technical  programs were set up and put into operation. Proposals have been  prepared on implementing 117 priority technologies and new kinds  of goods within the scope of State structural policy. Funding  has been obtained for 33 State science centers, which has  enabled retention of leading science schools in the high-tech  field.    As one of the foremost among the republics of the former  Soviet Union, Russia has been first to enter as a full-fledged  member into the European technological program ``Eureka.'' An  intergovernmental agreement has been concluded on  scientific-technical cooperation with the United States.  International scientific-technical cooperation of Russia has  enabled continuation of many research projects in the field of  high-energy physics, the human genome and genetic engineering,  and promising information technologies.    However, the speakers noted that the situation in science  and  technology is getting tenser. As before, science is being funded  by the month, and by leftovers. For example, last year science  organizations were underfunded by about 300 billion rubles.    Numbers of science personnel are also diminishing, both  because of the outflow of scientists to the private sector, and  because of the ``brain drain'' abroad. The best people are  leaving. The prestige of work in science has waned, there is a  reduction in the percentage of graduates from institutions of  higher education that train science personnel, schools of  science and whole disciplines are breaking up.    There has been a sharp reduction in volume of agreements  between enterprises and science organizations, the construction  of science projects has been curtailed, unique structures are  falling into disrepair. The breaking of ties between  organizations of the former Soviet republics is having an  enormous detrimental impact on the development of science.    Lack of cash is decelerating and downscaling international  cooperation.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

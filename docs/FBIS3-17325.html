According to Zukhurov, the domestic opposition in Tajikistan  represents no serious threat to the state. He pointed out that  the opposition consisted of separate bandit formations in the  mountain regions. He stressed that these opposition formations  were only capable of committing terrorist acts and sabotage in  distant populated centers.    Zukhurov supported the idea of political settlement in the  Republic. He announced that negotiations between the official  authorities and the opposition were being prepared.    Zukhurov also spoke for the further presence of CIS joint  peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. He said the peacekeeping  forces must remain in the region until a final settlement of the  situation in the Republic.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / What future for coal?:  Coal chief sees little hope of saving more pits THE chances of saving more coal pits are slim unless there is 'a radical change' in the UK energy market, Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman of British Coal, told the trade and industry committee of backbench MPs yesterday. He said that it was doubtful whether even British Coal's tentative agreement to sell 30m-40m tonnes a year to the electricity industry over the next five years could be maintained, because of pressures from competing fuels. He warned that if British Coal failed to confirm these contracts - which would account for 80 per cent of its output - the most the company would get would be 'a nominal tonnage' at world prices which would be below those currently being negotiated. Even if British Coal managed to raise its market share this would not necessarily save a large number of pits because of the productivity gains being achieved in the pits being kept open. Mr Clarke also gave a gloomy long-term prognosis for coal in the UK. He warned that although reserves were sufficient for several hundred years, the UK coal industry would only survive for 20 to 40 years at present coal prices. Mr Clarke said the mines had been placed into three categories according to their physical characteristics, their financial position, their ability to serve market needs, their employment position and risk factors. Ten pits fell into the top category of mines which had solid prospects. These were all being kept open. Eleven had lesser prospects and would probably have to close, though four of them were strong enough to warrant mothballing. The remaining 27 were unlikely to survive. MPs sought assurances from Mr Clarke that British Coal would do nothing to damage the prospects of any pits until the review had been completed. Mr Clarke said he had already given that assurance to the courts, where miners' unions are mounting a legal challenge to the closure plan. Mr Clarke said British Coal had sought 'enhanced' redundancy payments for miners laid off by the pit closures, but had been unable to persuade the government to agree to them. The cross-party employment committee of MPs has joined the trade and industry committee and the public accounts committee in deciding to investigate British Coal's pit closure programme. The committee yesterday agreed to examine the implications for jobs of the plans to shut 31 mines and make 30 000 miners redundant. Mr Neil Clarke, the British Coal chairman, will give evidence to the committee next Wednesday. Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan set for Dollars 1.3bn South Africa package - Aid and trade deal will pave way for reinvestment When he takes his seat at the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations in Naples next week Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, will not come entirely empty-handed to the table. One particular offering that Japanese officials have been preparing for their premier to bring - an aid and trade package worth as much as Dollars 1.3bn for South Africa's new democratic government - may assume added significance as a signal of Japan's desire to be a good world citizen in spite of the country's internal political upheavals. This will focus on investment projects linked to the reconstruction and development programme set out by the all-race Pretoria government in sectors such as telecommunications, medical and educational facilities. It will pave the way for Japanese companies to reinvest in South Africa at a time when their funds will be welcomed as an indicator of confidence. Last week an official Japanese mission flew to Johannesburg to seek out aid targets. The Tokyo foreign ministry yesterday declined to confirm the figures, but if the package is on the lines of that planned by the previous government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, it could comprise some Dollars 300m in official development assistance, up to Dollars 500m in Eximbank loans and a further Dollars 500m in trade and investment insurance cover over the next two years. The Japanese corporate sector rapidly reined back when the ministry of international trade and industry had to confess at the height of the sanctions era in the late 1980s that Japan had suddenly emerged as white-run South Africa's leading trading partner - ahead of countries such as Germany which had previously headed the rankings. In the same way, private enterprise may now follow the Tokyo government's lead in rebuilding ties with the country under President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress-led government of national unity. Part of the new aid will anyway be tied to trade with Japanese companies. Japan is currently South Africa's fourth largest trading partner as the high value of the yen has continued to push Japanese multinationals towards production abroad, but there have so far been few signs that Japanese companies are ready to invest heavily in South Africa. Licensing agreements largely maintained a Japanese presence in South Africa through the sanctions era and in some cases for many years before. The question now is whether Japanese companies, which until now have been content to provide parts and brand names to local manufacturing units in which they have no equity stake, are willing to contemplate closer operational or shareholding links. No big rush looks likely. One prime example is Toyota South Africa, the country's biggest car maker, a family-controlled company quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in which Toyota of Japan has no direct holding. It obtained franchise rights to use the Toyota name as far back as 1961 and has imported components ever since - currently representing some 35 per cent by value of vehicles produced. In the same way, Mazda vehicles are produced by Samcor, controlled by Anglo-American, the country's leading conglomerate. The automotive sector is overcrowded and Mr Peter Arthur, a partner at Webber Wentzel, a Johannesburg law firm which has recently acted for several multinationals investing in the country, says that 'we are not seeing new motor manufacturers coming in'. Toyota of Japan said yesterday it had no plans to take a stake in Toyota South Africa which 'is and will remain a completely independent local company'. But in Johannesburg recently Mr Brand Pretorius, managing director of the local operation, said it was 'essential for our company to become part of the global Toyota network'. What a South African manufacturing base can offer, as never before, is a bridgehead into the African market as a whole, and to others beyond. As Japanese companies seek out lower-cost manufacturing sites to escape the high yen, they are also able further to refine their markets and target the developing world, where reliable brands carry a similar cachet but pricing needs to be keener and the product can be more basic. South Africa's high tariff regime will be eroded only gradually as a result of the phased accord the outgoing government struck with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Partly because of a lack of previous capital investment under sanctions, a lag in relative productivity also serves as a disincentive to inward investment. Japanese investments so far have centred on exploiting the country's mineral wealth. In May Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading houses, became the first Japanese company to invest in South Africa since Mr Mandela's election when it bought a modest 1 per cent stake in Associate Manganese Mines. Last year the rival Mitsubishi Corporation advanced a Dollars 28m loan to Western Platinum for mining development and Nippon Denko, an offshoot of Nippon Steel, linked with the local NST Ferrochrome to produce high-carbon alloys for the Japanese market. Beyond the mining sector, Marubeni Corporation established a joint telecoms venture with the British-linked Plessey Tellumat. But in all, just 30 Japanese companies have offices in South Africa compared with 130 US groups. And most show no immediate desire to expand. As a Sumitomo official in Tokyo puts it, 'South Africa is a very distant, very unfamiliar country, not just for us but for most Japanese companies. We remain very cautious about major commitments.'</p>

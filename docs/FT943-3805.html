			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (7): Investor net spreads to China - Profile of Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency The agency charged with the job of attracting foreign investors to the Netherlands may soon be setting its sights on Hong Kong and China. As part of the continual fine-tuning of its international geographical presence, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency (NFIA) is considering hiring a local adviser in Hong Kong to start scouting out potential investors in the region. The Hong Kong project, if launched, would be undertaken in conjunction with the Netherlands's two 'mainports', the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport. Jochem Hanse, the NFIA's new director, said in an interview that the Hong Kong move would be undertaken cautiously as a long-term attempt to persuade local companies to use the Netherlands as a gateway into Europe. 'In the first instance, we're thinking of distribution facilities, because there's no chance at all for the moment that production facilities from, say, mainland China would be transferred to the Netherlands,' he said. Chinese entrepreneurs 'will need distribution offices, sites and centres in Europe in the coming years, and this is a role that could be filled by Rotterdam, Schiphol and their hinterlands,' he said. The Netherlands, with its pivotal role in European transport and distribution, relies heavily on its geographical location and its sophisticated transport infrastructure to attract foreign companies. Other key selling points for foreign investors are the education levels and foreign-language proficiency of the country's workforce and its proximity to important clients and suppliers. Some 80 per cent of foreign companies in the Netherlands are located in the corridor that connects Schiphol and Rotterdam, the world's largest port, to principal European markets such as Germany's Ruhr industrial area. Unlike some countries, particularly in southern Europe, the Netherlands does not make aggressive use of incentives, tax breaks and subsidies in the battle to win over investors. Government grants are limited to the north and south of the country and to an eastern district where the decline of the textile industry has caused high unemployment. 'The subsidy battle in Europe can be fierce,' Mr Hanse said. 'We try to sell our country on the basis of its assets." The NFIA's traditional focus on three 'sales' elements - infrastructure, workforce and proximity to market - will be preserved by Mr Hanse, formerly the NFIA's deputy director, who was promoted to the agency's top job in July. Equally, Mr Hanse emphasises that the potential move into Hong Kong does not herald any weakening of NFIA's promotional campaigns in its traditional markets for inward foreign investment. Apart from some annual fluctuations, the US generally accounts for half of all investment in 'greenfield' sites, Japan for about one quarter, and Europe for the rest. The UK tends to account for half of European inward investment into the Netherlands. In terms of US and Japanese investment in particular, the Netherlands has scored well in recent years. The country, which accounts for just 7 per cent of Europe's combined gross domestic product, is estimated to have captured about 20 per cent of all US and Japanese inward investment. NFIA, with a budget of Fl 20m and a worldwide staff of 70, has four offices in North America, an office in London, and an office each in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. It also has a network of local advisers in countries such as Switzerland, Sweden and Italy. The agency, which is part of the ministry of economic affairs, manages to attract a number of new investors every year who, on average, expect to pump a combined Fl 2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) of investment into the country and to create some 2,500 jobs. There are more than 5,000 subsidiaries of foreign companies in the Netherlands, accounting for about one tenth of the country's annual investment in fixed assets. Recent successes by the NFIA include the decision by Eastman Chemical Co of the US to base its European headquarters in The Hague and to make Rotterdam the site of its future European production facility. The Netherlands has also managed to win over a number of foreign automotive suppliers, including the US brake-system manufacturer Kelsey-Hayes which announced last year that it would build a factory in the southern Dutch town of Heerlen, near the Belgian and German borders. The biggest coup of all was achieved in the early 1980s, when Fuji Photo Film started up its rolling investments in what ultimately proved to be three new factories in Tilburg. The Tilburg site is thought to be the largest foreign investment by a Japanese company outside the automotive industry. These successes do not mean NFIA's job is always an easy one. Competition between European countries is stiff, and it shows no sign of abating. Mr Hanse says NFIA's aim is not to give candidate investors 'the usual blah-blah routine' but to help them in their decision-making process. 'An American or Japanese investor will come to this country with all sorts of questions like does he need a work permit, where are the industrial sites and what kind of tax deal can he put together. And he won't just be looking here, he'll also be visiting Britain, Belgium and Germany, among other places.' The Netherlands can offer high labour productivity, but wages are not as low as in Ireland and Britain, though they are roughly on a par with Belgium and lower than those in Germany, Mr Hanse says. This tends to mean that labour-intensive projects with a low-level of initial investment will tend to look elsewhere. But the Netherlands does do well in heavier investment, higher-skilled areas like chemicals and bio-technology. More recently, it has attracted a number of US and other computer companies that use the Netherlands as a distribution, light-assembly and quick-repair base. The sophisticated distribution centres make it possible for companies to offer one-day computer repair in large parts of Europe. They also underline why the Netherlands is emphasising 'value-added logistics' in the Europe-wide competition for outside investors.</p>

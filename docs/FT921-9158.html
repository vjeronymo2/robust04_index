			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Congress heads for clash over US taxes DEMOCRATS and Republicans are heading for a clash in Congress over how much of the tax incentives package proposed last month by President George Bush to enact. But with the tax debate turning into a contest of political gamesmanship, it is the Democrats who are proposing the full list of measures set out by Mr Bush in his State of the Union address, and the Republicans who are calling for a more limited package of short-term measures. With the backing of the White House, the Republican minority in Congress has selected seven main measures from Mr Bush's proposals. They include a cut in the capital gains tax rate, an investment tax allowance, and tax incentives for first-time home buyers. Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, countered the Republican bill by introducing one with 50 measures, which he said represented the entire Bush package. This is the bill on which the House ways and means committee, Congress's key taxation body, began work yesterday. The Republican bill omits the tax break Mr Bush promised to middle-income families: a Dollars 500 (Pounds 276) per child increase in personal tax allowances. While this measure was not included in the short-term plan Mr Bush challenged Congress to pass by March 20, his State of the Union address specifically asked Congress to act on it 'right away'. The bill also lowers the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to prevent the wealthy from escaping tax-ation by sheltering their income. 'It appears that the tax train is leaving the station and the middle-income people have been left behind,' Mr Gephardt said. 'What the administration now wants considered is short-term legislation, loaded with special interest tax measures, shorn of most relief for moderate-income Americans and financed by phony accounting changes.' Both Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the ways and means committee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, his counterpart on the Senate finance committee, said yesterday there would be only one tax bill this year: it should therefore address the entire range of tax proposals. Congressman Bill Archer, the senior Republican on the ways and means committee, said Mr Bush would veto the Gephardt bill as it did not comply with the fiscal discipline required by the US budget enforcement act. 'I don't think it's a good-faith effort when Dick Gephardt submits a bill, claims it's the president's bill, but offers no spending cuts to pay for the balance of the tax initiatives,' Mr Archer complained. Should the Gephardt bill pass, however, it would present Mr Bush with the ticklish political task of explaining why he was vetoing legislation comprising largely his own proposals, and preferred a bill giving little or nothing to middle-income families.</p>

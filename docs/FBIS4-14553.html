			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Duma President Ivan Rybkin by Andrzey Rybak; </F> place and date not given: "Cock-Crows"]    [Text] [Rybak] The traditional question of the Russian  intelligentsia is: Who is to blame? Who is responsible for the  current crisis in Russia?    [Rybkin] I believe we are all to be blamed for that, but the  intelligentsia more than others. Even though it started  perestroyka, it did not present a concrete program for work. We  have lost nine years with the search for it -- and we have not  been successful up to now. Why not? Precisely 70 years ago  even the Bolshevik economic experts managed to stabilize the  country within a few months! However, they were all shot later.    [Rybak] Today the Duma and the president are calling for  harmony. Does this mean that the various political forces no  longer want to blame each other?    [Rybkin] It costs enormous time and energy to be constantly  looking for someone to blame. And we do not have any time  anymore, we must concentrate on overcoming the profound crisis.    [Rybak] How do you want to do that?    [Rybkin] We must regain control over the economy. The state  companies must be controlled by the state again -- just as in  Germany. The private sector must be expanded and its share in  the overall product must be increased. The Duma should  primarily prepare laws that are necessary for overcoming the  economic crisis. Then we need laws that ensure the development  of a rule-of-law state in Russia: Laws about citizenship, the  Constitutional Court, the penal code, the election law.    [Rybak] You were the driving force behind the Duma's  decision on amnesty. If the released extremists, like Aleksandr  Barkashov or Viktor Anpilov once again strive for confrontation,  as they are already announcing, would you feel personally  responsible?    [Rybkin] If these people once again stage brawls, fighting,  and all kinds of Russian gladiator games in the streets, to  amuse other countries, we, the Duma, the president, and I  myself, will put these people behind bars again. Then nothing  will help them anymore.    [Rybak] Several Duma deputies recently said that deposing  the president is their roost important goal. Is the call for  harmony not also to be seen as an admission of helplessness by  the opposition? According to the new Constitution, the  president is backed by the Army, the police...    [Rybkin] The acceptance of the Constitution on 12 December  1993 was a vote by the people for the president. Therefore, I  consider all calls for the ousting of the president as political  cock-crows. Now we must sit down together and work, even if  this may be difficult for many people. However, this is  expected of us in all towns and villages in Russia. There are  many people who can just shout and not work. This applies both  to rightist and leftist fringe groups.    [Rybak] When the Supreme Soviet was dissolved on 21  September 1993, Boris Yeltsin announced early presidential  elections this year. Will the Duma insist on that?    [Rybkin] The Duma has no right to do so. In the  Constitution it says clearly: The president remains in office  until the end of his term -- and this is 12 June 1996.    [Rybak] In Yeltsin's speech on the state of the nation at  the end of February new tones were heard -- away from the shock  therapy, turning toward Greater Russian imperialism. Has  Yeltsin's policy changed or is all this political tactic?    [Rybkin] I believe that the president simply analyzed the  mood in the society and reacted to it. This is done by any head  of state.    [Rybak] The president's administration uses any opportunity  to humiliate the Duma. Does this not give rise to feelings of  revanche among the deputies?    [Rybkin] I do not share this opinion. The Duma cooperates  closely with all structures of the president, with the  government, and with the Federation Council. Possibly, there  are a few exceptions, people who have not been able to overcome  the events of the past months and want to put a fire under the  president's behind again and again.    [Rybak] The politicians speak of harmony, the people are  suffering. Could mass protests not throw the country into a  civil war?    [Rybkin] This danger exists. However, I believe that our  appeals have a positive effect. The people are fed up with  these power struggles at the top. They want social peace. The  energy that is lost in the power struggles is needed somewhere  else. Among the people it is said: In Russia so much energy is  wasted for whistling that the locomotive does not start moving.    [Rybak] Will the opposition not make use of this explosive  situation to grab power?    [Rybkin] Parties are founded to come to power. Perhaps this  time again someone will try to grab control of the helm.  However, I would not advise anyone to do this, because no  single party would be able to lead the country out of the crisis.    [Rybak] A power struggle has broken out between Moscow and  the regions. Can this lead to national conflicts?    [Rybkin] The center must give up part of its power to the  regions. It is simply impossible to rule such an enormous  country centrally. In Germany this is understood very well --  the laender have a certain independence. We have 89 regions;  they should elect their governors themselves. Today the  governors are often hated, the people break out in a rash when  they just see them.</p>

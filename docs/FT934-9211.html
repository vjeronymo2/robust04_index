			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Arthur Andersen posts 8% climb in fee income ARTHUR Andersen, the accountancy firm, yesterday announced fee income up 8 per cent to Dollars 6bn in the year to August 31. The figures relate to the global results for Arthur Andersen &amp; Co, the Swiss-based organisation. They included a 6.6 per cent rise to Dollars 3.2bn from Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, and a 10 per cent rise to Dollars 2.8bn for Andersen Consulting. Mr Lawrence Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of the firm, who was in London for its annual partners' meeting, said the results reflected the firm's focus on 'consistent high quality client service'. He said that revenues would have been up by 11 per cent at 1992 exchange rates, but that the increase was less marked because of a strengthened US dollar during the year. In line with its normal practice, the firm refused to provide any information on its profits. It argues that it is under no obligation to issue this information, has no outside investors and that the figures would be misinterpreted. The firm increased staff during the year to 65,591 from 59,680 and partners to 2,487 from 2,454. It increased the number of offices to 350 in 72 countries from 318. The global results included a 12 per cent rise in revenues from the UK firm, up to Pounds 407m. It would not split the figures between Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting. Revenue was Dollars 3.3bn in the Americas, Dollars 2.2bn in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, and Dollars 531m in Asia/Pacific.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Matsushita sets terms for Y200bn issues Matsushita Electric Industrial, Japan's largest consumer electronics group, yesterday set the coupon rates and conversion prices for its two domestic convertible bond issues totalling Y200bn scheduled to be launched next week. Concerns of over-supply due to the company's large lot issuance has weighed on the Tokyo stock market during the past few weeks, but Matsushita officials said it needed the funds to invest in its expanding multimedia business and overseas operations. With investors already worried that Japan Tobacco's Y900bn flotation scheduled for October 27 may drain liquidity from the stock market, Matsushita's Y200bn issuance could have adverse effects on the already weak stock market. Matsushita said it would issue eight-year and 10-year unsecured convertible bonds in lots of Y100bn, with coupon rates of 1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively. The conversion price for both issues has been set at Y1,620. The eight-year issue will be convertible from November 1 to March 28 2002, with the 10-year issue being convertible from the same date to March 30 2004.</p>

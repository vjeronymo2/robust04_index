			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PROUD PARENTS RENT HER STORKS TO HERALD LITTLE BUNDLES OF JOY  </P> <P> When Cynthia Mastropiero had a baby earlier this year, everyone in her Danville  neighborhood knew about it.  </P> <P> The pink, seven-foot wooden stork on her front lawn was a dead giveaway.  </P> <P> Mastropiero is one of many area women who have announced their motherhood in  this colorful manner, giving birth to a fanciful business.  </P> <P> Concord resident Liz Seaholm didn't expect much when she decided to build a  small flock of one-dimensional, wooden storks and rent them to proud new  parents.  </P> <P> "I thought it would just be a passing fad," Seaholm said.  </P> <P> Now, Stork Delivery Inc. is fielding inquiries about establishing possible  franchises in Florida, Illinois and Chicago.  </P> <P> Seaholm, 32, isn't quite ready to take that step, but she envisions the day  when her fledgling business will hatch more storks.  </P> <P> "I'm starting to think that I will have so many storks that I won't be able to  haul them around or store them in my garage," Seaholm said.  </P> <P> There have only been four bigger-than-life storks since Seaholm started the  business in mid-1988. Two are painted with pink clothes and two with blue  clothes. The pink storks herald the arrival of a baby girl and the blue hail  the birth of a boy.  </P> <P> The storks remain on the parents' lawn for three to seven days at a price  ranging from $35 to $55. By renting an average of three storks per week,  Seaholm estimates her business has collected more than $2,000 so far.  </P> <P> The gangling birds return to Seaholm's nest at the end of the rental period,  but the parents do get a keepsake from the spectacle: a hand-painted bundle  bearing the baby's name, date of birth and weight. The bundle dangles from the  stork's beak during the lawn vigil.  </P> <P> "There is also a potential hidden benefit," Seaholm said. "One lady told me the  whole neighborhood comes and showers you with gifts when they see this in your  lawn."  </P> <P> Gina Santucci, who rented a blue stork to announce her son's Jan. 17 birth,  didn't get any extra gifts, but "all the neighbors have commented on it. It's  been a big hit."  </P> <P> Seaholm doesn't bear the markings of someone who would go into the stork  business.  </P> <P> Until 1983, she worked as a data-processing manager for the Federal Reserve  Bank in San Francisco. She left the Fed after the birth of the first of three  children.  </P> <P> The stork-on-the-lawn concept is known to be popular in the East, but Seaholm  said she was self-inspired. She traces the idea to an occasion when she saw a  bunch of birthday cards in the yard of new parents.  </P> <P> The business appealed to her, she said, because it's something she can do with  her children -- 6-year-old Stephen, 4-year-old Paul and 2-year-old Kristen.  </P> <P> Her biggest problem so far has been getting the storks to homes far away from  her Concord base. She has delivered to lawns as far away as Livermore, Benicia  and Antioch. She had parents in Castro Valley and Pacifica come pick up the  birds.  </P> <P> None of the storks have been stolen, although one overjoyed parent wanted to  buy the woodwork.  </P> <P> Seaholm turned down the offer.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine holding this seven-foot stork for all those years and then  when the kid turns 18 saying, 'Look what I've got for you.' "  </P></p>

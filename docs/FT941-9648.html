			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Ministers seek to shrug off latest scandal The government yesterday called for an end to disclosures about the private lives of MPs, as ministers attempted to shrug off the fourth sex-related resignation in two years. Senior Conservatives praised Mr Hartley Booth, MP for Finchley, for quitting quickly as a minister's political assistant after newspaper disclosures of his friendship with a female Commons researcher. Mr Booth's resignation minimised the embarrassment caused to the government by detailed allegations about the relationship in the Sunday Mirror. Mr Booth denies sexual impropriety. However, there was widespread concern that no end appeared to be in sight to the catalogue of disclosures which has undermined the government's Back to Basics campaign on traditional moral values since the start of the year. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said Mr Booth's resignation had no connection with Back to Basics, launched by Mr John Major at the Conservative party conference in October.

Mr Booth's resignation follows the resignations of Mr David Mellor, Mr Tim Yeo and Lord Caithness from the government after media disclosures about their private lives. The Conservative party has also been rocked by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, MP for Eastleigh, in bizarre circumstances; and a series of revelations about the extra-marital relationships of other Conservative MPs. The government has virtually given up hope of winning the Eastleigh by-election, expected to take place on May 5, in which the opposition parties are expected to campaign strongly on moral issues. The Liberal Democrat party, which came second in 1992, is favourite to win. However, Labour plans to allocate its top by-election strategists to the campaign, and frontbench spokesmen are soon to visit the constituency. 'This is a genuine three-way split, and we intend to fight hard to win it,' said a senior Labour official. 'We think we have a real chance.'</p>

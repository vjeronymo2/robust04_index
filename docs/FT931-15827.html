			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Weather blocks Shetland salvage HEAVY seas and high winds around Shetland again blocked attempts to remove the oil remaining on the tanker Braer yesterday. Although the ship has not broken apart, salvage specialists believe this will eventually happen. Experts now believe that no further oil is leaking from the vessel, which may still contain as much as half of its 84,000-tonne cargo. But oil is still spreading northwards for about 25 miles up the west coast of the main Shetland island. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, will both make statements to the Commons about the disaster today. Yesterday Shetland salmon farmers received a boost when the supermarket group Safeway said it would continue to buy farmed Shetland salmon after it had visited the islands. Last Friday Marks and Spencer announced that it was stopping buying Shetland salmon as 'a temporary precautionary measure'. Other food retailers are monitoring the situation. The Shetland salmon farming industry is one of the sectors of the islands' economy most threatened by the disaster. Since Friday the salmon farmers have been prohibited from harvesting salmon in a 400,000 square mile area under a ban ordered by the Scottish Office. The ban, which also covers the catching of sea fish, was announced just after the islands' fishing and fish-farming organisations had declared their own ban. There are 16 salmon farms in the area covered by the ban, accounting for about a quarter of Shetland's salmon production which last year totalled 10,000 tonnes. Shetland council said yesterday that it was retaining the solicitors Penningtons to represent it in dealing with legal issues arising from the Braer incident.</p>

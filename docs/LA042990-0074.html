			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE GIFT OF STONES BY JIM CRACE (COLLIER: $7.95)  </P> <P> In this beautifully polished short novel, Jim Crace re-creates the last days of  a Neolithic village, whose inhabitants earn their livelihoods by chipping  flints into blades for tools and weapons. The misfit in their rigidly  circumscribed world is the narrator's stepfather, barred from a life of working  the brittle stone by the amputation of his right hand.  </P> <P> He learns to fashion words instead, shaping tales with the care and skill that  his relatives reserve for their most delicately edged blades. The struggle of  the one-armed storyteller for existence becomes a rumination on the need for  art in an otherwise mundane existence. Crace's evocation of the dark, fearful  Neolithic world is far removed from the Jung-at-heart hokum of "The Clan of the  Cave Bear"; "The Gift of Stones" is a deceptively simple book that explores  profound ideas with a rare delicacy of touch.  </P></p>

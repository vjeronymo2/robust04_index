			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stet enters final round of bidding for Matav STET, the Italian state telecommunications company, has emerged as an unexpected, last-minute contender in the bidding for a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian state telecommunications group. Stet International has teamed up with Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone company. Their consortium was one of four short-listed yesterday by the Budapest authorities to go through to a final round of bids for Matav in a two weeks' time. Matav is eastern Europe's largest privatisation. The Italian-led group is up against three consortia led by Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Telefonica, respectively the German, French and Spanish national operators. Preliminary indicative bids for the 30 per cent stake in Matav which the Hungarians are selling are understood to range around Dollars 500m. Rivals believe Stet's offer is to be towards the higher end of the bidding range. However, Mr Szabolcs Szekeres, chief executive of the AVRT state holding company which controls Matav, yesterday moved to dampen expectations that the price would go up in the next round of bidding. Privatisation advisers stressed that the four preliminary bids were not wholly comparable. Nor is a ranking in the first round a reliable guide to the outcome of the final round. One of the rivals admitted that Stet appeared to have established a benchmark on price. The Italian company appears to have undermined the assumption that Matav's privatisation was a straight fight between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. Hungary's political and economic ties with Germany are believed to be working to the advantage of Telekom which has attracted Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US as consortium partners.</p>

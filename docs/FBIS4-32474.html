			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kenan Ekic and Zoran Babic report on speech by </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 23 June -- recorded]    [Text] At its session yesterday, the Presidency of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina decided to propose to the  Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to elect Haris  Silajdzic as head of the new joint government of the Assembly of  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, the second day of the assembly  session (?was characterized) by Dr. Silajdzic's speech on the  basic principles of the new government's tasks.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] I would like to stress that the  government should have a unified program concept, regardless of  the fact that it has a double role. There are no strategic  differences concerning the political aims of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina that  would require different program principles. The Federation is  based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, therefore, the preservation  of sovereignty [word indistinct] aim that determines the unified  direction of the action of all republican and federal  authorities. This is also a strategic aim of the program and  [words indistinct], whose verification will be decided on by  this assembly.    I believe that in this respect we have a consensus, not only  of the Bosniak and Croatian people, but also of all the citizens  who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina to be [words indistinct]. In  addition to the unity on this vital aim, it is also very  important to have a unified view on the means with which we  intend to accomplish this aim.    I believe it is undisputable that we have decided to achieve  this primarily in a peaceful way and with political means.  Setting up the federation itself confirms that approach. We  have invested much effort to find qualitatively new solutions  that will secure full national equality, democratic relations,  and the highest standards of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This concept is determined by the Constitution of the  Federation and it is already demonstrating its effectiveness on  the ground with the majority Bosniak [words indistinct]. After  the signing of the Washington agreements, the fighting in the  region stopped within a very short period of time, and processes  leading toward the establishment of a lasting peace have been  started.    This is certainly a very important [word indistinct] in the  direction of finding an overall peace solution to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we do not consider the  federation to be a war coalition of two nations against the  third, but a model of relations that offers all peoples and  citizens an equal position within Bosnia-Herzegovina as an  internationally recognized state.    This is confirmed by the positive reaction by those  political  forces that are also beginning to emerge increasingly within the  ranks of the Bosnian Serbs as an expression of resistance to the  fascist nationalism of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] and  its leaders. Everyone can see what relations we are proposing  and setting up at present.    The assembly that I am addressing as a Bosniak, a Muslim,  as a (?nominal) prime minister is presided over by a Croat and a  Serb alternately, depending on the constitutional form of the  assembly' session. This is no coincidence. This is a real  expression of a political project that we are promoting and  offering.    We believe that the federation is a project that has a  future, a project that will sooner or later be, not imposed, but  accepted and established throughout the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we are very clearly expressing  our commitment to finding political solutions in a peaceful way,  political solutions that will justly satisfy the interests of  all the nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a commitment  that the government will firmly pursue at home and abroad. [end  recording]    [Reporter] However, considering that the aggressor is still  obstructing the peace initiatives, the international community  must determine the sanctions for the aggressor and the  guarantees for the implementation of the peace plans. The new  government will consider [words indistinct] one of the priority  tasks in its work.    [Begin Silajdzic recording] With the signing of the  Washington and Vienna Agreements, the adoption of the  Constitution and the corresponding Constitutional Law, the  election of the president and vice president, the initial phase  of the process of setting up the federation has been completed.  Today's decisions on appointing a reshuffled government and  laws on the federal state administration will fully establish  the (?instruments) of the executive authorities at the federal  level in a way that is constitutionally regulated for the  transitional period.    The necessary prerequisites have therefore been created for  an accelerated implementation of the constitutional provisions  and the (?organization) of the authority at the cantonal and  communal levels. In some regions activities have already been  started to set up communal councils and cantonal assemblies.  With its activities, the government should present a strong  impetus for this process to be completed throughout the  federation as soon as possible. There are no longer any valid  constitutional-legal or political reasons to justify delays in  the implementation of the Constitution at all levels [words  indistinct]. The reasons why we should speed up the setting up  of new bodies throughout the federation are not of a formal  nature. This is the essential prerequisite for solving in an  organized and systematic way the enormous problems caused by the  war in all walks of life, problems ranging from the return of  refugees to the revitalization of the economy and the  reestablishment of production and the financial system.    The constitutional position of the cantons in the federal  system is such that they have numerous and very important duties  that used to belong to the central authorities. These duties  can and must be taken on only by the legal cantonal bodies, who  will at the same time assume full responsibility for their work  as determined by the Constitution. In that case, the government  will indeed be able, in addition to its involvement in the peace  process, foreign affairs, and defense, to involve itself  maximally in work on the development of the economic system and  economic policy, including the planning and rebuilding of the  country, as well as regulating trade at home and with other  countries, financial transactions at home and with other  countries, (?setting up) the financial system, establishing  control of the currency, creating monetary and fiscal policy, as  well as defining energy policy. This means the inter-cantonal  distribution of energy and the provision and maintenance of the  necessary infrastructure.    It stands to reason that these issues will occupy the  dominant place in the government's program, since these are  areas in which the federation has exclusive jurisdiction, and  which are by their very nature such that they mostly belong  within the government's jurisdiction. The government will also  -- in accordance with the jurisdiction that will be determined  within the federal authority -- program and implement its tasks  in the health service, social policy, communications  infrastructure, the utilization of economic resources, and other  areas in which the federation and the cantons have divided  rights and responsibilities.    The government has to devote particular attention to the  implementation of the constitutional regulations on human rights  and basic [word indistinct], and -- within this -- the  application of the right guaranteed by the Constitution for  refugees to return to their homes is of particular importance.  This is a problem whose solution cannot be delayed or  conditioned by waiting for more favorable circumstances, at  least not when it comes to territories under the control of the  legal bodies of the republic, that is, the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a clear relationship here between  the time that has passed and the number of people that will  return. The longer it takes to return, the fewer will return.  This is why it is the responsibility of all the bodies,  including the Federal Government, to work in an organized way  and, most important, quickly for the return of the refugees and  displaced people. All those who do not behave accordingly can  be considered accomplices in preserving the effects of ethnic  cleansing. For this reason, and apart from other measures, it  is very important that the federal courts envisaged by the  Constitution be formed as soon as possible -- in which a certain  number of foreign judges will participate -- and that the  institution of the ombudsmen, the guarantors of human rights, be  activated as soon as possible, which will initially function  under a patronage of sorts of the CSCE.    The return of the refugees cannot depend solely on local  cantonal authorities. This problem even exceeds the federal  framework, since this is obviously a problem of international  proportions. This means that the international community -- in  solving this problem -- will be present both through the  necessary financial help and through certain forms of  institutionalized control. One such concrete step by the  international community is the agreement by the European Union  to administer the city of Mostar. We believe that this will  help the [word indistinct] of this city, not only in material  terms but also in overcoming the tensions created by the  conflict, restoring confidence, and returning refugees. So the  government should, within its jurisdiction, support this project  by the European Union [words indistinct].    Within this time frame for the implementation of the [word  indistinct], I would like to mention the foreign affairs [word  indistinct]. Why? [words indistinct] the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government, since the federation still has no international  legal status, and the constitutional solutions envisage that the  federation will not engage in foreign affairs until the peace  process is completed.    As for the trends in foreign policy, I think that, in  essence, the policy so far will be continued, with possible  corrections as determined by developments, both external and  internal. At the moment, however, there are no significant  reasons for any radical changes in foreign or domestic policy.</p>

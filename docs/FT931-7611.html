			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Pay talks deadlock in east Germany ARBITRATION talks between Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers association, and IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, yesterday broke down in the east German state of Mecklenburg-western Pomerania. The collapse of the talks, which follows a similar pattern in the four other east German states, now means that IG Metall will have to decide which steps to take in its demand for a wage increase of 26 per cent for its members in eastern Germany. As expected, Gesamtmetall insisted that it could not afford such a rise, and offered a 9 per cent increase. IG Metall said Gesamtmetall was effectively breaking the contract agreed in March 1991 which would bring wages up to the level of their west German counterparts by April 1994. East German wages in the engineering sector are currently 70 per cent of west German levels. Gesamtmetall offficials yesterday said the wage increase would reflect the lower productivity levels, and income parity should perhaps be phased in gradually, even beyond 1994. IG Metall, fearing that if it makes a substantial compromise it will undermine Germany's centralised wage bargaining system, now has three options. It can now go to the courts and prove that Gesamtmetall has broken the contract, it can ask its members to approach the courts individually if they do not receive the 26 per cent pay rise on April 1, when it was due, or it can call a strike. But a trend towards lower wage settlements in other sectors of the economy does not bode well. IG Metall membership of 300,000 could shrink further, particularly since more than half work in industries still held by the Treuhand, the agency overseeing the privatisation of east German industry. IG Chemie, which yesterday opened arbitration talks in Berlin, may be prepared to settle for as low as 8 per cent. AVOC, the employer's association, yesterday offered the union's 80,000 members 7.5 per cent, effective from May, but with no back-date between January and April. But IG Chemie said this represented an annual pay increase of 6.5 per cent, which it sharply criticised. These talks are still continuing.</p>

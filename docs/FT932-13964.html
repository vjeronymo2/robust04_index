			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Leading Article: Prison leaks GROUP 4, the private security company, appears to have neglected the golden rule of prison systems throughout the world - to hang on to the prisoners. During the first two weeks of providing prison escort services in East Midlands, Humberside and Yorkshire, seven prisoners have either escaped from the company's custody or been wrongly released. Others have failed to turn up on time for court appearances. This leakage has provided an embarrassing start to the UK's first private contract for escorting prisoners between prisons, police stations and courts. For Group 4, one of the largest security organisations in the world, these are particularly embarrassing events. The company already runs Britain's first privately managed prison, Wolds, and is bidding to manage Strangeways prison, Manchester. It has assembled a strong management team to provide custodial services by recruiting senior police and prison officers and Home Office officials. And it has provided extensive training for its carefully vetted staff - many with experience in the police, prison service or armed forces - in special facilities which include a mock courtroom and cells. Yet the company can rightly claim that not all the problems with prisoners were its fault. Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service Agency, has blamed design flaws in escort vehicles built to Home Office specifications for two escapes. The responsibility for one premature release has been accepted by the magistrates' court concerned. And the information needed to organise the complex movement of prisoners between 20 prisons, 71 police stations and 82 courts has been supplied late to Group 4. Nor do the police and prison service have an unblemished record in safe delivery of prisoners. More than 30 prisoners escaped from prison service custody last year in the region covered by the Group 4 contract. The figure for escapes from police custody is not available. In any case, the use of police and prison officers to escort prisoners is a waste of highly-trained staff who could be deployed more effectively on their mainstream duties. Ministers now accept that introducing such a complex contract on one day was unwise. A phased switch would have allowed the contractor to deal with teething problems and ensure a timely flow of information. It would also have allowed the 400 staff to be trained on the job, rather than in the pale imitation of a training centre. The next contract to be awarded, for prison escort services in London, will be introduced on a phased basis. However, Group 4 has still to prove its competence in providing this essential and high-profile public service. Failure to do so would pose a grave threat to further contracting out of prison escort services, since the company is one of the strongest bidders in this new market. The government must therefore be certain that it does everything possible, on its side, to ensure that the contract runs smoothly.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sterling devaluation helps Laird advance to Pounds 23.6m EXCHANGE rate movements helped lift first-half pre-tax profits at Laird Group, the manufacturer of car components and industrial products which makes more than 80 per cent of its money overseas. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 23.6m. Turnover grew to Pounds 324m (Pounds 295m). The company said profits had been lifted by Pounds 2.7m and sales by Pounds 40m through the devaluation of sterling. Profits also included an exceptional credit of Pounds 3.1m, being Pounds 5.1m from the settlement of a patent dispute, less a Pounds 2m provision for redundancies expected later this year in the German automotive seals sector. Operating profits in the seals division fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 13.2m, mainly because of the recession in the German automotive industry. Profits in the industrial products division rose to Pounds 9.3m from Pounds 7.3m, while the service industries side - which includes US printing and plastics distribution - turned in Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.6m). Earnings per share were 12.3p (11.7p), and the interim dividend was held at 4.2p. Separately Laird announced yesterday the purchase of the car body seal business of Happich, the German components maker, for DM24m (Pounds 9.6m) cash. The business, whose main customers are Mercedes, BMW and Opel, had turnover last year of DM39m. COMMENT Laird's strong presence in the German automotive sector, where it has 50 per cent of the market for car seals, will be further enhanced by yesterday's acquisition. However, its heavy dependence on German car production - down some 25 per cent in the half - is underlined by the fact that only sterling's devaluation pushed profits and turnover higher during the period. The currency factor will start to fade in the second half, and the group is also faced with a slowdown in car production elsewhere in Europe. Its financial and technical strength in the automotive sector will see it through the recession, but in terms of profits it will have to run very hard just to stand still. Meanwhile the non-automotive activities, which the group is seeking to expand, look a bit of a rag-bag. Earnings this year are forecast at 20p for a p/e of 16.3, a generous rating for a company so exposed to the European motor recession.</p>

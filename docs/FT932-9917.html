			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Croat forces in Bosnian onslaught BOSNIAN Croat forces yesterday ignored United Nations warnings and their own ceasefire pledges, pressing on with their military campaign forcibly to forge a separate state at the expense of Bosnia's Moslems. Fighting between Croats and Moslems intensified in south-western Bosnia's main city of Mostar, with some 60 rounds of heavy artillery falling on the area in a one-hour period and gunfire continuing throughout the day, the UN said. Bosnian Croat forces are attempting to seize control of the west bank of the Neretva River, which runs through the city, and have captured the Bosnian army's local headquarters. Under the Bosnian Croat vision of a 'Greater Croatia' the Neretva river would be its eastern boundary. General Philippe Morillon, the UN peacekeeping force commander in Bosnia, was making for Mostar last night with the commanders-in-chief of the Croat militia and Moslem-led Bosnian government forces to try to rein in the combatants, the UN said. UN officials said they were concerned about Moslem civilians in the area. According to eyewitnesses, Bosnian Croat troops marched hundreds of Moslem civilians down a track to detention in a factory yesterday after evicting them from their homes in Mostar. None of the detainees had any possessions. Many walked unsteadily down the slope, clutching their loved ones and crying, guarded by Croat soldiers in front and behind, the witnesses said. With international attention focused on the refusal by Bosnian Serb leaders to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan, Croats appear to be making their own land grab. Confident that they can push on with impunity, the Croats and the Serbs have nearly completed the carve-up of Bosnia. Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader who takes instructions from Zagreb, was the first to endorse the Vance-Owen plan which aims to preserve a single Bosnian state, divided into 10 provinces. The HVO, the military wing of the Croatian Democratic Union, the ally of Croatia's ruling party, eagerly approved the plan because it designates as 'Croat' provinces next to Croatia. They appear convinced that over the next few years the provinces can be annexed to Croatian territory, even if the plan is implemented. The Croatian dinar is already in circulation and the Croat's checkerboard flag flies in western Hercegovina. Mostar, badly damaged by Yugoslav army bombardments last spring, has been designated the capital of the self-proclaimed Croat state of Herceg-Bosna. The continued fighting has blocked off the main land route to central Bosnia, cutting off some 1.3m people dependent for survival on humanitarian relief convoys. The UN also reported serious shelling and heavy machine-gun fire in the dispute Jablanica-Konjic area, 50km north-east of Mostar.</p>

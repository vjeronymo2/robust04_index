			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Big is not necessarily beautiful in auditing Sir, I read with bafflement the Accountancy Columns's coverage of the Land Travel collapse (September 3). One of the 'warning signs' that Land Travel was about to collapse was apparently the fact that 'Price Waterhouse - one of the largest UK firms - resigned last year as auditor, to be replaced by a local firm'. Such a comment indicates a misplaced bias and a total ignorance of the accountancy needs of businesses and the high quality work being carried out by many 'local' firms to address those needs. Against the backdrop of numerous spectacular collapses in recent years and the financial shambles at Lloyds, the majority of which were audited by the big 6 firms or nearly big 6, perhaps you could explain the basis on which you can infer that if a company changes its auditors from one of the big 6 it is one of the 'warning signs'. Notwithstanding the misplaced bias of organisations such as yours, my firm is attracting substantial amounts of audit work from the big 6. The companies include plcs which are looking for better customer care, value for money, and a more hands on and pro-active approach which will make them better able to survive the present grim trading conditions. Big 6 is far from being beautiful] Keith Seeley, managing partner, Latham Crossley &amp; Davis, Sumner House, St Thomas's Road, Chorley PR7 1HP</p>

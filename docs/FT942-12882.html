			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Reports elevate chemicals Heralded by excellent first quarter results from DuPont in the US on Monday, progress reports from two of Europe's biggest chemical groups lifted shares in the sector yesterday. Hoechst, the first of the 'Big Three' German chemical groups to report quarterly figures, came in measurably ahead of expectations with a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits; its shares rose DM11.30, or 3.4 per cent to DM346.50. Bayer and BASF also rose; their quarterlies are due today, and tomorrow. Analysts reckoned that the industry's profits growth would accelerate as increased volume allowed it to raise product prices. 'Hoechst's statement seemed to suggest that the thin years in the German chemical industry are over,' said a trader. In Amsterdam, Akzo Nobel, rated as the world's ninth largest chemicals group following the merger between the Dutch and Swedish companies earlier this year, pleased analysts with first quarter results at the top end of expectations. Mr Charles Brown, of Goldman Sachs in London, said that taken overall the results were very encouraging, particularly as the merger was dilutive of 1993 and 1994 earnings. 'One has a sense that while business is currently not exactly buoyant,' he said, 'it is certainly not getting any worse and is running ahead slowly in Europe. Over the next year one will see benefits from the merger filtering down into the bottom line.'</p>

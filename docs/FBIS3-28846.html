			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Larry Jagan from the "Current World Affairs" </F> program]    [Excerpts] Dear Listeners: At the beginning of the week,  the National League for Democracy [NLD], the opposition party in  Burma, presented its views at the National Convention. In an  80-page report, it expressed its view on each topic under  discussion by nearly 700 delegates at the National Convention.  [passage omitted] Government officials are now scrutinizing the  NLD report before it can be presented by National Convention  Chairman U Aung Toe. The NLD, which won a landslide victory  with 80 percent of the votes in the 1990 general election, did  not even get 20 percent of the delegate representation at the  National Convention. Larry Jagan reports from Rangoon that some  NLD members are putting pressure on their leaders to boycott the  National Convention.    Dear Listeners: The NLD led by U Aung Shwe is now concerned  about being deregistered. That is why it is certain that the  NLD will not boycott the National Convention. In December,  before the resumption of the National Convention, the  authorities warned the leader of the NLD and one or two other  opposition leaders that their parties will be deregistered if  they boycott the National Convention. [passage omitted] Another  NLD source believes that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, before being put  under house arrest, told U Aung Shwe to work within the  framework of the multiparty regulations. Now the delegates who  support U Aung Shwe's position suggested that the NLD carry on  with the present situation to allow the party to participate in  the future election which will be held for sure once the new  constitution is completed. At the same time, it is also true  that there are many in the opposition movement who believe that  the NLD will lose its credibility if it continues to do what is  being directed by the rulers. They also believe that, as a  result, the NLD will face the danger of losing the public  support it amassed in the 1990 general election. [passage  omitted]    According to the inner circle of the National Convention,  many new suggestions are presented in the NLD report. Although  the NLD has accepted the presidential system, it is still firm  on its demands: The parliament must be sovereign and the  president must be a representative elected by the people. The  NLD source said the NLD has rejected the paragraph which says  the president must be a national leader and proposed that the  presidential candidate must be a highly educated person.  According to the inner circle of the National Convention, the  NLD also said that only representatives elected by the people  must be in the electoral college, which is responsible for  electing the president, and these representatives must by  equally elected from the two chambers of the parliament. It is  totally contradictory to what U Aung Toe, chairman of the  National Convention Convening Work Committee, said during the  resumption of the convention at the beginning of last month. In  his speech, he said two-thirds of the electoral college, which  is responsible for electing the president, is to be elected by  the pyithuhluttaw representatives [parliamentarians], while the  remaining one-third is to be elected by the commander-in-chief  of the Defense Services. It is also mentioned that each chamber  must elect one presidential candidate each while the third  presidential candidate will be elected by the commander in chief  of the Defense Services. Once the president is elected the  remaining candidates will become vice presidents. If the  president steps down, one of the vice presidents will be elected  president. But the NLD said there should be only one president  and one vice president, and it is still firm on its demand that  both must be elected by the people. [passage omitted]    Rangoon residents believe that the military rulers are  trying  their best to complete the procedures of the National Convention  as soon as possible. [Words indistinct] also believe that the  Burmese Government has a great desire to make sure that the NLD  participates in the National Convention until the completion of  the constitution so that the NLD cannot blame the government for  being excluded at the convention. A source close to the NLD  says the NLD is actually trying to prolong National Convention  procedures using delaying tactics. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "PM Newswrap" program] </F>   [Text] We have reaction to the happenings in Johannesburg  today from the Chief Minister of kwaZulu and Inkatha Freedom  Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    [Begin Buthelezi recording] We were very much saddened by  the  news that we have received, that when some people passed near  Shell House, which is the ANC [African National Congress]  headquarters, some people in Shell House shot at these people  and one person died and others were injured. Then when they  proceeded to the meeting it appears that more people were killed.    Mr. Themba Khoza phoned me to inform me that they had heard  information yesterday that some of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe --  Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadres intended mixing  with the people in order to start a riot and in fact as soon as  they had got to the venue of the meeting, I'm then informed that  they were shooting from some of the -- ANC people, as they had  described them here -- from the top of buildings, surrounding  buildings, the result of which 16 people have been killed.    So I wish to say that it is quite clear that there are  people  who really intend having some kind of mayhem in this country,  and I am saddened by the fact that the Zulu subjects of the  king, who intended doing no more than just demonstrate their  stand with their king, you know, in the matters that he has  raised, have been attacked in this way. It seems to me that the  issue of reconciliation in this country is something that is  going to be with us for a long time because it will not be  accomplished, because the bitterness caused by these kind of  attacks on innocent people, who meant no harm to anyone except  to take a stand with their king and to demonstrate their loyalty  to their king, should be attacked in this way.    And I really wish to condemn this attack on the Zulu people  on their way to the march and also at the march in the strongest  possible terms, and I do really hope that the attention of the  state president and the president of the ANC will be drawn to  this kind of merciless killing of our people.

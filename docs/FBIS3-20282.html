Due in large measure to the bitter and protracted row over  voting rights, British stock in the EU is probably as low now as  ever it was during the darkest and most bruising period of  Margaret Thatcher's Euro-confrontations.    Sir Leon Brittan, former home secretary and industry  minister, and for the past six years a senior member of the  commission is, nevertheless, the only candidate thus far to have  revealed himself in the race to succeed Jacques Delors.  Admirers and critics alike agree that Mr Delors, who retires in  December after a remarkable decade at the helm of the EU, is a  very hard act to follow.    A naturally reserved man, Sir Leon has developed a taste for  the media spotlight since commg to Brussels. As commissioner  responsible first for competition policy (including such highly  charged issues as the British government "sweeteners" paid to  Rover), and now for external trade, Sir Leon has not lacked  publicity.    He is the co-architect of the Uraguay round of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement, with the American  negotiator Mickey Kantor, and Peter Sutherland, GATT's director  general.    Sir Leon's colleagues sometimes find him aloof, but he is  widely admired as the most formidable intellectual foil in the  commission to Mr Delors, a Christian Socialist.    They have had their clashes, but Mr Delors has learnt to  respect him.    To date, Sir Leon appears to have the public endorsement  only  of Britain. The most important power brokers who will decide on  the next president (notably Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President  Francois Mitterrand) appear to favour other candidates --  including the prime minister of Belgium Jean-Luc Dehaene and the  Dutch prime minister, Ruud Lubbers.    So have the bitter exchanges between London and the other EU  capitals over the delay on enlargement and new voting rights in  the council of ministers fatally damaged his chances?    He is quick to put some daylight between himself and former  cabinet colleagues. "I really do not know. It depends how long  it goes on for. I am a British Conservative but I do not agree  with the Conservative government on all questions."    Aware that anything he says on the arcane voting issue might  add to the Tory civil war over Europe, Sir Leon will not be  drawn on the negotiations. But he insists that the admission of  Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden should be Britain's  priority, which can be loosely translated as: "For Gods sake,  put this blocking minority stuff in context or take the blame if  enlargement is derailed."    It would be unfair if Sir Leon were seen in other capitals  as  no more than a stalking horse for Perfidious Albion's strategy  to reverse European integration.    His thinking has evolved since he came to Brussels and his  manifesto for the the EU set out in his book, Europe -- The  Europe We Need, published this week, points to a rather  different European future than current Tory orthodoxy.    The book shows that Sir Leon is now a convinced  integrationist. His final chapter on the future of EU  institutions puts him on the side of those who want the union to  "deepen" as well as "widen".    In a much larger EU (progressively opening to the east) he  wants to make it easier for at least some decisions in areas  such as the internal market, health and safety at work, farm  fisheries and trade policy to be taken by a majority vote.    Hardly surprising in a Tory, he wants it slightly less easy  to take majority decisions in subjects "touching the individual  citizen", such as social and environmental policy.    Sir Leon is an unapologetic advocate of monetary union and a  single currency, and is increasingly optimistic these will be  achieved in the time scale agreed in the Maastricht Treaty.    What have been the biggest surprises during his time in  Brussels?    "I think what has surprised me most is the sheer resilience  of the European process," he said. "When we run into problems  we pick ourselves up and continue with remarkable speed."    He gives the impression of a man who feels the powerful  forces still pushing the integration bandwagon forward.    Surely the contrast between a British cabinet and a  multi-national, multi-lingual commission must be enormous?    "The differences are not anything like as great as you might  think. Commissioners do have somewhat greater personal  political autonomy than a cabinet minister -- you do not have to  clear things with the top as you might in a cabinet."    Sir Leon concedes there are limits. "If you were to make a  series of speeches attacking commission policy on the  environment, for example, that might not go down well with your  colleagues. And one does also gets involved in some trade-offs  with ones fellow commissioners sometimes to get policies  through."    So he acknowledges he has changed -- perhaps even "gone  native" in Brussels?    Sir Leon will have none of it. "That is a ridiculous  expression. Of course the world has changed in the last few  years and that means that I have developed my views -- rather  than changed my mind on fundamentals. The enormous changes in  Central and East Europe are a case in point."    He wants to close the gulf between the EU institutions and  public opinion, and to see national parliaments more involved --  alongside the European parliament -- in the governance of the EU.    He would also like a smaller, but politically more  effective commission -- a message which might not appeal to some  smaller EU countries. The commission's "reputation for  over-weening bureaucracy is greatly exaggerated but it may not  be wholy unjustified".    But with Europe still to be made, his main message is to  fellow Tories. "There is no shortage of opportunities. Let us  seize them with both hands."</p>

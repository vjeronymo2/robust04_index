			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in south  China's Guangdong Province have forever changed the image of the  lonely tiller of the soil and become owners of farms and  breeding factories, thanks to the strong backing of local social  service systems in rural areas.    Although he raises more than 2,000 pigs every year, Zeng  Jinqi, a bright young farmer in Shunde City, has eliminated the  worries of seeking marketing channels and buying forage and  vaccines.    Whenever he needs a particular service, a phone call to the  local social service network will soon bring about satisfactory  assistance.    Multi-level and comprehensive social service systems have  come into being in recent years along with the rapid burgeoning  of modernized agriculture in this comparatively prosperous  region of China.    Services provided include supply of funds, seeds, and forage  to farmers, purchase of agricultural products from farmers,  technological consultation and assistance in taking out various  kinds of insurance.    Among the 15,100 social service institutes dotted throughout  the towns and villages in Guangdong, a kind of "hospital for  crops" has received the most praise from local farmers.    Numbering more than 630, the hospitals for crops have  effectively solved technological problems peasants face in  farming, guided them to grow crops benefiting from more  scientific know-how and combined technological consultation with  prompt supply of high-quality seeds and fertilizers.    The fruitful work of local social service systems has  greatly  increased the economic benefits of agriculture, and local  farmers' interest in agricultural activities has been redoubled  accordingly.</p>

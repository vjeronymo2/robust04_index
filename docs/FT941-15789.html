			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a premium decision From Mr Iain C Baillie Sir, Like other correspondents, I oppose the proposed Pounds 1m premium bond prize. Surely, the fair certainty of winning smaller and more frequent prizes under the current system serves best to cater for the investor's mild gambling psyche and need to have an acceptable alternative to the conventional method of earning a return from a capital sum? The new proposal is strongly gambling-orientated, offering not only an extremely remote chance of winning but also a real financial disincentive through the loss of regular small prizes ('interest'). I believe these distinctions reflect the different needs of entirely separate segments of our investing com-munity. John H Shimmins, Birkenweg 12, 8472 Seuzach, Switzerland</p>

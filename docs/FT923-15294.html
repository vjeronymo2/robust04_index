			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities return to pre-election levels THE DEADLY cocktail of economic gloom and corporate financing and profit worries drove the stock market down below the FT-SE 2,500 mark yesterday for the first time since the re-election of the UK Conservative government in April. The setback was accompanied by a heavy sell-off in the stock index futures sector. At the day's low point, the Footsie was 33 points off and heading for the biggest one-day loss of the year; but a late rally trimmed the fall to 27.3 for a final reading of 2,493.9. Weakness in share prices was counter-balanced by strength in UK government bonds, prompting suggestions that a large institution might be switching from equities into gilts, by way of the index futures sector. A leading US securities house was a heavy seller of the September futures contract on the FT-SE Index, and returned aggressively in the afternoon after news of a fall in the latest US National Association of Purchasing Management Index. But at least two UK securities houses were also heavy sellers in the futures market. Activity in futures also appeared to be related to a large selling programme in the blue chip equities, completed at midsession but not printed until the end of the day. Adding to the market's nervousness were the pressures imposed by prospects for the clutch of new share issues now pending. Traders waited anxiously for news on the Telegraph issue, which was not known in market hours, and among retailers there were uncertainties over the planned refinancing of Isosceles and the pricing for MFI, the furniture group, which is expected today. Investors also have to deliver today their cheques for the Pounds 1.9bn second payment on BT shares. The continued flow of profits downgradings of leading British companies by brokerage houses completed the woe of the investment community. However, trading volume was not excessive. Seaq deals increased from Tuesday's 458.5m shares to 495.1m yesterday. 'Not particularly heavy for a day on which the Footsie fell so heavily and the background was so bleak,' commented one leading dealer. Dealers stressed that equity trading was still affected by technical factors as the market moved yesterday into the first day of dealing for the third quarter of the year. Daily totals of customer, or retail, business in equities, which are regarded as the most significant guide to investment activity, have remained relatively low this week. Tuesday's customer business was worth only Pounds 839.9m, below the Pounds 1bn figure seen as the sign of a healthily profitable market from the viewpoint of the big securities houses. Some market analysts were sceptical of yesterday's setback, which implied that fund managers were over-pessimistic and assuming that the Footsie would struggle to hold 2,600 at the year-end. Equity strategists preferred to emphasise that such a view would overlook the likelihood of some recovery in company profits in the third and fourth quarters of this year.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Management: Great expectations / Assessing what Opportunity 2000's first year has achieved Cynicism about Opportunity 2000, the business-led initiative launched a year ago to improve the position of women at work in the UK, is bound to be widespread among the quarter of the workforce now covered by the campaign. The hype surrounding the launch, fronted by John Major, the prime minister, inevitably raised expectations which will have been particularly hard to meet during the past year of recession. Short of sacking men wholesale and giving their jobs to women, sluggish staff turnover rates will have made impossible any real attack on imbalances between men and women in, for example, management grades. Even in the best of times, policies need time to work through - which is why those companies brave enough to have announced numerical targets for the appointment and promotion of women are generally setting their sights at least five years ahead. However, research* published yesterday to coincide with the first anniversary of the programme also suggests that Opportunity 2000 should not be dismissed as a publicity stunt which is having no practical effect on the day-to-day lives of women at work. A team drawn from Business in the Community, the business-led umbrella organisation responsible for Opportunity 2000, and Ashridge management college, conducted interviews during the summer with chief executives, board members and line managers from the original 60 or so companies which joined the campaign. The researchers also collected data on the practical steps now being taken by many companies to improve their attractiveness as employers of women. These include new policies and practices on: Recruitment. For example, Kingfisher now instructs recruitment consultants to include female candidates on shortlists wherever possible. The Co-operative Bank has trained managers in 'competency-based' recruitment interviewing, designed to eliminate bias against female candidates. Assessment and appraisal. It has often been claimed that traditional appraisal systems may discriminate against women. Legal &amp; General has tried to be more systematic and is developing 'gender-neutral' techniques. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte's appraisals cover regular core skills but also include sensitivity to the needs of clients and the ability to build relationships. Working arrangements. Almost all participating organisations offer flexible working arrangements to at least some staff. These include job sharing, working from home, part-time working and temporary contracts. The Bank of England is conducting an audit of all jobs to identify where flexibility is possible. Pay and conditions. Part-time workers, overwhelmingly female, have historically found themselves in receipt of less than pro rata pay and subject to conditions inferior to those of their full-time colleagues. More than three-quarters of Opportunity 2000 employers now provide common terms and conditions for all their staff; many have also taken steps to review their pay and check that equal reward is offered for work of equal value. Some flexibility in pensions is also available in nearly half of the companies. Family care. Most organisations are offering maternity arrangements well beyond the statutory minimum for all staff and half have career-break schemes for childcare. 'Keep in touch' schemes and re-entry programmes are increasingly on offer for women taking and returning from maternity leave; some companies are offering financial incentives to women to return after having children, or are undertaking to continue paying benefits during the period of leave. Help with childcare. Workplace nurseries, vouchers and holiday play schemes are now run by a number of participating companies, including Glaxo, WH Smith, Allied Dunbar and Boots the Chemist. Education and training. It is often claimed that women restrict their own promotion prospects by choosing to enter the 'wrong' disciplines - for example, pursuing careers in support functions like personnel, rather than 'core' activities, such as manufacturing. Some companies are now attempting to overcome these barriers. Lucas Industries, for example, is launching a new programme called 'engineering for non-engineers', which, it is planned, will help those in non-functional areas to cross the divide. Single-sex training has been found to be particularly effective in building confidence and enabling women to develop their own style. Over the past year IBM has doubled the number of women it has put through training courses. Commitment to Opportunity 2000 among chief executives and board members has clearly driven many of these practical improvements. However, there are worrying signs that messages have often failed to filter down the line: following the first year's review, strengthening communications and increasing line-manager involvement have been identified as the areas most in need of attention. Line managers interviewed were often not well enough informed about Opportunity 2000 to make a contribution. Less than half had specific targets for their departments and some appeared to be unaware that their organisations' declared equality goals had direct implications for them. A recent survey by the Institute of Management appeared to show that women themselves felt the continued existence of the 'old boys' network' was a far greater obstacle to their advancement at work than, for example, a lack of childcare or insufficient opportunities for flexible working. If prejudice is to be eliminated at all levels of an organisation, and cynicism about Opportunity 2000 is to be swept away, line managers will need to have been drawn more closely into the initiative by the next annual review. *Opportunity 2000, review of the first year.

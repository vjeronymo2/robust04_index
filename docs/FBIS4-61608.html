			<p>BFN     [Text] At approximately 1730 on 5 May Abkhazian forces  assaulted residents of the Georgian village of Mziuri, in the  Galskiy district of Abkhazia.    According to the press center of the Georgian Defense  Ministry, both the Georgians and Abkhazian forces reported dead  and wounded. How many people were lost in the conflict, remains  unknown.    The press service of Abkhazia's plenipotentiary mission to  Moscow rejects the Georgian report. It says that thirteen  Abkhaz troops have been missing in the Galskiy district since 5  May. A spokesman for the Abkhazian mission held Georgian  subversives responsible for their disappearance. He said  subversive groups infiltrated Abkhazian territory time and again  from across the Inguri river.    According to the Abkhazian Ambassador to Moscow Igor Akhba,  the subversives aimed to torpedo the repatriation of refugees to  the Galskiy district.</p>

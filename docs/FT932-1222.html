			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Skandia to collaborate with two foreign insurers SKANDIA, the Swedish insurance group, plans to collaborate with two foreign insurers to enhance services for commercial and industrial clients outside the domestic market, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Under one accord, the group will jointly operate an international service network with the leading Finnish insurer Pohjola from next January. The agreement expands the two companies existing co-operation which is cemented by cross-shareholding links. Under the other agreement, the US insurer Wausau will provide a range of insurance and claims services to Skandia's Nordic clients in the US and Canada. Skandia said it would develop a network of offices in continental Europe which would eventually serve both Pohjola and Wausau clients. Pohjola, meanwhile, is to build up a network of offices in the Baltic states and Russia.</p>

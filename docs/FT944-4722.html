			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / A nice little earner: The UK's nuclear levy, a redundant tax, should be allowed to lapse A little-noticed aspect of the review that the UK government is currently conducting of the nuclear power industry concerns the so-called nuclear levy. This surcharge on electricity bills for decommissioning old nuclear power stations, which brings in Pounds 1.2bn a year, is supposed to expire in 1998. But it is hard to see the Treasury - or any of the other potential beneficiaries - allowing such a nice little earner to lapse without a struggle. The levy was introduced when the government created Nuclear Electric to own and run nuclear power stations in England and Wales in 1989. It gave the company responsibility for decommissioning them, but not enough money to pay for the job. Instead, it instituted a temporary levy on electricity bills to raise Pounds 8.5bn over 10 years. The levy is set each year by the electricity industry regulator and is currently 10 per cent, but because receipts are behind schedule it may have to be raised next year. (This means, incidentally, that when the government introduced value added tax on home energy bills earlier this year, it began to tax the levy as well  -a clever way of compounding tax revenues. If VAT goes up to 17.5 per cent next April, VAT revenues attributable to the levy will be more than Pounds 200m.) Although the levy is supposed to end in 1998, it is questionable whether any government - Conservative or Labour - will allow this handy form of taxation to lapse. Even if Nuclear Electric's need for it were to disappear, there are would be those arguing against cancelling the levy itself. Imagine for a moment what would happen if the levy was cancelled, they would say. Straightaway, electricity bills would fall by more than 10 per cent. While that may seem a good thing, the present government is committed to pushing the cost of energy up - not down - to curb demand and reduce the environmental impact of power generation. And, in any case, underlying electricity prices are falling as the benefits of privatisation finally begin to work their way through. So there is actually a case for saying that taxation of energy bills should not merely be preserved but increased to support the objectives of current policy. But though the environmental case for propping up energy prices is strong, that is not the reason why the Treasury may want to keep the levy. Here, after all, is a revenue-raising measure that is in place, that is collected automatically and that people will notice only if it disappears. For those who would retain the levy after 1998, the only point for discussion is whether the proceeds should in future be fed straight into the Treasury's coffers or whether, being a specific revenue measure, they should be spent on a specific cause. The latter course is the one currently generating the greatest interest. Already the would-be recipients include the renewable energy lobby, which wants more subsidies for wind farms and landfill gas projects, and the coal-fired power generators, which want help to clean up dirty stations. There is also the ill-starred Energy Saving Trust that was supposed to be spearheading the government's campaign against energy waste. It has so far been short of funds because of the refusal of gas and electricity regulators to authorise even more levies on home energy bills to pay for it. The argument over the future of the levy is therefore likely to provide the unedifying spectacle of government struggling to justify preserving a redundant tax. We shall be treated to sonorous warnings from the Department of the Environment on the need for greater energy efficiency. Junior Treasury ministers will talk of the extraordinary difficulty (for technical reasons) of cancelling a taxation measure. The Department of Trade and Industry will highlight the business opportunities that should arise from whatever new use the levy proceeds are put to. All this will be said with a straight face. But no one will be fooled. Governments do not readily cut taxes, even though that is precisely what they should do in this case. The only sensible course is to allow the levy to lapse. The Treasury does not currently budget for the proceeds, and a firm statement of intent now would make it harder for this or a future chancellor to start factoring them into his revenue calculations. True, energy prices would fall, and that will encourage waste. But one of the main purposes of electricity and gas privatisation was to bring down energy costs and benefit the economy at large. If broader policy requires energy prices to be raised, this should be done through plain and open taxation, rather than by a residual measure that was created for a wholly different purpose.</p>

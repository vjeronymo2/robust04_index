			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Government's code of practice contains too many exceptions Sir, May I enter some reservations about John Willman's optimistic account of how the new voluntary open government code of practice will work under the ombudsman's supervision ('Eagle eye turned on Whitehall's secrecy', August 9)? Before asking how effectively the ombudsman will secure compliance, it is worth asking what precisely there is to comply with. Unlike freedom of information laws (FOI) overseas the code does not offer access to documents. The government says it will answer questions but not release original paperwork - a fundamental defect. There is no comparison between the detailed truth of records, assumptions, oversights, calculations, contradictions and so on, and a brief letter giving the department's edited summary. Access under the code will be limited to 'factual information'. Analysis, projections and the technical advice of government experts will be withheld. So will anything considered 'unreliable' or 'misleading'. Would the monthly unemployment figures - whose 'unreliable' statistical basis has prompted innumerable recalculations in recent years - be available under these criteria? There is also a formidable series of exemptions, many more sweeping than under FOI legislation. How much of the truth will appear in the trickle of remaining facts? The ombudsman might find that most secrecy is beyond his reach, being permitted by the code's overgenerous exemptions. The suggestion that only the ombudsman and not the courts can examine documents protected by public interest immunity certificates is incorrect. As the Matrix Churchill case demonstrated, a judge can examine them and - unlike the ombudsman - order their disclosure even if the government objects.

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Danger of Stalin's secret N-plants: Leyla Boulton recently visited the site of Tuesday's nuclear leak IRON GATES, rows of barbed wire, searchlights and armed guards separate Tomsk-7, Stalin's secret nuclear city in western Siberia, from the outside world. This is the site of a radioactive explosion on Tuesday night which has heightened fears about the once-pampered defence plants of the former Soviet Union which are still involved in the production of nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna yesterday put the Tomsk accident at Level Three on the International Nuclear Events Scale. That means 'a serious incident with on-site contamination but no effects off-site'. Chernobyl was a Level Seven disaster. However, a radioactive cloud was last night reported to be moving across Siberia away from Tomsk-7 and the nearby city of Tomsk. Russian television said the cloud was moving northeast at a height of 1.2 miles and a speed of 22 mph. The environmental group Greenpeace said several villages were at risk from wind-borne fallout. Russian officials in Tomsk tested snow for radiation. International environmental groups have blamed lax safety standards at the plant and said the international community should press Russia to stop plutonium production immediately. Anti-nuclear activists urged US president Bill Clinton to make his Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) aid package, offered at last weekend's Vancouver summit, contingent upon Russia halting production of civilian and military plutonium. However, Mr John Gittus, director-general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, which monitors nuclear incidents around the world, said the incident was nowhere near as bad as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. 'There can be no comparison between this incident and what happened at Chernobyl seven years ago,' he said. On a recent visit there the Financial Times was allowed to see only the prim administrative and residential centre, with solid, pastel-colour Stalin-era houses, amid beautiful Siberian forest. But Professor Alexei Yablokov, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on ecology and health, said his wife, a journalist, had seen 'rusting locks and leaking roofs' at nuclear-related facilities there. The incident at the Tomsk-7 chemical plant was the first at the heart of Russia's secretive defence industry to be openly and promptly acknowledged. Tomsk-7, established by Stalin to develop a nuclear bomb, is today a town of 110,000 people, producing plutonium and enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. Mr Gennady Khandorin, director of the chemical plant, said the reasons for a build-up of pressure which destroyed a container of radioactive material were still unknown. He said his staff were fine and only a stretch of road outside the plant had suffered from 'very small, local contamination'. The incident was nonetheless the worst in the former Soviet Union since Chernobyl. Special permission is required for a visit to Tomsk-7's two reactors, which produce nuclear fuel from which uranium and plutonium are derived, plus the chemical works where components for nuclear weapons are developed., Moscow is proposing to make Tomsk-7 the site of a national repository for plutonium from nuclear weapons dismantled under arms reduction treaties, and the US Congress has pledged Dollars 400m to fund such a facility. The incident is likely to put this plan into question. Despite Tomsk-7's desire to open up to the outside world - not least because of a reduction in special state support which used to make its isolation profitable - it is the victim of difficulties in transforming Russia's military-industrial machine. Mr Nicolai Yegorov, deputy atomic energy minister, said last month that Tomsk-7 had to continue to produce fresh plutonium until it had a centre in which to recycle the ageing plutonium which needs to be replaced periodically in nuclear weapons not covered by arms treaties.</p>

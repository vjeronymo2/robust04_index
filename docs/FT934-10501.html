			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Pacific forum may extend role MINISTERS of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum are expected to endorse a new framework giving the organisation a more formal role in setting policy on investment and trade. US officials said senior delegates from the 15 Apec member countries had given their blessing to a declaration on a new trade and investment framework which would probably be adopted at the Apec ministerial meeting in Seattle later this month. The framework proposes an evolution in the role of Apec, until now largely an informal consultative forum, to the establishment of a permanent trade and investment committee. This committee could continue some of Apec's existing work in areas such as customs but 'also move gradually into additional policy areas such as the comfort level and commitment of members to expand,' according to Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade representative. The Seattle meeting will also discuss a more ambitious vision of Apec's future prepared by a group of 'eminent persons'. Their report warns of rising protectionism, the development of inward looking regional blocs, and the escalation of trade disputes between Apec members, and urges 'the foundation of a true Asia-Pacific Economic Community' to head off these risks. It recommends that Apec set a goal of free trade in the Asia-Pacific region, working over the next three years to establish a timetable for reaching this goal. More immediately, it argues for measures to facilitate investment within the region, the adoption of an effective dispute resolution mechanism if one is not achieved in the Uruguay round of talks on liberalising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Washington trade experts warn, however, that the goal of an Asia-Pacific Economic Community is distant. The difficulty the Clinton administration is having in persuading the US Congress of the advantages of the smaller free trade area set up by the North American Free Trade Agreement does not bode well for such a sweeping ambition. 'Any talk about free trade areas, much less economic communities, would be in terms of long term ideals rather than concrete proposals,' said Mr Jeffrey Schott, a research fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank whose director, Mr Fred Bergsten, represents the US in the eminent persons group.</p>

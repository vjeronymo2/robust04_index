			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: When IT fails to measure up - Technically Speaking The value of information technology is rarely questioned by users these days. In schools and businesses, the belief is widespread that computers make classrooms more effective and offices more productive. The uncomfortable fact that vast investments in computers have shown only modest or, in some cases, no productivity increases is often dismissed as an irritating measurement problem. The US National Research Council said at the end of last year that US service companies spent at least Dollars 750bn (Pounds 493bn) on communications systems, computer hardware and software in the 1980s. During this period, their annual productivity gain was a mere 0.7 per cent. Many other studies also indicate that the correlation between IT spending and productivity increases is barely measurable. The general reaction to such studies is that the data is wrong or has been misinterpreted; or there is serious mismanagement of IT. It is true that the economic data is often difficult to collect, but it should be difficult not to notice an impact on the economy from such a large investment. This has become known as the productivity paradox, and there have been many attempts to analyse economic data in different ways to reveal the productivity that such large investments in computer technology must have made possible. If it is difficult to discern what the broad benefits of IT are, how can the smaller issues be evaluated? How does a manager decide whether investing to upgrade a company's PC systems to faster computer models, or to install improved software, will be rewarded through greater productivity? It is this lack of effective measurement of the benefits of investing in computer technology that forces many companies to make the equivalent of a leap in the dark when making significant investments in IT. One senior executive at a leading US bank describes the decision-making process as being based on a 'gut feeling'. It seems strange that a Fortune 100 corporation would make important business decisions by instinct but, lacking other measures, it may be as good as any other yardstick. The computer industry rarely mentions the productivity paradox. Computer companies routinely talk about increases in productivity, but these claims are made within the context of the technology. A new word processor is described as performing more quickly or data from a large database as being retrievable in less time. These measures of productivity are reassuringly self-validating but do not address the larger question of how IT should be used to increase productivity. Clearly, this question can be answered only by IT users. And the answer to the productivity paradox lies within itself. The paradox begins with the assumption that IT improves productivity and yet we do not see the results. Surely the answer is that IT is like any tool and its effectiveness is determined by the user. Lester Thurow, the US economist, believes that many corporations have misapplied IT. They have made large investments in IT without fully understanding how that technology should be used within the organisation. Many organisations allow departments to buy PCs and software with little control over which software packages are used and how those systems are applied. Thus employees find that computers allow them to do more work of different kinds. But there is often little or no distinction made as to whether that work should be done in the first place. Unless IT is managed with discipline and serious rethinking by companies about how they operate, its effects on the bottom line will not only be negligible but may be harmful. Organisations which solve the productivity paradox by focusing on strong management and appropriate use of IT will gain competitive advantage and unleash the true power of computer technology.</p>

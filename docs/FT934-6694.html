			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Gaidar calls for 'protectionism' to help business Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the government to apply 'sensible protectionism' to the country's industrialists and entrepreneurs. Mr Gaidar, who led the country's move towards a free market two years ago, said that since prices had been liberalised and the economy opened to imports, Russian companies' demands for protection against foreign competition showed they had adjusted to market conditions. He denied that he had changed his ultra-liberal views over the past two years to win votes in next month's parliamentary elections. Protection for business has been a popular theme in the election campaign. 'When we freed prices we needed imports because we did not even have any domestic markets,' he said yesterday. Russia's economic circumstances have changed. Now, the government was happy to respond to pleas from its farmers for an end to grain imports, and from other producers who now realised they had a market to defend. Import tariffs, which the government has steadily increased since opening up the economy in January last year, were also a useful source of budget revenues, he said: 'We believe that domestic markets should be protected and we can use these tariffs to raise some additional revenues.' He did not say which imports should be taxed, but added they should not be punitive ones, simply fees to support domestic industry. At the same time he vowed to resist demands to protect Russian monopoly producers which had no domestic competition.  Nor would he isolate the Russian economy from world markets, he said, claiming that Russia's speedy entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would help it.</p>

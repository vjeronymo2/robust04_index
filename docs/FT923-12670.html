			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Not quite as portable as they seem - Group schemes / Personal Pensions THE DRIVE towards group personal pensions has intensified over the past year, with small to medium sized employers seeing this product as a cheaper alternative to final-salary arrangements. However, employees should beware the promise of portability without penalty that these group plans claim to offer. All too often, employees who leave a group personal pension face a hefty fine that reduces their fund by over 50 per cent. At present, most of the UK's company pensions operate on a final-salary basis. Under a typical scheme, your pension builds up at a rate of 1/60th of your final salary for each year's service, up to an Inland Revenue limit of 40/60ths or two-thirds final salary, subject to a maximum of Pounds 50,000 where the 'earnings cap' applies. Group personal pensions are money-purchase products, which means that contributions are invested in a fund which is used to purchase an annuity at retirement. Some companies have set up a different type of money-purchase arrangement, known as a contracted-out money-purchase scheme (Comp), but these are more complex and less popular. At their most basic, group personal pensions are no more than a collection of individual plans, although some providers reduce their charges due to economies of scale. More generous plans also offer employer contributions, death benefits and, less frequently, disability benefits. It all depends on how much the employer is prepared to pay. Group personal pensions have proved particularly popular among smaller companies where the staff turnover is high. In theory, since each employee has his or her own plan, this can be taken from job to job. But the claim of portability without penalty is proving false. The main problem is that company pension schemes are notoriously incompatible. Unless the new company has an identical group personal pension, the employee may be forced to abandon the original plan in order to benefit from employer contributions and the other benefits associated with the main company scheme. So what happens to the existing plan? Any reduced charges that applied to the group personal pension will not apply once the employee leaves. If the employee joins the new employer's final-salary scheme, under Inland Revenue rules it is not possible to maintain the personal pension plan (unless there are additional self-employed earnings on which to base the contributions). The plan can be made 'paid up', which means that no further contributions are added and the existing fund continues to grow until the individual retires. This may sound fine, but invariably the pension provider will impose a severe penalty if the contributions stop. This reflects the high up-front charges that are incurred in sales of most personal pensions, including the payment of commission to the adviser. If you want to join the new employer's scheme, you could transfer-in your personal pension fund. Unfortunately transfers, particularly in the early years of a plan, reflect the hefty penalties associated with paid-up policies. Typically, after two years, an employee is likely to get back just 50 per cent of the voluntary premiums paid in. (The appropriate rights fund secured by the rebate of Serps contributions is treated less harshly.) Some life offices have reduced the impact of capital units on their personal pensions. These units, which are bought with contributions in the early years of a plan, attract very heavy charges. Scottish Provident got rid of its capital units altogether, and imposes no penalty on transfers. There is still a deduction to cover up-front costs, but the transfer value is about 70 per cent of contributions paid, instead of the 40 per cent more typically available where capital units are applied. If you want to join the company scheme, one way of dealing with the personal pension is to switch the fund into a free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) contract. FSAVCs are used to top up company schemes, where the company pension is expected to fall short of the Inland Revenue maximum. But Peter Timberlake, marketing manager at Legal &amp; General, warned: 'Officially, the FSAVC is a new contract, and the conversion, even if it is with the same provider, could incur fresh up-front commission for the salesman or adviser.' Since there is no industry standard on this, it is up to the individual to negotiate with the adviser to reduce the impact of commission. Unfortunately, even if the switch to an FSAVC can be achieved at little cost, few young people with heavy mortgage commitments can afford to pay both the occupational pension scheme contributions and to maintain the FSAVC premiums. If the FSAVC premiums are reduced, once again a charge probably will be incurred. The same problem can arise where the employee leaves to become self-employed. If the salesman and provider regard the switch in employment status as an excuse to set up a new policy, full up-front commission will be paid. Further problems arise where the employer previously made a contribution. Unless the individual can afford to maintain the total contribution level, the provider is likely to regard this as a drop in premium and impose a charge accordingly. Clearly, there seem to be portability problems associated with any change of employment. The cost of switching to an FSAVC or self-employed contract is likely to be every bit as expensive as making the plan paid-up or taking a transfer to an occupational scheme. Whichever way you turn, you are caught in a vicious circle that the pensions industry seems at pains to ignore. If you are offered membership of a group personal pension scheme, check at the outset what will happen to your fund if you change jobs. Some providers may be more sympathetic to the transfer issue than others, particularly those which operate on a non-commission or low-commission basis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] When he signed a government ordinance making A-310  aircraft and their parts exempt from customs duties, Viktor  Chernomyrdin was in breach of the Russian law because the  government has no right to make such decisions, Sergey Glazyev,  chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee, told  INTERFAX Monday.    A-310-300 planes are imported into Russia by Aeroflot under  a  leasing agreement with a consortium of European banks. Four air  buses of this kind are now in operation in Russia. A fifth  crashed near Mezhdurechensk, a town in the Kemerovo Region,  killing 75 passengers and crew.    Glazyev believed that the losses incurred in operating the  A-310's was the sole reason why Aeroflot was given tax relief.    Without this relief, the new import duties to be imposed as  of July 1 on aircraft and their parts would kill the idea of  importing A-310's, Glazyev believed.</p>

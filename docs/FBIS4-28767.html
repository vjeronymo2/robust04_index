			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries [MAFF] disclosed on 9 June that France and Australia  have called on Japan to lift its ban on import of their apples.  It said that the French and the Australian Governments had  already sent officials in charge of apple export and that the  Japanese Government has been officially asked to import their  apples. It also said that a meeting of experts has already been  held. Following its lifting of the ban last year on import of  New Zealand apples, the Japanese Government is likely to allow  import of U.S. apples this autumn. Since France is the largest  apple exporter in the world, it is expected that competition in  the apple market in Japan will intensify.    According to the MAFF, both France and Australia have  increased their calls for lifting the ban on the import of their  apples following the Japanese Government's decision to import  New Zealand apples last June. However, since their apples are  affected with harmful insects, Japan, at present, bans import of  both French and Australian apples for quarantine reasons.    However, it will be necessary for Japan to open its market  to  France and Australia if their apples are found to be safe for  export to Japan. As for the U.S. apples, Japan and the United  States, in their meeting on quarantine issues held in late May  last year, confirmed that the U.S. pest-control system meets  Japanese requirements. The first shipment of American apples is  expected to arrive in Japan immediately after the ban is lifted  this autumn.    The MAFF said that France has already sent data certifying  extermination of some pests. With this in mind, Japan plans to  hold meetings of experts to discuss technical quarantine  problems.    France, the largest apple exporter in the world, produced  2,324,000 tons of apples and exported 547,000 tons in 1992.  Australia, which produces 312,000 tons, is believed to be eager  to export its apples because its yearly export is only 31,000  tons.</p>

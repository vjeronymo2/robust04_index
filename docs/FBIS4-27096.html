			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  spoke with newsmen yesterday evening at the Deville Villa Plaza  Hotel. He said that fighting between the Burmese Government and  the Khun Sa forces is not intense now and is quite far from the  Thai border. If the situation becomes serious and if asked, the  Foreign Ministry will help by bringing the matter up for  discussion with the Burmese Government.    On the roundtable between the Phnom Penh Government and the  Khmer Rouge, the foreign minister said the Khmer Rouge has  softened its position. He said the roundtable is a good sign  that indicates that peace could follow. The Thai Government  strongly wishes that all Cambodian factions can reconcile their  differences and stop the fighting.</p>

The deal has been approved by the boards of Coke,  Amatil and BAT Industries, which is Amatil's largest shareholder, but is  subject to the approval of Amatil shareholders and Australian regulatory  authorities. Under the proposal, Amatil would concentrate on its core business  of snack foods and soft drinks and would spin off its tobacco interests into a  new company.

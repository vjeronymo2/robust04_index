			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lilleshall's shares decline 18p Shares in Lilleshall, the engineering and building products group, fell 18p to 123p yesterday, after it warned that its two UK window companies would perform disappointingly in the second half of the year. Mr John Leek, chairman, said that profits for the year to December 31 would be 'significantly ahead' of 1993, but lower than anticipated. Earnings per share would remain flat at 10p. In 1993 pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.91m, with Pounds 3.52m for the first half of this year. Following the announcement analysts lowered their forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 5.1m. Mr Leek said that Ideal Windows, the commercial window subsidiary, had increased volumes but was suffering from competition, particularly in the local authority market. Its retail window business, St Helens Glass, was facing weak consumer demand. The two companies make up 25 per cent of group turnover. On Wednesday, Anglian Group reported a sharp decline in interim profits because of reduced retail revenues and falling margins in the commercial market. Mr Leek said that the rest of the group was performing well. However Lilleshall, which has made seven acquisitions in the last two years, including St Helens Glass in September 1993, would not rush into further acquisitions.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FROST: 9 BIRDIES, 2 EAGLES EQUALS 60;  </P> <P> GOLF: BOGEY ON HIS 16TH HOLE PREVENTS HIM FROM MATCHING AL GEIBERGER'S PGA TOUR  RECORD OF 59.  </P> <P> David Frost tied the second-lowest round in PGA Tour history Friday, and it  could have been even lower.  </P> <P> Frost one-putted 11 of his first 12 holes in the second round of the Tucson  Open and finished with a 12-under-par 60 on a municipal course. Only a bogey on  his 16th hole of the day prevented Frost from matching the record 59 Al  Geiberger shot at the 1977 Memphis Classic.  </P> <P> "I'm not at all disappointed," he said. "It's the first time I've ever been in  this position, and it's three shots better than I've ever shot before . . . I'm  excited."  </P> <P> Frost one-putted 14 times and scored two eagles and nine birdies in only the  eighth round of 60 ever recorded in tour competition. The last 60 was shot by  Sam Snead in the 1957 Dallas Open.  </P> <P> Despite his spectacular round, Frost doesn't have sole possession of the lead.  Jay Haas, who played in a threesome with Frost and Craig Stadler, shot a 64 to  tie Frost's two-round total of 130.  </P> <P> Stadler was eight strokes back at 138 after shooting a 69 on the 6,902-yard  Randolph Park course, which usually plays to a par 70 but is listed at 72 for  the tournament.  </P> <P> Frost, who won the World Series of Golf last season, hit a three-wood second  shot to the green on the third hole (his 12th) and made a 30-foot putt for  eagle-three.  </P> <P> "That's when I started thinking about 59," he said. "I needed, what, three  birdies in six holes? . . . And I made three birdies."  </P> <P> But the bogey on the 356-yard, par-four seventh ruined any chance he had.  </P> <P> Frost drove the fairway and had 107 yards to the pin.  </P> <P> "I was between clubs, and I tried to hit a sand wedge hard," he said. "I didn't  need to . . . It hit the green and bounced over."  </P> <P> He chipped back to about six feet and missed the putt.  </P> <P> Robert Gamez, a 21-year-old rookie who passed up his last season at the  University of Arizona to join the pro tour, shot a 64 at the TPC at Star Pass  and was at 131.  </P> <P> The pros played one round on each of the two courses, and will play the final  two at the more difficult Star Pass layout.  </P> <P> Greg Norman disqualified himself from one of Australia's richest golf  tournaments Saturday, saying he accidentally had breached a rule during  Thursday's first round of the $625,000 Daikyo Palm Meadows Cup in Brisbane.  </P> <P> Norman shot a course-record 63 Friday to take a one-shot lead after two rounds,  but said Saturday he could not continue, feeling he had breached rules by  taking illegal relief on the 10th hole on Thursday, when he shot an  opening-round 66. He also said the 63 should be discounted.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned my course record should not stand," he said. "Whatever  I've done after the 10th (on Thursday) is history."  </P> <P> Norman hit his drive into the water on the 10th Thursday and believed he was  entitled to total relief from what he thought was a lateral water hazard.  </P> <P> "I dropped the ball but it rolled back towards the water and I had to stand in  the hazard to play the shot," he said. "I dropped it again and then placed it  believing I had the right to get total relief."  </P> <P> He was advised Saturday he was in breach of the rules.  </P></p>

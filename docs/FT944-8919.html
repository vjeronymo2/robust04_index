			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: US company wins 51% of HungarHotels American General Hospitality, a privately-held US company, has won an international tender for a 51 per cent stake in HungarHotels, Hungary's last state-owned hotel chain to be privatised, writes Virginia Marsh in Budapest. It outbid Intercontinental, the Japanese-owned international hotel group. The State Property Agency, Hungary's privatisation body, said it hoped to close the deal for HungarHotels, which owned 15 hotels in Hungary, by the end of this month. American General is believed to be paying between Dollars 50m-60m for the stake. The decision is a major blow for Intercontinental which now faces the possibility of having no presence in Budapest, one of central Europe's most visited tourist and business locations. It operates HungarHotels' flagship Hotel Forum through a local franchiser. Last year it lost the Duna Intercontinental, another top Budapest hotel to the Marriott group of the US. American General operates its hotels through franchisers rather than under its own name. In the US it works with chains such as Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton and Holiday Inn. The SPA said two fifths of the purchase price would be used for modernising HungarHotels' properties. A condition of the privatisation is that the new owner would not be allowed to sell any of the hotels for three years. The SPA was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, and American General was advised by Creditanstalt Securities.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Rising incomes bolster savings Buoyant personal incomes allowed consumers to continue spending in the first quarter of this year without reducing their savings, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. At the start of the year many economists thought that because of tax rises the recovery would only be sustained if consumers cut their savings in order to finance spending. However, the savings ratio - savings as a proportion of total personal disposable income - rose slightly to 10.4 per cent in the first quarter, from a revised 10.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. Income from employment rose by 2.1 per cent over the quarter, helped by bonuses and overtime payments which have been visible in the average earnings figures. After deducting taxes, the result was that total personal disposable income was 1.5 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. That allowed consumer expenditure to rise 1.4 per cent over the quarter. Overall, gross domestic product rose by 0.7 per cent over the quarter (or 0.6 per cent if oil and gas are excluded), confirming earlier estimates. However, first-quarter GDP is now estimated to be 2.9 per cent higher than in the first three months of last year, compared with the 2.6 per cent published. The change is due to revisions in the 1993 data, which show that growth was slightly faster in the second half of the year than was previously thought. Corporate finances were healthy over the quarter. The financial surplus of industrial and commercial companies, at Pounds 4.29bn, was the highest ever recorded. Gross trading profits, before deducting stock appreciation, were 2.6 per cent higher over the quarter and 15.4 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. Fixed investment rose by 2.1 per cent over the quarter and was 3.2 per cent higher than in the first quarter of last year. However, this investment was concentrated in the sector of industry consisting largely of government bodies and banks. Investment fell in manufacturing, mining and quarrying and in the electricity, gas and water industries. The value of stocks and work in progress fell by Pounds 449m in the first quarter, having risen by Pounds 157m in the fourth quarter of last year. Stocks rose in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors but fell in other areas, such as retailing. The implied GDP deflator, a measure of inflation compiled by averaging the prices of the goods and services which make up GDP, rose 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 0.6 per cent. The deflator was 3.3 per cent higher than in the first three months of 1993. The improvement in the trade balance added about 0.4 per cent to first quarter GDP, although this was offset by the effect of destocking.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Observer: Les Francais uber alles What does the president of the European Commission have in common with the managing director of the IMF, the president of the EBRD, and the secretary generals of the OECD and Council of Europe? Mais bien sur: Delors, Camdessus, Attali, Paye and Lalumiere are all French. The Germans may be accused of throwing their weight around these days, but one area where they have patently put up a miserable show is in securing the top spot at major European or international institutions. The head of the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank is deutsch - if anyone noticed - but otherwise it is the French, defying Nicholas Ridley's canine comparisons, who have long made the running. Not unlike the British, the Germans seem to regard Brussels as the place to palm off problem politicians; and no German has ever been nominated for the big IMF job. The betting is that this reticence will evaporate when the European central bank hoves into view. But then there is the diplomatic teaser that, if they are as mustard-keen as they appear to secure the siting of this worthy institution on home turf, it would be a tall order to expect to be granted a countryman as the first president into the bargain.</p>

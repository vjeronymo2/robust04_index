			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Beyond this point predators may lurk - The possible consequences of the latest round of potential mergers in the profession Rumours are rife this week of a radical merger that would provide a substantial shake-up to the existing structure of the accountancy profession. A hefty giant is threatening to take over a collection of smaller entities in a consolidation that could have substantial ramifications for the delivery of services. A new stage has been reached following discussions in the last few days, although it may yet be a good length of time before any deal comes to fruition while all those involved huddle together to debate the options. It follows a long period of sometimes tense courtship, with successive and competitive bouts of broken engagements in the past and role-reversal as pursuer and pursued for the prize. There is a risk that if things do not go to plan, attempts at merger could instead lead to a further and embittered fractionalisation. The potential for failure is certainly high. Fragile egos are at stake, careers could be jeopardised, jobs may go, and there is also an enormous potential for a clash of cultures. A good degree of bitterness and backstabbing has already been in evidence, with those less reluctant to go ahead indulging in selective and embarrassing leaks to the press. In spite of the emphasis on the word 'merger' in public, such combinations generally end up as takeovers by the dominant party, as any accountants worth their charge-out rates will concede. The driving force is naturally a commercial one, with some keen competitive concerns between the rivals making the merger attractive as a way to gain clients and maintain or boost market position. The spread of resources from around the country and the potential market across the world make the merger seem in many ways an attractive proposition. The rumour in question is, of course, the possible merger of the UK's six leading professional accountancy bodies. Equally, however, it is the possible merger of the two accountancy firms Arthur Andersen and BDO Binder Hamlyn. For in all the respects listed above, both mergers are remarkably similar. Yet in most other ways, they are extraordinarily different. The former has a history stretching over decades, will probably take years more to evolve and is characterised by a good deal of hostility. It is also frankly all but irrelevant to the outside world. The latter has been just a few months in the making, will likely be concluded one way or another by the summer, and looks set to be conducted on relatively friendly terms. It will also probably have a more important outcome for the world at large, as the 'Big 6' firms boost market share still further. At the start of last week, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies met to ratify the report of a working group it had set up nearly a year earlier chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick. This endorses calls for 'rationalisation' of the profession. A week before, Mr Jim Wadia, managing partner of Arthur Andersen, the UK's fourth largest firm, wrote proposing a merger to Mr John Norton, senior partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth largest firm. Drawing comparisons between the two accountancy firms in question and one or more of the six professional accountancy bodies is difficult. There is perhaps at least a limited parallel, with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales playing the Arthur Andersen role in taking the initiative. Some sceptics suggest that the institute has been driven to act by financial worries and concern about its waning influence in the longer term, notably a tailing off in the growth of student recruitment. This is happening at a time - and partly as a result - of the success of the other professional bodies, notably the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in the UK with its members steeped in practical experience, and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants with its aggressive marketing of its qualification overseas. Meanwhile, Andersen believes that Binder is a tempting target because of its healthy list of quoted clients, and because it thinks it may be difficult for the smaller firm to hold on to this group for much longer. Arguably some of the 11 regional partnerships within Binder - which must each vote on the merger - are in the position of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which is proud of its small but separate stance while a little nervous of being swallowed alive in a merged entity. Andersen stresses that Binder would be able to retain something of its own identity and possibly its name in a merged UK firm. The Bishop proposals make similar claims for the professional bodies and their constituencies, with a tortuous set of elected and co-opted regional bodies, co-ordinating groups and special interest sections. The sceptics in both mergers would argue that before long the differences and distinctive qualities are more likely to disappear, after a good bout of indigestion and some blood-shed. The two firms need to be sure that a merger will not lead to assuming substantial overheads and less significant smaller clients while losing Binder partners, staff and worthwhile clients. The six professional bodies need still to justify how a single body will cope any more effectively than the present system with such a diverse group of members' interests and public interests. The next few months will be decisive. Andersen's Jim Wadia has already been given considerable authority to negotiate a merger, and final approval at a worldwide partners' meeting could be granted by July 1 if Binder agrees. In the labyrinthine world of the politics of the professional bodies, such speed will be lacking. Market researchers can at least look forward to a lucrative time, with several surveys of accountants to canvass views in the offing. Judging by unpublished information from some joint market research conducted more than a year ago, the UK and Ireland's three chartered bodies will have an uphill task trying to persuade their members to agree to their colleagues sharing the title 'chartered accountant'. Less than 30 per cent in each body approved the idea then. That should come as no surprise, given that it was the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales which failed to vote in sufficient numbers for a merger with the Scots in 1970, or with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy in 1990. Equally, other confidential responses in the research suggested that only a third or less of the members of four of the six bodies supported the idea of an institute divided in three geographically. The exceptions were the Scottish and Irish chartered accountants. Mr Ian Plaistowe, a former president of the English and Welsh Institute, may be a senior Andersen partner as well as a member of the Bishop working group. But there the similarities do end. The action taken by his firm is likely to be far more clear-cut and rapidly resolved than that of his professional body.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / BA's new US routes spark attack BRITISH AIRWAYS is to start services between the US and both Birmingham and Manchester. The announcement yesterday provoked a sharp attack from the US airline industry, which said the move highlighted the unfair advantages BA had over its US rivals. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of US carrier United Airlines, last night met Mr Ian MacGregor, the transport secretary, to renew pressure on the government to ease restrictions on the operations of American carriers in the UK. He and other US airline chiefs are pressing for the changes as a quid pro quo for British Airways' proposed purchase of a Dollars 750m (Pounds 438.5m) stake in USAir, the American carrier. 'I want to make sure the British government understands the degree by which BA wins in this deal,' Mr Wolf said yesterday. 'BA would be able to run a US domestic route network while we would not have access to top UK regions or onward flights to third countries. BA's announcement (on Birmingham and Manchester) underscores the discriminatory nature of the air services agreements between our two countries.' BA did not need prior permission to announce the new services because it already had the rights to fly the routes. American Airlines, the largest US carrier, said yesterday that BA was starting the services only after years of pressure. 'We would begin a Birmingham-Chicago service within 90 days if given the green light.' Mr Wolf pressed Mr MacGregor to allow his airline to fly twice daily between the US and Manchester and Birmingham. He asked the government to try to persuade third countries to accept onward flights from London by US airlines. BA's services will start in March 1993 and will link Birmingham with Newark, near New York, and Manchester with Los Angeles.</p>

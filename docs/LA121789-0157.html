			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE MAY BACK CITY IN POLICE DISPUTE;  </P> <P> LABOR: A RULING ON THE FORCED IMPOSITION OF A UNION CONTRACT FOR LONG BEACH  OFFICERS HAS BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL A HEARING JAN. 22.  </P> <P> A court hearing last week did little to end the contract shoot-out between city  management and the police union, although a temporary truce will remain in  place for another month.  </P> <P> While she indicated during a Los Angeles hearing on Thursday that she will side  with the city, Superior Court Judge Dzintra I. Janavs postponed until Jan. 22 a  ruling on whether city management can impose a new contract on the 610-member  police union without the union's consent. In the meantime, the city has been  barred from carrying out the new contract, which the union complains is being  forced upon them.  </P> <P> Whatever Janavs' ruling, however, an appeal is expected. "I'm sure this will  get decided by the state Supreme Court," union attorney Mike Hannon said. "This  is probably a year or two away from resolution," observed Mike Tracy, president  of the Long Beach Police Officers Assn.  </P> <P> Deciding that the city had not given the union sufficient notice that it was  going to declare an impasse in the nine-month-old bargaining talks and adopt  its final contract offer, Dzintra ordered the city to give that offer to the  union to allow the membership to vote.  </P> <P> Although that opens the door for an agreement that would end the labor dispute,  Tracy predicted that the contract would be overwhelmingly rejected unless the  city makes substantial changes.  </P> <P> "We will make some modifications (in our position) and see if there is any  movement from them," he said.  </P> <P> City human resources Director William Storey held out little hope of further  bargaining by the city, saying the city's offer could not change unless the  City Council modifies its position.  </P> <P> The court case revolves around the City Council's decision last month to adopt  the city's final contract offer. Arguing that such action violates the  so-called evergreen clause of their last contract, the union asked Janavs to  prohibit the city from imposing its final contract position.  </P> <P> The evergreen clause stated that the old contract would remain in effect until  either July of this year or until both sides agreed upon a new contract,  whichever was later. "Now they just pull the rug out from under us and say we  didn't mean to do this. They shouldn't be allowed to do that," Hannon argued to  the judge.  </P> <P> Such evergreen clauses, which the police union has had in its contracts for a  decade, are rare. Attorneys said there are no pertinent California court  rulings, and the two sides disputed interpretations of federal labor law cases  that touched on the issue.  </P> <P> Janavs, saying she had "given this case an awful lot of thought," agreed with  the city's arguments that federal labor law indicates that an open-ended  contract can be terminated by either side, as long as reasonable notice is  given. She decided, however, that the city had not given reasonable notice  because it declared an impasse only a week after announcing that it planned to  do so.  </P> <P> City management insists that staffing changes are necessary to run the Police  Department more efficiently and has demanded a number of changes in personnel  policy that have been bitterly fought by the union.  </P> <P> "They may ram it down our throat, but we'll throw it back on them," declared  Tracy, who reiterated that the union is not planning any job actions. Instead,  he said the union is launching a publicity campaign aimed at rallying public  support for their cause.  </P> <P> "We feel the matter at this point in time has to be taken to (the public) . . .  We're not going to go away. We're not going to roll over and say this is a  great deal and say we're taking this."  </P></p>

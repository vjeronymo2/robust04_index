			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Sihanouk withdraws offer to Khmer Rouge King Norodom Sihanouk has withdrawn an offer to give cabinet posts to the Khmer Rouge in return for a ceasefire. His decision abruptly ended hopes that the offer could lead to peace talks between the radical faction and the government, Iain Simpson writes from Phnom Penh. It also means that renewed fighting in the central province of Kompong Thom is likely to spread to other areas. In the past week, Khmer Rouge troops have attacked government positions and villages in the province, retaking positions which the government captured last year. Reports from other provinces in the west indicate that both sides are preparing for offensives  -a dry season pattern likely to be repeated this year. Earlier in the week, King Sihanouk held talks in China with the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan. The king is in hospital in Beijing, receiving treatment for cancer. They discussed the king's proposal to give the Khmer Rouge senior government positions in return for agreeing to a ceasefire, giving up its army and handing over the territory it controls.</p>

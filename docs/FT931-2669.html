			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: OCP bidder set time limit to top Gehe offer A FRENCH consortium seeking to outbid Gehe, the German medicines group, for control of Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines wholesaler, was yesterday given a deadline of April 9 to beat the German FFr2.12bn (Dollars 370m) offer. The time limit is a consequence of the Paris stock exchange's decision yesterday to grant legal clearance to Gehe's controversial bid for OCP. The German offer, worth FFr800 per share for at least 50.01 per cent of the fully diluted equity, will be open from today until April 16, said the SBF stock exchange association. Under French takeover law, any counterbid must be launched five trading days before the close, in this case April 9. Gehe announced a friendly offer last month, with the support of Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP chief executive. However the group's largest single shareholder, the Bourely family, with 15 per cent of the equity, subsequently opposed the Gehe offer and has been trying ever since to mount a French counterbid. The government has lent advice but denies having assisted the French consortium. OCP's FFr33bn annual turnover gives it 43 per cent of the French market for drug supplies to high street chemists. Potential members of the counterbidding group include Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemicals group.</p>

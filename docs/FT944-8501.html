			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Competition likely to churn up and slim down dairy industry - Higher milk prices will result in more added-value products Two weeks ago, Britain's Pounds 8bn dairy industry was pitched into a new competitive world when the government deregulated the milk supply market for the first time in 60 years. This has resulted in companies complaining bitterly about price increases and threatening plant closures and job losses as profits are hit. Unigate, which has already warned that the rise in milk prices would cut its profits by Pounds 10m this year, said it might have to close more dairies to compete. Dairy Crest, the processing arm of the old Milk Marketing Board, recently announced the closure of two dairies with the loss of more than 200 jobs. Dairy Crest's own future is uncertain as speculation is rife about a takeover bid from rival Unigate. The company is due to be sold by the residuary body which was appointed to wind up the milk board's business, but a stock market flotation has been put off indefinitely following the milk price rise. A match between Dairy Crest and Unigate would make strategic sense as it would offer scope for rationalisation of low-grade butter/skimmed milk powder plants and cheese making capacity which have been hardest hit by the rise in milk costs. A bid would be likely to attract the attention of the competition authorities, however, as it would give Unigate almost 60 per cent of the UK's butter-making capacity. It is not just these two companies which must trim capacity: the entire industry faces a pressing need to reduce output if it is to remain competitive at higher milk prices. Although dairy companies have shed many plants in recent years and cut milk processing capacity by 60 per cent, they have not kept up with the rapid pace of change in consumer buying patterns. Some dairy executives believe there is still considerable slack in the business. Consumers are turning rapidly away from doorstep milk deliveries to supermarket purchases at a rate of 12 per cent a year, making many bottling plants redundant. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, the farmers' co-operative which has succeeded the milk board, reckons Britain has twice as much milk bottling capacity, twice as much butter/powder capacity and 30 to 40 per cent more cheese making facilities than required. The rise in milk prices which has raised raw materials costs by an average of 11 per cent across the industry has eroded company margins to about 4 per cent. Some City analysts believe the industry's milk bill will rise by Pounds 350m in the coming year, wiping out its entire profits. Financial imperatives are likely to hasten rationalisation, but Mr Neil Davidson, group executive at Northern Foods and current president of the Dairy Industry Federation, the trade body, fears that if too much capacity is closed there will be insufficient facilities to cope with seasonal peaks in milk supply. Milk cannot be stored for long and at certain times of year, when cows are calving, output increases. The extra milk must be turned into a product with a longer shelf life such as butter or skimmed milk powder unless it is to be wasted. This is why much processing capacity can stand idle for long periods in order to absorb peak supply when it occurs. However, Mr Dare says the problem is not as great now as in the past. Farmers have managed to iron out much of the seasonal fluctuation in milk output in recent years - he says it is now plus or minus 5 per cent of core product-ion. Dairies have been slow to gear up to these changed market realities. To a large extent, they are still thrashing out a strategy in the new competitive world after having been cushioned for many years by the milk board's system for rationing supply. They have been late in recognising the need to add value to their production and innovation has often been led by foreign competitors. It will be much more difficult for companies to pass on higher prices for undifferentiated products. Mild cheddar cheese, for example, is vulnerable to replacement by lower-priced imports. The industry must move rapidly to capitalise on its production of higher-value value items which are less exposed to rises in raw materials costs while rationalising commodity production to cut overheads. Over the next three years there is likely to be a widespread shake-out in the industry. But so far the dairies have laid their problems at Milk Marque's door, resenting higher prices, and complaining to the Office of Fair Trading about an abuse of its dominant power. Further rationalisation in the industry would help counter Milk Marque's dominance by establishing a small number of powerful buyers.</p>

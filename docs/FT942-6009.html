			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Scalfaro denies misuse of secret funds President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is becoming increasingly embroiled in a controversy over the use of secret funds during his time as interior minister in the 1980s. Rather than stay aloof from damaging allegations that he was aware of the misuse of the secret funds by the security services, President Scalfaro has been drawn into making a series of rebuttals. These rebuttals have in turn raised more questions than answers. The alleged misuse of these funds by interior ministers over the past decade has been under investigation by Rome magistrates for a year, and seven former top domestic intelligence officials are on trial for embezzlement. At various stages all the accused have sought to implicate four former Christian Democrat interior ministers, including Mr Scalfaro, for operating a secret payments system from unaccountable ministry funds. Mr Scalfaro held the portfolio from 1983 to 1987. The Rome magistrates last week issued a statement saying they were not investigating the president after further accusation had been made in court. This prompted President Scalfaro to make an angry unprepared statement to journalists. 'I defy anyone to prove a single lira was spent by me or other interior ministers for anything other than institutional purposes.' Ever since then the opposition Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the former communists, as well as the governing Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, have been calling for explanations of what these 'institutional purposes' were. Having admitted he knew about the use of these funds it will be difficult for him to avoid demands to be more specific. No one has denied the need for discretionary funds at the interior ministry, but the president's critics argue there should be some proof the monies were not being misused. The raising of the temperature on this issue could make the president vulnerable on the question of his tenure. Even before the elections, politicians across the political spectrum had started to question whether Mr Scalfaro, elected by the discredited old parliament, should be allowed his full seven-year term. both the Northern League and the MSI have been giving ever stronger messages that the president can only remain as long as parliament deems fit.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENTIST RESURRECTS SOUNDS FROM THE PAST  </P> <P> In the compact disc era, people who talk about spinning some old records  usually mean breaking out the big vinyl LPs.  </P> <P> But when Michael Khanchalian, a 34-year-old dentist, hankers to listen to a  bygone tune, he gingerly slips a wax, cylinder-shaped record from a cardboard  box. Next, he cranks up one of his many turn-of-the-century phonographs,  attaches an oversize, goose-neck brass or wooden horn to the machine, and  gently sets down the stylus.  </P> <P> "This is beyond nostalgia," says Khanchalian, sitting in the den of his  Monrovia residence, listening to some of the first records ever produced. "I  don't collect them because I remember Teddy Roosevelt or Sarah Bernhardt. I do  it to resurrect the sounds of the past -- to make history come alive."  </P> <P> Wax records, invented by Thomas Alva Edison, were first produced commercially  in 1890 and manufactured as late as 1929. Two of the most famous songs recorded  on wax were "A Bicycle Built for Two" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."  </P> <P> Fellow fanciers of the records, known as cylinders, say Khanchalian has one of  the best collections anywhere. They praise him for using his dentistry skills  to repair the delicate cylinders for collectors around the country, thus  helping preserve a dying medium.  </P> <P> The wax records are about the same size and shape as the cardboard tube inside  a roll of toilet paper. To be played, the hollow cylinder is placed on a  mandrel, a metal spindle. The wax record revolves at a high speed while a  needle moves up and down on hundreds of grooves. Sound quality varies from  muddled static to surprising clarity depending on the condition of the  cylinder.  </P> <P> Among Khanchalian's roughly 1,000 wax cylinders is a recording of Theodore  Roosevelt giving a speech about labor laws when he was running for President  under the aegis of the Bull Moose Party. Other political recordings -- used by  candidates to reach a mass audience before radio broadcasts began in 1920 --  include cylinder-preserved debates between Democrat William Jennings Bryan and  Republican William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States.  </P> <P> Khanchalian's copious collection -- stored in cabinets and drawers in his guest  room, living room, dining room, garage and just about anywhere else he can find  space -- includes an 1898 cylinder of George W. Johnson, an early black  recording artist.  </P> <P> He also has a selection of vaudeville recordings made by, among others,  comedian Sophie Tucker in 1910. And there's a 1908 recording by early  Oscar-winning actress Marie Dressler, who tells her audience that she's a  "self-supporting suffragette," before launching into a raucous rendition of  "I'm a Respectable Working Girl."  </P> <P> Khanchalian, vice president of the California Antique Phonograph Society, which  has about 300 members, loves to wax on about the hobby he began at 10 after an  aunt gave him his first cylinder. He started collecting seriously in 1981 and  now counts two records in particular as his most prized possessions. One is his  oldest, an 1891 recording of Patrick Gilmore's military band playing "The  College Song." (Gilmore was John Philip Sousa's mentor.) The other is one of  only two recordings in existence of a once-popular evangelist team, Ira Sankey  and Dwight L. Moody.  </P> <P> "Mike has one of the best vintage record collections that exists today," says  Rick Wilkins, curator of the Olden Year Musical Museum in Duncanville, Tex. "He  has some of the oldest records in the world."  </P> <P> But perhaps as important as his collection is Khanchalian's ability to repair  the fragile wax records, worth anywhere from a few dollars to a few thousand  dollars each. As a dentist, he has been able to transfer some of his skills,  painstakingly filling cracks and breaks in a damaged cylinder much the same way  he would craft a crown or fill a cavity. He even uses dental wax and the small  silver tools of his trade to repair the records.  </P> <P> "In dental school, you learn to be accurate within a tenth of a millimeter,"  says Khanchalian, who practices in Pasadena. "If you are off in dentistry, the  patient can really feel it. The same is true of the cylinders. You have to  match up the grooves exactly right or it won't work."  </P> <P> Indeed, collectors across the country credit Khanchalian with saving some of  the rarest and most valuable vintage recordings.  </P> <P> "He's amazing," says Allen Koenigsberg, editor and publisher of the Antique  Phonograph Monthly, a New York magazine with a circulation of about 2,000.  "Before Mike started fixing these things, most people gave up on them. When  they break, they're like a jigsaw puzzle."  </P> <P> Wilkins has sent some of the more important cylinders from his museum  collection to Khanchalian for restoration. "He's the only one in the world that  does it," Wilkins says. "He's saving historic recordings that were made in the  1800s that otherwise would be lost."  </P> <P> Restoring the old cylinders is tedious, so Khanchalian takes on projects only  for a handful of collectors. "I try to just work on the really rare ones," he  says. "For me, it's a labor of love."  </P> <P> In return for saving cherished cylinders for his peers, Khanchalian often is  paid in the currency he loves best: another cylinder for his collection. "I  just love early recorded sound," he says. "It's as if you were right there."  </P></p>

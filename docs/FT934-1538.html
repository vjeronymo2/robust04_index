			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Palestinian peace negotiations falter again The planned meeting in Cairo next week between Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, Mr Yassir Arafat, intended to resuscitate the deadlocked Israeli-PLO negotiations, is almost certain to be postponed to January 6 or later, Israeli officials said yesterday. The Cairo meeting, tentatively scheduled for December 22 or 23, was agreed on by the two leaders after talks last Sunday failed to resolve differences holding up the start of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area of the West Bank. Israeli troops were to begin pulling out of the Gaza and Jericho areas last Monday. And although both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin said after their abortive meeting that a delay of 10 days in finalising the precise details of an Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement would not be too damaging, another delay could only weaken the diminishing support on both sides for the peace process. However, Norway's deputy foreign minister, Mr Jan Egeland, said last night that 'high-level representatives' of Israel and the PLO would meet in Norway on Monday for talks, Reuter reports. The meeting at an Oslo hotel, also including delegates from the US, Russia, Egypt, the EU and Norway, would be preceded by informal talks tomorrow, he said. Mr Egeland, who helped broker the historic peace deal in at least 14 rounds of secret talks in Norway this year, said it was unclear if Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, would head the Israeli delegation, as reported earlier by a PLO official. Mr Omar Kitmitto, PLO representative in Norway, had also said the PLO delegation would be headed by Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen. Israeli TV said the discussions might prepare the ground for another meeting between Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat. In the past 24 hours, several Israeli officials involved in the negotiations have given off-the-record briefings indicating that central issues still remain to be resolved, and that the start of the troop withdrawal may have to be put off for several weeks. Israeli and PLO officials are continuing to hold private contacts in an effort to agree the size of the Jericho autonomous area, and to resolve the issue of border controls. Mr Arafat wants crossing points from Gaza into Egypt and from the Jericho region into Jordan managed by Palestinians. An opinion poll published yesterday by the Centre for Palestinian Research showed a decline in support for the autonomy programme among Palestinians, with 41.5 per cent backing the accords, compared with 64.9 per cent three months ago. A survey among Israelis, published by the Ma'ariv daily, showed 54 per cent believe an autonomy deal will eventually be reached. Foreign governments have pledged Dollars 570m (Pounds 383m) in aid to the Palestinians next year, but insisted that any use of this to meet start-up costs of the fledgling Palestinian administration must be properly monitored, the World Bank said yesterday. At the first meeting in Paris of the Bank's consultative group for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Mr Abu Ala'a (Ahmed Qurie) pressed donors to allow some of their aid to be used to fund current costs of the Palestine Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development, which he chairs, and other new Palestinian institutions, as well as capital investment in aid projects. The Bank backed his argument, with its vice president for the Middle East, Mr Caio Hoch-Weser, asking donors to be 'flexible' in the difficult start-up phase of Palestinian self-government. He said: 'We are assuming all tax receipts, direct and indirect, in the territories will be transferred to the Palestinians.' But initially the latter might have difficulty without foreign aid in covering salary costs. The European Union, which together with national donations from its 12 states is the biggest contributor to the Dollars 2bn fund for the Palestinians, had promised to meet some administrative running costs, Mr Hoch-Weser said. He was confident that other donors would do the same. International auditors would be brought in to monitor the aid. Mr Abu Ala'a, who earlier held talks with Mr Peres, in Paris, acknowledged that the delay in reaching full agreement on implementing the September peace accord would have 'a real impact' on economic development plans.</p>

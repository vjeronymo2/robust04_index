			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: Washington pressed to ratify pact US failure to approve the implementing legislation of the Uruguay Round trade accord would be 'equal in magnitude' to the US failure to approve the League of Nations after the first world war, Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in charge of trade, said yesterday. He was nearing the end of two days of talks with US officials, senators and congress members. Sir Leon said defeat by the US Congress of a trade accord approved with US and EU leadership would be devastating. At a time when US leadership is needed to handle problems around the world, the inability of the US administration to get the trade pact approved would impair its ability to lead. The administration has not been seriously worried about Gatt passage but opponents may be making headway with their contention that the new World Trade Organisation would involve a loss of US sovereignty. Mr Newt Gingrich, second ranked Republican in the House of Representatives, has talked of 'a very real chance' he might vote against the deal. Some US officials are concerned that failure to approve the WTO this year would give the opposition time to build strength. But the administration has been unable to agree on a way to raise the estimated Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.7bn) needed to compensate for tariff cuts. Sir Leon suggested numerous solutions, including a waiver of the US budget act requirement that all expenditure be offset by new taxes or cuts. He said failure to pass the implementing legislation this year would be 'unwise to the point of being irresponsible.' Sir Leon said he had discussed with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, the option of allowing China to become a founder member of the World Trade Organisation this year, before its economic liberalisation is complete. WTO members would be allowed to use safeguards against Chinese imports.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] SYDNEY, June 1 (AFP) -- Australia's internal spy  agency has replaced its telephone system, fearing it has been  penetrated by foreign agents, it was reported Wednesday.    The SYDNEY MORNING HERALD, quoting intelligence sources,  said  the agency became concerned about its phone and computer systems  nearly two years ago after a tip-off by the US Central  Intelligence Agency about Russian spy activity. The newspaper  said the decision to replace the phone and clean out the  computer system in the Australian Security Intelligence  Organsiation (ASIO) was linked the arrest in June 1993 of an  ASIO agent and the secret expulsion of six Russian agents in the  last half of 1993. The newspaper reported that the cost of  replacing the systems would be absorbed within the extra eight  million dollars which the ASIO received in its annual funding in  the last Australian budget. ASIO got funding raised from 47  million Australian dollars (31 million US) to nearly 55 million  dollars.    No immediate comment could be obtained on the SYDNEY MORNING  HERALD's report.</p>

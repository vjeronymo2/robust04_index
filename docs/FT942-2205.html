			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Egypt strong enough to say no to IMF: Reform success allows Cairo to resist devaluation pressure The fact that Egypt and the International Monetary Fund are in disagreement  -this time with Cairo resisting IMF pressure to devalue - has a familiar ring to it. That Egypt is prepared to resist IMF recommendations out of self-confidence in its economic performance, however, is a more novel phenomenon. The differences surfaced last week, when Egypt admitted that IMF approval for the present stage of its economic reform programme faced a delay of up to six months and that devaluation was the point of contention. Cairo had otherwise hoped to win the Fund's approval by next month. That in turn was to trigger relief of about Dollars 5bn of external debt under a 1991 deal in which official Paris Club creditors said they would write off half Egypt's then Dollars 40bn debt if it successfully undertook IMF and World Bank reforms. Egypt has already enjoyed two tranches of debt relief under this agreement, having since 1991 undertaken 'remarkable and broad ranging reforms', in the words last week of Mr Ram Chopra, director of the World Bank's Middle East department. And senior Egyptian officials say they are confident of winning the third and final tranche by the year's end. But they will do it, they say, Egypt's rather than the Fund's way. From near bankruptcy in late 1990, Egypt has cut inflation by a third to less than 7 per cent, sliced its budget deficit from 18 per cent of gross domestic product to less than 2.6 per cent, and padded reserves from two weeks of import cover to more than 18 months. All this while liberalising trade and the banking and capital market sectors and streamlining and improving the tax system. Egypt has also defied tradition by holding the Egyptian pound stable at around EPounds 3.3 to the dollar for the past three years, underpinned by the introduction in 1992 of positive real interest rates for the first time in decades. This stability the government prizes as among its most cherished achievements, one which ministers say does more than anything to establish international confidence in the economy. But the IMF now believes Egypt can no longer afford the cost to its export competitiveness of an exchange rate it reckons may be 25 to 40 per cent overvalued. It believes equally that Egypt cannot sustain indefinitely the high real interest rates (three-month T-bills are at 12.2 per cent) without constraining growth. So the Fund is urging more flexibility on both counts. 'We will never devalue,' Mr Atef Obeid, the public sector minister, said flatly last week, describing such a move as 'destructive' and 'destabilising'. Chief among Egyptian officials' reasons, perhaps, is that they fear devaluation might jolt hard-won confidence in the currency and threaten both to halt healthy flows of hard currency - much of it in remittances from Egyptian workers - and to reverse the process of 'de-dollarisation' of the economy. Today just 23 per cent of broad money supply is held in dollars, against 57 per cent before the reforms. Mr Obeid agrees the pound has appreciated in real terms, but says only 'modestly'. The government also appears convinced that this overvaluation is correcting itself. Inflation, at 6.89 per cent year on year, is undercutting IMF targets and should fall further during the next few months, eroding the differential between Egypt's and its main trading partners' inflation rates  -a differential of roughly 3 percentage points. Officials suggest that the benefits to export competitiveness will not outweigh the potential threat to confidence. While a devaluation might directly improve the competitiveness of non-oil exports, recent rough and ready figures suggest they are already rising by an annual 14 per cent. The government claims, meanwhile, to be taking an axe to the forest of fees and charges facing Egypt's small export industries, which some estimates suggest can add 12 per cent to an exporter's costs. The government can also argue that non-oil exports bring in only about 15 per cent of Egypt's hard currency earnings, the bulk of which come from Suez Canal receipts, remittances and oil exports. Senior officials also suggest that a greater impediment to export growth than the exchange rate is the relative backwardness of Egyptian companies in export experience. 'Our entire economic policy is geared towards the tradeable sector,' says Mr Yousef Boutros Ghali, minister for international co-operation. 'But I deeply believe the issue of competitiveness lies in the technical competence of our exporters - this is what we need to worry about.' None of which provides much cheer for the IMF; neither for the numerous bankers and businessmen who have long sought a devaluation - to perhaps EPounds 3.8 or EPounds 4.00 to the dollar - and, perhaps more urgently, a relaxation and re-alignment of interest rates. All believe the future of Egypt's export sector - on which they also argue rests Egypt's economic future - depends on improving competitiveness. Officials do not appear to rule out a continued shaving of interest rates and perhaps slight slippage in the pound-dollar rate. But the government appears otherwise content that the main macro-economic variables are under control. The reforms are at last becoming, some ministers believe, 'irreversible'. There are signs in the last few months that growth has started to pick up after the depressing effects of the stabilisation programme. Indicators such as cement sales, holding companies' turnover, power consumption, rail freight and others point to growth of about 2 per cent. Bank credit to the public sector is up 21 per cent and to the private sector32 per cent. A recent lull in attacks by Islamic militants might also lift some gloom from the tourism industry. So the government will sit it out for the next five or six months and hope that inflation will fall further, exports will continue to grow and that by the end of the year, it will have been vindicated. 'The numbers will bear us out,' says a senior official.</p>

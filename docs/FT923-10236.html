			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (6) How green is Dearne Valley? - Pastoral landscape is simply a by-product of the decline of the mining industry IT IS almost dark, on a hot, sultry July night. Along little country lanes, flanked by stone-built houses garlanded with roses, small groups of people are sipping beer outside country pubs. Can this really be the Dearne Valley, one of the UK's most devastated, de-industrialised heartlands, a national unemployment blackspot suffering from severe economic, environmental and social problems? By day, admittedly, parts of the valley - such as the blackened, despoiled Wath Manvers site, reputedly the UK's largest single area of dereliction - look pretty grim. But the slide back into a greener, almost pastoral landscape - noticeable on such symbolic tracts of land as the site of the former Cortonwood colliery, flashpoint of the 1984-1985 miners' strike - is one of the by-products of the rundown of an industry which, in the last century, precipitated the growth of the Valley's towns and villages, today home to 80,000 people. The Dearne Valley, 20 square miles of what was the heart of the South Yorkshire coalfield between Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster, epitomises the problems and possibilities of the many communities in Britain where a now vanishing mining industry shaped everyone's life. Given the dearth of alternative employment in the valley - especially for men - many local people would not surprisingly prefer coal mining to greenery. Local politicians such as Mr Hedley Salt, leader of Barnsley borough council and chairman of the national Coalfield Communities Campaign, believe the decimation of Britain's mining industry and consequent sterilisation of reserves is criminally shortsighted. But he and his colleagues have also concluded that, in areas where that battle has been lost, their top priority must be economic diversification, environmental upgrading and educational and community development. This pragmatism has paid dividends; Barnsley is the only local authority to have won the government's Pounds 37.5m City Challenge funding twice over: first last year, as part of the Dearne Valley Partnership, with Doncaster and Rotherham Councils; and this month, for Barnsley's north-east corridor. A strong spirit of partnership with the private sector and the local community was an important factor. Coal mining in the Barnsley area, where the seams outcropped conveniently near the surface, dates back to the middle ages, but its rapid expansion, creating swift growth of the town and its surrounding villages, came in the last century. A few pits sunk in Victorian times, such as Houghton Main and Grimethorpe, two of just three surviving collieries in Barnsley borough, cling on. But their days are numbered: Mr Salt gives these two and Edwardian Goldthorpe, the borough's other pit - and also the last in Dearne Valley - only five years. In the past decade, about 30,000 mining jobs have been lost from Barnsley and the Dearne Valley; some of the area's remaining miners now commute up to 70 miles a day to the Selby complex. Many who took redundancy have learned to their cost the difficulty of finding other work. The Dearne Valley's problems are exacerbated by poor communications; traditionally, coal was moved by rail and collieries were in walking and cycling distance of home. Construction of link road from the M1 to the A1, now under way, has been a top priority. In a bold move to change the valley's culture, as well as its appearance, the partnership has selected Sheffield University to produce a development plan for a Pounds 100m university college, to be built on the Wath Manvers site where four collieries, until a few years ago, disgorged their coal and spoil. The concept of a university on the doorstep is a big change in an area where the Coal Board was a cradle-to-grave employer, and school staying-on rates were low. But change is already in the air around Barnsley and not only in the greening of its environment. The council proudly promotes its track record of inward investment, including Japanese roller bearings makers Koyo Seiko, and talks of building a new enterprise culture. There are more subtle changes too; Mr Salt, quite unprompted, apologises for using the word manpower. 'It's not sexist,' he explains, 'Because it was men who worked in the mines.' That too, underlines the area's revolution; male employees in the Dearne Valley are now in a minority. In 1984 the Yorkshire coalfield had 53 pits employing 52,000 men: now it employs 14,596 at 21 collieries, mainly grouped around the North Yorkshire/West Yorkshire border, in the Barnsley/Rotherham/Doncaster axis and just over the county boundary in Nottinghamshire. According to the widely-leaked Rothschild report only 14 pits, seven of them in Yorkshire, would be fit for privatisation. On this basis, the Yorkshire coalfield would shrink to a few isolated collieries, plus parts of the Pounds 1.4bn Selby complex, which now produces British Coal's cheapest deep mined coal. Whether or not privatisation reduces the industry to such a small rump, more Yorkshire collieries are certain to close as British Coal fights to reduce its costs in order to compete against cheap imported coal and the new generation of gas-fired stations. North Sea gas is a threat; new combined cycle gas turbine stations are being built by both National Power and PowerGen at Killingholme, south Humberside. These plants are among eight large gas-fired stations proposed for the area between the Humber estuary and the Wash. Plans for a big new coal import terminal at Immingham, also South Humberside, were shelved before the general election but could still be revived, as National Power and Powergen, which currently buy 80 per cent of British Coal's output, have yet to conclude negotiations over its supplies to them after the present contract expires next March. The Pounds 700m flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) project at the Drax power station, which with Eggborough station takes the Selby pits' entire output, is vital to coal's credibility as a suitable fuel for a more environmentally aware age; the project will cut emissions of sulphur dioxide, a critical element in acid rain, by 90 per cent. The first two FGD units will begin operating next year at Drax, Western Europe's biggest power station; the other four will be phased in up to 1996. At Selby, whose five deep mines came into production between 1983 and 1991, output reached 9m tonnes in 1991-1992. The complex, intended to produce around 10m tonnes annually for more than 25 years, has struggled with geological problems but in 1991/2 achieved 9m tonnes output. Yet, even so, a nasty shock came earlier this year when British Coal announced 190 job cuts. North Yorkshire County council is pressing the European Commission to make its RECHAR and Objective II aid programmes available to Selby, to counter employment decline in mining and electricity generation. It is also lobbying for the Selby/Goole/Castleford/Pontefract area, which straddles three county boundaries, to get UK government assisted area status. All this can only heighten the stiff competition for new investment between areas which share a common problem. But Mr Salt refuses to be downhearted. 'It's not very many local government politicians who ever have the chance to reshape their own community. With the collapse of the mining industry, we have that opportunity. We're grasping it with both hands.'</p>

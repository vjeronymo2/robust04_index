			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 7 (XINHUA) -- China's reform of its  labor employment system is pounding at lifelong-employment which  was practised for decades, and opening a channel for enterprises  to shift their operational mechanism.    In Shanghai, China's largest economic center, it is now  common for both staff and workers to get their jobs through  competition.    According to the latest statistics, more than 1.6 million  employees, accounting for 97.53 percent of the total, at state  enterprises in Shanghai, are working under labor contracts in  different forms.    A municipal government official in charge of the reform said  that Shanghai began the reform of its labor employment system in  1992. Altogether 1,118 enterprises, accounting for 82.94 percent  of the total, are participating in the reform.    "Getting jobs through competition has given both enterprises  and employees more opportunities to choose each other," the  official noted.    The transactional volume of Shanghai's Farm Machinery  Company  and the Machinery and Electrical Appliance Import and Export  Company has been expanded by linking income to output.    The Shanghai No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant has drawn up a plan  to train its employees technically and widen their general  knowledge.    Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the  Chinese Government had carried out the "iron rice bowl" system  -- a term signifying commitment to secure employment and the  guarantee that the state would provide at least the basic  necessities for everyone.    The reform of the labor system in Shanghai, China's leading  industrial center, has cut 5.18 percent of the workforce from  the state-owned sector.    A survey shows that many of these people wanted to try the  market economy.    After leaving his former post, Zhang Miaoguo, a worker at a  large state enterprise in the Minhang District of suburban  Shanghai, found a job as a cleaner at the social service  department under the Shanghai Fuyu Quanye Development Company.    Although his job is dirtier than his former one, he earns  more than before.    After giving up her "iron rice bowl" post, Ye Aguo, a  47-year-old female worker is serving as a casual laborer in the  neighborhood and earns more than 300 yuan per month. She is  satisfied with her present work.    According to the municipal labor department, Shanghai will  focus on improving the social security setup to pave the way for  a more flexible labor market.</p>

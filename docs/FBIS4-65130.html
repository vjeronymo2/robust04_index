			<p>BFN     [Text] Swedish radio news has learned that Sweden will not  apply for a seat in the United Nations Security Council in 1995.  It says Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas will address the  Swedish parliament on Monday [16 May]. She is expected to say  that Sweden will not have enough support from the other member  countries because among other reasons it is going against  Germany and Italy. Sweden applied earlier in 1992, but lost out  to New Zealand.</p>

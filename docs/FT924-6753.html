			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovery flawed by lack of investors THE Nikkei average climbed 4.9 per cent in active trading on rumours that financial authorities were putting pressure on public fund managers to inject funds into the stock market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 785.36 higher at 16,778.84, after a high of 16,851.45 in the last minutes of trading. Having opened at the day's low of 16,011.33, it was led higher by banking shares in the morning. Volume rose to 350m shares from 194m. A total of 240m shares changed hands in the afternoon, bolstered by buying by public funds, arbitrageurs and investment trusts. Advances overwhelmed declines by 948 to 79 with 67 unchanged. All sectors gained ground and the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 49.88 to 1,271.21. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.44 to 1,023.70. The early buying fanned rumours that the ministry of finance had asked postal savings and public pension funds to commit funds to the stock market. While many market participants remained on the sidelines, investors who had sold short rushed to buy to cover their positions. Speculation that an agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition parties would be struck also helped sentiment to improve. But traders noted that the underlying economic factors had not changed and said there was little genuine buying by investors. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said: 'The rally was technical, mainly driven by heavy short-covering.' Public funds bought the electronics sector, which had been falling on earnings concerns. NEC rose Y32 to Y640, while Fujitsu gained Y24 to Y526. Bank shares, which had fallen on rumours of short-selling, also advanced. Industrial Bank of Japan added Y150 to Y2,380 and Mitsubishi Bank gained Y160 to Y2,190. Nippon Housing Loan, the troubled non-bank financial institution, rose Y47 to Y250. Dealers came back to trade speculative theme stocks. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y1,410, while SS Pharmaceutical gained Y100 to Y1,090. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 614.35 to 18,082.07 in volume of 28.8m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y340 to Y10,100. The company is likely to become the third largest earner among listed Japanese manufacturing companies this fiscal year, as its parent pre-tax profit is expected to surpass that of Matsushita Electronic Industrial. Roundup THE REGION was active and volatile in several markets, mainly on political rumours and concerns. HONG KONG nosedived 3.9 per cent on worries over Chinese criticism of governor Chris Patten's proposed democratic reforms. The Hang Seng index closed 240.19 lower at the day's low of 5,848.33 in turnover up from HKDollars 3.76bn to a busy HKDollars 4.14bn. There was a burst of selling by overseas institutions in late trading. Leading blue chips saw profit-taking, with HSBC Holdings tumbling HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 60 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 20.90. BOMBAY fell to a low for the 1992/93 financial year (April/March) as trading resumed after a four-day gap. The market was closed on Monday for settlement, and on Tuesday brokers boycotted trading in protest against registration fees imposed by Sebi, the new regulatory agency. The BSE index fell to 2,501.77 before recovering some ground to finish at 2,524.71, still down 61.97 from last Friday's close. Brokers blamed poor first-half company results, and the availability of several new equity and debenture issues on attractive terms. AUSTRALIA rose for the second consecutive day in its bounce from a 21-month low, the All Ordinaries index closing 10.1 higher at 1,375.1 in light turnover of ADollars 166.3m. ANZ rose 10 cents to ADollars 2.63 after reporting a ADollars 579m loss on Tuesday when it closed unchanged. Brokers said that today will be dominated by Westpac and National Australia results. Both gained 2 cents with Westpac closing at ADollars 2.62 and NAB at ADollars 6.90. NEW ZEALAND registered its highest close for seven weeks as strength in market leaders, particularly in Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey, took the NZSE-40 index up 15.94 to 1,434.91 in healthy turnover of NZDollars 25m. Telecom and CHH each rose 6 cents to Dollars 2.42 and Dollars 2.69 respectively. TAIWAN rose 2.1 per cent and saw its most active trading this month on rumours of overt government support for the market. Turnover more than doubled from TDollars 5.4bn to TDollars 11.5bn as the weighted index closed 76.39 higher at 3,660.10. The financial sector led with a gain of 3.6 per cent. SEOUL dropped on a government move to force Daewoo to merge two of its subsidiaries, and following the suicide last Sunday of a branch manager at a major bank. The composite index fell 10.17 to 621.25. MANILA slipped as electric power outages lasting seven hours hit local industries and spread gloom in the market. The composite index closed 9.07 lower at 1,315.16. SINGAPORE was led lower by key blue chips as investors continued to consolidate their positions after the recent gains. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 10.72 to 1,422.93 in volume of 87.05m shares against 111.18m.</p>

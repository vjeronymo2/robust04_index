			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Scottish companies seek telecom licences THE TWO Scottish electricity companies have become the first UK electricity companies to apply for licences to enter the telecommunications market and compete with BT and Mercury. Yesterday ScottishPower said it intended to begin by providing leased circuits for business customers, but would eventually offer telecommunications services to residential users. It has applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for a licence. It emerged yesterday that Scottish Hydro-Electric, which operates in northern Scotland, made an application a few weeks ago. No other electricity utility appears on the latest register of companies applying for telecommunications licences maintained by Oftel, the industry regulator, but others are expected to apply. Last year the government opened the UK telecommunications market to competition, encouraging utilities and other companies to apply for licences. ScottishPower, like other electricity companies, already has a large telecommunications network using packet switching and digital-data transmission between power stations and control rooms. It also has access to customers' premises through its electricity supply cables. The ducts through which these cables run can carry optical-fibre telecommunications cables without suffering electrical interference. ScottishPower intends to expand its telecommunications network and connect it to the premises of companies which wish to use its service. It will initially offer companies leased circuits for internal communications between sites. Mr Hugh Wilson, ScottishPower's telecommunications business manager who recently joined the company from BT, said it hoped to expand across the UK and overseas through links with other utilities. He said ScottishPower had already had discussions with other regional electricity companies. He would not say how much ScottishPower intended to invest in its telecommunications venture, but acknowledged that it would take hundreds of millions of pounds over a long period to make an impact. Hydro-Electric said it had applied for a licence within the last month but did not wish to comment further. For either company to offer a comprehensive service in Scotland would require them to co-operate and use the telecommunications links which already exist between them. PowerGen said it was not applying for a licence because, unlike the regional electricity companies and integrated utilities, it did not have connections to customers' premises. So far seven telecommunications companies have been granted licences by the DTI to operate services.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, which  have been considering plans for a recombination of parties in  the coalition alliance on the condition of fielding the Liberal  Democratic Party's [LDP] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime  minister and former foreign minister, for the prime  ministership, are now being pressed to reconsider their  strategies. Watanabe has shown a willingness to join hands with  Shinseito and Komeito, but in such a case, the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] are certain to  withdraw from the coalition alliance. Even if Watanabe were to  bolt from the LDP, it would not be easy to fill the hole that  would be left in the coalition alliance should the SDPJ and  other groups leave the alliance. Shinseito and Komeito would  then find themselves barred from carrying out their crucial task  of forming a majority group. Apparently, the two parties have  thus taken a "two-pronged approach": considering plans to  maintain the framework of the current alliance with the SDPJ and  other groups while flashing the "Watanabe negotiating card."    Initially, Shinseito planned to join "Reform" [Kaikaku], a  new lower house parliamentary group formed by the Japan New  Party [JNP] together with Komeito; the "Kaikaku-no-Kai"  [parliamentary group formed by Takeo Nishioka and others who  recently broke away from the LDP], and a group of lower house  members from the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan [DSP] who  are close to DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa. Shinseito  then planned to form a grand parliamentary alliance of 170-180  members, making it the largest ruling coalition parliamentary  bloc. It then planned to use this as a backdrop in a strategy  to join hands with Watanabe and his supporters.    However, plans to form a majority group among the ruling  coalition parties have not been proceeding as well as expected  because, among other reasons, the formation of the "Kaikaku" has  triggered a split in Hosokawa's own front yard, the JNP. On top  of this, the assumption that "the SDPJ would never form an  alliance with the LDP" (as stated by a senior Komeito official)  turned out to be incorrect. With the emergence of a possible  alliance between Sakigake, the SDPJ, and the LDP, from which  Watanabe is expected to have defected, there has emerged the  possibility that the Shinseito-led group may fall back into a  minority.    On the afternoon of 10 April, rumors of an  "LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake" alliance caused mixed reactions among  Shinseito members. Some senior party officials suggested that  the party place priority on maintaining the current coalition  alliance and attend a party leadership meeting proposed by SDPJ  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in order to ease resistance against  the so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" formed by Shinseito Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa. Ozawa, however, rejected the leadership meeting, in  insisting on launching a frontal assault. As for the meeting  between Murayama and three other party leaders, Ozawa openly  demonstrated his displeasure, saying: "Only half (of the ruling  coalition party leaders) will be there. It will be nothing more  than a private gathering." Another senior party official feels  that should the "LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake" alliance plan proceed  further, "there eventually will be a split in both the LDP and  the SDPJ." A group of Shinseito members close to Ozawa has been  contacting Watanabe behind the scenes, while a group of junior  party members has been contacting the LDP's  proelectoral-reformists who are close to former Prime Minister  Toshiki Kaifu.    While such maneuverings are going on, Shinseito is also  considering plans to maintain the framework of the current  coalition alliance and to successfully field "Tsutomu Hata as  the new prime minister." The party considers this as the "last  point of compromise." In this case, however, it is certain that  the SDPJ and other groups will demand that there be no more  instances of "Ichi- Ichi line"-initiated steering of the  government. A top DSP official has even insisted, "Ozawa and  Ichikawa should be placed on their good behavior." In case  agreement cannot be reached among the ruling coalition parties  to choose Hata as Hosokawa's successor, there also remains the  possibility that Murayama and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura may be fielded for the prime minister's post. Thus,  Shinseito is on the verge of having to choose between going  ahead with its plan to form a majority group or succumbing to a  "compromise."</p>

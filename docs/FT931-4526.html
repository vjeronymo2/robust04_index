			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Greeks queue to file tax returns in Athens LONG queues at Inland Revenue offices around Athens are the first indication that the Greek government's efforts to reduce tax evasion may be having an effect. The Finance Ministry is optimistic that its television campaign, exhorting Greeks to 'make a new start' by filing a tax return, will produce a 15 per cent rise in the number of income declarations received by Friday's deadline. Recession and the launch of the single market has affected revenue collection in recent months, with VAT receipts showing a sharp decline. However, Greece faces much bigger problems in trying to restrain an underground economy that may have doubled in size over the past decade, and reversing a widely held belief that no intelligent citizen pays more than a minimum of tax. 'One of the main reasons revenues are behind just now is because, under single market rules, VAT is no longer collected at customs but when goods are sold,' according to Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister. 'That's less worrying than the very large degree of tax evasion. The black economy is anywhere between 35 and 50 per cent of the real economy. That's a huge amount of money going untapped.' Cuts in the levels of corporation tax and income tax, introduced when the fiscal system was overhauled last year, appear to have made little impact on attitudes. A recent Finance Ministry check of credit card receipts on the island of Santorini, a popular tourist destination, revealed that shopkeepers were declaring only 8.5 per cent of transactions. It was followed by a sample cross-checking of company returns, which resulted in about 25,000 businesses being asked to file a supplementary tax declaration. Computerisation is under way, but it will be some time before automatic cross-checking can be widely applied. Meanwhile, tax officials are being offered an incentive to press for payment of tax arrears: a share of the receipts.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Observer: BP Oil surplus Sounds like BP chairman Bob Horton is living up to his axeman image. One of his first acts on taking over the controls of Standard Oil in 1986 was to cancel plans to install a 48-foot tall pink and maroon Claes Oldenburg sculpture outside Standard's Cleveland headquarters. To Horton it looked too much like a rubber stamp and, deary me, that was not the sort of message he wanted to project. Now Observer hears that the highlight of the BP oil sculpture exhibition in 1990 - opened by the then arts minister David Mellor  - has been made redundant. A specially commissioned two ton cube sculpture by Nigel Hall which was supposed to go outside BP Oil's new headquarters has to be found a new resting place. Times are tough at BP and the company seems far more anxious to promote itself as a lean, mean money machine rather than an over-generous patron of the arts. Offers over Pounds 50,000, please, to Bob Horton, Britannic House, 1 Finsbury Circus, London EC2.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Marudai seeks to boost ratio of cross-holdings MARUDAI FOOD, a Japanese food processing company, said yesterday it would raise its ratio of cross-shareholdings by encouraging banks and insurance companies to raise their exposure in return for lifting its own stakes in some of the financial institutions involved. The move comes at a time when many Japanese companies are reducing such links. Japan's cross-shareholding system has been under pressure following the collapse of stock prices and the slowing of the economy. A fall in bank share prices in recent months was blamed on a weakening of that system as troubled industrial companies cashed in long-term holdings. Marudai plans to lift its ratio of stable shareholders from the present 55.3 per cent to around 60 per cent. 'We think it will help us increase profits. If there was not a good financial reason, we would not have this plan,' the company said. Marudai is likely to strengthen links with Sumitomo group companies which together already hold about 18 per cent of its shares. One characteristic of the recent weakening of share links has been that some companies on the fringe of the large corporate families have decided that at present the cost of the connection outweighs the benefits. Other companies have chosen to identify themselves more closely with the large families, hoping to bolster their share price and to encourage other group companies to broaden business ties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Miguel Gonzalez] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Eurocorps should speak English,  even though it has no British or North American participation.  This is what Spanish officials think, and this is the view they  will argue in discussions about Spanish participation in  Eurocorps, the embryo of the future armed branch of the European  Union. Talks will begin in February and are expected to conclude  by sometime this spring. Belgium for its part insists on equal  status for the Dutch language.    After 45 years of NATO, English is today the lingua franca  of  the armed forces, according to Spanish officials. A historical  paradox: Spain, the last country to join the Alliance, is acting  as the principal defender of the "Atlantic language." At this  point, language is the Eurocorps' biggest stumbling block.    Originally it was expected that the 50,000-person European  army corps initiated by President Francois Mitterrand and  Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Franco-German summit at La  Rochelle in May 1992 would have two official languages: those of  its two founders.    Belgium, which decided to join on 25 June, about the time it  assumed the EC presidency, demanded equal linguistic treatment  for Dutch, its other official language. "I can't imagine myself  having to go through an interpreter to give orders," warned  French General Francois Clerc, the Eurocorps chief of staff.    With Eurocorps threatening to become a tower of Babel,  agreement was reached on a formula that would be satisfactory to  the Belgians, preoccupied as they are with problems of internal  cohesion and estrangement between the francophone and Flemish  communities, but without, according to Spanish sources, putting  Dutch on the same footing as German or English. What it amounts  to is that orders will be translated into Dutch whenever they  must be translated into French or German--something that would  not occur under ordinary circumstances, since most of the  command structure is bilingual. Spain, less nationalistic in its  approach, is not demanding coequal status for Castilian and will  conform with normal usage respecting official acts and documents.  <H5>  Polyglot Soldiers </H5>   Spain has a different, less chauvinistic demand: It is  insisting English should be the working language, substitutable  for any of the other languages in daily operations. Spain  maintains that the other partners need to know only one foreign  language, while Spanish soldiers, working in proud isolation  until just a decade ago, are asked to be polyglot.    At least that is the demand being made on the 12 NCO's and  officers, one of them a general, who will be detailed by the  Spanish Army to the Eurocorps headquarters established on 5  November in Strasbourg (France). Modest in its pretensions,  Spain does not aspire to command Eurocorps, not even on a  rotating basis like General Helmut Willmann of Germany, though  perhaps Spain could fill a high-level position on the  headquarters staff.    After all, its contribution is less than those of its other  partners: a Spanish brigade (3,500 men), compared to the  division (10,000) contributed by each of the other three  countries. The government decided on 10 December that the unit  assigned to Eurocorps will remain in Spanish territory, leaving  Spain only for maneuvers or to carry out a mission.    The formula for transferring command of the unit, still  under  discussion, will have to be compatible with Spain's obligations  to NATO and with the accord reached in January 1993 between  Eurocorps and the Alliance. Under the accord, Eurocorps will be  placed under the allied command in case of conflict in Europe.</p>

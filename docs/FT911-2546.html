			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / German union chiefs reject calls for wage restraint GERMAN trade union leaders reacted angrily yesterday to suggestions that high wage rises were dampening economic prospects, as engineering workers prepared for widespread warning strikes today to back a 10 per cent pay claim. Germany's five leading economic research institutes, in their latest joint six-monthly report, said the level of wage settlements, at 6 to 7 per cent, jeopardised prospects for economic growth in 1992. The institutes, predicting a fall in this year's growth in west Germany to 2.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent last year, said the latest pay settlements would only be 'acceptable' if workers accepted much more moderate wage rises for 1992. Although the institutes' warning was given predicable backing by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, the German Trade Union Federation (DGB) rejected the report's conclusions. Mr Michael Geuenich, a member of the DGB board, said companies were still making 'excellent profits' and could therefore afford the level of settlements. The verbal flurry came on the eve of warning strikes called today for about100,000 workers in the engineering and electrical industries, following breakdown of pay talks with the IG Metall trade union. The strikes are expected to cause extensive disruption in the car industry, with plants of Volkswagen, Ford, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche all targeted. Employers have so far offered a pay rise of 4 per cent for nearly 4m workers covered by IG Metall. Sporadic strike action is expected to continue next week unless agreement is reached. The report from the five institutes also warned about the high level of wage rises in east Germany, where wage rates are 60 per cent above last year. The institutes' report drew attention to the worsening of Germany's internal and external finances caused by unification, forecasting that united Germany will show a small deficiton current account this year after a current account surplus of DM77bn (Pounds 25.7bn) for 1990. The Bundesbank last week criticised high wage rises in the east as holding back investment there. But Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall chairman, said lower wage rises would go into the pockets of employers in thewest rather into rebuilding east Germany.</p>

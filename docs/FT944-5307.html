			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Private View: A boy who was bitten by the Eurobug - Controversial German politician Karl Lamers talks to Christian Tyler about the origins of his proposals for the fast-track integration of Europe's hard core He is the bogeyman of the Eurosceptics. His is the name anti-federalists utter when they want to frighten the children. Karl Lamers has an appropriately wolfish look about him, with his craggy face and mouth full of teeth. But this German politician and thinker is more bitten than biting. Behind the teeth he is thoroughly civilised, humorous and human. Lamers is touring European capitals to defend and explain the controversial ideas contained in a recent policy paper he co-wrote on the future of the European Union. Its call for a 'hard core' group of states - Germany, France and the Benelux countries - to press ahead of the others with political and monetary union is considered not only pre-emptive, but shocking. For some British MPs, Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman of the German Christian Democrats, is a dangerous idealist living a federalist fantasy. Recently, a Tory MP snapped at him that it was 'ridiculous' to imagine that a housewife at her ironing-board in Athens would one day be listening to a Norwegian Eurobudget minister on the radio. Lamers looked patient. 'If we don't develop the union she might be hearing something much worse,' he said. The German MP claims that his views are shared by most mainstream German politicians. Was he then, I asked, playing stalking horse for the narrowly re-elected Chancellor, Helmut Kohl? He gave a lupine grin and changed metaphor: 'I am not some kind of U-boat. We (the authors of the paper) say very openly what we do and some people in the government are not very happy about it.' Are you telling home truths about Europe which governments are unable to tell? 'Ja, naturlich. If this had been an official government paper I would have been shocked.' So, I said, you are a missionary among the uncivilised natives of Europe. An idealist? Lamers relapsed into German. 'It is stupid to believe that one can live without ideas and without ideals. I don't regard it as negative if somebody thinks I have ideals. But I'd find it dangerous if they thought I only had ideals.' What experiences shaped your ideas? 'My father had a big influence even though he was buried on my ninth birthday. He was the victim of a bombing raid on Dusseldorf in November, 1944. Even so he had awakened in me a very strong interest in history. 'The second strong influence - maybe it's dangerous to mention this in Britain - was that I went to school with the Jesuits in Bad Godesberg for nine years. And the fathers really impressed me very much.' What did they teach you? 'Well, first of all they taught me how to think. Secondly, they taught me some philosophy. We had a very strict philosophy teacher, much feared, but outstanding. These fathers were all very European-minded and that made an impression on me.' So, of course, did Germany's plight after Hitler led it to defeat. 'I personally did not suffer from hunger,' Lamers reaclled, 'and we weren't bombed out. We didn't have to flee. I noticed that I was very lucky compared to my compatriots and Europe seemed a very natural and obvious continuation of my experience. 'I was lucky enough to be influenced only by people who felt no enmity. I think that was the biggest piece of luck. Neither at home nor anywhere else did people influence me against the British or the French or the Italians.' Lamers studied law and for many years was director of the Karl Arnold Foundation, a political academy in Bonn. In 1980, he reached the Bundestag, representing part of Wesel on the lower Rhine. He is married to a philosopher-novelist who is writing a book on Nietzsche. He likes gardening and thinks Schubert the greatest musical genius. I suggested he might not know the hearts of ordinary Europeans. Were they not turning against the grand European project? 'That is a problem for all politicians nowadays. Politics has become a full-time job. Of course I try to have contact with citizens in my constituency and wherever else I can. If I lack knowledge I try and make up for it. I try to put myself into the shoes of ordinary people. 'But I've often had the experience that people don't want to be bothered too much by politics either, that they expect the politicians to do their job and do it well. They don't want to be asked all the time.' (Lamers deplores the Swiss enthusiasm for referendums.) 'I am very impressed by Burke: you can't constantly be going back to the people.' Lamers comes from a part of Germany, the Rhineland, which was always cosmopolitan. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, before the rise of the nation state, the continent had been remarkably unified, he observed. They didn't have a bureaucracy in the Middle Ages, I said. 'That's true. But bureaucracy is a consequence of our way of life and of our way of doing business. 'Why do we have a European bureaucracy? Because we have a common European reality. The internal market didn't create this. It's only the institutional consequence of the fact that we already have this web of relations, this reality.' I asked Lamers why German politicians wanted integration so badly. The nation state was not the 'aim' of history, he explained - for history has no aim. Furthermore, it had proved a dangerous institution. 'Every state claimed to be the ultimate judge of its own affairs; and if the state didn't get what it thought was its right, it took it by force. Of course, we know what that led to in Europe.' Nation states might survive, but their sovereignty was already 'an empty shell'. Germany, finding itself in the middle of past conflicts, had tried to take control, with terrible results. Germany was again the strongest nation in Europe, and, following the collapse of communism, it was once more in the middle. So is Germany trying to save itself from itself? 'I know that theory. But no. It's not only a German problem, but a problem for everybody else as well.' You have talked about 'disastrous consequences' if the project fails. What are you talking about - war in Europe again? 'No. At least not within the European Union. But if we are incapable of contributing to peace in our neighbouring countries, that is a disaster. 'And, of course, such conflicts could arise more often, and could extend further than, for instance, the Yugoslav conflict.' Is it a problem if Germany develops what one might call a 'co-prosperity sphere' in central and eastern Europe? 'Naturally it's a problem. It's a problem already. Half the foreign trade of our eastern neighbours is with Germany. For Russia that's not a problem, but for Poland it is. The Poles don't really want to get back into the same sort of dependency. Especially they don't want to be an 'object' between Germany and Russia. 'In the end, we always come to the same conclusion. Germany appears to lose most from European integration, not only in the monetary field but others. But, in reality, we can gain most. At the same time we believe others will gain, because the difficulties caused by Germany's being central were also the difficulties of all its neighbours.' I said: It sounds an apocalyptic sort of justification for further developing something which, in historical terms, is already highly integrated. 'In historical terms, yes. But is it really sufficient for the present and the future? Compared with the past, of course, we have developed very far, incredibly far. But I don't think we have gone far enough.' Despite the outcome of the second world war, do you detect a kind of inferiority complex in the British and French leaders you talk to? 'If I thought that, then I wouldn't tell you. Because I would only make it worse. So please understand: I beg you not to make me say that sort of thing. I'm not saying it. 'What I do say - and I've already said it publicly in France - is that I want a strong France, a self-determining France. I also want a strong Britain and I don't want anybody to be afraid of Germany. Everything I do is determined by the need to destroy that sort of feeling, should it exist.' Are you afraid of Germany? 'No, no.' Or of certain developments inside Germany? 'Well, of course, I'm concerned about certain developments. If you're not, then you're blind.' Are you referring to racism? 'That, too. But I don't think it is a very big problem. The danger I see is that Germans will say 'Well, we are in a very comfortable situation, why should we work on continued European integration?' They don't have the vision to see the real interests of Germany. They become egoistic, self-ish. 'In Britain there are many who think - so I read in the papers - that we Germans are afraid of ourselves. But that's not the real reason. I am convinced that the Germans have learnt something from their history and I totally agree with my own people. 'I have absolutely no problem in being a German. Quite the contrary.'</p>

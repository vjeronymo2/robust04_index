			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / The town without pity: Congressional setbacks and a drumbeat of media criticism have made Bill Clinton appear vulnerable Is the Washington political establishment seriously down on Bill Clinton or, in its own way, merely testing him? If the former, are his current troubles comparable to those that eventually paralysed Jimmy Carter and, domestically, George Bush? If the latter, does he have the stuff to pass the exam? The questions have to be recognised because Washington, where comment is the staff of life, is asking them insistently. The rest of the country seems more patient with the new president but it is still plugged in to what comes out of the capital. It is possible to win the White House by running against Washington, as Messrs Carter, Reagan and Clinton demonstrated, and even easier to acquire popular cult status by keeping up the drumbeat of criticism, which is Ross Perot's modus operandi. But once installed, a president has got to come to terms with his new neighbours. He may seduce them, cow them, deal with them or even go over their heads - avoid them he cannot. The establishment itself is both easy and hard to define. Its clear component parts are the politicians, the media and the special interest lobbies. But all eat and drink from the central trough, which is the president and his government, and all have radically or subtly different agendas. At present there is no denying their collective appetite for Mr Clinton's flesh. The issues may be Bosnia, deficit reduction, still unannounced healthcare reform, gays in the military, campaign financing, federal land use, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and more; and they are drawing blood. For the first time, there has been a touch of petulance in the president's responses and an acceptance, in the recent White House staff reshuffle, that some of the criticisms had merit. It was no coincidence that the president chose to take his economic message, campaign-style, on the road for several days. It was equally predictable that he was promptly criticised for leaving the superheated Washington kitchen, just as he had been previously attacked for not getting out and about enough. Even commentators sympathetic to Mr Clinton have taken on a harder edge. Joe Klein of Newsweek, condemning his 'marshmallowly all-inclusive empathy', wrote: 'He has neutered the eternal political question - what's he for? - and raised a darker, more perverse, test of his leadership - what, if anything, is he against?' David Gergen of US News wrote: 'Friend and foe alike think he can be rolled. . . . He has a wonderful head and a big heart, but people are looking for more backbone.' This is most evident in Mr Clinton's relations with Congress, where politicians, more than ever, can no longer be defined simply by their party allegiance. The Republicans may have held together to block the economic stimulus package but desertions from Senator Bob Dole's fold enabled easier voter registration (the 'motor voter' bill) to pass and may allow campaign finance reform to get through. Some Republicans are nervous about being blamed for 'gridlock'. However, the adjustment after 12 years to a Democrat in the White House is proving harder for the president's own party. Their universal public catechism is that they want him to succeed, not least because if he fails they may go down too, but many have difficulty separating the general wood from their own favourite trees. In the House this week teeth have been bared by a group of fiscal conservatives led by Congressmen Charles Stenholm of Texas and Tim Penny of Minnesota, now strengthened by Congressman Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, a bosom friend of Mr Clinton until he was not rewarded with either the Defense Department or the CIA. Their beef is that the president's deficit reduction plan relies too much on revenue raising and not enough on spending cuts. Tom Foley, the speaker of the House, nursing a comfortable Democratic majority, can probably contain their opposition by cracking the whip. Mr Clinton helped by going to Capitol Hill this week. But the more independent-minded Senate is a tougher nut to crack, as witnessed on Thursday when David Boren, the Democrat from the oil state of Oklahoma and a key member of the finance committee that has a Democratic majority of only 11 to nine, joined John Danforth, the Missouri Republican, in proposing deeper spending cuts and fewer new taxes, including abandoning the BTU-based energy tax. Their plan probably cannot pass the Senate but their opposition makes more problematic and protracted the enactment of Mr Clinton's version of the package in most of its proposed form. The proliferation of special Democratic causes is also now pressing Mr Clinton. Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, a wily operator in defence of his state's oil and gas interests, will ride his other hobby horse, a value-added tax, for all it is worth, including siding with Messrs Boren and Danforth. Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Max Baucus of Montana have laid down clear markers on Nafta passage, as has Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, on renewing China's most-favoured-nation trading status. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, who chairs the important House ways and means committee, was more direct in simply eliminating the investment tax credit from the president's agenda (with no complaints from Mr Clinton because the committee approved a revenue bill broadly to his liking). Cross-party and regional coalitions are now a constant possibility, beyond the farm and oil-state assault on the energy tax. Westerners combined to frustrate Mr Clinton's plans to increase revenues from federal lands; high-tech states such as Texas want to preserve multi-billion-dollar prestige projects such as the super collider (a giant atom smasher) and the space station. None of this is new to Washington, though it now assumes particular intensity. Congress is also set in some of its other ways, seemingly oblivious to last year's electoral mandate for change. For example, much of the blame for the slowness in administration appointments does lie with the White House's relentless pursuit of diversity - but not all of it. The Senate was not shown in its best light this week when a routine session to confirm 16 nominees was endlessly delayed by special pleadings for potato farmers in Maine, a commuter trunk road in St Louis, and changes in the Treasury's family income statistics. Only half the nominees got the nod and the perception of business as usual, now captured by live cable television coverage, was reinforced. If the body politic is fretting, the media is even more fractious. Instant punditry is now the norm, no longer confined to the established columnists or notorious talk show hosts who became celebrities last year because the candidates all wanted to appear on their programmes. Every action by the president is deemed worthy of an absolute life-or-death verdict, as in some Roman amphitheatre. The sense of government and politics as a process is getting lost. Mr Clinton shares some blame for this phenomenon, because his chronic activism invites so many judgments. Also, unlike Presidents Reagan and Bush, both often inarticulate unless speaking from a script, his natural tendency, now slightly curbed, is to talk knowledgeably all around any given subject. This still delights many - Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, was quite bowled over by his recent Oval Office session - but it also may confuse the public as much as it enlightens. The Bosnian petard has been particularly illustrative. Having tried, like the grand old Duke of York, to march the American people and the allies up the hill of forceful intervention, his retreat, even if understandable, reinforces an impression of indecision. A common complaint, from press and politicians alike, is that support would be there if only the president explained what he was going to do and why. Some red-blooded pundits apart, this would probably extend to doing relatively little in the Balkans, barring some new wave of atrocities or threats to other countries. However, some of the media assaults seem less well-founded. This week's controversies over the sacking of the White House travel staff for non-competitive practices and sloppy bookkeeping and the circumstances of Mr Clinton's haircut on board Air Force One at Los Angeles Airport do not suggest a willingness to give the president a fair shake. But they do increase the perception that he is vulnerable. Explanations include a media sense that he got too easy a ride at the end (not the beginning) of last year's campaign; the media's piqued relations with the very young and workaholic White House staff; and a punchier and more herd-like brand of contemporary political journalism, which is now more of a blood sport and less of a contemplative occupation. In a sense, Mr Clinton's good start - the first budget bill passed, Boris Yeltsin succoured, fine speeches given - set him up for a fall, which the Washington establishment always enjoys facilitating. Even the capital's new star, Janet Reno, the attorney-general, is feeling this phenomenon. Having risen to staggering heights of popularity by the mere, but abnormal, act of 'taking responsibility' for the Waco denouement, she is now under fire for protecting those who gave her bad advice. 'Only in Washington,' said a tart column in the iconoclastic New Republic, 'would this make her a hero.' Observing the political and media fray is Washington's largest private-sector industry - the special interest lobbyists. They are vultures in the populist eye of Ross Perot and a target of Mr Clinton, who wants to take away some of their tax deductions. While it is far too facile to place all lobbyists in the hall of reactionary shame normally reserved for the National Rifle Association, it is dangerous to ignore their power. Their influence in Oklahoma on Senator Boren was palpable. One such clash of the lobbying titans already endangers healthcare reform even before its unveiling. Abortion rights advocates are demanding that national health insurance cover be provided to all reproductive services while the right-to-life forces are threatening to scuttle the whole package if a single cent is spent to reimburse abortions. Totally lost in the passionate wash is the reality that only a minute share of national healthcare costs, which everybody accept must be curtailed, are accounted for by abortions. It has always been said of Mr Clinton that he is a fast learner. It was true in last year's campaign and was certainly the case over 12 years as governor of Arkansas, especially after a hyperactive first term ended in defeat. But the campaign and Little Rock were the minor leagues. In Washington, he is seriously expected to be the boss, using whatever tactics work, and the first year is when that essence of leadership needs to be shown. In short, he needs to win 'a big one' - and soon.</p>

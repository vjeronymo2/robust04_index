			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS LEADERS MUST DO MUCH MORE THAN LAMENT THE EDUCATIONAL CRISIS IN  AMERICA  </P> <P> Flanigan and all other critics of the public schools must remember that schools  are a reflection of society.  </P> <P> As long as we seek instant gratification and instant wealth, there will be a  problem with education. Generations laughed at the Protestant work ethic, and  now we have a generation that values neither work nor ethics. When this  changes, education will improve.  </P> <P> IRENE WILLINGHAM  </P> <P> Sun Valley  </P></p>

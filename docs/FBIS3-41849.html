			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]    Our party and the Republic Government put forward the  10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for  national reunification through the united national strength last  year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program.    Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow  countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by  transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and  to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who  has the long history of half a century.    We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the  road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our  10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country. We also took the important measure  for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders.  However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our  magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for  reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon  foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have  taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to  national unity.    While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises  against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and  talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an  international cooperation system under the pretext of our  nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading  North-South relations to a dangerous phase.    The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in  appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from  the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and  fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The  South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and  national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean  people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer  have any further expectations of the current South Korean  regime. This is natural.    If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and  its followers are babbling about, it is because of the  antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States  has persistently sought.    It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear  issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula  in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S.  talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United  States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and  may drive the situation to a deadlock. The United States should  look straight at all facts and act with discretion.    Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint  statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement  the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved.    There is no change in the principle and line of our party  and  the Republic Government for national reunification. We will  make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means  of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems,  and two governments according to the three-point principles of  independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national  unity.

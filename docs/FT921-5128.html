			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Tractor makers told to halt information exchange THE EUROPEAN Commission yes-terday ordered several leading tractor makers to stop sharing sensitive information on sales in the UK, alleging this collusion had helped the companies solidify a share of about 88 per cent of the British market. Four big tractor companies - Ford New Holland, John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Case International - and four with smaller operations in the UK - Fiat Agri, Renault, Lamborghini and Deutz of Germany - have been sharing business information since 1975 through a computer network. Some manufacturers last night acknowledged that information on the registration of vehicles was being exchanged through a third party, but denied that the information swap involved pricing details. Renault, the French state-owned vehicle producer, said it regretted the Brussels move. It added that information had only been exchanged to help identify the scale and nature of a difficult market. The commission has ordered manufacturers to scrap the system or scale it down so it does not interfere with free competition. It decided not to impose a fine as it judged that the information-sharing did not amount to a fully-fledged cartel. Brussels said the tractor makers were effectively eliminating competition. 'You can't exchange company-specific figures,' said the commission, adding that these 'should be secrets which help companies compete, even to lead each other up the garden path'. Members of the information exchange would also be in a position to act to exclude outsiders, the commission feared. The commission's move followed a long inquiry, and took account of the fact that the UK tractor market is declining, relatively small, and highly concentrated. Since the inquiry started, Ford New Holland has merged with Fiat Agri. In certain types of tractors sold in the UK there were only three or four suppliers, and no significant imports from outside the EC. The commission said the oligopolistic structure of this market contrasted with that of the UK car market, where prices were generally above those on the Continent, but which was subject to considerable pressure from Japanese imports. Yesterday's decision carried no implications for the UK car market, the commission said.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Norwegian vote lacks support Norway's minority Labour government yesterday escaped a vote of no confidence after the opposition Conservative and right-wing Progress parties failed to gain majority backing in parliament for the proposal, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo. The proposed vote was aimed at toppling Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, the finance minister, for his handling of the Uni Storebrand affair, in which the company, Norway's biggest insurer, last year collapsed under the weight of its short-term debt used to finance a failed raid on Skandia Forsakrings, its Swedish rival.</p>

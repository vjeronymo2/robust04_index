			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Stamp duty Measures to counter avoidance of stamp duty are included in the Budget. The duty on sales will apply to exchanges of interest in land or buildings for another, and transfers of land or buildings in return for other property will be liable to stamp duty whatever the nature of the property offered in payment. These provisions will apply to documents executed on or after December 8 1993, unless the document implements a contract made before today. Where the price payable on a sale or lease (or for the assignment of a lease) cannot be determined at the time the document is executed, duty will be payable on the open market value of the property transferred. This new rule will apply to documents executed on or after December 8 1993. A similar rule will apply where the rent payable under a lease cannot be determined.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WINDS AID EFFORT TO KEEP OIL FROM HITTING COASTLINE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: TWO-MILE-LONG SLICK FROM TANKER SPILL THREATENS ORANGE COUNTY  BEACHES AND PRIME WILDLIFE HABITATS. CLEANUP WORK FOCUSES ON SCOOPING UP CRUDE.  </P> <P> Winds kept a two-mile-long slick of Alaskan crude oil from washing ashore  Thursday, raising hopes that the 300,000-gallon spill -- the worst in Southern  California in two decades -- can be cleaned up before seriously damaging a  prized wildlife sancutary and miles of prime Orange County shoreline,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "We have been extremely lucky," said Peter Bontadelli, director of the state  Department of Fish and Game. "The good weather and offshore breezes have saved  us thus far. The oil has not hit the beaches."  </P> <P> As scores of anxious environmentalists, local officials and state experts  monitored its movement, the purplish slick -- about 2 miles long and 4 miles  wide -- drifted several miles off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Officials said it was too large to encircle with a boom, so clean up efforts  focused on scooping up the light crude from the damaged tanker, American  Trader.  </P> <P> Federal officials had initially ruled out using chemical dispersants because of  their toxic nature. But Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard was seeking permission  from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Fish  and Game to employ dispersants to break up the slick.  </P> <P> Investigators zeroed in on one of the ship's anchors as the apparent cause of  the 7,000-barrel spill late Wednesday afternoon in relatively shallow coastal  waters. The 21-year-old tanker attempted to moor offshore when the portside  anchor apparently punctured the single-hulled vessel, the ship's owner said.  </P> <P> Thousands of gallons of oil poured through a 3-foot gash before emergency teams  halted the leak early Thursday. The tanker, in a routine maneuver, was  preparing to unload its cargo of crude through underwater pipelines leading to  a Santa Fe Springs refinery.  </P> <P> The anchor theory was supported by Coast Guard officials. "It's very likely the  anchor," said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Dewell. "Our investigators have have  seen the damage to the anchor." Another Coast Guard officer said: "The anchor  is now bent like a banana."  </P> <P> Owners of the tanker, American Trading Transportation Co. of New York, deployed  divers to asess the extent of damage to the ship.  </P> <P> Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost, Jr., who flew to the scene from Washington  on Thursday, said there is a good chance that virtually all of the spilled oil  will be removed before it can wash ashore if the weather holds. "I can't tell  you what percentage will come ashore, but we hope none," Yost told reporters  gathered near the historic Huntington Beach pier.  </P> <P> A stream of local and state politicans descended on Huntington Beach Thursday,  staging a series of press conferences to voice support for clean up efforts and  raise questions about oil drilling and tanker movement in Southern California  coastal waters.  </P> <P> "I hope this oil spill sends a strong message to Sacramento and Washington,"  Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said at a morning press conference on the beach  overlooking the spill. "It was just pure dumb luck we didn't have a tragedy. We  shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security."  </P> <P> In Washington, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said he would meet  with President Bush to brief him on the incident, adding that the oil company  and owners of the tanker expressed their "commitment to me" to help in cleaning  up the oil.  </P> <P> As the spill clean-up moved into its second day, protests from offshore oil  drilling opponents grew.  </P> <P> The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization, said  little comfort could be taken in the fact that the spill had remained offshore  or that clean up operations were under way.  </P> <P> "Even though the flow of oil has been stopped, the ability of the oil industry  and the government to clean up the 300,000 gallons that were spilled into the  Pacific Ocean is pathetic," the NRDC said in a statement.  </P> <P> Lynne Edgerton, with the NRDC's Los Angeles office, said, "The spreading slick  from the impaled American Trader presents an imminent threat to the  ecologically important wetlands of Bolsa Chica, Anaheim Bay, and Upper Newport,  some of the healthiest wetlands left in Southern California."  </P> <P> Despite the warnings, officials said that so far the environmental impact has  been remarkably minimal from the spill, the worst since the catastrophic 1969  Santa Barbara spill when 3.2 million gallons of crude fouled beaches for months  and killed thousands of shore birds.  </P> <P> "We got lucky, it could have been a lot worse," said biologist Victor Leipzig,  executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, a grassroots environmental  group.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach officials, who declared a state of emergency and planned to  meet Thursday night to map out clean up stratgies should the oil wash ashore,  kept their fingers crossed that their shoreline would be spared major damage.  </P> <P> "We've been dodging bullets for 24 hours," City Councilman Jim Silva said.  "This is one of the most popular beaches in California. It would be a shame if  we lost it."  </P> <P> About a dozen oil-coated birds were rescued Thursday by volunteers and  biologists, who set up a command post and wildlife treatment center on the sand  south of the Huntington pier. In all, 25 oil-covered birds have reportedly been  recovered, of which eight have died.  </P> <P> Fear persisted, however, that the oil would wreck environmental havoc if and  when it reaches shore.  </P> <P> "Clearly if the wind and currents shift and it starts moving in, we're going to  have what we always said -- significant shoreline impacts," said Brian Baird,  an oil spill expert with the California Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Fish and game chief Bontadelli said that if the oil hits the Bolsa Chica  wetlands, upper Newport Harbor and the mouth of the Santa Ana River it will  take 2 1/2 years for the ecosystem to recover. The Bolsa Chica wetlands, the  focus of intense battles between environmentalists and develoeprs, is home to  dozens of bird species including the Light-footed Clapper Rails and Lest terns,  both endangered species.  </P> <P> "The wetlands are the key to all marine life as well as shore birds and  wintering water fowl," Bontadelli said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, British Petroleum confirmed Thursday that the spilled oil was  Alaskan North Slope oil, the same oil that bled from the Exxon Valdez last  March.  </P> <P> However, California's warmer climate may cause the oil to evaporate sooner than  it did in Alaska's Prince William Sound, as well as appear lighter in color.  </P> <P> "With warmer water temperatures, the (more volatile components of the oil)  would (evaporate) quicker," said Charles Webster, BP's manager of crisis  management.  </P> <P> "As far as the persistence of what's left, it's probably not a great deal  different (from Valdez) except it might remain more liquid than it would if it  were in an extremely cold climate," Webster said.  </P> <P> A federal emergency response team considered attempting to clean up the oil by  using chemical dispersants or setting the oil slick on fire. But both options  were ruled out after reviewing the scene, said Kathleen Shimmin of the EPA.  Both ideas were abandoned because of health concerns.  </P> <P> "It's too close to land," Shimmin said. "We would never consider using  dispersement if mechanical cleanup is working, and in this case it's working .  . . We'd use putting toxic chemicals into the environment and posing a  potential hazard to the wildlife to clean up a spill as a last step."  </P> <P> The use of chemical dispersants is controversial because they are toxic to  marine life and because their effectiveness is uneven, according to the  National Academy of Sciences. State fish and game officials said that if  dispersants are used, it would like injury snails, halibut and other  bottow-dwelling creatures. It could also fish larvae in the spill area.  </P> <P> "That's the trade off for not hitting sensitive coastal areas," said fish and  game spokesman Curt Taucher.  </P> <P> Ecological experts and environmentalists who visited the scene said the oil  slick threatens to sicken or kill species all through the aquatic food chain --  from the microspic plankton that float in fresh water, through mussels and  anchiovies and sardines, up to sea lions whose fur can be matted by the crude  oil, leaving them vulnerable to the cold.  </P> <P> Clean up efforts centered around several large skimming vessels that attempted  to scoop up the oil. Booms were placed around the front of the tanker to  contain spilled oil near the hole in the hull, but the size of the larger slick  made the use of skimmers necessary.  </P> <P> Although the cause of the spill is still under investigation, the ship's owner  said that alcohol tests performed on the tanker's skipper initially appear to  be "negative." The results will not be complete, however, for at least two  days.  </P> <P> Mike Murphy, vice president of American Trading, said the company considers the  tanker's skipper Robert La Ware "an able and experienced seaman."  </P> <P> "He has been with our company 30 years and he's an extremely experienced master  on the West Coast," Murphy told reporters. "He has put this ship and many  others on moorings many, many times."  </P> <P> Shortly after dawn today, about 150 gawkers and volunteers gathered near the  Huntington Beach pier to watch the idle tanker offshore and look for oil on the  beach.  </P> <P> "I have lived in Huntington Beach all my life," said Sam Cracchiolo. "But never  in a million years did I think this would happen here."  </P> <P> Residents as far inland as two miles said they could smell the crude. Police  dispatchers said they received several dozen calls from concerned residents.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Ted Lempert, chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Spill  Prevention, said that the American Trader's ruptured tanks contained about  20,000 barrels of crude and about 6,000 barrels were lost.  </P> <P> "The amount of oil spilled from the American Trader is about 3% of what was  spilled in the Exxon Valdez tragedy," Lempert said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> About 50 members of the Screen Extras Guild picketed Monday outside Universal  Studios to protest the use of non-union extras in the Warren Beatty film, "Dick  Tracy." The pickets began their protest outside a studio gate on Barham  Boulevard last week, when production on the Beatty feature got under way, said  a union organizer, Jerome Blackwell. "We will continue for each day they  shoot," Blackwell said. "As long as we (picket), they will be slowed at least  20 minutes a day." Blackwell estimated the "Dick Tracy" production schedule  will mean jobs for non-union extras for the next 80 days. Neither Beatty nor  Barry Osborne, the film's executive producer, was immediately available for  comment. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: CIS initiative merits support Sir, John Lloyd argues ('Mr Absent without leave', February 19) that the closer economic relations now being forged between several republics of the former Soviet Union may reflect either 'a neo-imperialist impulse' on the part of Russia, or 'an eastern version of the European Community'. No doubt the motivation of some Russians comes under the first heading, but it would be wrong to condemn all such moves towards closer integration. Last week I was in Minsk (Belarus) on a European Commission technical assistance mission and attended the inaugural meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States' council of anti-monopoly committees, which aims to co-ordinate competition policy and law across the territories of the 12 CIS members. In many CIS countries the anti-monopoly committee is almost the only organ of government actively pursuing market-oriented reform policies and each hopes to gain moral and practical support from the others. In time, this council could develop into a supranational competition authority similar to DG1V of the European Commission, which is an important part of the glue which holds the EU together. Of course, Russia dominates the CIS economically to a far greater extent than any one economy dominates the EU, and the first chairman of the council will be a Russian. Nonetheless, his term is only for two years and each country will have equal representation at council meetings. It is also significant that the CIS secretariat is based in Minsk, not Moscow: the Belarussians see the city developing into the Brussels of the east. Western agencies are already supporting the work of individual anti-monopoly committees, but there seems a good case for technical assistance to this CIS-wide initiative as well. More generally, effective reform would be advanced if the west made at least a rudimentary application of competition policy a condition for financial assistance.

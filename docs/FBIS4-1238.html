			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Johannesburg Blast `Last-Ditch Attempt by Fanatics' --  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 April in a page-10  editorial says the 24 April bomb blast in the center of  Johannesburg has "shaken the fledgling mood of marvelous  optimism that swept South Africa after the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] breakthrough: we have reason to curse the brutal,  ignorant criminals responsible for the outrage." "This bomb was  another last-ditch attempt by fanatics to sabotage the  transition the overwhelming majority of South Africans is  committed to. It might not be the last act of terror in this  period, but it does not signal the civil war or uprising that  the doomsday prophets predicted for our moment of great change.  The election is going ahead, miraculously, with the  participation of all the most significant political parties in  our country. This is an achievement of which the world is in  awe: we have to keep our heads, and to see it through to  completion."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   New Style of Opposition Required -- Johannesburg BUSINESS  DAY  in English on 25 April declares in a page-16 editorial that the  Democratic Party (DP) "has the vision required for opposition"  role in the new South Africa. "Unlike the ANC, NP [National  Party] and Inkatha, its prospects do not depend on inspirational  leadership." However, the "nature of opposition politics will  change significantly. The Westminster style of opposition will  not be altogether appropriate in South Africa in the next five  years." This period requires "nation building", and "the value  of the DP lies in its ability simultaneously to oppose and help  build, and to detect and strategically counter, as effectively  as possible, threats to civil liberties." "It will have to use  delicate judgment (totally lacking in the NP) to detect when the  line is crossed between co-operation and compromise, and  self-destructive appeasement. When that line is breached, in  economics or civil rights, that is when to yell from the  rooftops."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   SOWETAN Urges Votes for ANC, PAC -- A front-page "Comment",  that continues on page 12, of Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on  25 April says that although the choice for black voters in this  week's election "will be difficult," there is "an undeniable  obligation to vote for the liberation organisations. The ANC  and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] are the only parties for  whom our choice should be made. Regrettably, Azapo [Azanian  People's Organization] is not standing. The liberation  organisations were the engine in the struggle that brought about  the first all-race democratic elections in SA. Not only did the  leaders of these parties spend years in prison, they were  subjected to all the terrible onslaughts used by apartheid to  destroy entire communities and in the process, our beautiful  land." "Mr F W de Klerk, although he represents the party that  caused the damage in the past, will and must be recognised by  history as an important catalyst in this momentous change. Some  will also look on the IFP with a measure of unhappiness. But  the fact that Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi finally entered the race  must reflect favourably on him."</p>

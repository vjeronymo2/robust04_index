			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman yesterday sent a  letter to Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and foreign  minister. The message, conveyed by Janko Vranicani-Dobrinovic,  Croatian ambassador to the Benelux countries, requests Belgium,  as one of the members of the European Union's [EU] troika, to  enlist EU support for Croatia's development, which would speed  up the democratization process and help to gradually resolve the  problem of Croatian territories under UN protection.    Minister Claes and Ambassador Vranicani-Dobrinovic also  discussed the implementation of the Washington agreements  between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims.    The Croatian ambassador underlined Croatia's interest in  concluding an agreement on trade and economic cooperation,  protection of foreign investments, and double taxation.  Vrnicani-Dobrinovic requested that Belgium ease or abolish  visas for Croatian citizens and resolve the problem of workers  employed by Croatian companies in Belgium.</p>

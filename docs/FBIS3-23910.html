From Sobchak"]    [Text] Yesterday the city court considered a claim of the  former city soviet chairman Aleksandr Belyayev, who is  challenging the legality of a number of articles in the statute  on elections, which bars him, as a Federation Council member,  from being elected to the city assembly. The case never got to  the point of argument: At the very beginning of the hearings  Aleksandr Komarov, deputy chief of the mayoralty's legal  department, handed the court Anatoliy Sobchak's new decree,  which eliminates Federation Council deputies from the  "blacklist."    The litigation between Belyayev and Sobchak did not end  there, however. On 23 February the court will consider a new  claim from Aleksandr Nikolayevich which challenges the statute's  legality regarding introducing the residency and age minimum for  candidates, as well as banning MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] personnel, fixed-term military servicemen, the mayor,  the vice mayor, and deputy mayors from running for deputy seats.  Commenting on the situation, he remarked that the mayor is not  necessarily Sobchak but merely an official. Aleksandr Belyayev  is against electing bureaucrats to the city assembly, but he  believes that such a ban must be reinforced by federal law or at  least a presidential edict. Meanwhile, on 22 January Boris  Yeltsin repealed the point in the "Law on Kray and Oblast  Soviet..." that barred heads of the executive branch from  becoming deputies. As to the ban on MVD personnel and military  servicemen on running for deputy seats, in the opinion of  Belyayev and his representative, this simply violates the  current law.</p>

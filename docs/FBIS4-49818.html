			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On the morning of 28 April the provincial higher  people's court sponsored a press briefing to disclose the  province's achievements in launching the "spring offensive"  against crimes, during which the responsible personnel of the  provincial higher people's court said: Since the beginning of  this year and particularly since the beginning of the "spring  offensive", the people's courts at all levels throughout the  province have regarded the work of maintaining the social  stability and safeguarding the economic construction as their  own missions and actively joined in the offensive. While doing  a good job in conducting the administration of justice, they  have particularly, emphatically, and vigorously grasped the  trials of criminal cases and strictly punished a large number of  criminal elements who have jeopardized the social peace. Thus,  the achievements scored by the province in the "spring  offensive" have been further consolidated and broadened.    After the launching of "spring offensive", the people's  courts at all levels have reinforced the dynamics in dealing  blows at criminal elements. Particularly as for serious and  appalling cases, they have achieved in having their leading  personnel attach importance on them; concentrate their efforts  on handling them; join in the handling of them in advance;  firmly grasp the trials and examination of them; and give heavy  punishment to convicts rapidly. Last week alone, the provincial  higher people's court held the meetings of judicial officers in  three consecutive days to examine and handle 64 serious and  appalling criminal cases. During the meetings the participants  made decisions to sentence 76 convicts to the death penalty,  eight convicts to the death penalty with a reprieve, nine  convicts to life imprisonment, and 36 convicts to more than  three months imprisonment. As of 23 April the provincial higher  people's court wound up 216 cases of second trials and retrials,  which showed an 86-case increase over the same period of 1993,  and gave sentences to 466 convicts. [passage omitted]    Currently under the unified leadership and arrangement made  by the local party committees, the people's courts at all levels  across the province are closely coordinated with the organs of  public security and people's procuratorate; are concentrating  their superior forces on dealing with serious and appalling  cases; and are striving to win an overall victory in the "spring  offensive".</p>

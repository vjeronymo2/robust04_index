			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Decision To Purchase Aircraft from Central </F> Asian States"]    [Text] According to a press report, Pakistan is drawing up  a plan to purchase aircraft from Central Asian states as its Air  Force is in need of fighter planes expeditiously. India's  stepped up war preparations have intensified this need.  Although negotiations are under way for the purchase of French  aircraft, it might take three to four years to give effect to  the talks and the changes taking place at the international and  regional level are so rapid that there is no room for any  complacency in the country's defense matters. For quite some  time, Pakistan has been steadfast in its policy to purchase more  and more weapons from the United States and we have suffered its  repercussions through the three wars forced on us. The program  formulated by the present government by deviating from its  traditional path to purchase aircraft for its Air Force from  Central Asian States is an important step taken in the right  direction and no effort should be spared to remove all the  bottlenecks on its way.</p>

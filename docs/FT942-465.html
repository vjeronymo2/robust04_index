			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Royal Ordnance contract extended The government has extended part of a big ammunition contract awarded to Royal Ordnance last year in a deal worth about Pounds 40m to the British Aerospace subsidiary. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, announced last night that the government had agreed to extend the small arms element of the Pounds 200m contract for a further two years to cover 1998-99 and 1999-2000. He said the decision should help to maintain jobs at the factory at Radway Green in Cheshire, which employs nearly 600 people. The company won the original five-year contract to supply ammunition ranging from small arms to tank shells last October against stiff competition. BAe is considering collaboration between Giat, the French state-owned arms manufacturer, and Royal Ordnance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with former Prime Minister Faustin </F> Twagiramungu by correspondent Marie-France Cros in Brussels;  date not given]    [Text] Faustin Twagiramungu is the prime minister appointed  by the Arusha peace agreements (August 1993) to lead the  transitional government in Rwanda. A few hours after the  assassination of President Habyarimana on the evening of 6 April  and having learned of the kidnapping by the Presidential Guard  of several ministers and their families -- all of whom were  killed -- he sought refuge with one neighbor, while his family  sought refuge with another. In the morning of 7 April, the Blue  Helmets came to look for him in armored vehicles, but they did  not take his family. From 7 to 19 April, Mr. Twagiramungu  remained on United Nations premises, before being transported --  in an armored vehicle and hidden in a jute sack -- to the  airport and tossed into a plane bound for Nairobi and then  Brussels.  <H5>  Illegal </H5>   On Wednesday [11 May], Mr. Twagiramungu met with Foreign  Minister Willy Claes. "We agree on the need for a cease-fire  and the need to say that the hostilities are being aggravated by  the continued supply of increasingly sophisticated weapons to  both belligerents." Mr. Twagiramungu supports the RPF, which  wants to sign a cease-fire agreement only with the Rwandan Army,  not the government, "because the government has called for  massacres and because it is illegal. The "president" did not  even take an oath before parliament and the parties did not give  their agreement to having their members participate in the  cabinet, as was the custom when we were still operating under  the terms of the 1991 constitution," which was claimed by the  authorities to be the legal basis, in preference to the Arusha  agreements, which replaced it in 1993.    For the time being, the civilian opposition wants to set up  a  coordination committee for the democratic forces of change  bringing together four parties: the Democratic and Republican  Movement (MDR), the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD), the  Liberal Party (PL), and the Christian Democratic Party (PDC).  "Contact must be made with the people by radio. There is a  terrifying political vacuum. There are only the RPF and the  killers. This situation is desired by the MRDN [National  Revolutionary Movement for Development], which wanted to  annihilate the opposition so that it could be alone in the face  of the RPF and then exterminate it with the support of the  people. We cannot tolerate this. The political struggle must  continue."    However, one problem does arise: The MDR is divided between  those who follow Mr. Twagiramungu and those who, in the name of  "Hutu Power," have joined the presidential sphere supporters,  some of whom are currently participating in the massacres of  civilians. "They fell into the trap of the MRND, which preached  Hutu unity. I preach Rwandan unity, as is written in our  bylaws. They did not respect these bylaws, so they can no  longer be in our party. We need a congress to decide on a clear  divorce. Under no circumstances may we cooperate with these  people any more."  <H5>  Yes To Arusha </H5>   Mr. Twagiramungu supports "the Arusha peace agreements 100  percent" but "of course, the killers will have to be excluded  from the planned institutions and the international community  must help us judge them."    Is the RPF the army of the civilian opposition? "I cannot  say. I have not talked about this with them. In our agreement  in Brussels in May and June 1992, we said that we were prepared  to collaborate with the RPF if it agreed to the negotiations.  We also said we would undertake the same political struggle:  Dismantling the dictatorship. We must keep this spirit. When  the RPF has ended the war -- we do not have weapons to join them  and put an end to the massacres -- the struggle will still be to  destroy the dictatorship."    And the Rwandan Army? "How can it be described -- it and the  gendarmerie, both of which have remained on the sidelines  without defending anyone from the massacres! I condemn the Army  leadership. If there are officers who are convinced that what is  happening is evil, then let them fight the militias or, at  least, keep their distance."    What about the MRND? "The militias that kill do so on the  orders of this party. I think it should be dissolved. We  cannot keep parties which preach extermination. The MRND  militants must redefine what they want and choose other leaders.  Apparently, there are moderates in the MRND. So let them prove  it by dissociating themselves from the massacres. We cannot  tolerate letting these people start again some day. I am almost  50 years old. I have seen violence like this in 1959, 1964,  1973, 1990, and 1994. Will my children also have to live with  this all their lives? For 35 years now anytime anyone has  talked about power it is in Hutu/Tutsi terms. Will we have to  wait another century to achieve national unity? If the answer  is yes, then there will never be any development. Never."</p>

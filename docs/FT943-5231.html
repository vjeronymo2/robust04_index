			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Jordan The Amman share market was depressed last week by plans for a capital gains tax on the share dealing of finan- cial institutions. On Tuesday, most shares plunged to the 5 per cent daily price limit imposed to stabilise fluctuations. On Wednesday, however, the general price index ended weekly trading only 0.55 down on the day at 147.12. A feared steep fall in volume and prices was averted after investors decided the proposals were unenforceable at any time in the near future, and that they still had to be debated before becoming law.</p>

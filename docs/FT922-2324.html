			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Observer: Sears' test-bed Has Liam Strong, Sears' newly-installed chief executive, fallen for the Hanson mystique in making his first big appointment? Stephen Park, his new finance director, certainly has an impressive CV. As a former Hanson financial comptroller he should be well trained in what Hanson does best - keeping a tight grip on costs and capital spending. He is also Lord Hanson's personal assistant, so he should have a pretty good idea what Britain's number one predator thinks about Sears - one of the London stock market's favourite takeover targets. Even so, some Hanson-watchers wonder whether Park is in quite the same class as Chris Miller, Lord Hanson's previous PA - now in Wassall's driving seat - or BET's new finance director Bob MacKenzie, another old student of the Hanson school of financial management. Park may not have long to prove himself. After all, it was only a year ago that Lord Hanson told the FT that 'Allied-Lyons or Sears could be taken at any time but we do not want to go for them.'</p>

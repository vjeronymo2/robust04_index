			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030) and </F> XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)]    [Text] Beijing, 9 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking on 7 May at a  national conference of commodity inspection bureau directors, Li  Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  and vice premier of the State Council, said: We should further  tighten commodity inspection, inspect and supervise product  quality in accordance with the law, and exercise strict control  over the quality of export and import products.    Li Lanqing said: Quality is not only the lifeblood of  enterprises and foreign trade but also an important matter that  bears on a country's reputation, national quality, and a  country's economic and social development. People should be  aware of the need to "develop the country by improving quality."  Product quality, which is primarily the business of  enterprises, should be improved scrupulously so that "coarse  food grains will be turned into delicacies." However, commodity  inspection departments bear heavy responsibility for checking  quality. Our country's reform, opening up, and development of  foreign economic relations and trade have increased the  responsibility of commodity inspection departments. Although  their main duty is to inspect quality, these departments should  also take necessary measures to help and prod enterprises to  improve the quality of their commodities. Commodity inspection  departments should be impartial and incorruptible, should not be  kind-hearted, and should be "fastidious." They should not  "raise their hands" to allow substandard goods through, and  should firmly prevent those goods from leaving the country.  They should also continue to inspect the quality of imported  goods in accordance with the law, so as to reduce unnecessary  losses to the state and business operators. They should keep  expanding the scope of commodity inspection and increase the  inspection rate. In addition, they should further improve the  quality and efficiency of their work, and serve units that  engage in production and foreign trade. They should increase  exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts,  strive to bring themselves into line with international norms,  and act according to international practice. Domestically,  commodity inspection departments have approved more than 400  laboratories in various lines of business, which should be  allowed to perform their functions fully. Although they are the  "main force," commodity inspection departments should make full  use of social resources to compensate for their own limited  resources.    Li Lanqing noted emphatically: Commodity inspection  departments should further build up their ranks. They should  pay attention to training various types of qualified personnel;  they should not only cultivate senior- and mid-level personnel  but should also strengthen in-service training, placing  particular stress on the training of law enforcement personnel.  Commodity inspection departments should never slacken their  efforts at building clean government. Without a highly  disciplined commodity inspection team which possesses a  stringent work style and enforces laws impartially, it is  impossible to accomplish our tasks. We should study and draw up  several strong, easy-to-implement measures in light of the  distinct features of the commodity inspection sector, and should  implement those measures relentlessly.    In closing, Li Lanqing said: The party Central Committee and  the State Council are very concerned about and supportive of  commodity inspection work; party and government leaders in all  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government also take such work seriously. This  attests to the increasingly important role of commodity  inspection work in national economic construction and foreign  trade. We hope that comrades in commodity inspection  departments will redouble their efforts and make fresh  contributions to national economic construction and foreign  trade.</p>

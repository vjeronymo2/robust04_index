			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan and the United States have consolidated the  contents of an agreement on "cooperation regarding development  of private-sector industrial technologies." The possibility of  promoting cooperation was studied at the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks. The details of this agreement indicate that  the Japanese and U.S. Governments will select 10 topics such as  development of materials for producing semiconductors and  development of carbon fibers, and start joint research this  fall. The governments of both countries will sign the agreement  in early June. They will promote cooperation mainly in the area  of utilizing military technologies to produce civilian goods by  combining U.S. military technologies with Japanese technologies  for production of nonmilitary goods. Both governments will ask  private industry in their own countries to take part in the  cooperation.    It is expected that Eijiro Hata, minister of international  trade and industry, and Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown--who  will attend the East and West economic officials' meeting  scheduled to be held in Warsaw, Poland, from 6 May--will agree  on an outline of the cooperation.    At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks held in  Washington, Japan and the United States disagreed over the issue  of objective criteria, including numerical targets, and failed  to reach an agreement in three areas; government procurement,  insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts. However,  both countries agreed to promote "cooperation from the viewpoint  of global prospects," such as population and environmental  issues. As one field of "cooperation between the two countries  in the area of ultramodern technology," both countries, as  stated in the Washington agreement, were scheduled to have  detailed discussions to finalize contents of cooperation in  private-sector industrial technology.    Four proposals of the 10-point plan will be implemented  first. They are applications of nitride aluminum, which is used  for tank armor plating and other purposes; applications of  carbon fiber composite material, which is used to produce  structural materials for space shuttles and aircraft, and for  production of nonmilitary goods; application of environmental  technologies for treatment of factory waste fluids and noise  prevention; and structural analysis of proteins.    In addition to these four proposals, other projects to  promote technological cooperation have also been mentioned.  Among them are plans to develop a factory automation (FA)  system by using the target-tracking device on missiles with  machine tools to achieve highly sophisticated factory  automation, and to develop an LCD device to be used for  high-definition televisions.    Both countries will improve development efficiencies by  combining U.S. military technologies and Japanese application  technologies. Ultimately, they plan to promote joint  development for all proposals in the 10-point development plan.    The U.S. Government intends to send a joint study group  composed of both government officials and private-sector  personnel to Japan in June, and hopes that a final agreement can  be reached on cooperation in research work. Following the  investigation team's trip to Japan, Japan and the United States  will establish a joint project team composed of members of state  research institutes, and start research as early as this fall on  each proposal. Through the New Energy Development Organization  (NEDO), which is a corporation having a special status, the  Japanese Government will ask private corporations to join the  plan.</p>

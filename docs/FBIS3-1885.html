The INTERFAX news service quoted Kolesnikov as saying that  the military bases will be set up on the sites inherited from  the former Soviet troops.    Russia will sign relevant agreements with the countries  concerned so as to legalize the process of establishing those  bases.    Armenia has already signed such an agreement with Russia.    Some CIS countries called for the withdrawal of Russian  troops following the break-up of the Soviet Union. But due to  difficulties in establishing their own army, these countries  have changed their mind in order to have an army to maintain  order and security.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced for the first time  Russia's desire to establish military bases in CIS countries  when he was visiting Georgia in January.    CIS defense ministers also held a meeting in late February  in  Moscow on military cooperations.</p>

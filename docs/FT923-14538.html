			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Polls on water metering 'mislead' WATER METERING would be less popular if consumers knew the full cost and how much water was lost through leakage, the National Consumer Council warned yesterday. Surveys carried out for Ofwat, the water industry regulator, suggest widespread public support for metering. However, Mr Robin Simpson, deputy chairman of the council, says in Consumer Voice magazine that the surveys were misleading. 'In none of the surveys were the respondents told that the average leakage is about 25 per cent of the water supplied by the water companies.' About 64 per cent of 290,000 respondents to a questionnaire sent to 18m homes said they would prefer metering. But Mr Simpson said: 'The questionnaire gave a range of increases in water charges due to metering, with an increase of Pounds 29 a year at the top end. Yet there are well-documented cases where water charges have increased by more than that.' Water companies have three options after the present system is phased out: metering; a flat licence fee; and a bill based on the type of property. Ofwat said that with metering - the fairest option - customers would pay for leakages only if they were in their own supply pipes - not any in the mains. The director-general of Ofwat should have powers to compel companies to compensate customers for poor service, the chairmen of Ofwat's regional customer service committees said yesterday.</p>

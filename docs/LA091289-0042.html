			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was reelected chairman of his party, the  Christian Democratic Union, but with a record number of votes against him. More  than three-quarters of the delegates at the party congress in Bremen voted for  Kohl to stay on as party leader for the next two years and take them into the  1990 general election. But a record 147 of the 738 delegates present on the  opening day of the congress voted against the chancellor, who was the only  candidate. The party has suffered setbacks in local and European elections in  the past year. Public disputes between liberals and conservatives within the  party have also damaged its standing.  </P></p>

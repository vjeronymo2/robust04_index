			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["j.t./DW"-signed report: "Germany Has a Duty To </F> Participate"]    [Text] Oxford/Brussels -- German Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe has once again called for a security partnership between  NATO and Russia. Speaking at Oxford yesterday, he said NATO  would be well-advised to respond positively to Moscow's  expectations. It is, quite simply, entirely understandable that  the great power Russia should wish to participate in the  alliance process of formulating views if the issues in question  concern overall European security and global strategic  considerations. Ruehe said: "NATO cannot treat Russia like  Tajikistan or Albania."    In comments addressed to Moscow, the defense minister said  that Moscow must learn how to be a neighbor among neighbors as  well as a partner among equals and act accordingly. Ruehe thus  indirectly criticized statements by leading Russian politicians  who have recently reserved for themselves the right to take  unilateral steps should circumstances become critical in  neighboring countries.    Russia must become a strategic partner for NATO, said Ruehe,  and it must also feel that it is that. This should not mean,  however, that the integration of Germany's immediate eastern  neighbors into Western structures should be hindered.    In his Oxford address, Ruehe came out in favor of an active  German foreign policy. If one does not "export" stability now,  one will later be affected by instability oneself. Germany has  a duty to participate. Ruehe said: "Germany must develop a new  national tradition for the Berlin republic."    At NATO headquarters in Brussels, it was said that Russia  should not be accorded any kind of special role under the  Partnership for Peace. However, the alliance should develop  appropriate relations with the Kremlin in view of Russia's  significant geopolitical role. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is  coming to Brussels next week to hold talks. He will also  discuss Russia's new military doctrine.</p>

Admittedly, now that  the cold war is far behind us and relations of trust and mutual  understanding are being established between states, such an  episode may seem to the uninitiated to be an anachronism. Is it  still necessary to carry out reconnaissance such as this today,  you might ask. Well, judge for yourself. Despite the  strengthening of confidence and mutual understanding between the  countries of West and East Europe, every day reconnaissance  planes take off from foreign airfields and head toward the  borders of Russia and the CIS countries. According to recent  data in my possession, in 1993 alone NATO countries and other  states carried out over 2,600 reconnaissance flights near the  borders of the Russian Federation and our immediate neighbors.  At the present moment the NATO countries support a whole armada  -- 470 reconnaissance planes and base patrol aircraft -- in the  allied and national air forces. The main types of tactical  reconnaissance planes are the RF-4C, the RF-16, the AMX, the  Jaguar GR1, the Mirage F-1CR, and the Tornado FR and GR1 [as  published]. The tactical and technical characteristics of these  planes are given in the table below. In addition, the U.S. Air  Force has over 60 strategic reconnaissance planes.    In addition to this number around another 150 reconnaissance  planes and base patrol planes belonging to the United States,  Japan, and the Republic of Korea and stationed in Asia and the  Pacific also constantly monitor Russia's borders.    To be fair, it should be noted that since the end of the  cold  war the intensity of these flights has diminished year by year.  To be precise, the 1993 figure was 12 percent down on 1992. But  you will agree that 2,600 reconnaissance flights a year are  still rather a lot. In short, Russia's neighbors near and far  are keeping us under constant observation. Incidentally, they  are doing this not just from the air but also from the ground  and from space. What is there for us to do?    Despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia is  still a vast state. In terms of length of border and size (the  area of the Russian Federation is 17.1 million square km), it is  still the largest country in the world. Russia's geostrategic  position is unique because it is situated in both Europe and  Asia and, consequently, it is bound to have interests in those  parts of the world. In view of that fact the Russian Federation  is obliged to follow the development of military-political  processes both in the Asia and Pacific region and in Europe and,  indeed, in the Near and Middle East, which are just 1-2 hours'  flying time from our territory. In short, Russia needs constant,  objective information on the states surrounding us. This  information comes not just from the words and assurances of the  politicians. Airborne reconnaissance is one objective source of  that information, too. [passage omitted]    The Army and its most important component -- the Air Force  --  like the whole country, are not having the best of times at the  moment. Owing to the crisis in the economy and the disastrous  lack of funds, the command of the Air Force is having to tackle  tasks that contain many unknown quantities when it comes to the  allocation of budget money: What is it to be spent on -- wages,  housing, spare parts, or procurement of new hardware?    "Owing to the shortage of fuel, spare parts, and other  expendable materials," Lieutenant General of Aviation Nikolay  Rastorguyev, directorate head and deputy chief of the Air Force  Main Staff, said, "we have cut flights to a minimum beyond which  we can go no further. Pilots are simply losing their skills."    I cannot fail to mention the fact that, as a result of the  breakup of the Soviet Union and the division of the Army, the  Air Force reconnaissance service has suffered palpable losses.  Some air regiments have been disbanded, some "privatized" by the  former Union republics. For instance, there is one regiment of  front-line reconnaissance aircraft left in Belarus and three  regiments apiece in Ukraine and Central Asia.    Despite these losses, a Russian front-line reconnaissance  aviation grouping has in the main been formed today. Units  redeployed from distant and nearby foreign countries are  settling down in their new bases and have embarked on combat  training. And the claims by some mass media that the Air Force  has curtailed combat training do not, to put it mildly, accord  with reality. The example I cited at the beginning of these  notes and a host of other facts attest that the Air Force  reconnaissance service is always ready to perform and is  performing its designated tasks.    Of course, they are having a hard time now. Everything is in  short supply. Things are further aggravated by the fact that  over the last few years (owing to lack of proper funding) the  Air Force has drastically cut procurement of new aviation  hardware. That has also taken its toll on reconnaissance  aviation. The stock of Su-17M4R, Mig-25RB, and Su-24MR planes  is becoming outdated and worn-out, their service life is coming  to an end, but there are no reinforcements or replacements. The  program for commissioning the Sukhoy firm's new reconnaissance  plane has been disrupted owing to lack of funding again, and  will the Air Force even have the money to buy it? In short, if  the current situation lasts another few years, in around 10  years the Air Force may be left without a reconnaissance service.    But what are we worrying about? The world situation is  changing. And it seems to be changing for the better. Perhaps in  10 years or so Russia will not have any enemies or adversaries?  God grant that that be true! But can we close our eyes to the  fact that neither the United States nor the other NATO countries  are giving up any of their reconnaissance programs. In  particular, reports have appeared in the Western press that the  United States is developing the "Aurora" top-secret supersonic  reconnaissance plane. With a range of 15,000-17,000 km and a  speed of Mach 5-6 at altitudes of around 36,000 meters this  aircraft with its two-man crew is capable of getting virtually  anywhere in the world fast.    AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY also reports that the  U.S.  Air Force has allegedly taken delivery of the new "Black Manta"  TR-3A operational-tactical reconnaissance aircraft. In short,  despite the fact that international tension is obviously easing  and relapses into "cold war" are a thing of the past, the  leadership of the world's leading countries has not slackened  its efforts to develop airborne reconnaissance systems, but is,  on the contrary, trying to perfect them.    Come what may, Russia is historically destined to be a  leading world power. And it cannot do without reconnaissance  (airborne reconnaissance included).

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Sport: Europe's unsung women drivers - Golf 'LET'S face it,' a sports agent once told me. 'Women's sport is about sex first, performance second.' In European golf, particularly in Britain, the prejudices are nursery school and public school in equal measure, this means three supremely talented players are almost unknown. Jack Nicklaus could be fat and famous. But Helen Alfredsson, Laura Davies and Trish Johnson need to play like Hogan and look like Madonna. Is the deft and devious mind of an agent truly unable to sell mere skill and personality? Will his next-of-kin, the sponsor, really not buy it? When it comes to Alfie, Laura and Trish, perhaps personality is a polite way of putting it. Each is blessed with charm, tenacity and vulnerability, but they are all highly competitive and live as fiercely as they play. The facts that these three Europeans (who play this weekend at the BMW European Masters at Golf du Bercuit, just outside Brussels) are all in the US LPGA Tour top ten and all played in Europe's drubbing of the crabby, ungracious Americans in last year's Solheim Cup is of interest only to a faithful handful. Alfredsson, 28, spent her youth in stilettos as often as spikes. She was a catwalk model in Paris. But she gave that up: 'It was a meat market. It was just make-up, calories and drugs. And I got out of it fast. Now I wear long shorts to hide my cellulite.' She trained in Sweden's elite golfing academy, before going to college in San Diego. There she was twice banished from the golf team and went off with the soccer coach, Leo Cuellar. Cuellar, a former Mexican footballer, is now her fiance. 'We play many games together, but whether it's backgammon or cards, we have to beat the hell out of each other,' she says. To Alfredsson quitting is anathema, tantrums occasional. Spectators like her tantrums. They can be louder and more richly worded than many of Lenny Bruce's best performances. Last year she was America's rookie of the year. This year, she has already won their first major, the Nabisco Dinah Shore. Davies has become accepted in British sporting circles less because she won the British and US Opens of 1986 and 1987 respectively than because she is far more knowledgeable than most of the men on the television quiz A Question of Sport. Her golf game is built on instinct and gargantuan power. And no coach. She continues to support the European circuit in spite of its disastrous management history. During tournaments she organises football and cricket matches. And plays in them. (You can just imagine Nick Faldo doing that. What would his personal fitness trainer say?) She is a mediocre spin bowler, a sterling bat and a bit like Niall Quinn, the gangling Irish striker She says: 'I like a gamble. I like driving cars too fast. I love sport. Any sport.' Talk to her about football, for example, and you get neither ignorance nor platitudes. Rather: 'Graham Taylor is a prat. I lost all respect for him when he dropped Chris Waddle. And you can quote me.' This sort of outspokeness gives agents hypertension. Johnson, Davies' 27-year-old partner in cricket and crime on tour, finally found recognition this year by winning two consecutive US tournament. Her long game is less spectacular than either Davies' and Alfredsson's, but from 80 yards or less she is deadly. At last year's European Masters she was unwise enough to have me caddy for her, when her regular valet was stranded in the US. Her concentration, dedication and shot-making are on a par with, say, Vijay Singh on the men's tour. But I bet Vijay does not drive to the course like Trish. She became intolerant of Belgian traffic and every morning for six days insisted on driving the wrong side of the road. This was not a little bit of overtaking. This was stretches of up to a kilometre at 120km an hour. Johnson, Davies and Alfredsson, like to live a little. They are throwbacks to the days before golfers played to earn rather than to win. They play for love first, money second. They play for a win, not a place. A game populated by a thousand clones of Scott Simpson ought to be grateful.</p>

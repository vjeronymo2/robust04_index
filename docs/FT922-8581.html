			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Nordstrom declines 16% in first quarter NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based stores group and one of the stars of the US retail sector in the late-1980s, has reported a 15.9 per cent fall in first-quarter profits. The fashion retailer, which has been hit by the west coast recession, said it made Dollars 21.6m after tax in the three months to the end of April, compared with Dollars 25.7m in the same period a year earlier. Sales in the first quarter rose 8.7 per cent, to Dollars 663.8m. However, Nordstrom's finance director, Mr John Goesling, said sales trends had not 'improved enough to offset the higher costs of doing business'. Its shares yesterday edged higher, by  5/8 to Dollars 34. Meanwhile, May Department Stores, which operates 319 department stores across the US under names such as Lord &amp; Taylor and Kaufmann's, and 3,304 shoe stores, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 81m for the 13 weeks to May 2. This compares with Dollars 76m in the same period a year earlier. Total net retail sales in the period were up from Dollars 2.17bn to Dollars 2.3bn. Its shares rose  3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: WORKPLACE  </P> <P> Desperately Seeking Nannies: A company that specializes in recruiting  "All-American" nannies from small Midwest and Northwest towns opened two months  ago in El Toro and already has more requests for nannies than it can readily  fill, owner Anne Leets said.  </P> <P> "Child care is a big issue for working parents," said Leets, the founder of  All-American Childcare Agency.  </P> <P> She said the live-in nannies she places accept salaries at the going rate in  Southern California, ranging from $150 to $250 a week plus room and board. But  she said the family employer also must pay for transportation to bring them  from their home towns.  </P> <P> Leets said that since she founded her agency in September, she has placed close  to 30 nannies throughout Orange County. "Right now I have three clients for  every nanny I can find," she said.  </P></p>

Welcome to  Newsline.    [Finca] Good evening.    [Ascar] As I asked Mr. Goosen earlier, plans for the  immediate future. I'd like to ask you again what do you think  can be done to address the concerns of the civil servants as  regards their pensions?    [Finca] There is a task force already set up by the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] for that purpose and I am led  to believe that that task force is already addressing that  issue. We, as the joint administrators, will be lending our  support to what the task force is going to be doing.    [Ascar] Rev. Finca, do you think there are any similarities  between the situation in the Ciskei and the situation in  Bophuthatswana not too long ago?    [Finca] There are similarities, and there are, of course,  differences. The similarities lie in the fact that there is a  popular uprising of dissatisfaction with these Bantustan  dictators. The similarities are in the fact that in Ciskei there  has been, what I believe, an acceptance by Brigadier Gqozo that  he can no longer control the situation and has voluntarily  stepped down.    [Ascar] Do you not see a pattern emerging in the independent  states? Is there not a fear that this could spill over to other  areas?    [Finca] I don't know whose fear that is. Is that the fear of  those who are in authority or is that the fear of the people? I  think there is a general trend developing in our country that  democracy has to be dictated to by the people on the ground.    [Ascar] Rev. Finca, would you corroborate what Mr. Goosen  said, that the Brigadier is in fact not under house arrest?    [Finca] I'm not as conversant with the facts of what has  been  happening today as my colleague Mr. Goosen is. I've just come  in this morning from Johannesburg. I've been attending a  meeting there, so I believe that Mr. Goosen's version of what is  happening will by and large be correct. He has been closer to  the situation than myself, for today.    [Ascar] You have been in the Ciskei today. Are you able to  ascertain whether there are indeed Ciskeian Defense Force  loyalists who are still supporting the brigadier?    [Finca] I am not able to comment on that. I'll be going to  Bisho for the first time tomorrow morning. I came in, as I say,  from Johannesburg this morning, and I have never been to Bisho.    [Ascar] Rev. Finca, we thank you for your participation.  Thanks for joining us.    [Finca] Thank you.</p>

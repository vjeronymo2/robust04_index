			<p>BFN     [Text] Johanesburg April 28 SAPA -- Provisional results of  South Africa's first all-race election could be available as  early as Saturday [30 April] afternoon. An Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman told SAPA unofficial  results from the smaller counting stations could be available on  Saturday afternoon.    Other results, including the national poll, would follow,  but  he could not say when.    The IEC initially said it would take 26 hours to certify the  elections. Legally a period of ten days is allowed.    The IEC announced earlier on Thursday that counting at the  800 stations countrywide would only start at 6AM on Saturday.    IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said counting would  be delayed because an additional day of voting in KwaZulu/Natal,  Northern Transvaal and Eastern Cape, where voters were unable to  cast a free and fair vote, had been recommended.    The commission spokesman was unable to say when the election  would be certified.    All disputes needed to be resolved before the commission  could certify the elections substantially free and fair or  otherwise, he said.</p>

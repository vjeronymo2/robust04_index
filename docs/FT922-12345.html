			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Mud-slinging turns the US off: Political disenchantment can be linked to the role of the media 'It is coverage wanting humanity, common sense and, not incidentally, news. It is as if the plague of post-modernism had infected the newsrooms of our greatest newspapers.'  - Ward Just, veteran foreign correspondent and author, writing in the Washington Post. 'That is the first positive thing I've read or heard about him this year.'  - Anne Nesbet, lecturer at the University of Colorado, on being told last week a mildly complimentary anecdote about Bill Clinton. It is now a cliche to describe this American election year as one of great political disaffection. Usually the blame is assigned somewhere between the magnitude and intractability of the problems facing the country and the shortcomings of those who want to lead it. Though the problems of earlier times might be comparable, nobody of sound mind will claim that George Bush or Bill Clinton and possibly H Ross Perot are reincarnations of George Washington, FDR and possibly Theodore Roosevelt. But the question is whether responsibility for this sad state of alienation might also extend to the fourth estate, the presumed great intermediary between the problem and the solution. There is more to this than standard journalistic angst, for it really is the stuff of everyday conversation from Maine to California. In Britain, Neil Kinnock believes Labour's defeat was in good measure attributable to the Tory press. Right or wrong, nearly four out of five eligible Britons cast a ballot. By contrast, the US does not have an ideological mass media and yet, barring a remarkable reversal of all known trends, this November fewer than one in two will bother to vote for a president. Even if this comparison fails to take full account of differing political and social structures, it is hard to deny the correlation between the changing face of the US media and the engagement of the public in political life. The case for the prosecution can be briefly put: the media's long adversarial tradition of hard reporting and muckraking, which claimed mighty scalps from Boss Tweed, the 19th-century Tammany Hall boss in New York, to Richard Nixon, and which made its share of mistakes as well, cannot but be contrasted with today's tendency to presume wrongdoing about anybody even contemplating entering the public domain, either politically or in any other capacity. Somewhere in the wash, the necessary conveyance of conventional news gets lost. The politicians are not the only ones under the gun. Last week Arthur Ashe, the retired tennis player, was 'outed' as an Aids sufferer by USA Today newspaper. There was also an extraordinary investigation by the Washington Post into the detailed deliberations of the Noriega trial jury, focusing not merely on why they disagreed but who disagreed with whom. The media justification in both cases, as with its scrutiny of the politicians, is that Mr Ashe was already a public figure while the Noriega jury de facto became a collective one. The New York Times argued that raising consciousness on Aids mattered more than any right Mr Ashe had to privacy. Similar logic was applied universally to the Noriega trial, with the sanctity of jury deliberations considered secondary to the public's 'right to know'. The line from the Clarence Thomas hearings and the Kennedy Smith and Tyson trials is clear: no stone gets left unturned. Mr Clinton knows now that he can have no secrets. Russell Baker, in one of his more semi-serious columns in the New York Times, argued that Mr Clinton had been battle-hardened by the experience, especially in New York. The more common view is that the pursuit of his private and public life, rather than his policies, has seriously weakened his candidacy. Time magazine, for example, this week devoted its cover story not to why he won three primaries, but to why he is not trusted. Time's polling sample of 937 opinions was evidently considered a more important diagnostic resource than the approximately 820,000 who actually voted for Mr Clinton on April 7. The American media's reflex faith in polling has yet to be undermined by evidence from across the Atlantic. Switching its targets, but not raising its standards, last week ABC News reported without a shred of broadcastable evidence that the house of Jerry Brown, when governor of California, might have been used for parties, in his presence or not, at which narcotics might have been consumed. His rejoinder  -'Anyone who knows me knows I don't give parties' - paled into insignificance compared with a presumed past sin. Going for the front-runner is an old game. Mr Brown is not alone in arguing that it was the media which anointed Bill Clinton favourite in the first place, long before anybody voted anywhere. It was thus placed under a particular obligation to scrutinise and dispatched squads of reporters to Arkansas. It follows that once Mr Brown won the Connecticut primary, he became eligible for the full treatment. So, for a while, did Pat Buchanan on the Republican side, though it may also be the case that, as a media man himself, he was treated rather gently in the beginning. By this logic, President Bush should be next. The proven involvement of his son, Neil, in a savings and loan scandal appears far worse than any conflict of interest, still totally unproven, involving Mrs Hillary Clinton and her Arkansas law firm. And if Mr Clinton strayed from the marital bed, there are plenty of rumours the president has, too. But it is also considered axiomatic that the Bush people stand ready to feed the media even more dirt to use against Mr Clinton, should he win the nomination, to the point that the Willie Horton commercials that laid Mr Michael Dukakis low in 1988 will this year be reckoned tame enough to show on children's television. The only contrary argument is that the Bush people know the Clinton camp has dug up dirt on the president, thus creating an unedifying stand-off. This prospect has already been fully aired in the media. So what is up? Like most changes, the US media has not transformed itself overnight. Among many evolutions, it has become more national, less parochial. USA Today is a ubiquitous publication; both the New York Times and Los Angeles Times, the best of east and west, now have national editions. In an atmosphere of more intense competition, the temptation to run with the story rather than check or edit it grows. The relationship between the writing press and television, once characterised by an essential reliance for information by the latter on the former, has shifted. No longer is it virtually automatic that whatever appears on the front pages of the leading newspapers will appear on that evening's TV national news. TV sets the agenda more. Now the news divisions of the three main networks, CBS, NBC and ABC, are in relative decline. They face competition not only from brash, smart and round-the-clock CNN but from their affiliate stations, which have prevented the extension of the national news from its current 30-minute format, preferring local news and entertainment, the two often indivisible. This year NBC is pooling its convention coverage with public broadcasting, the chronic poor cousin, to save money. Only CNN is substantially increasing its election budget this year. One result is the soundbite. In 1968, according to one delicious survey, the average time given to Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey to get over a point was 42.3 seconds. In 1988, this has dropped to 9.2 seconds, enough for Mr Bush or Mr Dukakis to say 'friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears' and not a word more. A second consequence is the growing tendency to see paid political 'attack ads' as newsworthy in themselves, because they are composed of soundbites, professionally made and save a bit of work. Curiously, the experience this year is that negative advertising may be ineffective. It certainly hurt Tsongas in Florida, Brown in New York and Buchanan in Georgia. Television, itself the developer of the cult of the personality, has also made writing journalists into celebrities. No hack worth his or her salt in Washington is complete without a regular television or radio outlet. Candidates cannot escape either. So Clinton and Brown find it politically necessary to appear on the Phil Donahue show, normally devoted to matters typically addressed in the sort of supermarket tabloid which paid Gennifer Flowers to say what she wanted. What the public senses is the absence of any consistent attempt to address the issues really bothering the country. This is now a complaint of the left as well as the right, which has long thought all but its own media a liberal coven. Last week, the University of Colorado put on its annual world affairs conference in Boulder, as good an event as any to test the liberal zeitgeist. Almost without exception, panellist after panellist, including several self-flagellating journalists, denounced the trivialisation of the media. To some this was yet another adverse reflection on the isolation of Washington, seen, in media as in politics, as an incestuous place. To others it reflected the inability or unwillingess of television to portray complex issues and the disinclination of the writing press to fill the substantive gaps left by television. And yet there is in the newspapers, and occasionally on television, no lack of analysis of what is wrong with the social and political fabric of the US. A Washington Post series by Dale Russakoff this week on the destruction of the dreams and prosperity of a Pennsylvania steel town is Pulitzer prize-worthy stuff, as, by universal acclaim, was a comparable exercise late last year by the Philadelphia Inquirer. Nor is all political reporting and commentary devoid of content, on TV as well as in the print. To watch Robin MacNeil, of the MacNeil-Lehrer programme, grill Clinton and Brown together on foreign policy last month was to learn a lot. For anyone interested in the political process, the writings of R W Apple Jnr, David Broder, Richard Cohen and a dozen others are mandatory and readily available, many syndicated nationwide. But too often neither seen nor heard, and that is a problem. Ward Just, writing from Paris, is probably closer to Boulder than he knows when he writes: 'This is what is going on; the fourth branch of government, powerful, numerous, smug and prurient, protected by its own constitutional amendment, is behaving like a gang of arrogant rich kids in an out-of-town saloon, where anything goes and no one prosecutes.' Which is precisely what the public is also saying about its politicians.</p>

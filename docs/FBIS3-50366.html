			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Michal Kovac returned from his  official visit to Poland just over an hour ago. Today he  visited the Royal Palace on Wawel Hill in Krakow and then met  the representatives of the Slovak community in Poland. During  the flight home, Michal Michalcik interviewed the president on  his visit.    [Begin recording] [Michalcik] [passage omitted] To what  extent do you feel that the intentions with which you went on  your first visit to Poland were fulfilled?    [Kovac] I think that, in some aspects, the visit was  succesful beyond my expectations. [passage omitted] It would  certainly have been more effective if agreements could have been  signed on this occasion and if [Economics] Minister Ducky had  also taken part in the visit, particularly because the Polish  side expected it. In spite of this, I think that this changed  nothing regarding the overall results of the visit, taking into  consideration what can generally be expected from a presidential  visit.    [Michalcik] The affair concerning Milan Panic's letter  started in Bratislava on the day you left [25 January]. Do you  think the choice of date was deliberate?    [Kovac] I cannot say anything for certain. I only know that  the letter was dispatched from the Presidential Office to the  Office of the Government on 17 or 18 January and that it was  lying there for quite a long time. This means that there was an  opportunity to react to it in some way by 19 or 20 January. I  cannot say whether the prime minister received the letter from  his clerks only later, or whether something else happened. In  any case, as regards this visit, the date it was made public was  not well chosen.    [Michalcik] During your talks with Polish President Walesa  and other officials, a number of interesting proposals and  projects emerged--namely, a total opening of our borders and a  systematic dialogue within the Partnership for Peace project.  Speaking at a news conference, you said that this is no longer  just a shared wish but an inevitable course of action brought  about by circumstances. [passage omitted]    [Kovak] We have come to realize that our nations are very  close to each other, we are neighbors sharing a border almost  600 km in length, and we have the same problems, common  interests, and internal and foreign policies. Therefore, it  would be very irresponsible not to make use of this chance.    This conclusion has been reached not only on the level of  presidents but, in my view, also on the level of the Polish  Government as well as the Sejm and Senate. Therefore, I feel  entitled to expect that the next meeting between the [Slovak and  Polish] prime ministers, perhaps also between the Polish and  Slovak Cabinets, will really mean a significant turning point,  because at these meetings issues will be specified and a number  of agreements prepared for signing. We are fully aware of the  fact that, without a proper basis formed by agreements, it is  not really possible at present to develop our relations on  various levels. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Foie gras feasts - Philippa Davenport tells you all about fattened duck and goose liver Smoked salmon was first, followed by oysters, as the choice items that greedy people bought for themselves and sent to their friends as mail-order presents for the festive season. Now foie gras, long favoured at top tables, is the most fashionable fare with which to celebrate the feast of Christmas. Foie gras is a more ticklish proposition to buy than smoked salmon or oysters because, unlike those very British foods, foie gras is foreign territory. Valiantly, however, the Weekend FT's food and drink team agreed to research and sample what is available to establish best buys for readers. First, a few basic facts about foie gras. Foie gras, which simply means fattened liver, can come from goose (oie) or duck (canard). Whether goose makes superior foie gras to duck, or vice versa, is open to endless argument. Goose is rarer now, and more expensive, because these birds are more labour intensive to raise. Experts agree generally that goose foie gras is richer and smoother, although duck tends to be fuller-flavoured. Foie gras may be sold raw or cooked to varying degrees. Raw and vacuum-packed, it keeps for just two weeks and must be refrigerated. Cooked lightly and freshly (called fresh in English, mi-cuit in French), wrapped in foil and vacuum-packed, and kept in the refrigerator, it has a shelf life of three to four weeks. The next rung up the preservation ladder is known as semi-conserved in English, demi-conserve in French. Bottled or tinned, this also must be stored in the refrigerator, where it will keep for about four months. Finally, there is fully-preserved foie gras - what the French call en conserve - which is cooked at length and sterilised in jars or tins so that it does not need refrigeration. It can be stored safely in a larder or cool larder-cupboard and will keep for about two years. As preserved foie gras is the only sort suitable for sending by mail order, we restricted our comparative tasting to products in this category. We aimed to get our supplies from the food halls of department stores, importers prepared to sell retail as well as wholesale, and small specialist companies. The services offered were varied, to say the least. This soon became clear to the Weekend FT's Anna Lambert, who organised the orders to be despatched for our tasting. Food halls generally seemed impersonal and expensive, geared better to selling hampers than the single jar or tin of foie gras that more suitable for mailing to great-uncle George. What is more - and presumably with the flashy end of their lucrative international clientele in mind - they seemed to concentrate on foie gras products with truffles and other fancy trimmings rather than good, plain foie gras entier. Of the importers, W. G. White was wonderfully informative and helpful: alas, its business is wholesale so it does not offer mail-order service. Repertoire, which does, showed a willing spirit initially but inefficiency in practice. After four frustrating attempts to contact Cutters (none of our calls was returned) we gave up on them. We found that only the very small specialist companies were knowledgeable about their products and willing and able to talk to us. They tended to be much better at supplying orders exactly as requested, and delivering them when they promised. We asked for three different sorts of preserved foie gras, all 100 per cent pure and simple. Foie gras d'oie entier en conserve. Entier is a key word here. Foie gras labelled like this must legally consist of whole lobes or a large piece of liver (with a small piece permitted only to make up weight). Samples tried were: 1. Andignac of Landes (supplied by Gourmet Products of France, Pounds 22.00 for a 180 gram jar). 2. Auguste Cyprien of Perigord, (supplied by Clark Trading Co, Pounds 19.50 a 130 gram tin). 3. Jean-Pierre Picot of Gascony (supplied by Traiteur Pagnol, Pounds 25 per 160 gram jar). Goose generally found less favour than duck but one taster voted the Picot goose a close second best to the overall winner, approving its 'fine colour, strong appetising nose and good length'. Others enthused less, describing it, among other things, as 'somewhat stiff','dense', 'too rich' and 'a little lacking in flavour'. The Andignac sample pleased by virtue of its 'pink flush appearance', 'good texture' and 'very good flavour - but not what I would expect from goose'. It was also rated 'rather coarse', 'chewy in the mouth' and 'cloying in aftertaste'. The Cyprien sample, approved by some for its texture and 'mealy' flavour on the one hand, also provoked the comment 'rather coarse, more like a brawn or a pork terrine'. Foie gras de canard entier en conserve. Whole lobes once again but this time duck rather than goose livers. Samples tried: 1. Andignac of Landes (supplied by Gourmet Products of France, Pounds 17.50 per 180 gram jar). 2. Auguste Cyprien of Perigord (supplied by Clark Trading Co, Pounds 18 per 130 gram tin). 3. Jean-Pierre Picot of Gascony (supplied by Traiteur Pagnol, Pounds 24.50 per 160 gram jar). We all prefered duck foie gras to goose, and were unanimous in giving our top vote to the Cyprien duck. The general gist of our comments here was good clean taste, good texture, good finish, good value. Again opinions were fairly united about the Andignac sample: 'dense flavour', 'quite full in the mouth', 'almost sweet' and the word 'buttery' cropped up repeatedly; while the Picot sample elicited the description 'cheesey' from almost all the tasters. Bloc de foie gras de canard en conserve. Bloc or loaf is a cheaper way to eat 100 per cent foie gras, a smooth blend of foie gras trimmings that is usually, but not always, studded with little nuggets of lobe - look for the words 'avec morceaux' on the label. Samples tried: 1. Auguste Cyprien of Perigord (supplied by Clark Trading Co, Pounds 12.75 per 130 gram tin). 2. Jean-Pierre Picot of Gascony (supplied by Traiteur Pagnol, Pounds 7 per 65 gram tin). Only two samples of bloc as Gourmet Products of France sell it fresh not fully preserved. Results were disappointing here. 'Quite nice flavour and good length but not special' was the most enthusiastic response that could be mustered for the Cyprien sample. Picot fared little better. Indeed it was described as 'meatily unsubtle, cloying, coating the mouth disagreeably' by one of our team. The overall winner by far, the best buy on all counts by common consent, was the foie gras de canard entier in a tin by Auguste Cyprien from Clark Trading. The only pity, we agreed, is that glass jars make more handsome and impressive gifts than tins. But taste is the most important thing, and the fact that tins are lighter and less fragile is an obvious postal advantage. It is undeniably true that the much more perishable fresh or mi-cuit foie gras is superior to fully preserved - the lesser heat treatment it has undergone permits texture and flavour to retain greater delicacy. With this in mind, Londoners may like to note that Gourmet Products of France sells fresh whole lobes of goose at Pounds 35 and duck at Pounds 29 per 300 grams, and en bloc of duck at Pounds 16 per 250 grams. Traiteur Pagnol also sells fresh lobes at Pounds 29 and Pounds 25 per lb for goose and duck respectively. Remember, these products need to be kept under refrigeration so take a cool bag when shopping. They are unsuitable for mailing. The greatest treat of all - as dazzlingly different as fresh alpine strawberries just picked from the wild versus a jar of ordinary strawberry jam - is high quality raw foie gras cooked to order. Foie gras lightly sauteed and served hot on salads, or garnished with quickly fried slices of apple or gently warmed grapes, makes an exquisite fast feast for a deux occasions. The other great foie gras delicacy is a freshly-made terrine. This has to be cooked ahead and is a spectacular party piece. To remind ourselves of this fact we tasted a terrine of foie gras specially prepared for us by Gordon Ramsay, of the much-lauded Aubergine restaurant at 11 Park Walk, London SW10 (tel:071-352 3449). Silkily smooth, with a sensuous melt-in-the-mouth texture, fine lingering flavour and a shiver of shimmering jelly on the side, it was food for the gods. As my colleague Nicholas Lander pointed out, when you taste something like this, and you think of the time and ingredients that have gone into its making, the restaurant charge of Pounds 12 per portion does not seem exorbitant. Aubergine does not, alas, sell its terrine of foie gras as a take-away. However, terrine of foie gras can be cooked to order for collection from the House of Albert Roux. Or, if you have the time and enjoy culinary adventures, you could buy raw foie gras and make your own terrine at home. Gourmet Products of France sells raw duck foie gras at Pounds 40 per kilo as does House of Roux at Pounds 18.50 per lb. A recipe for terrine of foie gras will follow next week.

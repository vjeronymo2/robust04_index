			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Mortgage Brokers: With more and more people crossing banks and S&amp;Ls off  their lists when they go shopping for mortgage loans, the state's mortgage  brokers have come into their own.  </P> <P> The brokers generally don't provide funding; they put borrowers and willing  lenders together. And mortgage brokers now are responsible for a majority of  the residential loan originations in the state.  </P> <P> So now they've formed an association -- the California Assn. of Mortgage  Brokers. One of the founding chapters is in Orange County.  </P> <P> The statewide group is headquartered in San Diego.  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Bhutto seeks minority party backing to form government MS BENAZIR BHUTTO, claiming a victory in Pakistan's general election which would return her to power after a three-year gap, was last night trying to form a minority government amid continuing uncertainty about the country's political future. Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party won 86 seats in Wednesday's poll for the 217-seat national assembly, emerging as the largest party but failing to win a majority. Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Moslem League leader, who supplanted her as prime minister in 1990, won 72. The rest were mostly shared by Islamic and provincial parties, religious minority groups and independents. To take power, Ms Bhutto needs the support of about 25 independent and minority party members, who tend to back the government in return for political and financial favours. Mr Sharif refused to concede defeat, insisting: 'I am confident that with the help of other smaller parties and independent members the PML can muster sufficient support to form a government at the centre.' But his chances were thought to be remote compared with Ms Bhutto. The next test for all parties is tomorrow's provincial elections. Attention will focus on Punjab, the most populous province, where Mr Sharif is thought likely to win and so prove a thorn in the side of the new government. Ms Bhutto's success in the third general election in five years follows months of political turmoil which culminated in the resignation of Mr Sharif's government in July. The interim government has pledged to transfer power to a new administration on October 19. The lack of an overall majority is likely to hamper efforts to achieve political stability. The recent upheavals have hurt business confidence and Pakistan's prospects of attracting foreign trade and investment. Businessmen in Karachi said yesterday they were glad the election was over, even though Ms Bhutto rather than Mr Sharif, their favourite, had emerged with the most seats. Ms Bhutto claimed that vote-rigging had robbed her of a majority, though she made no specific allegations. Second bite at the apple, Page 18</p>

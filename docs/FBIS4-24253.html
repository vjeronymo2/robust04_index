			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 27 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's Northern  Universities Students Association today condemned the arrest of  leading opposition figure Moshood Abiola and called on "all its  members and Nigerians to fight for the restoration of democracy"  in Nigeria, a communique from the association disclosed. The  Northern Universities Joint Campuses Committee [NUJCC] considers  Moshood Abiola's arrest as "the biggest blunder of the century  and evidence of the confusion that has hit the ranks of the  military junta" in power, according to the communique which was  passed to AFP.    The NUJCC voted "unanimously on a motion of defiance to the  Constitutional Conference" which was inaugurated today in Abuja  by Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha. For the NUJCC,  it is obvious that the delegates from the 30 states of the  federation to this conference "were not elected" because the  people did not take part in those elections. "How can delegates  handpicked by the government claim to be representing the  people?," the association queried in its communique, calling on  the government to put an end "immediately" to the deliberations  of the conference.    The communique was signed by representatives of the  Universities of Jos (center), Zaria, Makurdi, Kano, Yola,  Bauchi, Sokoto, Abuja, Minna, and Maiduguri (north).</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / 1992: better safe than sorry - Equity markets have taken a backseat to fixed interest securities The pre-Christmas wave of optimism which propelled the UK equity market to another new all-time high of 2842.0 last night (the FT-SE 100 Index is now up 14 per cent this year) is not typical of markets around the world. In fact, another poor year for the global economy, in which overall growth of the 24 nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is estimated to have been only 1.5 per cent, has formed the backdrop for a generally dreary 12 months for the world's capital markets. In these conditions fixed interest securities have often outperformed equities, although rapidly expanding government financial deficits have had the effect of subduing the bond markets too. Only some spectacular events in the currency markets have livened up the year and provide the more speculative investors with some handsome returns at limited risk, mainly by courtesy of the European central banks. As the year draws to a close, hopes for a global recovery look little better. The OECD has just knocked down its 1993 growth forecast from 3.0 to 1.9 per cent. And although some of the countries early into the recession are now showing signs of an upturn - certainly the US and possibly the UK - Germany and Japan may not yet have seen the worst. Investors are having to grapple with the evidence that this is not just another business cycle but that long-term structural changes are afoot. When leading industrial companies such as IBM are shedding tens of thousands of jobs, while the only rapidly-growing areas of the global economy are in regions such as southern China and parts of Latin America, it is a foolish portfolio manager who continues to extrapolate the long-term charts from the past. Certainly, shareholders had to dabble in stock markets such as Hong Kong and Mexico this year in order to achieve returns that were at all interesting in local currency terms. The best-performing national market in dollar terms has been Malaysia with a gain of 23 per cent. For sterling-based investors the numbers naturally look much better, given the pound's 13 per cent trade-weighted depreciation since last December 31 (and 18 per cent against the dollar). The British investor is showing gains of around 40 per cent in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Mexico, according to the FT-Actuaries World Index series. Overall, however, the World Index is down 7 per cent this year in dollar terms and is up just 12 per cent for investors who prefer to do their calculations in sterling. The pace is always dictated by the markets in New York and Tokyo, which account for two-thirds of the world index's weightings. On Wall Street it has been an amazingly steady year, with a year-on-year improvement of only 4 per cent. Moreover, 1992 has been the least volatile year for the US stock market in living memory, essentially because the recovery in the economy and therefore in corporate earnings was already discounted in 1991. Since then there has been a flood of money into equities from private individuals fleeing low savings deposit rates and buying large quantities of mutual funds. But, on the other hand, there has been a sharp rise in new stock issues and a certain amount of selling by foreigners who generally feel that Wall Street is overpriced. The net result has been stalemate. As for Tokyo, the well-managed slow-motion stock market meltdown has gone a stage further in 1992. This year's index fall has been 20 per cent (only Denmark has performed worse in local currency terms) and the Japanese equity market now accounts for only 26 per cent of world market capitalisation against about 45 per cent at its peak three years ago. The painful return of Japanese property and equity prices to more justifiable levels still poses a severe threat to the country's financial system, with the capital bases of the banks undermined. But Japan is better placed than most other countries in terms of fiscal balance and bond yields. Ten-year Japan government bonds (JGBs) now yield only 4.6 per cent, easily the lowest for any leading country. A UK investor who bought JGBs a year ago - when they were yielding 5.4 per cent - might not have seemed to be on to a good thing. But on top of that he has been able to add a modest local currency capital gain and, more importantly, a yen appreciation, in terms of sterling, of 22 per cent. The return has been a handsome 36 per cent. This kind of calculation has been the key to successful investment in 1992. While the more glamorous equity investors have taken an unaccustomed back seat the bond fund managers who trade fixed interest securities and currencies have grabbed the limelight. But once again a great deal has depended on the investor's base currency. In the UK, the global bond funds have enjoyed a great year, and are heading the unit trust performance charts. But it looks very different in the US where the strength of the dollar against many currencies in the past few months has caused many equivalent international fixed income funds showing returns which are meagre and sometimes even negative. Generally speaking bond yields have dropped in 1992, because the impact of the recession and the influence of lower inflation rates has outweighed the increasing flow of government debt as fiscal deficits widen. Average inflation, according to the OECD, will fall from 3.5 per cent in 1992 to 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994. But the average budget deficit is running at about 4 per cent of gross domestic product this year and next. Brokers James Capel have calculated that new borrowing by the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations next year will total a massive Dollars 750bn. Real interest rates, apart from in Japan and Germany (where inflation is still rising) are remarkably high. This ought to make bonds very good value, as they indeed have been this year. But there could still be problems if so much paper is issued that the markets find it indigestible. The UK government, for instance, is threatening to issue gilt-edged securities at the rate of Pounds 1bn a week during the financial year 1993-94. A real bull market in bonds will not happen until investors can see a way in which government deficits can be brought down. The bond investor's calculation must be that real interest rates will have to be brought down sharply. This could be done through an acceleration of inflation, but there are not many countries in which that is going to happen given the surplus of capacity in the industrial, farm and labour markets. In the meantime, attention has been focused on currencies. It was hard to make money by trading currencies when they were floating freely in the 1980s, but the growth of the semi-fixed rate European exchange rate mechanism proved to be a godsend for speculators. Politicians with short memories thought they could set exchange rates by dictat. For an amazingly long time they seemed to be right. But by the summer of 1992 the ERM lost its credibility, and unofficial and official member currencies of the ERM were picked off one by one: the Finnish markka, the Italian lira, the pound, the Swedish krona and the Norwegian krone. Other currencies, such as the Spanish peseta, could only sustain their position through exchange controls. By December, the French franc was coming under severe pressure for the second time. An old lesson was expensively relearned: central banks defending unsustainable parities against hopeless odds serve only to hand juicy profits to market operators. But the egg on the faces of governments often brought smiles to stock market investors. In the UK, the devaluation of sterling served to bring life back to the equity market. Investors do not directly have to speculate in currencies or buy foreign securities in order to benefit from a depreciation of their domestic currencies. In the UK, overseas and export profits - which are increased in sterling terms by a devaluation - account for almost half the earnings of London-listed industrial companies. Since Black Wednesday, London's FT-SE 100 Index of market leaders has climbed by almost 20 per cent, and similar strength has been shown by the equity markets in other devaluing countries. In Sweden, Finland and Italy stock market indices have jumped by between 18 and 53 per cent since the local currencies were unpegged from the D-Mark. At the core of the ERM the picture is much bleaker, however. German equities are a fifth below their May highs as industrial gloom accumulates. There is a similar picture in France. In the UK, fund managers are once again comfortable with their high exposures to equities. For as long as the British government struggled to keep sterling close to DM2.95 there was great worry that the corporate sector would be crushed between a fixed exchange rate and an inflexible labour market. Now, with the pound floating freely, there is more confidence that British companies can go on delivering the healthy dividend growth rates that UK institutions crave. Nevertheless many British companies have been crippled. The leading sectors this year have included water, electricity and food retailing, representing cosy monopolies or oligopolies which can brush aside the recession. But sectors such as chemicals, metals, aerospace and construction have slumped. Among the 100 shares in the Footsie the worst performers have included a variety of recession-hit industrials such as ICI, Arjo Wiggins and Fisons, while Lasmo and BP have been victims of the poor oil prices which have resulted from slow economic growth around the world. Portfolio managers have been obsessed this year by the timing of any recovery and the desirability of switching from recession-proof to recovery stocks. There have been one or two false dawns. Small companies have continued to perform badly for much of the year. But in the past few weeks another flurry in the second-liners has begun. More indices have been created to allow professional investors to follow better these swings and roundabouts among the big, the medium-sized and the small stocks. HSBC, the year's Footsie winner, is something of a freak, with the Midland Bank share price's takeover gains being compounded by the Hong Kong market windfall and the dollar appreciation bonus of its new parent, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Elsewhere, insurance and media recovery stocks dominate the top performers' list, and water companies such as Thames Water are a little way behind. For 1993, if more manufacturers and capital goods stocks do not feature in the winning list, something will surely have gone seriously wrong with the British economic recovery.  -------------------------------------------   WORLD MARKETS: THE RETURNS OF RECESSION  ------------------------------------------- FT-Actuaries World Index % change (dollars terms)  ------------------------------------------- Malaysia               22.92 Hong Kong              21.67 Mexico                 15.18 Switzerland            14.04 US                      4.62 Netherlands             1.02 France                 -4.59 Belgium                -5.90 Singapore              -6.81 UK                     -7.03 World                  -7.03 Finland                -7.41 New Zealand           -10.79 Sweden                -11.68 Germany               -11.85 Ireland               -15.73 Canada                -16.00 Austria               -17.53 Australia             -19.60 Norway                -20.07 Japan                 -20.55 Spain                 -23.08 Denmark               -25.58 Italy                 -29.31 South Africa          -40.69  ------------------------------------------- FT-SE 100 Index  ------------------------------------------- Top 10               % change HSBC Holdings          92.59 Granada                77.60 Siebe                  68.30 Guardian Royal Exchange63.96 Bowater                61.60 Carlton Comms          61.11 BAT                    58.28 Burmah Castrol         54.47 Argyll Group           51.97 Thames                 50.46  ------------------------------------------- Bottom 10            % change Wellcome               -9.36 Redland               -10.96 British Steel         -13.87 ICI                   -15.29 Ladbroke Group        -18.53 BP                    -21.84 Forte                 -22.75 Fisons                -30.98 Lasmo                 -32.29 Arjo Wiggin Appleton  -36.21  -------------------------------------------</p>

A child exposed to storage yard soils cross-contaminated by past users of chlorophenolics under typical conditions (consumption of 0.1 gram of soil/day for 160 days/year for six years) would be subject to an increased cancer risk of 7E&hyph;10 over a lifetime, or a chance of 0.7 in a billion. The estimated incremental population risk is also reduced approximately 1,000-fold (to 4E&hyph;7 cases per year over a 70-year period) for the anticipated increase in the development of cancer as a result of exposure to direct ingestion of soil contaminated with wastes from the use of cross-contaminated formulations for wood surface protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> One commenter remarked that the EPA failed to specifically address the incremental risks to subsistence fisher persons from consumption of fish/shellfish contaminated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection. EPA agrees that the risks to highly exposed sub-populations should be considered. The fish ingestion scenarios developed for the proposed rule considered exposure to a general population and recreational fisher at the outflow of a drainage area containing surface protection facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA used the analysis for the high end recreational fisher to approximate the risk to the subsistence fisher. Recent data show that the high end ingestion rate for a subsistence fisher is greater than for a recreational fisher by a factor of approximately 2. Therefore, the incremental risk for a subsistence fisher would not exceed a level of concern, since the projected risk to recreational fishers is much less than 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis of risks from fish consumption assumes that all fish in the drainage basin are contaminated. The estimates of PCDDs and PCDFs in fish tissue are based on sediment concentrations of these constituents. The sediment concentrations are estimated based on the erosion of contaminated soils from sawmill sites in a river or stream basin and subsequent dilution of contaminant levels by the erosion of uncontaminated soils from the corresponding drainage basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The projected risk levels increase as the size of the drainage area decreases, due to the relatively lower amounts of uncontaminated soil in smaller drainage basins. EPA performed an analysis which shows that, even with all exposure parameters set at values which would maximize the overall estimate of exposure, in order to reach a risk level of 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the drainage area would need to be 8,000 hectares or less, which is smaller than the smallest drainage area in the country. The average drainage area is 440,000 hectares, and the lower fifth percentile of the size distribution is 109,000 hectares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

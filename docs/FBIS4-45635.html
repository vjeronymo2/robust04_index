			<p>BFN     [Text] At the United Nations, Pakistan has proposed that  resources from the public sector, especially from industrially  developed countries, should be transferred to developing nations  for environmental protection so the process of sustainable  development can be continued. Addressing the high-level meeting  of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, Begum Nusrat  Bhutto, the prime minister's special envoy, proposed that  resources should be allocated for creating awareness among the  people about programs which can help protect the environment and  eradicate poverty. She said that Pakistan believes in the  process of sustainable development and like other countries is  also deeply concerned over the deteriorating natural  environment. She said that Pakistan feels concrete steps should  be taken at global and national levels for continued  development. Begum Nusrat Bhutto said that the Government of  Pakistan is aware of the importance of environmental protection  and the matter always remains in view while making decisions at  every level.</p>

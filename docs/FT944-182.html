			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Israel economy grows by 6.8% Israel's economy outperformed all 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations in 1994 with a growth of 6.8 per cent in gross domestic product, according to Israel's central bureau of statistics. Israel also led the field with a growth in per capita income of 4.3 per cent, although income remains low by western standards at Dollars 13,730. Fuelled, among other things, by an influx of 600,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union over the past five years, the economy has expanded at an average of 5 per cent a year since the beginning of the 1980s. Figures released this week show unemployment falling from 10 per cent in 1993 to 7.6 per cent this year. This puts Israel ninth among OECD states with the lowest rates of jobseekers. On the other side of the ledger, however, Israel registered the highest trade deficit and the second highest inflation rate. The trade deficit rose to Dollars 8.3bn, compared with Dollars 6bn last year. The consumer price index climbed to 12.3 per cent from 11.2 per cent in 1993. Private consumption leapt 9.3 per cent, investment in machinery and infrastructure by 17.3 per cent. While celebrating Israel's economic health, independent analysts are predicting a slow-down in 1995. Mr Ya'acov Sheinin, president of the Tel-Aviv forecasting firm, Economic Models, commented yesterday: 'These figures mean that the Israeli economy has huge potential.

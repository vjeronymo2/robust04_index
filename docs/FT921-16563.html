			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Most economists expect recession to end this year THE BAD economic news for 1992 is that unemployment hits 2.7m, public borrowing stretches to Pounds 20bn, and consumer spending manages to rise only 1.5 per cent above last year's levels. The good news is that the majority of economists expect the recession to drag to a close this year and not to linger on into 1993. These are some headline results of today's Financial Times survey of new year forecasts of the UK economy, which compares 1992 not with 1993 but with 1991, to give a fuller anatomy of the recession. Contributors sang a different tune as recently as last summer, when the last FT forecast table was compiled. Then the consensus among the economists from 23 universities, intergovernmental institutions, independent think tanks and City investment houses was that the recession would end in 1991. This survey reveals how the optimism vanished again after the summer into fears of a double-dip recession and the near-certainty that the general election would be fought against a tattered economic backcloth at best. The survey suggests that the occasional monthly expansion of output and retail sales volumes over the summer, combined with rosy surveys of business and consumer confidence, were not green shoots of economic spring as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hoped, but straws in the wind. In 1991 City economists and the Treasury alike were caught out by the extent and length of the recession just as they were overtaken by its speed and depth in 1990. The prospects for recovery this year remain hedged with the big uncertainties of unemployment growth, the depression in the housing market and growth recessions in the US, Germany and Japan. Economists have been slashing their growth forecasts for 1992 right up until the last moment. On New Year's Eve, for example, Professor Douglas McWilliams, the Confederation of British Industry's chief economic adviser, predicted GDP growth of just 1 per cent for this year compared with 1.7 per cent in the CBI's forecast of a few weeks earlier. Professor Wynne Godley, of Cambridge University, is the only economist who expects output to contract over the coming year, by 0.8 per cent after a 2.4 per cent fall in 1991. The average forecast for GDP growth of all contributors is 1.7 per cent in 1992, much less than the Treasury's Autumn Statement 2.3 per cent growth forecast. Forecasters expect the contraction in 1991 to be 2.2 per cent, in excess of the Treasury's November estimate of 2 per cent. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of GDP, and forecasters are relying on income growth, lower interest rates and lower inflation to tempt people back into the shops. The forecasters expect the year-on-year rate of retail price inflation to be 3.7 per cent by the fourth quarter. Underlying inflation should also show a decisive fall, as the recession further squeezes domestic prices and a firm exchange rate keeps the price of tradeable goods steady. With average earnings growth due to outstrip price rises - not to speak of the high-street bargains perennially available - consumer spending is due for a slight rebound of 1.5 per cent this year after dropping almost 1 per cent in 1991. Spending will remain subdued as consumers adjust their debt-income ratios to more sustainable levels. The housing market remains a concern, although economists do not see it as preventing a recovery so much as inhibiting its vigour. Unemployment will continue to mount to 2.7m (an average over the year) but at a slower rate than in 1991. This, combined with the squeeze on profits, and the constraint from membership of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), will make for a cautious consumer-led, rather than export-led, recovery. According to Mr Padhraic Garvey of Cambridge Econometrics: 'There are indications now that consumer confidence is improving, but rising unemployment is likely to discourage a sharp increase in borrowing.' Destocking is considered an important spur to growth. Mr Nigel Pain, of the National Institute, attributes much of its 2.1 per cent GDP forecast for this year to a stockbuilding turnaround. That sterling will not be devalued in the ERM, in spite of recent talk of a realignment among backbench MPs, must be regarded as a certainty in the light the chancellor's pledges. For this reason forecasters expect interest rates to remain high, although the government should be able to afford a cut of 1 percentage point by the end of the year. Most forecasts were made in December, however, before the Bundesbank raised Germany's Lombard rate by 0.5 per cent to 9.75 per cent, higher than during either of the oil shocks. The view of economists that there was room for cutting interest rates was also formed before sterling slipped to within a whisker of its permitted lower limit in the ERM, prompting fears that the next interest rate move would be up, not down. The government, it is thought, will do its best to take 0.5 per cent off the base rate before the election. One lasting hangover from the recession will be the sharp deterioration in the public sector finances. While the main thrust to demand will come from private-sector consumption, public-sector consumption will come a close second. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is to bulge to Pounds 19.6bn in 1992-93, after Pounds 11.2bn in 1991-92, largely reflecting cyclical factors but also the continual cost of mitigating poll tax bills and improving the public services. Mr Roger Bootle, of Greenwell Montagu, said: 'The size of the PSBR is not a problem.' Nor will the PSBR, apparently, preclude some 'cheap and cheerful' giveaways in the Budget. Most economists expect the Budget stance to be neutral - not lowering or raising the tax burden. But given the likelihood of a weak economy in March, many feel there is some scope for an income tax cut, or even an pre-election handout of up to Pounds 2bn, perhaps for the housing market.</p>

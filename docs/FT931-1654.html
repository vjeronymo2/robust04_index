			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines rise on traffic reports as Dow eases Wall Street EQUITIES turned narrowly lower yesterday afternoon in dull trading with only the transportation sector showing signs of real strength, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 1.62 at 3,461.68. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.04 at 448.84, while the Amex composite rose 0.38 to 419.56. The Nasdaq composite closed 1.59 lower at 675.03 after posting gains in morning trading. Trading volume on the NYSE was about 232m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 967 to 887. A surge in airline shares contributed to strong gains in the Dow Jones transportation average which climbed 20.15 to 1,551.14. Airline issues were lifted by reports of improved domestic traffic. An analyst at First Boston said that domestic revenues for the industry were about 6 per cent higher in February, above his expectations of 4.5 per cent growth, although he expected international business to decline by as much as 9 per cent in March. AMR, parent of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 63 7/8 , Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 51 7/8 , UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 120 3/8 and US Air improved Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/4 . Ford hit a 52-week high of Dollars 53, up Dollars  1/2 after Dean Witter Reynolds increased its rating on the stock to 'buy' from "hold'. The firm also increased projected earnings for Ford to Dollars 2.45 a share for 1993, from Dollars 2.25. Among other car makers, Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 and General Motors closed unchanged at Dollars 39 7/8 . Outboard Marine, a leading manufacturer of outboard motors, sank Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after the company said that a slow-down in European and US sales had hurt second quarter net income. Outboard Marine expects earnings in the three months to fall below the 10 cents a share it earned a year earlier. Drug company shares overcame their recent depression, with Merck rising Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37, Glaxo Holdings adding Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 and Johnson&amp;Johnson gaining Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 . In Nasdaq trading, shares in Retix plunged Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 6 1/2 after the software company said that it might break even or post a small loss in the first quarter and predicted that revenues might fall as much as 15 per cent in the quarter. Other technology issues were unable to hold onto their morning gains. Canada TORONTO prices ended higher in active trading boosted by a strong gain in real estate stocks. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 composite index gained 14.99 points to 3,598.73, with advances leading declines 342 to 319. Volume of 61.1m shares included two blocks of Royal Bank of Canada totalling about 2.8m shares. Real estate stocks jumped 3.87 per cent, as Cambridge Shopping rose 1 1/8 to 16 1/8.</p>

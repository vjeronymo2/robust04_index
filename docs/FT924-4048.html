			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Housing market uncertain BRITAIN'S two largest building societies disagreed yesterday over whether house prices were still falling or had started to rise after the latest mortgage interest rate cuts. Halifax, the country's largest society, with about a fifth of the mortgage market, reported that house prices had risen by 0.1 per cent last month, the first monthly increase recorded by the society since June. Nationwide, its nearest rival, said prices had fallen on average by 2 per cent in November, the second-largest monthly fall reported by the society since October 1991. The sharp difference between the monthly price surveys conducted by the societies illustrates the uncertainty in the housing market after sterling's withdrawal from the ERM in September. Nationwide said yesterday: 'The number of transactions is very low at the moment, so any movement tends to be exaggerated. It is very difficult, therefore, to draw any firm conclusion from a single month's figures.' Nationwide's survey was completed on November 23 while Halifax recorded price movements until the end of the month. Indications from builders are that sales, after a slow start to the month, picked up during the final week of November, which may explain some of the difference between the two societies' findings. Halifax and Nationwide said that it would take time for the recent reductions in interest rates to have an impact on the housing market. Prospective buyers, they said, continued to be concerned about rising unemployment and the state of the UK economy. Halifax said: 'We would expect volume sales to increase by about 15 per cent next year, in line with recent forecasts. Prices are much more difficult to forecast and predictions range from another small fall to a small rise next year. We would, however, expect prices to have begun to stabilise by the second half of next year.'</p>

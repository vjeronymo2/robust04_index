			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Under Prague's historic skin - Christian Tyler gets to the heart of the Czech Republic's multi-faceted capital PRAGUE from the air looks less like a capital city than a smiling country town to which a thoughtless 1950s planner has added overspill housing estates. In approaching this city, one of the great spectacles of Europe, one can choose instant gratification by ignoring the suburbs and plunging directly into the antique beauty of the Old Town. Or one can give Prague her due and savour the greater pleasure of unpeeling her, slowly, like an onion, from the outside. We had arranged to rent rooms in the suburban flat of a former Czech diplomat in expectation of a privileged introduction to the place. But his wife fell ill, the substitute apartment we were offered was too far from Metro and tram stops, and we ended up in a self-contained flat in the eastern district of Zizkov - conveniently close to the city's best tram route, the Number 9. The area was poor, the building was a grey 1930s block and music blared from behind the first door on the dank stairwell. But the flat itself, though plain by our standards, was big, clean and newly-decorated with bathroom tiles of a trendy toad's-belly design. I wondered if the landlord, a Mr Hranicka, ever lived there. It was unfamiliar but homely. We could watch the neighbours dressing and cooking in the flats opposite. A blackbird sang from the roof by day and the local drunks serenaded the street by night. Although the view from the windows was limited, from Zizkov we commanded, thanks to the Number 9 tram, a fine historical perspective of Prague. The tram picked us up in the grim neglect of post-war Communism, trundled past monuments of the city's industrial heyday in the 1930s, descended past the late-empire merchants' offices and deposited us near the gothic Powder Tower at the entrance to the old city. Prague's preservation owes a lot to the shame of Munich when Chamberlain and Daladier allowed Hitler to begin his eastwards expansion. What Hitler lost is today being peacefully reclaimed by German tourists and investors. The Czech Republic feels already part of western Europe (and one trembles for the future of its incomparable beer). I saw only one ugly reminder of the past, the words wir kommen wieder] scrawled on a wall. There are other reminders outside the city, such as Terezin, the former Theresienstadt concentration camp for Jews. The old city is crammed with tourists - it must surely soon overtake Amsterdam as Europe's hippy mecca - but has a carnival gaiety about it. The arena bounded by the theatrical facades of Old Town Square has become a vendors' market and circus. Some of the attractions are ingenious: boys were forging souvenir swords on a portable furnace; an animal trainer had terriers with ruffles round their necks jumping through hoops; a ferret stared out of an old mortar casing carried by an unshaven type in battle dress - presumably he was a central European exponent of the well-known Yorkshire virility test. If the old town can be claustrophobic, at peak periods the famous Charles Bridge is suffocating. The western youths who come to live and busk in Prague strum drearily on their guitars (sample from one monotonous troubadour: 'Just because you're going forwards doesn't mean I'm going backwards . . . '). They are outclassed by the native musicians: brass quartets, baroque ensembles, Dixieland bands, dulcimer-players, flugelhornists. Even the little old man scraping a violin while his wife kept time with a stick-shaped tambourine was putting his back into it. Indeed, though architecture is Prague's glory, music is its connecting theme. The sound of string-players tuning up drew us to the Chapel of Mirrors where we were able to watch a rehearsal before running round the corner to take in a choral concert in the dusty gloom of the Tyn Cathedral. Even the muzak in the restaurant where we dined that night (the excellent U Plebana in Betlemske square) was classical muzak. Architecture and music come potently together in the Tyl theatre, built in 1780, where Mozart conducted the premiere of Don Giovanni. It is a handsome, sideways-on building, recently restored and now a playhouse. Understanding no Czech, we paid our homage to Mozart by booking in, somewhat doubtfully, for a surrealist version of The Marriage of Figaro in a scruffy hall near the top of Karlova Street. We were not disappointed. As with the buskers and the souvenir-sellers, we were forced to marvel at the inventiveness of the Czechs. The opera, given in full, zipped along with an orchestra of 12 players; the singers were of conservatoire standard and the shoe-string production was farcical, ingenious and witty. It is as if the Czechs are still celebrating their release from the old regime (independent Slovakia has less to crow about) and westerners are welcome to the party. If you have not yet seen Prague, you should - and soon, too, before the hustlers and the crowds take all the fun out of it.

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO LAWMAKERS SLACKEN  </P> <P> Legislators raised $24.4 million last year for their reelection campaigns,  marking the first time in memory the flow of money into lawmakers' war chests  has slowed, California Common Cause reported Friday.  </P> <P> The figure, culled from campaign reports submitted to the secretary of state,  is 13% lower than in 1987, the last year in which there was no election. The  1989 figure compares to $27.4 million in 1987, the all-time high for off-year  fund-raising. Most campaign funds are raised during election years. Common  Cause spokeswomen were reluctant to credit the decrease to Proposition 73, a  1988 ballot measure that overhauled the state's campaign finance laws. Among  other things, Proposition 73 set limits on contributions for the first time.  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Ripa di Meana says Berlusconi cheating in poll Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister and media tycoon, is illegally using his dual position 'to steal an advantage and cheat the electorate' in next week's elections to the European Parliament, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the former EU environment commissioner, alleged in Brussels yesterday. Mr Ripa di Meana, now standing as an MEP at the head of the Italian Greens' list, presented a list of alleged infractions to the European Parliament, and demanded Mr Berlusconi's disqualification as a candidate for Strasbourg under EU electoral rules. He also said lawyers acting for the Greens were trying to bring a case against the Italian premier's tele-vision monopoly under EU treaty competition rules. The former commissioner called for an immediate inquiry by the European Parliament into the 'black-out conditions' for opposition campaigning because of the broadcasting monopoly exercised by the three private channels owned by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest holding company, and the three RAI channels controlled by the government. Campaign broadcasting had been cut by 30 per cent on RAI channels and 80 per cent on Fininvest stations, he claimed, although it is understood both groups agreed before last March's Italian general election to cut costs by cutting Euro-election coverage. The Italian premier is heading his Forza Italia list in all five of Italy's electoral colleges. So too, in line with traditional practice in Italy, are a dozen other prominent politicians for their parties. But Article 6 of the 1976 Act laying down rules for European elections, transposed into Italian law in 1979, states that members of national governments are ineligible for election as MEPs. Only in Luxembourg are existing ministers, including prime minister Mr Jacques Santer, heading lists for Strasbourg. But there, by contrast, the government is up for re-election in national polls the same day. Mr Ripa di Meana made clear this was 'only the first round' in his movement's attempt to impugn the Berlusconi government. The second round will focus on persuading Brussels to bring a court case against the Fininvest/RAI duopoly.</p>

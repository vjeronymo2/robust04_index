STATE'S CREDIT PLUMMETS  </P> <P> New York's budget woes took a dramatic turn for the worse as Wall Street's two  major rating agencies lowered the state's credit rating, leaving it with the  third worst rating among the 50 states.  </P> <P> Monday's credit downgradings could cost New York taxpayers millions of dollars  in higher interest payments on the state's debt.  </P> <P> Only Massachusetts and Louisiana are rated as worse credit risks than New York.  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has put blame for the state's third straight year of fiscal  problems on an unanticipated drop in tax revenues and the economic slowdown  that has hit the Northeast.  </P> <P> The state's budget deficit for fiscal 1990, which ends Saturday, is projected  at more than $1 billion. A $1.5-billion shortfall forecast for fiscal 1991  "continues to grow," Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said in announcing its  downgrade.  </P></p>

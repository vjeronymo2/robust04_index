			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 37-MONTH TERM GIVEN MAN FOR CROSS BURNING  </P> <P> A Westminster man who fanned racial fears last summer when he burned a  four-foot wooden cross in the yard of a black family was ordered Friday to  spend 37 months in prison for the crime.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts, describing the cross burning as  outrageous in its racial bigotry, opted for the harshest punishment that he  could give Gary Skillman, 24, under 1984 sentencing guidelines.  </P> <P> Skillman, who gave several conflicting statements about the incident but  declined to testify at his trial, told the judge in a Santa Ana courtroom  before sentencing: "I have nothing to say."  </P> <P> Left to puzzle over the actions of a man described as a white supremacist were  Alvin and Lillie Heisser, the targets of the burning.  </P> <P> "Why would someone do something like this? We've been trying to find an answer  to that for over 200 years," said Alvin Heisser, a past president of the local  NAACP chapter. While satisfied with the sentence, Heiser said the painful  memories "will never go away. It'll be there forever -- burning in you."  </P> <P> Skillman will remain in federal custody pending an appeal of the verdict and  sentencing, according to his attorney.  </P></p>

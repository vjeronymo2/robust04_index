			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARMENIANS BLOCK ENTRY TO RED ARMY  PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> A group of about 1,000 chanting Armenian demonstrators blocked the entrances to  Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on Thursday evening, delaying a concert by the  175-member Soviet Red Army Chorus and dance ensemble for more than two hours.  </P> <P> "We're trying to bring to public attention that the Red Army, instead of  protecting its citizens, is firing on people," said Berdj Karapetian, a  spokesman for the Armenia National Committee, one of two groups protesting  Thursday.  </P> <P> Rather than confront the demonstrators, police began escorting about 900  ticket-holders into the auditorium through a side door shortly after 10 p.m.  Several said protesters had pushed and shoved them as they stood in line to buy  tickets for the 8 p.m. show.  </P> <P> "I'm really aggravated," said Pat Radowitz, one ticket-holder. "I believe in  freedom of speech, but I also believe in my right to see a concert."  </P> <P> Police reported shouting matches between demonstrators and people trying to  enter the auditorium for the show. No one was injured.  </P> <P> The chorus was scheduled to appear in the United States in 1939 but was delayed  for 50 years because of World War II, the Cold War and years of East-West  tensions.  </P> <P> Thursday's performance was the first of four scheduled for Los Angeles through  the weekend.  </P> <P> As the ticket-holders entered the side door, police declared an unlawful  assembly and moved into the crowd of demonstrators, who dispersed peacefully.  </P></p>

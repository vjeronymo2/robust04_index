			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and  Cambodian government forces across the border from Aranyaprathet  intensified yesterday.    The Khmer Rouge 519 Division under Mit Sau pushed government  forces from Yeang Dangkum by burning villagers' houses and  soldiers camps, according to military sources on the border.    The government force was later holding its ground under  protection of artillery rounds fired from Ban Nimit base on  Route 5. More than 25 shells fell in Thailand around Non Mak Mun  and injured one Thai soldier.    About 200 Khmer refugees had been trying to escape the  fighting but were moved near checkpoint No. 27 of the 12th  Ranger Regiment at Ban Nong Chan, a safe area away from the  border. Another 300 Cambodians were scattered near the border.  An additional Khmer Rouge force was pressing the government base  at Ban Sing.    A military source in Aranyaprathet said fighting began about  noon yesterday about six kilometres south of Poipet. The Burapha  Task Force authorized warning smoke rounds to be fired north of  the government base after shells fell on Thai soil.    A task force source said the Khmer Rouge attack was  extremely  cruel with reports of decapitation in order to intimidate  villagers.</p>

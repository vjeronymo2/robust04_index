			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BERLINERS TO FEED SOVIETS;  </P> <P> COLD WAR RESERVES TO BE SENT  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pronounced himself and other Communists  "guilty before the working class" and promised immediate steps to improve food  supplies.  </P> <P> The Soviet president will get substantial help from Germany in that effort.  More than 40 years after Moscow tried to starve West Berlin into submission,  Germany said today it will help ward off hunger in the Soviet Union by donating  huge food reserves built up because of the infamous blockade.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said he had concluded agreements for the republics of Estonia,  Kazakhstan and the Ukraine to send dairy products to Moscow and Leningrad,  where milk is hard to find in stores. Food shortages have caused a public  outcry.  </P> <P> He also said powdered milk will be taken out of storage and distributed to the  people.  </P> <P> In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top foreign policy adviser, Horst Teltschik,  said Germany will give the Soviets the so-called Berlin reserves, replenished  over the years in case of another blockade.  </P> <P> Those reserves include, among other items, 66,000 tons of rye, 26,000 tons of  canned meat and 7,500 tons of butter.  </P> <P> Berlin officials, who urged Bonn to donate the food, estimated that it could  feed 10 million Soviets for one month.  </P> <P> A huge U.S.-led airlift broke the 1948-49 Soviet blockade, aimed at driving the  Western powers out of Berlin.  </P> <P> A daily airlift of supplies and tens of thousands of food packages sent by  CARE, the international relief organization, will also aid the crippled  Communist nation as part of a large-scale assistance program.  </P> <P> Germans are worried, however, that their donations could wind up in the Soviet  Union's growing black market. "We are supervising things ourselves," said Klaus  Noeldner, head of the German branch of CARE.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in a wide-ranging, hourlong speech before a conference of the Moscow  City Communist Party organization, also reiterated his determination to hold  the Soviet Union together.  </P> <P> Standing on a podium with an 8-foot-tall bust of Lenin, Gorbachev told the  nearly 1,000 conference delegates that he realized the country's food and  ethnic problems were intensifying and he urged the party to keep the common man  in mind.  </P> <P> "We are guilty before the working class, I think, all of us, and me  personally," the 59-year-old president and Communist Party general secretary  told the audience.  </P> <P> A Soviet government spokesman said today Gorbachev will go to the troubled  southwestern republic of Moldova (the former Moldavia) on Friday in an effort  to calm ethnic tensions that have split the republic and led to violent  clashes.  </P> <P> Gorbachev will go to the Moldovan capital of Kishinev for a 24-hour visit and  is also considering a visit to the Russian-speaking city of Tiraspol, Gorbachev  spokesman Sergei Grigoriev said.  </P> <P> Russians and Ukrainians in the Dniester region of eastern Moldova and  Turkic-speaking Gagauzis in the south declared separate autonomous regions  earlier this year because of fears that minority rights will be trampled under  Moldovan nationalism and the majority's desire to unite with Romania.  </P></p>

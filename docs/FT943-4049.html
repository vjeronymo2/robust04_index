			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: An unexpected bill for extra tax I recently sold some insurance bonds (a mix of managed and international units) bought some years ago for a useful capital gain. I declared this gain on my tax return but, in his wisdom, my accountant decided that the sale should be declared under 'all other income or profits' as a 'chargeable event'. The Inland Revenue has now added the full amount of the profit realised on the sale to my taxable income and requested payment at the 40 per cent rate. As a result, I am now faced with an addition to my tax approaching Pounds 2,000 instead of enjoying what I expected to be a tax-free gain. The bonds - from which I have drawn no income - are, in effect, an investment in unit trusts and, to my mind, should be treated as such for capital gains tax purposes. Are my accountant and the Revenue correct, or do I have a case? When you say that you 'sold some insurance bonds', we take it that what actually happened was that you surrendered a unit-linked, single-premium life assurance policy, or perhaps more than one such policy. That being so (and assuming that no top-slicing relief is available under section 550 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which we cannot tell from the limited data), the gain will be taxable at 15 per cent by virtue of section 547 (5) of the Taxes Act. Only your accountant has enough precise background facts, figures and dates to say exactly what your tax bill should be. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

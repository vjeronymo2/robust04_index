			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Pettersson's auspicious move on paper It be may luck, but Bengt Pettersson looks to be timing his leap from one pillar of the Swedish pulp and paper establishment to another rather well, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. He will be leaving Stora to take over as MoDo's chief executive on August 1 with at least two favourable developments as a background. First, MoDo's fortunes are on a clear upward trend; last week it announced its first quarterly profit for three years. Second, and perhaps more important, MoDo has recently resolved a long-running ownership battle which froze much decision-making for many months. It certainly helps that Pettersson does not come from SCA, the Swedish forestry group which was the losing party in the struggle. Pettersson is a respected forest industry manager, if little known outside the sector. He has strong credentials for the job, having been in the pulp and paper business for 28 years - 'quite a few cycles', as he puts it. For the past six years he has been managing director of Stora's packaging division, Billerud, which fared better than most of the company's operations in the industry downturn. Observers expect Pettersson's style to be different from that of Bernt Lof, who steps down after nine years as MoDo's chief executive. Lof's bullish industry prognoses, again in evidence last week, didn't always go down too well with analysts. Pettersson is coy about his immediate priorities. But high on his agenda will be the fate of Modo's packaging division, effectively earmarked for sale following the company's decision to concentrate on newsprint, fine paper and board. He may even question whether MoDo has the resources to develop as many as three core areas given increasing competitive pressures. Few would be surprised if he opts for an alliance or disposal in due course.</p>

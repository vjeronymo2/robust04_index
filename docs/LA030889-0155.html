			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOPE SEEN IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES  </P> <P> After several years of economic decline, many sub-Saharan African countries are  showing encouraging signs of turning themselves around, a World Bank report  said today.  </P> <P> "The evidence of the past three years leaves room for optimism," the report  declared. "These encouraging signs, though still preliminary, augur well for  the future."  </P> <P> The bank hopes the report will encourage the African nations to continue  reforms and encourage the international community to continue financial  support. "Prospects for recovery in Africa appear to be much sounder than a lot  of people thought," said senior economist Charles Humphreys, one of the  report's authors.  </P> <P> Many economic trends are becoming positive in the region, he said. Agriculture  has improved strongly, while exports, excluding oil, grew by 3% a year between  1985 and 1987.  </P></p>

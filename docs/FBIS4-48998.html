			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Guo Lingchun (6753 3781 </F> 2504): "Follow the Historical Tides and the People's Will"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 29 Apr (XINHUA)--The administrative and  economic subcommittees under the Preliminary Working Committee  [PWC] for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR]  Preparatory Committee are scheduled to meet in Hong Kong in  early May. People in Hong Kong have increasingly attached great  importance and attention to the PWC because the role it plays  has a close bearing on the smooth transfer of power when China  resumes exercising its sovereignty over Hong Kong, and also on  how Hong Kong will carry out the policy of "one country, two  systems" and enjoy a high degree of autonomy after 1997 on the  basis of the Hong Kong Basic Law. People of all circles fully  endorse the work the PWC has accomplished since it was  established nine months ago.    An organization whose establishment was authorized by the  state's highest power organs, and the members of which are  representative personnel in Hong Kong and China, the authority  of the PWC is unquestionable. At this stage when the British  have demonstrated no sincerity for cooperation, the PWC has  taken up the formidable task of taking part in drawing up the  blueprint for the development of Hong Kong--the "Pearl of the  Orient"--after 1997.    The various measures the PWC has taken following its  establishment show that it is pragmatism it underscores. Ever  since its establishment in July 1993, it immediately proceeded  to draw up plans in five areas--administrative, economic, legal,  cultural, and social and security. Later, its members travelled  between Beijing and Hong Kong, meeting one or two times each  month since the beginning of the year to discuss issues ranging  from the convergence of Hong Kong's current political system and  economic framework with the Basic Law, to issues about how to  expedite communications and transportation services between  Shenzhen and Hong Kong.    The PWC has been proceeding with its operations in an  orderly  and earnest manner: It has been "screening" one by one the  hundreds of regulations and statutes currently in effect in Hong  Kong, based on the principle that they should be converged with  the Basic Law. It has also started examining certain major  issues concerning the economy and people's livelihood, and it  has placed on its agenda the ways and means of stabilizing the  ranks of Hong Kong's civil servants. Some people have said that  while this important consultative organ has Hong Kong's future  in its view, it also has taken Hong Kong's situation into  consideration; and that while what it ponders upon and plans are  major and imminent issues relevant to Hong Kong's final  transitional period, all the issues are associated with Hong  Kong residents' vital interests. Hong Kong's media can see from  the region that the PWC's work is an "indication that Hong  Kong's political development has henceforth stepped into a new  era."    To build a new "kitchen" according to the Basic Law, PWC  members who have accepted this great trust have pooled the  wisdom of even more people in Hong Kong while releasing their  own energy. As a result of their lobbying efforts in Hong Kong,  many legal experts have taken part in consultations, and the  discussion of revising textbooks has started within educational  circles. While the PWC has reflected the wishes of more Hong  Kong people through rallying the strength of various quarters,  the efforts the PWC has made have also proved its representative  nature and credibility.    This new-born organ is now taking root among the public.  Since the end of last year, the PWC Secretariat, which is  located in Peddar Street on Hong Kong island, has sent 280  letters to various social groups to solicit their views on its  subcommittees' planning. Thus far, over 60 groups have replied  to express their views, over 60 people of various circles have  expressed their views through telephone calls, and 123 people  have expressed their support for the work done by the PWC and  hailed PWC members for having "stepped forward for Hong Kong's  smooth transition in 1997." A retired principal has sent 12  letters consecutively to state his views, and a friend from  cultural circles visited the PWC, offering to do "something  concrete and practical" for the PWC. Over 10 groups, including  different political organizations and nongovernment  institutions, have also directly stated their views while  meeting with the PWC's Hong Kong members. What they think and  worry about coincide with the PWC's on-going projects, namely  the convergence of laws, issues about the right of abode, as  well as exit and entry after 1997, education on state and  national concepts, and change of housing policies--issues  ranging from macroscopic understanding to suggestions on  minuscule matters -- and they have also urged people to watch  out for the "moves" of the British side during the remaining few  years.    Although the PWC's history has been short, its role cannot  be  underestimated. More and more countrymen in Hong Kong have  expressed confidence in it and placed great trust in it.  Shouldering the expectations of the people in the country,  including the people in Hong Kong, the PWC has been carrying on  with its glorious mission through soliciting constructive  proposals, working earnestly, and following the historical tides  and the will of the people.</p>

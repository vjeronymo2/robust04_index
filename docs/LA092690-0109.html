			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP SOLE SUPPLIER OF SENSOR, PANEL TOLD;  </P> <P> HEARINGS: A MARINE COLONEL SAYS THE NAVY HAD NO CHOICE ON A $300,000 SPARE  PARTS ORDER, EVEN THOUGH THE FIRM ADMITTED FAKING TESTS ON THEM.  </P> <P> The Navy has decided to partially waive a contract suspension against Northrop  Corp. so that it can obtain critically needed electronic sensors for its AV-8B  Harrier, which has been dogged by higher than expected failures of the part, it  was disclosed Tuesday.  </P> <P> Pressed by shortages of the sensor, the Pentagon has been forced to turn back  to Northrop for an estimated $300,000 spare parts order, even though the  company pleaded guilty last February to falsifying tests on the same sensor  system, a Marine Corps official told the House Government Operations Committee  Tuesday. The Marine Corps official said the Northrop part has become the most  trouble-prone part of the aircraft and could force the grounding of as many as  18 Harriers over the next 12 months.  </P> <P> The disclosure that the Pentagon is buying the same parts from the same company  by which it was earlier defrauded evoked harsh criticism at the congressional  hearing, which was called to look into Northrop's problems.  </P> <P> "A procurement system in which the Navy is forced to obtain parts from a  corporate criminal is intolerable," said committee Chairman John Conyers Jr.  (D-Mich.). "But it looks like business as usual for Northrop."  </P> <P> Marine Col. James G. Hart, the Harrier program manager, said the military  service has no choice but to go back to Northrop for the equipment because it  is the sole supplier of the part, known as a "rate sensor assembly," which  helps stabilize the AV-8B in flight. At present, the Marines have parked four  of the $22-million aircraft because the sensors are in short supply.  </P> <P> "Northrop has cheated all of us, not the least of which may be that young  Marine who needs that airplane," Hart said. "But I cannot compound that  mistake. We have to get those jets up."  </P> <P> The Marines have deployed to the Persian Gulf an estimated 60 of the two-engine  Harriers, which can take off vertically and are used to provide close air  support for ground troops. It is not known whether the problems with the  Northrop sensors have caused any operational problems for Marines in the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Hart testified that the Northrop sensors are failing after an average of 999  hours, while they were supposed to operate under contractual specifications  1,525 hours before failure. Hart described the component as a critical safety  item on the Harrier but said the failure of a sensor is not likely to cause a  crash.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, at least one fatality in a Harrier accident has been related to  the troubled Northrop sensor, Hart said, but he declined to discuss details  about the case because of military confidentiality about accidents. Northrop  spokesman Les Daly said later in an interview that the firm has no information  about any accidents related to a sensor failure.  </P> <P> However, Hart said that if a sensor failed during combat, it would seriously  degrade the ability of the Harrier and its pilot to defend against an enemy.  </P> <P> "The improprieties are a clear and present danger to our troops in the Persian  Gulf," Conyers said in an interview after the hearing. "In a potential military  situation, a failure could spell disaster for the ground troops that depend on  the Harrier for coverage."  </P> <P> The committee also heard testimony from two other witnesses.  </P> <P> One was Howard H. Hyde, former chief engineer at Northrop's Western services  department in Pomona who was convicted in the criminal case and is now serving  a prison sentence. Hyde, who was escorted to the hearing by federal marshals,  testified how he and Western services General Manager Charles Gonsolves  conspired to falsify tests on the sensors because they lacked the proper  equipment to test the devices.  </P> <P> And Ronald Deady, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, testified that he has  long suspected that the U.S. air-launched cruise missile, which uses another  Northrop sensor that was improperly tested, is defective and unable to meet  requirements.  </P> <P> Deady, now living in Lancaster and who formerly was a high-level official in  the cruise missile program, said he became alienated from the Pentagon  procurement system after he saw that the military itself conspired with  contractors to allow defective weapons to pass through the system.  </P> <P> "I had seen enough of this process that I was disgusted," Deady said. "I  personally could not put up any longer with seeing the taxpayer ripped off."  </P></p>

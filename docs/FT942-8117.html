			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Pinter - prince of pauses / Alastair Macaulay enjoys the wordless moments as much as the prose Sooner or later some bright Ph. D. student is going to publish a thesis on 'The Pause in 20th-Century Drama'. The origins of the pause will no doubt be traced back to Greek drama and to Shakespeare; Ibsen may be acknowledge as the secret godfather of the pause, and Chekhov as its undisputed father. The prose of Proust and Joyce, the poetry of Pound and Eliot, the films of DW Griffiths et seq., the music of Erik Satie and John Cage, will all be seen as major influences, and the importance of Stanislavski and Brecht will be given due weight. The Pause will be seen as one of the key technical and expressive devices of modernism. The pause in Beckett will be reassessed, of course, and given yet more honour. A revisionist chapter will give fresh credit to Joe Orton and Marguerite Duras for their hitherto under-praised use of the pause in all its ambiguities. Who knows? Maybe Coward and Rattigan will prove to have been secret masters of the pause as well. I confess that I await 'The Pause in 20th-Century Drama' with no small impatience. But it will stand or fall by its treatment of Harold Pinter. Readers of Pinter's plays will know that 'Pause' and 'Silence' are frequent directions in the text, and will have pondered the separate implications of both words. Theatre-goers, however, may feel that there should be more than two words to cover the wordless moments in Pinter. If the Eskimos have umpteen different words for snow, after all, why not as many for Pinter's pauses? He gives them umpteen different nuances. In One for the Road (1984), pauses are simply part of police-state interrogation. In four scenes, Nicholas, who is or seems to be chief of police, interviews a family of prisoners: husband, wife, seven-year-old son. The pauses here are filled with suspense. They are the prisoners' refusal to answer, their failure to comprehend the question, their shock at the nature of the question, and they are also moments in which the interrogator changes tack from one line of thought to another. As often in Pinter, one actually finds oneself wanting more pauses, for Nicholas - who does almost all the talking - jumps from one thought to another with bewildering fluency. The bewilderment is both ours and the prisoners'; and so, as we follow Nicholas's words, we begin to react as they do. Nicholas is a monomaniac, and his interrogation is at least half filled by his declarations of his own importance, his nearness to God, and his irresistible allure. As he proceeds, we sense something else: that all his talk only reveals the flaws of his own mind. Silence, by contrast, is golden. One for the Road was being performed in the second week of Dublin's Gate Theatre's Pinter Festival, along with Old Times (1971). Talk about contrast] Whereas One for the Road is (with Mountain Language) Pinter's most overtly political play, Old Times is entirely to do with a man (Deeley) and a woman (Anna) meeting, and in part competing, to stake personal claims upon the past and present of Deeley's wife, Kate. And whereas the several ambiguities of One for the Road (director: John Crowley) are not its most forceful feature, the ambiguities of Old Times (directed by Kevin Billington) keep growing. Deep beneath the surface, however, both plays express one of Pinter's most deep-held concerns: that no one can or should possess or control anyone else. In One for the Road, this point is immediately and overtly political. In Old Times, it is subtly and eventually feminist: Kate resists the claims of both husband and oldest friend, affirming her own independence no less than Nora in A Doll's House. Yet the play is no more about her than it is about the other two. Very beautifully, it shows time past within time present, and shows people using, and being used by, old times. Not only can no one be possessed by anyone else; eventually, no one can ever be known by anyone else. Here is the quintessence of Pinter. A brilliant gimmick of this festival has been to cast a leading actor, each week, in two plays. In Week Two it was Michael Pennington who played both Nicholas and Deeley. Pennington is one of the last of a line of those RSC stars whose command of vocal technique is (forgive the pun) breathtaking. His Nicholas is a bass, his Deeley a tenor. He can, as Nicholas, produce an effortless fortissimo - and then, as a psychological twist, produce an effort-ful fortissimo. His phrasing is always musical, and one attends to his every word. His only abiding fault - never a major problem, but a fault in Pinter as in Shakespeare  - is that he lacks the art to conceal his own art. In this pair of Pinters, however, I found that he slightly overplayed the contrast between the two characters. Deeley has his feeble side, sure; but if Nicholas is played so much as the sinister controlling figure, One for the Road loses its subtler tensions. This fault was shared by his Irish colleagues, who stressed the terrorised protesting side of the imprisoned family. The two women in Old Times, Olwen Fouere and Catherine Byrne, were also Irish. Doesn't the text suggest reverse casting? Though the play is set in England, Deeley slips into Joyce-like parlance ('bejasus'), whereas Anna's lyrical stream-of-consciousness flights sound rather Virginia Woolf. This hardly matters, however. All the Irish actors bring a naturalness to Pinter that frees his plays of the hothouse atmosphere that can, in England, become precious. And a common theme throughout the festival has been the designs by Eileen Diss. Their elegant economy is always in ideal accord with the plays. At each performance the Dublin audience responds readily to Pinter's humour, lyricism, and deeper humanity. The Pinter Festival ends this week with a matinee of Landscape and evening of Moonlight.</p>

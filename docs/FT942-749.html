			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Partnerships in business grow Growing numbers of UK companies are developing friendly 'partnership' relations with their purchasers and suppliers, a survey has found. Twenty per cent more businesses than a year ago are using 'partnership sourcing' - a system in which purchasers and suppliers seek to set up long-term, collaborative relationships with each other based on more than cost analysis. Nearly three quarters of purchasers and 61 per cent of suppliers use the practice, according to the survey by the Partnership Sourcing group, a non-profit making body established by the Confederation of British Industry and the Department of Trade and Industry. This compares with 56 per cent of purchasers and 36 per cent of suppliers who used the system a year ago, said the Partnership Sourcing group. For the first time in the four years of the survey more than 90 per cent of companies said they had heard of the concept. But in spite of growing awareness of an idea which has recently become popular in information technology and electronics, the survey showed that companies had found that adopting partnership sourcing was more time-consuming and difficult than anticipated. Out of 300 companies questioned across a number of industrial sectors, 41 per cent said that 'co-operation with the other party' was a key difficulty. In total 85 per cent said that partnership sourcing had enabled them to cut costs, 67 per cent said they had been able to improve delivery times, 81 per cent said they could improve the service they gave their customers and 78 per cent said they had improved product quality.</p>

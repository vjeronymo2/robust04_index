			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Mozambique poll First Angola, now - it seems - Mozambique. The last-minute decision by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the former rebel Renamo movement, to boycott Mozambique's first multi-party elections is a potentially devastating setback to hopes for a lasting peace in the country, as well as a blow to the wider vision of a stable southern Africa. Mr Dhlakama's claim that 'massive fraud' left him with no other choice is far from convincing. The presence of a 7,000-strong United Nations monitoring force, as well as some 2,000 international observers, may not be enough to guarantee an election entirely free of abuse. But it should be enough to detect irregularities on a large scale. Yet the proper response to Mr Dhlakama and his party is not suppression. Renamo, dismissed by many as no more than a creation of white Rhodesia and subsequently adopted by minority-ruled South Africa, has proved surprisingly resilient. Its support cannot simply be explained by intimidation, notwithstanding its atrocities during the civil war. It has been able to exploit ethnic and regional differences and, not least, hark back to the dismal record of the ruling Frelimo party, now led by President Joaquin Chissano, in its early years in government. Frelimo's nationalisation programme proved disastrous, its approach to government authoritarian until it accepted multi-party elections two years ago, and its own human rights record far from clean. If pressure from southern African states and western governments can make Mr Dhlakama change his mind, the election can be put back on track by extending voting over one or two more days. The chances of Mr Dhlakama changing his mind seem slim, however. Mr Chissano, the likely winner even had Renamo participated in the poll, should seek to defuse Renamo's challenge by making clear that irrespective of the outcome of the poll he will form a coalition administration. There is no significant ideological difference betwen the two parties. Any conceivable government would have to carry on with reconstruction of the country under the World Bank's structural adjustment programme. Further, such is the country's acute shortage of skills, it simply does not have the personnel now to sustain a conventional opposition. Allocating an appropriate share of government posts to Renamo will be difficult, especially since Mr Dhlakama has deliberately removed the only reliable way of gauging his support. Distaste at his tactics should not, however, deter his opponents and the western donors on whose support Mozambique depends from seeking some accommodation. Renamo possesses the capacity to destabilise post-election Mozambique as the rebel Unita movement did Angola. Accepting it in a government of national unity would be a small price to pay for averting a renewed civil war.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> O'NEAL, TEAM COMPROMISE ON CONTRACT  </P> <P> Outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal, a Pro Bowl alternate last season, has agreed  in principle to a two-year contract, Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard  said Saturday night.  </P> <P> Both Beathard and O'Neal's agent, Marvin Demoff, had said the deal was close  for the past week, but final terms weren't put in place until Beathard and  Demoff met Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Beathard said the deal won't be finalized until Demoff gets approval from  O'Neal. Beathard was unable to reach Demoff Saturday for confirmation.  </P> <P> The contract was a compromise for both sides.  </P> <P> "I think it worked out in the middle of where (O'Neal) wanted it and where we  wanted it," Beathard said.  </P> <P> O'Neal, who met with Beathard Wednesday at UCSD, said he has been keeping in  shape by running. This has been his longest holdout. He missed all of the 1987  season and half of 1988 with a knee injury. DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

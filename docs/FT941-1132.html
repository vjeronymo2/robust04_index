			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Next buys Clydesdale consumer credit side The break-up of Clydesdale Group, the Scottish-based electrical retailer which went into receivership in January, continued yesterday with the purchase by Next, the fashion retailer, of Clydesdale's consumer credit business. Next's Club 24 subsidiary provides consumer credit and services for Next and other businesses such as Kingfisher, British Telecom, Yorkshire Water and Yorkshire Electricity. The Next credit card now accounts for less than a fifth of Club 24's business. Next is paying some 23.5m for the business. The assets are mainly consumer credit receivables resulting from sales made in Clydesdale stores. Next is buying the receivables on a discounted cash flow basis, with most expected to be collected over the next 18 months. It said it expected to develop additional business following the purchase. Grant Thornton, the receivers, have now made sales totalling about Pounds 65m, compared with claims of creditors estimated at about Pounds 80m. There are three businesses left - about 70 high street shops, the servicing business and a captive reinsurance company. However, Grant Thornton was not optimistic that sales of these activities would add significantly to the total proceeds.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> In sports: The Rams travel to Massachusetts to take on the New England Patriots  today at 1 p.m. The Rams, at 10-5, can make the playoffs as a wild card with a  win. Even if the Rams lose, they will still qualify if the Minnesota Vikings,  the Green Bay Packers or the Washington Redskins lose. The Rams have won five  of their last six, including road victories against New Orleans and Dallas. The  Patriots are 5-10 but have won three of four games with the Rams -- including  the last two -- in 1983 and 1986.  </P></p>

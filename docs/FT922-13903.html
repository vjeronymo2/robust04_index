			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Court allows more time for MCC plan THE court-appointed administrators of Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC), the UK-based company once controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, have been granted a 60-day extension of their exclusive right to file a reorganisation plan for the company. The delay was granted on Tuesday night by Ms Tina Brozman, the New York bankruptcy court judge who has overseen the running of MCC since last December, when the company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. MCC is operating under a complex arrangement that permits the Macmillan publishing company and Official Airline Guide, both MCC subsidiaries, to function in the US and requires co-ordination between New York and UK court administrators of the Maxwell empire. Judge Brozman granted the extension, to June 15, saying the complexity and time- consuming research required to ascertain the disposition of assets warranted the ruling. Time Warner, the US entertainment and media group, has agreed to buy Maxwell's British publishing business, Macdonald and Co, for an undisclosed price.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Strong medicine restores US banks - The changing fortunes of a hard-pressed financial sector Pandemonium. Feeding Frenzy. Panic Buying. Those are some of the more colourful adjectives being bandied around Wall Street this week to describe a remarkable rise in the price of bank shares following the industry's release of surprisingly strong first-quarter figures. Shares in Wells Fargo, the large California-based banking group, stood over 19 per cent higher at yesterday's New York close than on Tuesday, just before it announced far better than expected figures. Shares in Citicorp, the nation's largest banking group, were 13 per cent higher than before its results announcement. Analysts have been scrambling to raise their 1992 banking profits forecasts. Mr Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein said he had raised estimates on 60 per cent of the businesses he tracked. Why the sudden surprise? After all, the fundamental forces reshaping the US banking industry have been visible to industry observers for some time. For the past 18 months the sector has been grappling with crisis levels of commercial bad debt, the result of imprudent lending to the over-heated US property sector in the 1980s and the more general impact of recession on businesses' ability to service loans. The banks have clearly been on a slow, gradual path to recovery as they have taken large doses of medicine, including heavy bad debt provisioning, slashed dividends, mergers, the sale of non-essential assets and big cuts in their bloated operating costs. What has surprised Wall Street this week is the speed at which these actions seem to be producing results. This, coupled with a singular absence of nasty shocks during this reporting season, has reinforced the perception that the industry has turned the corner. The outlook was brighter than at any time in the past five years, said one analyst. That may be so, yet the capacity of individual banks to produce some unpleasant surprises over the next few months should not be under estimated. The property market, in particular, could produce more problems, particularly in southern California. Three factors lay behind the greater-than-expected profits increases of the last quarter. A stabilisation, or drop, in banks' provisions for bad commercial loans. For example, Chemical Banking, which merged with Manufacturers Hanover at the end of last year, saw its loan loss provisions drop from Dollars 450m in the fourth quarter to Dollars 375m, some Dollars 50m below the market's expectations. Citicorp, the largest US bank, which has suffered severe credit quality problems, reported a rise in net loan loss provisions from Dollars 1.15bn at the end of last year to Dollars 1.23bn. Its heavy exposure to bad property loans was underlined by the fact that Dollars 588m of the total involved North American commercial real estate, up from Dollars 562m the previous quarter. However, there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel. Mr John Reed, the chairman, said the domestic real estate portfolio had stabilised and while he was forecasting commercial credit write-offs this year at roughly the same level as 1991, the position was expected to improve in the second half. Yet analysts remain uncertain as to whether the precipitate drop in real estate values over the last few years has touched bottom, or whether there could be further to fall. Particular doubt surrounds heavily overstocked southern California, where many analysts believe the property market is still weakening. Wells Fargo, in spite of its strong first-quarter operating performance, nevertheless suffered a 9 per cent rise in non-performing assets, compared to the fourth quarter, and many analysts remain cautious about its outlook. Improving net interest margins. This is the difference between what a bank pays to borrow funds and what it charges to lend money. Margins have been generally improving, albeit with substantial regional variations, for much of the past year. This was helped by the Federal Reserve's lowering of short-term interest rates and lesser reductions by banks in the cost of borrowing. Cost cutting. Financial crisis has forced banks to slash their costs, either through internal shake-ups or mergers with rivals. The positive effects of these moves showed up strongly in first-quarter figures. For example, Citicorp, which cut its workforce by about 1,000 people during the quarter, to about 85,000, produced a 6 per cent cut in expenses. Chemical said it saved Dollars 50m during the quarter thanks to workforce reductions following the merger with Manufacturers Hanover. Its ratio of non-interest operating expense to total operating revenue improved to 62.6 per cent from 65.5 per cent in the fourth quarter and the bank said it was on target to realise Dollars 750m of savings by 1995. These factors, together with asset sales, have helped banks repair their capital ratios, with even laggard Citicorp showing a substantial improvement in the quarter. Its total risk-based ratio stands at 8.12 per cent, above the regulatory minimum, while its Tier One ratio - which must be above 4 per cent by the end of the year, according to the Basle agreement - rose to 4.06 per cent. Wall Street expects the sector's earnings to continue growing for the rest of this year and into 1993 as provisions decline, interest margins remain strong and expense cutting works its magic. Rising interest rates could dent the performance, as could a trend to lower rates on credit card receivables. But by next year, assuming the economy continues its recovery, these factors should be outweighed by a resumption of loan growth. Yet for all this week's euphoria, much of the sector still has a long way to go to restore its profits and ratios to levels which are satisfactory by historic standards. Citicorp may have doubled its quarterly net income to Dollars 183m, but this is small for a bank with assets of Dollars 217bn and it would probably have lost money without a hefty contribution from asset sales. Mr Reed said that there was still a great deal to do when he told Citicorp's annual meeting that the group aimed to restore its normal earnings capacity by the end of this year and put its capital problems behind it by the end of 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US BANK RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  1st Quarter        Per cent     Net interest                    1992 net          change       margin (%)                 income DollarsM     on year    1st Q 92 v 1st Q 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banc One              179             +38         6.82       6.17 BankAmerica           303              +7         4.64       4.32 Chase Manhattan       141             +21         3.93       3.83 Chemical Banking      260             +44         3.72       3.07 Citicorp              183             +97         3.76       3.66 NationsBank           310             +95         3.89       3.81 Wells Fargo           119             -22         5.70       5.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compiled by Rivka Nachoma, New York  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

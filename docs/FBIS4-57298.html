			<p>BFN     [Text] President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, upon his  return yesterday from Mexico City, confirmed that the government  will sign a free trade agreement with Mexico before the end of  the year.    Calderon Sol, who will assume the presidency on 1 June, said  that "if negotiations continue at their current rate," the  treaty could be signed before the end of President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's term, set for 1 December.    The president-elect met with several ministers and local  business representatives during his visit to Mexico. The  purpose was to measure the degree of interest in investments in  El Salvador. He said this was only possible "thanks to the  stability of the democratic system and the peace process, which  have given the county prestige."    In statements to the Mexican press, Calderon Sol expressed  his willingness to establish a common market, since this would  open operations to 120 million consumers, 30 million of which  are in the Central American isthmus.    If no agreement is signed during President Salinas de  Gortari's mandate, talks would continue with the new president  to be elected on 21 August. The new Salvadoran president said  that signing a free trade agreement with Mexico would be the  first step toward reaching a similar agreement with the United  States.    On 23 May Calderon Sol will fly to Washington to meet Vice  President Al Gore, who will host a summit meeting several days  later to discuss NAFTA with all of the Central American  presidents. In commenting on his scheduled trip to UN  headquarters in New York, the president-elect said he had "no  concerns at all about addressing any topic with the secretary  general." He was referring to statements made by Chief Justice  Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, of the Supreme Court of Justice,  during the opening session of the Legislative Assembly.    He explained the purpose of his trip was to express the  political will to fully comply with the peace agreements and to  request aid from the United Nations, through agencies such as  UNICEF, FAO, and the WHO. He said that, belonging to this  international forum, El Salvador has a right to the programs  these agencies offer. Therefore, it can request such aid "with  dignity and authority."</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IOC OFFICIAL: STEROID USERS DESERVE LIFETIME BAN;  </P> <P> ANITA DEFRANTZ SAYS STRICTER PUNISHMENT NEEDED FOR THOSE TESTING POSITIVE  </P> <P> Athletes who test positive for anabolic steroids should be banned for life from  competing in the Olympics, one of two International Olympic Committee members  from the United States said Monday.  </P> <P> Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and  an outspoken anti-steroid crusader, said she intends to submit that proposal to  IOC members at their annual session next month at San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> She said that she has not spoken with IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch or  any of the other members about the proposal but believes it will be  well-received.  </P> <P> Under current IOC rules, an athlete can compete in the Olympics if he is  eligible under the international rules of his sport.  </P> <P> But as a result of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson's disqualification at the 1988  Summer Olympics after testing positive for a steroid and subsequent revelations  that he had been using the drug since 1981, there has been sentiment among some  sports officials for stricter penalties.  </P> <P> According to the rules of track and field, Johnson can return to competition in  September of 1990 and is eligible for the 1992 Summer Olympics. DeFrantz said  her proposal would not apply for Johnson because it would not be retroactive.  </P> <P> "Our (IOC) medical commission has stressed rehabilitation of athletes who are  using steroids, but I think it's time to send a stronger message," she said.  "It's not like athletes are taking them because they have a cold. They're  taking them to cheat."  </P> <P> One person urging support of the proposal is Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic  gold medalist in the intermediate hurdles who is a member of the IOC's athletes  commission and chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee's substance abuse  committee.  </P> <P> "I think the IOC athletes commission would favor that," Moses said. "So far,  we've tended to go along with the IOC. But I think we have to do something  that's going to have more effect in stopping the problem. Scare tactics about  the health risks of steroids haven't worked. Maybe the answer is lifetime bans  for those who are caught."  </P> <P> DeFrantz and Moses made their remarks at the end of a two-day conference at the  Amateur Athletic Foundation that was described as the nation's first consensus  meeting on the dangers of steroid abuse. It was sponsored by the AAF, the USOC,  the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. and the National Federation of State  High School Assns.  </P> <P> Focusing on four areas -- research, education, testing and rehabilitation -- a  report will be submitted to William J. Bennett, who is charge of the Bush  administration's drug-control policy, in September.  </P> <P> "There's no question it was a worthwhile meeting," USOC executive director  Baaron Pittenger said. "We developed an atmosphere in which there can be  broader cooperation than we've ever had, and I think there will be some  significant developments along these lines as we build on this foundation."  </P> <P> Pittenger said he was particularly impressed by a presentation made Monday by  cyclist Cindy Olavarri of Albany, Calif., who was disqualified from the U.S.  Olympic team in 1984 after testing positive for a steroid and since has  reported various physical and emotional side effects from her use of those  drugs and others.  </P> <P> "Life was very difficult for her the year after she was suspended," Pittenger  said. "But no one from the USOC or from the cycling federation called her to  find out how she was doing. I don't think any of us have given enough thought  to what our responsibilities are to athletes who have fallen victim to  steroids."  </P> <P> Emphasizing that he was not stating a USOC position, Pittenger said he did not  think DeFrantz's proposal would be popular with most international sports  federations and National Olympic Committees.  </P> <P> "Right now, I'd have to say that I've observed a willingness among the  federations to have standardized rules and sanctions," he said. "But everybody  I see tends to lean toward a two-year suspension for the first violation and a  lifetime ban for the second."  </P></p>

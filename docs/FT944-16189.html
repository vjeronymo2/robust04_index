			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Body Shop There was little to complain about in yesterday's figures from Body Shop. The adverse publicity which has swirled around the group this summer has had no perceptible impact on sales. The decline in like-for-like turnover in the UK, a feature of the results in 1992-93, has been arrested. The expansion of the retail network continues apace, especially in Asia where sales were up 46 per cent in total and 91 per cent ahead in Japan alone. Despite all the worries that surround one of the last 80s go-go stocks still to be going, the Body Shop formula seems to be in good order. The number of shops operated around the world should rise from 1,136 now to at least 2,000 by the end of the century. Two doubts remain. The first is the US, where Body Shop, on its own admission, has a weak market position reflected in a 1 per cent drop in like-for-like sales in the first half. Body Shop is hoping to tackle this with intensified marketing and advertising. The second problem is mounting competition in the UK. Today the first Bath &amp; Body Works opens, a joint venture between The Limited, a powerful US retail group, and Next. Over five years this may pose a serious threat. In the short term, though, Body Shop's earnings momentum will not be endangered and the shares' premium rating seems justified.</p>

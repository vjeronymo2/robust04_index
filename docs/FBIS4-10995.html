			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Returning from a Latin American tour last night,  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said our country cannot  wait for the normalization of relations with the United States  to take into account citizens who live abroad. The merit of  this meeting with emigres lies in the fact that even in abnormal  conditions, Cubans from inside and outside the country have  decided to hold a dialogue to resolve their common concerns,  Robaina said.    Robaina said that during his Latin American tour, he  confirmed there is concern among Cuban emigres and residents of  the countries he visited over the critical situation of the  Cuban economy and interest in helping the country resolve it.</p>

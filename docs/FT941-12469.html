			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: An ugly way of life - Clive Fewins meets a man who makes gargoyles The hands that carved 1,000 gargoyles are still hard at work. Now 74, veteran sculptor and stonemason Michael Groser still chips away, paper hat on head, whenever he receives a call from an Oxford college that a vital part of its structure is in need of replacement. The call usually comes from an architect or a contractor. But whatever the intermediary, Groser's work is stamped indelibly on the Oxford skyline, and on the interiors of parish churches and other buildings. Many of the hundreds of pinnacles at All Souls college, each adorned with a profusion of crockets, or little stone bulges, are Groser replacements of medieval originals. At the same college most of the replacement carving on the famous twin Hawksmoor towers are Groser's, while at New College there are some 200 carvings by him. Groser sang in the college chapel, as a salaried lay clerk, for 27 years. Singing was his first career after he left university and theological college, where he spent 18 months before he decided against following his father into the priesthood. In spite of acquiring an Equity card and acting in two films, Groser settled for architectural sculpture, being drawn to Oxford from London in 1955 by the lure of work and the fact that his wife Eileen was born there. It was the time of the great drive to restore many of the colleges, and by the early 1960s Groser found himself in demand by local builders. He soon found he had the ability to mimic the medieval styles. The little stone demons, wrestlers, bishops, horsemen and dogs, as well as figures with all manner of afflictions from gumboils to large warts stare down at the observant visitor. Gargoyles, properly named grotesques, were a sort of medieval joke, introduced by stonemasons. They are also believed to represent the last vestiges of paganism - guarding the Christian buildings against the pagan forces the faith had subdued. Whatever their origins, gargoyles and grotesques were often caricatures of well-known faces in the medieval town. Michael Groser's work carries the same humorous stamp. At the Oxford church of St Peter in the East - now the library of St Edmund Hall - he was commissioned to carve 12 faces; the principal, bursar, librarian and a past principal among them. Others include the foreman, chief architect, and managing director of the main contractor at the time, and Groser himself. That is not the only college building in which Groser's stone caricature appears. In one other he is wearing the familiar daily newspaper hat that he always makes for himself to keep the dust out of his hair. As well as being a caricaturist in stone, Michael Groser is also a wood carver of note. Examples of his work can be seen in Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, Wells Cathedral, St Stephen Wallbrook church in London and, more recently, as part of the National Trust's major restoration of Waddesdon Manor near Aylesbury. 'Generally I prefer working in stone. You are not constantly sharpening tools, as with wood, and you have to be thinking about the work all the time,' he said. 'It's nice to think that many of the stone grotesques I have replaced date from around 1390 and it's even nicer to think that many of my replacements should also last about 600 years,' he said.

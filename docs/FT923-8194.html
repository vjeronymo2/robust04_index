			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Dockers clash with police at Dunkirk FRANCE'S dock dispute yesterday took a violent turn with a demonstration outside a Dunkirk court where five dock workers were being tried for criminal damage. Police accused militant dockers of intimidating fellow employees. Hundreds of dock workers gathered outside the court and clashed with police when news broke of the five being charged with causing damage to port property in connection with incidents at the weekend. The demonstrators cheered when two dock workers were set free after being questioned by the police. Yesterday's demonstration came after months of unrest at Dunkirk and other French ports where dockers have been protesting against new legislation which cuts jobs and changes employment conditions radically. The laws are intended to modernise the labour system by phasing out the union-run practice of hiring dockers on a casual basis by making them salaried employees. French unemployment continued to rise during the second quarter with sharp increases in lay-offs in the building and industrial sectors.</p>

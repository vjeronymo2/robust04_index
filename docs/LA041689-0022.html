			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXES  </P> <P> The great thing about democracy is that we pretty much deserve what we get.  Ronald Reagan and his string-pullers didn't make any secret about the fact that  they believed in lower taxes for the rich. Now is not the time for those of us  in the middle who have to make up the shortfall to scream and rend our  clothing. After all, we are the very ones who put him there -- not once but  twice -- and then elected his veep for yet another four years!  </P> <P> Have no pity, George -- sock it to us.  </P> <P> FRANK LAROCHE  </P> <P> Ladera Heights  </P></p>

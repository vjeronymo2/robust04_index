			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIMEDYNE GETS FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET COLD LASER  </P> <P> Trimedyne Inc., a medical laser catheter manufacturer struggling to revive  flagging sales, said Monday that it has received approval from the Food and  Drug Administration to market the first so-called "cold laser" for opening  blocked arteries of the legs.  </P> <P> Trimedyne in 1987 was the first company to win the FDA's approval to market a  laser-powered "hot-tip" catheter to sear through fatty plaque in leg arteries.  The hot laser uses laser energy to heat the metal tip of a catheter, which is  then threaded through the arteries to vaporize the blockages.  </P> <P> But sales of the hot laser fell off when the medical community expressed  preference for an alternative technology known as a "cold laser." A cold laser  uses a free beam of laser-produced light, administered in short bursts, to  remove the plaque without producing significant heat. Doctors prefer it because  they want to eliminate the possibility of thermal damage to healthy tissues.  </P> <P> While Trimedyne's hot laser has shown success in opening clogged leg arteries,  the FDA has not yet approved it for use in the heart. The market for using  lasers to unblock clogged heart arteries is estimated by Trimedyne to be worth  up to $800 million a year.  </P> <P> Trimedyne began developing a cold laser about two years ago.  </P> <P> Richard Demmer, Trimedyne's executive vice president, said his company's  Omni-Pulse laser, approved by the FDA, is powered by a holmium crystal that  generates short bursts of ultraviolet light to vaporize plaque.  </P> <P> "The medical world has said the cold laser is the way to go and now we have met  the challenge," he said.  </P> <P> However, Demmer said it's too soon to tell if the cold laser will prove  superior to the company's hot laser in treating blood vessel blockages in the  legs.  </P> <P> Trimedyne's main objective, he said, is to get the cold laser approved for  cardiac use, although he acknowledges that the process will likely take two  years. Another local firm, Advanced Interventional Systems of Irvine, is  expected to become the first U.S. company to get federal approval to market a  cold laser to treat blocked coronary arteries.  </P> <P> An FDA medical panel recently approved the AIS device for use as an alternative  to bypass surgery in certain cases when balloon angioplasty -- forcing an  opening with pressure -- had been uneffective in clearing a patient's heart  arteries.  </P> <P> Trimedyne lost $6.2 million on revenue of $10.2 million for the first nine  months of its fiscal 1990 year, contrasted with earnings of $929,000 on revenue  of $26.6 million for the corresponding year-earlier period.  </P></p>

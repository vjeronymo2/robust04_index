			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Children aged five may face testing SCHOOL TESTS for five-year-olds are being considered by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. He said last night such tests would measure children's abilities - which could vary according to background and other factors - when they started school. The move follows controversy over tests for children at seven and 14. Mr Eamon O'Kane, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the idea was likely to face similar opposition from teachers and parents. The idea of tests for children starting school was seized on by Mr Patten when it was mentioned on the Sky News television programme Target. He said: 'I think it might be a very good idea to have some judgment. If teachers are worried that children are coming in at rising five at different levels, different backgrounds and the rest of it, and it is therefore very difficult to judge their progress at seven, what we need is something very simple to measure what their standards are when they enter school.' Mr O'Kane said: 'After the ham-fisted way the other tests have been handled, the idea of having yet another tier of them isn't a principle we are likely to endorse.'</p>

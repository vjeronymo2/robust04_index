			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brussels 'open skies'ambitions scotched EC transport ministers yesterday agreed to co-ordinate more closely the external civil aviation agreements each member state now negotiates bilaterally. But they scotched European Commission ambitions to negotiate 'open skies' deals on behalf of the EC as a bloc, except on a case-by-case basis requiring a prior mandate from the Twelve. The Commission said immediately it would take the EC Council of Ministers to the European Court - 'in the next few days', said Mr Abel Matutes, transport commissioner. Brussels has long argued for a common external aviation policy to win better access for EC airlines, and prevent a free-for-all inside Europe which might put at risk its own hard-won deregulation of air transport. But ministers decided member states 'shall remain fully responsible for their relations with third countries in the field of aviation unless and until action has been taken by the Council.' The Council based itself on the transport articles of the EC treaty, whereas the Commission maintains that external aviation agreements come under the the treaty's commercial clauses, which give Brussels broad competence. Ministers did agree, however, that the EC should establish common rules on aviation relations with other countries. The Twelve and the Commission will thus set up an experts group to: Exchange information on and consult on external negotiations; Sort out conflicts of interest between states, and possible infringements of EC law; Identify areas of common interest where the Community should negotiate as Twelve. They also agreed yesterday on common equipment standards for air traffic control. These are aimed at integrating 54 control centres, using 31 incompatible systems and 70 different computer languages.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Oki Electric appoints new board OKI ELECTRIC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported a Y19.3bn (Dollars 156m) parent company pre-tax loss in the six months to September, suspended its interim dividend payment, and appointed a new board of directors in an effort to turn around the company's business. Mr Nobumitsu Kosugi, president, resigned yesterday to take responsibility for the company's poor financial performance. He was replaced by Mr Jun Jinguji, a former executive at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone who has been a senior director at Oki since 1985. Oki suffered from poor sales in all principal product areas: telecommunication equipment, data processing systems, and electronic devices. Total sales declined by 8.5 per cent to Y261.8bn. Oki is one of the smaller electronics companies to remain in the race to produce high-capacity memory chips, but is widely expected to quit the business because of the escalation of development costs as the technology becomes more sophisticated. The company posted a net after-tax loss of Y8.7bn. For the fiscal year as a whole, Oki expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y25bn and net loss of Y16bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is an additional report on the Pailin  battlefield from 30 March to 2 April. During these days:    1. Our forces continued to block the entire Sala Krau-Kon  Damrei route. The invading forces were completely cut off from  their communications and supplies.    2. The entire route north of Pailin remained disconnected.  The invading forces tried hard to contact their colleagues by  travelling in small groups on foot through the jungle. We kept  attacking them, though, and they also hit our land mines,  suffering continuous losses. The survivors fled, leaving  ammunition, dried food, and medicine along the way. Some fled  into the dense forests. No one knows whether or not they are  still alive.    3. On 1 April, we launched four attacks on the invading  forces along a stretch of road from Veal Cheng to Sala Krau,  killing 18 of them on the spot and wounding others.    4. The road from Sala Krau to O Rum-el was blocked by our  forces in several places. On 2 April, we attacked the invading  forces fleeing from the western part of Sala Krau in waves,  killing 42 of them.    5. We are continuing to cut off the invading forces from all  corners, and are waiting in the bamboo forests to smash them.  They only have a small number of tanks left. These tanks do  not dare to dash about and launch operations. They are in  hiding, fearful that we will smash them.    6. Every day, we cut off the stretch of road from Suosdei to  Chisang and Treng. The battle is continuing within the  perimeter of Pailin and along the communications lines the  invading forces are trying to use to send supplies to their  colleagues within the perimeter of Pailin. The invading forces  cannot bring their dead or wounded colleagues out because they  cannot get there either on foot or by air. More puppet soldiers  are continuing to desert the Pailin battlefield for fear of  being killed.</p>

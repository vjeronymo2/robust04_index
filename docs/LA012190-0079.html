			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS GET THE OL' 1-2-3-5-6-7  </P> <P> It was a day of upsets in college basketball, as six of the top seven teams  fell.  </P> <P> The only team to survive was No. 4 Missouri, which defeated top-ranked Kansas.  No. 2 Georgetown was upset by unranked Connecticut, No. 3 Oklahoma fell to No.  23 Arizona, No. 5 Syracuse was beaten by Providence, No. 6 Michigan lost to  Iowa and No. 7 Illinois lost to No. 24 Purdue.  </P> <P> The upsets began at Columbia, Mo., where the Tigers, who trailed by as many as  nine points in the first half, came back to defeat Kansas, 95-87.  </P> <P> "At halftime there were a lot of sad faces," said Missouri's Anthony Peeler,  who scored 24 points. "But we just talked about treating them as just another  team."  </P> <P> It was the 26th consecutive victory at home for the Tigers (17-1 overall, 4-0  in the Big Eight), who made 18 of 29 shots in the second half. It is also the  second consecutive season that the Tigers have defeated a top-ranked team on  their home court. They beat then-No. 1 Oklahoma, 97-84, last February.  </P> <P> The Jayhawks (19-1, 2-1) led, 46-43, at halftime, but the Tigers scored the  first six points of the second half and took the lead for good with 17 minutes  remaining.  </P> <P> Terry Brown brought Kansas to within 67-65 with 10:44 remaining. The Jayhawks  pulled to within two points of the lead on three more occasions, the last time  at 77-75.  </P> <P> Doug Smith scored 23 points for Kansas, 19 in the second half.  </P> <P> Connecticut 70, No. 2 Georgetown 65 -- The Hoyas, the only undefeated  major-college team after Kansas was beaten earlier in the day, lost when the  Huskies connected on seven of eight free throws in the final 1:04 for a Big  East Conference victory at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> The Huskies (15-3, 5-2) broke a 60-60 tie with 3:46 left on a three-point  basket by Nadav Henefeld and never trailed again. The Hoyas (14-1, 4-1) got as  close as 63-62, and made it 67-65 on a three-point basket by Mark Tillmon with  32 seconds left.  </P> <P> The Huskies held the Hoyas scoreless for the first 7:03 and had a 14-0 lead  before Alonzo Mourning, who had 23 points, scored on a dunk.  </P> <P> No. 23 Arizona 78, No. 3 Oklahoma 74 -- The Sooners had shooting troubles all  day against the Wildcats. But in the end, it was the shot the third-ranked  Sooners didn't take that gave the Wildcats the victory at Tucson.  </P> <P> Kermit Holmes cost the Sooners (12-2) a chance at the tying basket when he lost  the ball out-of-bounds with four seconds left. The Wildcats' Sean Rooks was  fouled one second later and hit two free throws.  </P> <P> The Wildcats limited the high-scoring Sooners to seven-for-28 shooting in the  first half and 24-for-69 for the game. The Sooners, who lost Tuesday to Kansas  State, last lost consecutive games two years ago -- to Louisiana State and  Kansas State.  </P> <P> Providence 87, No. 5 Syracuse 86 -- Junior guard Eric Murdock made a jump shot  from the foul line with four seconds to play and the Friars defeated the  Orangemen for the first time in 11 years in a Big East game at Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> Leading, 86-85, the Orangemen's Dave Johnson missed the the first free throw of  a one-and-one with 33 seconds remaining. After Murdock's shot, Richard Manning  of the Orangemen missed a short jumper in the lane as time expired.  </P> <P> The Friars (11-4, 4-2), led by Murdock's 25 points and 16 assists, ended more  than a decade of futility against the Orangemen (12-3, 3-3), who had won 21 in  a row from the Friars since the league was formed in 1979.  </P> <P> Iowa 78, No. 6 Michigan 76 -- Les Jepsen scored 13 of his 19 points in the  second half and sank the winning free throws in overtime as the Hawkeyes  overcame a 15-point deficit to stun the Wolverines in a Big Ten game at Iowa  City, Iowa.  </P> <P> The Hawkeyes (9-6, 1-4) broke a five-game losing streak. The Wolverines are  13-3, 3-2.  </P> <P> Rumeal Robinson, who scored 22 of his 28 points for the Wolverines in the first  half, drove the length of the court but missed a flying, off-balance layup at  the buzzer.  </P> <P> Michael Ingram's layup with 39 seconds left in regulation gave Iowa a 71-71 tie  and capped a 24-9 run in which the Hawkeyes rallied from a 62-47 deficit with  11:24 left. The Wolverines had a 44-33 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Matt Bullard led the Hawkeyes with 23 points. Terry Mills scored 15 points for  Michigan.  </P> <P> No. 24 Purdue 81, No. 7 Illinois 68 -- At West Lafayette, Ind., the  Boilermakers turned a 17-2 second-half run into a runaway to remain undefeated  in Big Ten play while beating a higher-ranked team for the third time in their  last four games.  </P> <P> Purdue (13-2, 4-0) scored the first four points of the game and never was  caught, taking a 17-7 lead in the first eight minutes.  </P> <P> The Illini (13-3, 3-3) trailed by 12 points with 14:43 left when the  Boilermakers put the game out of reach by scoring 10 consecutive points and  then adding another seven for a 21-point advantage.  </P> <P> Kendall Gill scored 23 points for the Illini. Marcus Liberty, the Illini's  leading scorer, was eight of 18 shots.  </P></p>

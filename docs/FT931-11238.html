			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Time Warner files plan to raise Dollars 1.5bn TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday offered fresh evidence of its aggressive move to reduce the cost of debt and preferred stock dividends when it said it had filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to Dollars 1.5bn. Over the past few weeks, Time Warner has raised Dollars 3.5bn in debentures and spent the proceeds repurchasing the Series D preferred stock which was issued after Time and Warner Communications agreed to merge in 1989. Some Dollars 3.1bn of Series C preferred stock remains outstanding, and Time Warner said yesterday it planned to use the next Dollars 1.5bn it raises to redeem some of these securities. The Series C and D stock in 1991 cost Time Warner a total of Dollars 579m in dividend payments, dragging the company into loss despite healthy operating earnings. The debentures being issued to replace the Series C and D preferred stock have maturities ranging from five to 40 years. Analysts believe Time Warner's financial strategy will eventually shift from redeeming preferred stock to the disposal of non-strategic assets in order to raise funds to reduce bank debt.</p>

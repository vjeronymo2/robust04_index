			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Workstart scheme to start by June THE FIRST new employees to be recruited under the government's Pounds 2.6m Workstart programme should start work by June, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, told MPs yesterday. Answering questions in the Commons, Mrs Shephard promised that monitoring of the four initial Workstart pilot schemes would be 'very close.' Contracts would stipulate that individuals hired under Workstart must be additional to a company's existing workforce. The scheme - announced in the Budget - will give employers a government subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for taking on the long-term jobless.</p>

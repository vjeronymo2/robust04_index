			<p>BFN     [Text] Leonid Kravchuk, one of the candidates for the  president of Ukraine, visited Odessa Oblast on 16 June. The  program of the trip included visits to Izmail and  Belgorod-Dnestrovskyy, a meeting with Odessa residents in the  Politechnical University house of culture, and a live program on  local television. Kravchuk was accompanied by his adviser  Valentyn Symonenko, Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko,  Odessa State Administration Head Vladlen Ilyin, Oblast Council  Chairman Ruslan Bodelan, and Odessa Mayor Leonid Cherneha.    Speaking before Odessa residents, Kravchuk negatively  assessed the reluctance of the oblast council to grant a patch  of land for the building of the oil terminal. Kravchuk  emphasized: "I think that the oblast council still has time to  think and make a decision that would suit Ukraine's interests."    Answering a question about his relations with Yeltsin,  President Kravchuk pointed out: "Our personal relations are  normal. We even know when we have to telephone each other.  With regard to Yeltsin's perception of Ukraine, he signed the  tripartite agreement on behalf of Russia and granted Ukraine  recognition of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Of  course, the president of Russia, just like his Ukrainian  counterpart, has to protect the interests of his state."    President Kravchuk shared his opinion about the newly  appointed Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol. He, in particular,  pointed out: "I have never been Masol's opponent. In 1990, he  resigned after he had been summoned to the Ukrainian Communist  Party Central Committee and proposed to make this step. At that  time he unsuccessfully tried to find support outside Ukraine."    This is how Kravchuk explained his decision to propose  Masol's candidacy: "My decision was prompted by the specific  procedure for the Supreme Council's approval. I had to propose  someone who would not cause a split and opposition. There were  other candidates, too, but I understood that they did not have a  chance and preferred not to hurt their feelings. Now, the main  thing is not to stand in Masol's way."    Answering a question about the relations between eastern and  western Ukraine, Kravchuk stated: "I know both parts well and I  am sure that no problems exist at the level of ordinary people.  However, there are gentlemen who shout on behalf of the people.  Both in the east and the west people want to live free lives."    Kravchuk informed the audience that in accordance with a  presidential edict, the National Bank of Ukraine had transferred  1.7 trillion karbovantsi to assist the agricultural sector.    He added that a fixed exchange rate of the U.S. dollar would  soon be introduced in Ukraine -- 20,000 karbovantsi. According  to Kravchuk, should this step fail to significantly influence  prices, a fluctuating rate will be introduced.</p>

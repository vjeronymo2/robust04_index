			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Sterling suspension severe blow to ERM THE suspension of sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism has dealt a severe blow to the credibility of the currency system which may prove impossible to rebuild, foreign exchange dealers and market analysts said last night. It has also called into question the Maastricht treaty on European union, by raising important doubts about the feasibility of an important element of that agreement: monetary union. A referendum is being held in France over Maastricht on Sunday, but some analysts felt the vote had lost most of its relevance. 'This is a first, very large, nail in the ERM coffin,' said Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney in London. 'What's more, one of the major pillars on which Maastricht was built has been knocked away.' According to Mr James Barty, senior UK analyst at Morgan Grenfell, 'Maastricht is a lot less likely to be ratified than it was even last Monday, even if the French say Yes.' Speaking before last night's meeting of EC monetary officials in Brussels, they reckoned it would be difficult for the other weak currencies within the ERM to hold out against a likely further speculative onslaught by currency dealers. Suspension of the membership of the lira, peseta and escudo was thus considered likely. Any attempt by sterling to re-enter the mechanism quickly might also prove short-lived, since dealers would recognise that the Bank of England's ammunition against further speculation has been depleted by a sharp drop in reserves this week. The British government had also suffered a sharp loss of credibility in the financial markets and its position politically had been weakened considerably - given Prime Minister John Major's description of devaluation last week as a 'betrayal'. Whatever the short-term developments, the ERM was seen as reverting longer-term to a two-tier system with a group of stronger currencies clustered around the D-Mark and others floating more freely. The last major realignment of the ERM was in January 1987. Sterling - along with the D-Mark one of the top five traded currencies which makes it more difficult and expensive to beat speculators - did not join the mechanism until October 1990. Some analysts pointed out that the nature of the mechanism had changed since 1979 from one where periodic adjustments of currency parities were expected, towards an almost fixed-rate system. This was a development of which the Bundesbank was known to disapprove. 'Any mechanism such as this which attempts to fix exchange rates has a limited life cycle,' said Mr Jeffrey.</p>

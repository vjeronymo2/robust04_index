			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Rift widens on Italian budget plan ITALY'S treasury minister, Mr Piero Barucci, has added his name to that of another senior minister threatening to resign if parliament fails to pass the 1994 budget by the formal year-end deadline. The threat springs from a growing rift between 'technocratic' ministers, who hold some of the key portfolios in the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and parliament. Last month, Mr Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister, said he would step down if the 1994 spending plans, for which his ministry is largely responsible, were not passed in time. Last Friday, the budget was approved by the Senate, the upper house of parliament, after an unusually long examination. It is now before the lower house, where opposition is likely to be even tougher. Although ostensibly over spending cuts, the budget dispute has been overshadowed by attempts by some politicians to prolong discussions in order to postpone a general election, widely expected early next year. The elections are forecast to register a sharp drop in support for the main political parties. For many deputies under investigation for political corruption, parliamentary immunity has been a lifeline against interrogation and possible jail. Mr Barucci, addressing foreign journalists in Milan, distinguished between a brief delay in winning approval for the budget and a more serious hold-up. 'It would be a severe setback for the prime minister and the three ministers responsible for the economy, especially the treasury', he said. Some observers have already predicted Mr Ciampi would resign on principle if the budget were not passed in time. On privatisation, now moving into top gear, Mr Barucci said Italy had reached a point of no return. No matter who came to power after the next elections, privatisation was inevitable, he argued. The sell-offs, starting with the Credito Italiano banking group next month, will accelerate in early 1994, with the disposal of two further financial institutions. The biggest transactions will come later, with the flotation of the Ina insurance group in June and the Enel electricity authority, possibly by December. In 1995, the government expects to sell off shares in the Stet telecommunications authority and the energy side of the Eni energy and chemicals concern. Mr Barucci regretted that new legislation to create private pension funds had so far failed to produce a response. The attempt to foster a private pensions industry, under discussion for more than a decade, was designed to ease pressures on the overburdened state system and create a new pool of institutional investment capital, partly to facilitate privatisations. 'In reality, the new law doesn't work,' Mr Barucci admitted. He said the government would have to redraft the legislation to provide a more effective stimulus. Mr Barucci declined to say when bank creditors to Efim, the state holding company put into liquidation in July 1992, might be reimbursed. While regretting the government's failure to maintain earlier promises on repayments, he ascribed the delays to constant revelations about alleged irregularities in Efim's affairs. 'The money is ready,' he said. But 'very big problems' remained in paying it out because of the legal actions being taken by Mr Alberto Predieri, the special Efim administrator, against some former managers.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IN LIFE AS IN WRITING, SUSAN GRIFFIN ADDRESSES LARGE THEMES  </P> <P> Susan Griffin's voice is clear but just soft enough to demand absolute  attention as she talks by telephone about how chronic, disabling illness has  affected her life and work for the last six years.  </P> <P> A Berkeley writer who will be the Laguna Poets Winter Festival reader Saturday,  Griffin has never hesitated to take on life-and-death matters in her work.  Until recently, however, she hadn't had to address them quite so directly in  her life.  </P> <P> Griffin's nonfiction books, poetry and plays examine the world from a feminist  perspective. She's written about pornography, rape and human relationships with  nature. Her new nonfiction book, "A Chorus of Stones: The Private Life of War,"  will be published by Doubleday next year.  </P> <P> In 1975 she won an Emmy award for her televised play "Voices," and she's now  revising a new one-person play, "One Two Three . . . Loss," which actress Ruth  Zaporah will perform in Berkeley this fall.  </P> <P> Griffin has had a fair amount of writering success. Yet she must still struggle  to make ends meet. "The assumption is I'm financially well off because I'm  recognized," she said, but the reality is that publishers' advances for serious  writing are small, and more grants are available for younger writers than for  "established" ones.  </P> <P> In past years Griffin has supported herself as a waitress, Teletype operator,  house painter, assistant magazine editor, artists' model, actor, director and  teacher.  </P> <P> Such jobs are no longer possible, for she's one of a growing number of people  with chronic fatigue immune dysfunctional syndrome (a recently discovered  illness in which the body's immune system is suppressed). The disease can  sometimes make it difficult for her to cross a room, much less teach, although  she still occasionally takes on private students.  </P> <P> Yet, despite a recent worsening of her illness, Griffin will perform in Laguna  because "I like to read. I consider my poetry meant to be read aloud," she  said. She plans to read from her most recent book of poems ("Unremembered  Country," 1987) as well as some newer poems, excerpts from the new play and  bits of "A Chorus of Stones."  </P> <P> Griffin feels that the recent proliferation of immune system-suppressing  ailments (such as AIDS) results from the deterioration of the earth's  environment, a deterioration that has not been examined enough.  </P> <P> "A lot of my work has dealt with denial, the psychology of denial and the kind  of schizoid division of the self into a physical and a spiritual part," she  said. "We say, 'I'm not a body, I'm a soul,' as if the body could be thrown  away."  </P> <P> Griffin says that she, too, denied her illness for several years, despite her  often-expressed idea that "sensuality and bodily knowledge carry the most  profound significance."  </P> <P> It helps, she said, to live in the Berkeley hills, a community where she has  deep roots and where she can maintain her connection to nature because "I live  in a place with a lot of trees around. And of course nature isn't just outside,  nature is also in my own body."  </P> <P> Griffin was born in Los Angeles. Her childhood, which she wrote about in a  still-unfinished, autobiographical play called "Thanksgiving," was hard. Her  parents divorced when she was 6, and after that "I was moved around from one  member of the family to another."  </P> <P> At 16 she was living with her father, a fireman, when he was killed in an  accident. Subsequently she was adopted by a friend's parents. Her adoptive  father, a painter and sculptor, demonstrated by example that an artist could  have "a viable way of life," Griffin said.  </P> <P> In 1960 Griffin moved to the Bay Area. She earned bachelor's and master's  degrees from San Francisco State University, studying writing with Kay Boyle,  Robert Creeley and Josephine Miles. "I think it's critically important for  young writers to study with established writers," she said, "to have the  example of someone who has that sensibility and way of life, and see they're  normal people who brush their teeth and get up and work, like a bricklayer  does."  </P> <P> Her own work began to be published around 1970.  </P> <P> A self-described "radical feminist," she's written for Ms., Ramparts and many  other publications, and she's published three books of nonfiction, five of  poetry, a play and a collection of selected work.  </P> <P> Griffin's writing has won praise over the years. Critic Valerie Miner wrote:  "Griffin moves us from pain to anger to communion with and celebration of the  survival of woman and nature." In "American Women Writers" critic Kathleen  Klein stated that "the power of Griffin's work comes from the clarity of her  perceptions of the role, conditions, existence and aspirations of women." And  poet Adrienne Rich has called her "one of the wisest and most lucid writers in  America today."  </P> <P> Her writing has been influenced by African-American poetry, jazz, haiku, Asian  philosophy and French poetry and prose poems, Griffin said, by the women's  movement and by the fact she was born on the West Coast. "People make fun of  California, and I do too, but the truth is a lot of really important thought  has been initiated here. It's a place where the whole mind-body dichotomy has  been challenged," she said.  </P> <P> Married in 1966, she was divorced in 1970. She raised her daughter Rebecca on  her own. Rebecca, who renamed herself Chloe a few years ago, now lives with her  fiance while attending Mills College.  </P> <P> The theme of women being silenced by cultural forces recurs throughout  Griffin's writing. She resisted writing about her sexuality shortly after her  divorce, when she was "newly lesbian."  </P> <P> "I wanted to protect my daughter, and I had some questions about child custody.  . . . It did have a very dampening effect on my work. If you're being so very  careful not to speak about who you love and what you're feeling, it radiates  out into the rest of your life. You end up censoring things without even  thinking about it, before they even reach the stage of consciousness," she  said.  </P> <P> Once she allowed herself to begin describing her sexuality, "I remember it as  this incredible burst of energy, and joy, and anger," she said.  </P> <P> She feels that societal changes of the last two decades have made it possible  for some, but by no means all, women to be less silent about their lives. "I  think we're just beginning to open up and understand what (sexist) oppression  is. That situation has not changed for many women, in many ways it's worse than  it was before," she said.  </P> <P> Griffin's new nonfiction book, "A Chorus of Stones," draws from a long look at  nuclear policy, at "the effects of gender issues, family structure and intimacy  on war," she said.  </P> <P> To write it, she studied existing literature and interviewed many individuals  around the world, in the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Japan.  Like her earlier nonfiction books, "Stones" draws undisguisedly on her own  reactions to the material.  </P> <P> The book is "very hard to describe, it doesn't fit in a category," she said.  "I'm talking about states of mind, states of body. The only way to approach it  is in more artistic language."  </P> <P> Her new play, "One Two Three . . . Loss" is "a play about encounters with  death," Griffin said. "I had a very close friend with whom I was living. She  was killed very suddenly in 1985. The experience was very profound for me.  She's hardly in it except that she dies. (The play) goes to a place more  primal" than the one specific death. "I'm looking at the direct experience of  death from the point of view of the one who doesn't die." The play also draws  on Griffin's own heightened fears of mortality since the onset of her illness.  </P> <P> Many of the poems of "Unremembered Country" deal with loss, but they also echo  with the need "to love this world." The poems she's written since publishing  the book, Griffin said, address "the ecological situation."  </P> <P> Her writing draws on her life, but it isn't straight autobiography. "I think  unless you are really writing an autobiography, it's important to look at  things from your life as material, but not as things you have to be faithful  to," she said. "I don't make up things in poetry. Everything there is literally  true, (but) it's sort of the case that you may choose to tell this moment, and  then leap 500 years and tell this (other) moment. I don't bother to explain, I  let the music, the association, the juxtaposition do that."  </P> <P> Despite her reduced energies, the writer tries to work regularly. Soon, she  wants to begin writing some nonfiction "about the experience of illness," as  well as continuing to write poetry and plays.  </P> <P> "If you go to your study every day, even if you just put in an hour, then your  mind is working when you're not there," Griffin said. "You can't depend just on  flashes of inspiration, there's an awful lot of spadework with writing. Writing  is like having a relationship. If there's a particular regularity it allows  things to open up and unfold.  </P> <P> "It may feel that not much is happening, it goes on that way for six or seven  days, or even two weeks, and then I'll have a click, and it's illuminating,"  she said. "All those days I worked fed into it, worked up to it. (Writing)  requires a lot of stick-to-itiveness, faith, and daily work."  </P> <P> Susan Griffin will read from her work at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at the Forum  Theatre, 650 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Tickets are $10 and can be  purchased at the door.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I went very far away from life  </P> <P>  with its torpor. I was out there  </P> <P>  in the ethereal air  </P> <P>  the cold rush against my face  </P> <P>  was exciting  </P> <P>  and even more  </P> <P>  there was a kind of star that broke  </P> <P>  my heart and made it wide  </P> <P>  as space itself.  </P> <P>  Now I have fallen again  </P> <P>  and I rush arms open like a lover  </P> <P>  or prodigal daughter.  </P> <P>  Streets, gleam of pavement after rain,  </P> <P>  my very human thoughts, my very human wants,  </P> <P>  those old songs just now I am writing again  </P> <P>  I love you, I love you again.  </P> <P>  (Reprinted by permission from "Unremembered Country," Copper Canyon Press,  1987.)  </P></p>

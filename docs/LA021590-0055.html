			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> STEAMY MAIL OF VICTORIAN LOVERS  </P> <P> Searching the Heart: Women, Men and Romantic Love in Nineteenth-Century America  by Karen Lystra (Oxford University Press: $24.95, 336 pages.)  </P> <P> My own heart ached with envy when I learned that Karen Lystra conducted the  research for her book, "Searching the Heart," by poring over hundreds of  antique love letters in the Huntington Library in San Marino. I have a vision  of Lystra wandering through the elegant galleries and magnificent gardens, a  packet of scented and beribboned letters clutched to her breast, whiling away  the hours in a reverie of ardent words and urgent longings.  </P> <P> The reality was probably less lyrical, and Lystra's book turns out to be a  graceful but utterly earnest work of scholarship. Still, the raw material of  Lystra's study -- the intimate words of men and women who lived long ago but  whose passions are still very much alive in their love letters -- infuses her  book with a full measure of romantic and sexual love.  </P> <P> Lystra, professor of American Studies at Cal State Fullerton, set herself the  task of finding out how Victorian-era Americans actually felt about love by  studying two kinds of source material -- the love letters that they exchanged  with one another, and the "medical and moral advice books" that tutored them in  the proprieties of courtship and marriage.  </P> <P> What Lystra discovered is that the Victorian era was not so sexually repressed  as we are taught in the approved texts. "The erotic intensity of the  middle-class men and women in this study, as well as their passion for sexual  expression, may take some readers by surprise," she warns. "Nineteenth-Century  middle-class Americans actually held an extremely high estimation of, indeed  almost reverence for, sexual expression as the ultimate symbol of love and  personal sharing."  </P> <P> Lystra has pondered these topics deeply and with great and insight. She is  always sensitive to both the inner meanings and larger social implications of  the rituals of love and courtship, and she calls our attention to the  significance of romantic love in the sexual politics of men and women, the  distinctions between the public and private realms of experience, and the  mounting importance of individualism in middle-class society in the Victorian  era.  </P> <P> "In America," she observes, "romantic love was an active agent, not only a  passive index, of the crucial social change that brought modern -- meaning  romantic -- selfhood to a large group of men and women."  </P> <P> The love letters that are the proof text of Lystra's study are quoted  generously but selectively; we are rarely given love letters in their entirety.  But these fragments of superheated Victorian prose, whether found in the  letters of a literary celebrity such as Nathaniel Hawthorne ("Oh I shiver again  to think how much I love thee!") or some otherwise obscure Victorian widow ("As  the flowers open out and give fresh perfume and beauty in the sun -- so does  the heart warm and expand to love"), give "Searching the Heart" a sparkle and a  glow that one does not often find in an academic monograph.  </P> <P> Sometimes the examples are hilarious. The growing ardor of one pair of lovers  is revealed by the escalation of rhetoric in the closing lines of their love  letters. At first, the gentleman signed his letters "Very truly yours," but  later he could hardly contain his frenzied sexual hunger: "Darling, darling,  darling, Oh! how I love you!! I want to maul you. Good bye, sweetie, Yours  Forever."  </P> <P> Only rarely are the letters openly erotic or explicit, but the sexual tension  and titillation are unmistakable. "Pray write as often as you can," urged one  yearning husband, "and when you write put on your open black dress and  beautiful white under dress." And "a respectable army wife" taunted her absent  husband, who was campaigning against the Indians on the frontier, in the  steamiest of prose: "How are you this hot day? I am most roasted and my chemise  sticks to me and the sweat runs down my legs and I suppose I smell very sweet,  don't you wish you could be around just now."  </P> <P> Lystra concludes that men and women of the Victorian era were far less timid on  matters of the heart than we are led to believe by the approved texts. " 'Lie  still and think of the Empire,' is the wedding-night advice Queen Victoria was  supposed to have given her daughter, thus representing the quintessential in  Victorian repression and prudery," Lystra writes. In fact, she insists, the  Victorians regarded sexuality as a wholesome and even noble element of the  relationship between man and woman: "Imbued with romantic love, sex was seen as  an act of self-disclosure, not so much in the sense of revealing one's body as  one's essential identity. Sex was identified with the inner life and was  perceived as part of the privileged revelation of an "authentic self."  </P> <P> Of course, as Lystra points out, Victorian morality imposed strict restraints  on public expressions of sexuality -- and that's precisely why the love letters  of the era are such potent stuff. "Forbidding sexual expression in public  helped to create and also to explain a veritable explosion of private sexual  expression whose pleasure was partially enhanced by the thought that speaking  of sex was forbidden," Lystra explains. "Victorians gleefully censored their  own private correspondence and worried about being found out. But the idea of  someone reading their letters hovered like a ghost of lasciviousness over  correspondence, making their missives almost a secret erotic art."  </P> <P> Lystra is no "ghost of lasciviousness." She treats these most private of  letters -- and the men and women who wrote them for each other alone -- with  respect and dignity. "The mail of lovers was sacred," she writes. "In both the  act of reading and writing love letters, Victorians displayed an intimacy that  affords the historian a remarkable opportunity to cross once forbidden  boundaries. . . . " And yet, in "Searching the Heart," Lystra invites us to  join her as she explores these once-sacrosanct enclaves of our history. The  journey is intriguing and surprising.  </P> <P> Friday: Richard Eder reviews Buchi Emecheta, "The Family."  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Ulster cable TV franchise advertised The Independent Television Commission is to advertise the biggest cable franchise in the UK - covering all of Northern Ireland. The announcement was made by Sir George Russell, the commission chairman, in a speech at Queen's University, Belfast last night. The cable franchise, which will almost certainly offer telecommunications services as well as extra channels of television, will cover about 530,000 homes. Until now the West Midlands franchise covering 490,000 homes was the biggest. Bidders for the Northern Ireland 'local delivery licence' will not be required to cable the entire province. But they will have to say what parts of the area they intend to serve, by what means and by what timetable. It is possible that the cities and larger towns of Northern Ireland could be cabled, but that the rural areas could be served by microwave broadcasts.</p>

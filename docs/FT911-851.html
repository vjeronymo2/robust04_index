			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Pit closures could lead to 6,000 job losses A FURTHER seven coalmines are to close over the next year with the possible loss of up to 6,000 jobs, British Coal disclosed yesterday. Confirmation of the closures, already announced locally, came at a meeting of the Commons energy select committee. Mr Kenneth Moses, British Coal's company's technical director, told the committee that seven pits around the country were scheduled for closure, reducing the total number functioning to 62. A British Coal official later said that the likely reasons for closure would be the exhaustion of recoverable reserves. The closures had been negotiated with unions locally, and there were no appeals. Miners affected by the closures would be offered early retirement or alternative work, and no compulsory redundancies were expected. The pits scheduled for closure are in several regions, including the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and south Wales. They are Dawdon, Barnsley Main, Denby Grange, Dinnington, Sutton Manor, Allerton Bywater, and Penallta. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, was also questioned by the committee on the likely shape of Britain's coalmining industry as negotiations get under way with PowerGen and National Power on future coal demand. Under questioning, Mr Clarke said it was impossible to predict the future size of the industry prior to the outcome of talks with the generating companies.</p>

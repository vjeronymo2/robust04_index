			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Deepening crisis pushes Ukraine into urgent reform THE UKRAINIAN prime minister yesterday told parliament the country's economic crisis was so acute that there was no alternative but to adopt an ambitious reform programme. In what amounts to a U-turn in Ukraine's economic policy, Mr Leonid Kuchma called for the curbing of Ukraine's runaway budget deficit - 44 per cent of GDP, he said - along with 'forced' privatisation of both large and small enterprises, an overhaul of the burdensome tax system and a focus on agriculture as an engine for overall reform. Together with the stimulation of the private sector, Mr Kuchma plans to introduce stricter government regulation in some areas. He called for tight exchange control over all foreign currencies, including the rouble, and warned that the chaotic and often corrupt state sector would be subject to closer government control. After reciting a list of bleak economic indicators, Mr Kuchma told the legislature: 'We have no choice but to build everything from scratch as we did after the second world war.' Over the objections of ex-communist hardliners, Mr Kuchma was granted extraordinary powers until May 1, when parliament can decide whether to extend them further. Under the existing system the prime minister, president and parliament share power, forming an awkward and weak troika. In an effort to break through this deadlock Mr Kuchma won the right to take extensive economic decisions unilaterally, and persuaded reluctant MPs to restrict their own authority to passing economic legislation. As the director of the world's largest missile factory, Mr Kuchma had been expected to continue his predecessor's policy of subsidising the massive state sector. But, since becoming prime minister less than a month ago, he has concluded that Ukraine can no longer afford to prop up the old regime. He conceded that the economic situation was worse in Ukraine than in any other former Soviet republic, citing an 18 per cent decline in GNP and a 22-fold increase in the prices of wholesale goods since the beginning of the year. Under the stewardship of Mr Kuchma's predecessor, Mr Vitold Fokin, Ukraine staved off total collapse by issuing more than Rb400bn of unbacked credit to bale out faltering state enterprises. That option was closed last week when Ukraine, to Russia's relief, left the rouble zone. Mr Kuchma warned Ukrainians that his programme of swifter privatisation and tighter control over credit would result in bankruptcies and unemployment. To mitigate these effects he suggested the creation of a work-fare system whereby the unemployed would be paid a minimum wage to work on government construction projects.</p>

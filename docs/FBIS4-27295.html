			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The inaugural ceremony  of the second-term South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils (Hanchongnyon) was held at Chosun University in Kwangju  Saturday, attended by more than 50,000 students from some 200  universities and colleges throughout South Korea, a radio report  from Seoul said.    At the ceremony, Hanchongnyon adopted a five-point programme  -- opposition to outside forces, restoration of national  sovereignty, democratisation of society, reunification through  confederation and promotion of campus democracy.    The students vowed to launch a movement of opposing the  United States and ousting the "government" for the establishment  of an independent democratic government and the reunification of  the country.    They also held ceremonies to inaugurate the National  Reunification Committee and the Committee for the Promotion of  Campus Autonomy.    Prior to this, the students in groups of 300-400 held  meetings on education, culture, health service and the press and  marched downtown Kwangju, divided into regional federations of  General Student Councils and conducted propaganda shouting  "Scrap the 'National Security Law'" and "Stop to Nuclear War  Scheme on Korean Peninsula."    About 700 students of the agricultural college handed to the  "American Cultural Center" in Kwangju 150 postcards declaring  their "opposition to rice market opening."    More than 50,000 students under Hanchongnyon held a rally in  Kwangju Sunday for a probe into the truth of the May 18 incident  and held a demonstration demanding the punishment of the  traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.    They condemned the sinister act of the United States in  manipulating behind the scene the Kwangju massacre and strongly  demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea.</p>

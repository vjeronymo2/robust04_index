			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gabor Oblath] </F>   [Text] There was not a single country in our entire region  where total exports, as well as exports to the West, declined to  the degree they did in Hungary. Notably, Hungary had the largest  deficit in the balance of payments and the largest relative  trade deficit (compared to exports and to the GDP). The fact  that exports increased slightly in the first quarter of this  year cannot be interpreted as a sign of reversal in view of the  extremely low level of trade in the same period of last year.  Imports grew much faster than exports, and the enduring and very  considerable deficits in the balance of trade and the balance of  payments ($750 million and $800 million, respectively, in three  months) begin to threaten the stability of the economy.    The trouble is greater than one would think; to realize  this,  one should discard two beliefs in particular. According to one  belief, the 1993 decline in our exports was part of a general  East European trend which was caused primarily by the recession  in the West. According to the other, the huge deficit in the  balance of trade and the balance of payments in the first  quarter of this year is actually "a good thing" because it is a  sign that the economy began to grow.    Both parts of the first belief mentioned above are based on  an error. On the one hand: In 1993, in a number of East  European countries, the value of exports expressed in U.S.  dollars did not decrease but increased (especially that of the  exports into industrialized countries), and the fact that the  total exports of the region decreased slightly was largely due  to the extreme decline in Hungarian exports. Concerning the  entire region, we have final data only for the first three  quarters of last year. These data indicate that the total  exports from Eastern Europe as well as the exports to the  industrialized countries expressed in U.S. dollars decreased by  approximately 2 percent compared to the same period of the  previous year. However, if we disregard Hungary's results and  look at the exports of only the other countries, it appears that  last year the rest of the countries increased their total  exports by 3 percent, and their exports to the West by 4.5  percent.[.sup]1[/]    On the other hand, in spite of the recession in the West,  the  Czech Republic was able to increase the dollar value of its  exports to the West by 20 percent, Poland by 12 percent, and  Romania by 7.5 percent. (Since the export prices of the  aforementioned countries calculated in U.S. dollars decreased,  the increase in the volume of their exports was even more  considerable.) In view of these results it is difficult to  believe that Hungarian exports to the West decreased in 1993 by  21 (!) percent largely because of the recession in the West. And  indeed, this explanation is without any factual foundation.  Namely, while the Western demand for import goods from the  entire East European region decreased by 5 percent, the  so-called specific demand for imported goods which is relevant  for the individual countries[.sup]2[/] decreased more than  the average (by 5.5 percent) in the case of the Czech Republic  and Poland, which both exhibited considerable export growth.  Thus, the recession in the West does not explain anything. The  reason for the difference in export results must be found within  the individual countries, in the internal prerequisites and the  differences in economic policies.    The other belief is that the Hungarian trade deficit is  actually a good thing because it is connected to the  vitalization of the economy. This opinion is unfounded, but this  is not the only problem with it. Namely, those who believe or  want people to believe that things are basically all right  unwittingly obscure two connected but fundamentally different  issues. One of them is whether there are favorable economic  processes behind the trade deficit, i.e., whether the deficit is  desirable. The other question is whether the imbalance can be  sustained.    Strongly simplified, one can say that the trade deficit is  desirable if it happens while exports are increasing and is  prompted by processes which can provide a foundation for the  subsequent growth of the economy. However, it is certain that  the deficit is undesirable when it is accompanied by a decrease  in exports, a considerable increase in imports not for the  purposes of investment projects, and by domestic producers being  squeezed out of the domestic market. These symptoms indicate the  low or decreasing ability of the country to compete on the  international market; they are hardly desirable.    However, the trade imbalance is characterized not only by  the  favorable or unfavorable processes which created it, but also by  its relative size. Although there are no rigid limits, generally  it is still possible to decide whether the relation of the  deficit to the country's foreign currency income, GDP, foreign  currency reserves (or other indicators) is still in a realm in  which the deficit can be financed on a sustained basis (without  undermining the country's future financial standing), then the  deficit can still be sustained. However, there is a limit beyond  which the deficit becomes unsustainable. Of course, this limit  is not independent of the perception of creditors and foreign  investors whether the deficit is desirable, and by far precedes  the point after which the deficit becomes technically impossible  to finance. (Incidentally, one should not rely on the momentary  judgments of creditors and investors, because they can  unexpectedly and fundamentally change.) Approaching this limit,  the country itself must take convincing steps to reduce the  deficit. If these steps are not taken by the country, sooner or  later they will be taken by creditors and investors.    Looking over the East European countries' 1993 results, one  can find examples of desirable and sustainable trade deficit.  For instance, in the Czech Republic, exports increased very  rapidly, and investment-oriented imports increased considerably,  while the deficit remained negligible. Slovenia offers an  example where the deficit is presumably undesirable (it was  induced by a slight decrease in exports and an increase in  consumption), but because it is insignificant, it is also  sustainable. Finally, there is also an example where the deficit  is the result of desirable processes (primarily due to economic  expansion; it was accompanied by a rapid growth in exports to  the West and the import of machinery), but it is presumably  still not sustainable, because it is too large; this is the  situation in Poland.    The trade deficit in Hungary is fundamentally different: The  deficit is primarily due to a decrease in exports, and the  increase in imports in 1993 had little to do with an  acceleration of the economy; at any rate, indications of the  latter are uncertain. But independent of all this one must see  that if the deficit reached one-third of the value of the  exports, and is beginning to exceed 10 percent of the GDP, it is  certainly not sustainable. Not even when, due to credits, the  level of foreign currency reserves increased to a relatively  high level. Namely, these reserves are meager compared to the  deficit, and they imply mostly debts.    A comparison of the results of Hungarian foreign trade with  other countries of the region indicates that the decrease in  Hungarian exports was unique and by far not unavoidable. The  roots of the problem must be found not without, but within, in  Hungarian economic prerequisites and economic policy.  Footnotes    1. We mean Eastern Europe without the successor states of  the  Soviet Union. The source of all the data in the article is the  database of the UN European Economic Committee which is based on  national statistics. See: Economic Survey of Europe in 1993-1994.    2. The change in the ("specific") demand for imports from  individual countries can be calculated as the weighted average  of the demand for imports in the OECD countries, in such a way  that as a bias we employ the percentages of the share of Western  countries in the exports of individual Eastern countries.</p>

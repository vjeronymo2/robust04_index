Although he stopped short of unilaterally  naming a prime minister, he nevertheless announced measures  which depart from the constitutional framework as agreed by the  Sovereign National Conference (CNS) which, we should remember,  brought together all elements of Zairian political life and  civil society.    Contrary to the Zairian leader's claims, not all parties  have  signed the protocol of agreement between the opposition and  presidential party. At the very most, the Sacred Union of the  Radical Opposition indicated last Wednesday that it would agree  to sign it and some representatives have put their signatures to  the text. Moreover, Mobutu would have no right to dissolve the  High Council of the Republic (HCR), which resulted from the  national conference, and to merge it with "his" national  assembly. The opposition sees this as a further "constitutional  coup d'etat" by the president. Clever as always, Mobutu would  thus be undoing the work of the CNS while forgetting that the  validity of his own position stems from it. His mandate in fact  expired in December 1991 and was extended by the conference  members at the insistence of the Western partners (the Americans  in particular) in order to avoid a transition marked by  conflict. As is customary, Mobutu is dipping into the texts to  retrieve that which suits his own ends.  <H5>  Lukoji Against Tshisekedi? </H5>   In his Friday evening address, Mobutu announced that the  remodelled interim HCR-Parliament was to meet yesterday and  should, over the next two weeks, deal with matters of its  internal organization (validation of mandates, rules of  procedure, election of officers, setting up of committees),  drawing up and adopting the interim constitutional act, and the  choice of a prime minister drawn from the opposition, whose  appointment should be sanctioned by a presidential decree. He  also indicated that the allies of the Sacred Union of the  Radical Opposition and the presidential party had suggested  Mulumba Lukoji as prime minister, while the Sacred Union  continued to support Etienne Tshisekedi.    For their part, the opposition representatives do not want  to  hear any talk of the immediate dissolution of the HCR. They  believe it should first examine the texts of the protocol of  agreement. If it concludes that they do not violate the statute  of the CNS, it must have them signed by all the parties  (including Mobutu) at a formal ceremony in the presence of  foreign witnesses.    Finally, the meeting scheduled for this Monday has been  postponed until Wednesday. It seems that this is designed to  provide time for tempers to cool off. On Sunday the present HCR  was unable to sit. The military prevented it from doing so under  the pretext that the president had terminated its legal  existence. For his part, Etienne Tshisekedi has rejected the  presidential decisions and pointed out that he is the only  "legal" prime minister because he was elected by the CNS. He  also called upon the population to respect a total shutdown of  activities on Wednesday.  <H5>  Monsengwo to the Rescue </H5>   Whereas Mobutu has succeeded in reviving tensions, the HCR  president has been seeking to ease them. In any event,  Monseigneur Monsengwo seems ready to confront the radical  opposition. In his opinion, all political factions have "either  signed or reached a decision to sign the protocol of agreement."  The prelate considers them to be historic agreements. He has  thus called upon the parties not to compromise "the result of so  much hard work."    Monseigneur Monsengwo wants the HCR to meet "right away" in  order "to be able to take up the option which allows it to form  a single body with the former national assembly." He has thus  admitted in substance that this institution should give way to  the interim HCR- Parliament, now remodelled following political  agreements.    This declaration will certainly not please the most radical  opposition members who believe the new HCR will be dominated by  the presidential party and members of the moderate opposition  with little inclination to support Tshisekedi.  <H5>  Paris as the Third Way </H5>   All this should make it possible to arrive at the "third  way"  as suggested by the French cooperation minister. According to  Michel Roussin, a "third way must be found between Etienne  Tshisekedi and the government appointed by Mobutu." For the  opposition, this amounts to nothing less than abandoning  Tshisekedi and breaking the consensus binding Belgium, the  United States and France.    It should be noted that neither Belgium nor the United  States  have reacted to Mobutu's statements. Both countries seem to be  waiting to see how things develop and if the latest negotiations  manage to ease the tension.    But the fact remains that the Belgian Government does not  seem very worried by the prospect of the HCR disappearing so  easily, despite the fact that it has always seen it as the sole  representative body of the Zairian transition.    The alarming descriptions of what is happening in the field  also seem to be meeting with little reaction.    Several witnesses report troop movements, sporadic looting  and violence, none of which augurs well.    Many people are now hoping above all that Mobutu becomes  genuinely involved in the interim process in order to avoid any  further breaking of the consensus and further delays for the  transition.</p>

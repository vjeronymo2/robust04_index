			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TOURISTS IN WESTERN YUGOSLAVIA CLAMOR FOR MUSHROOM FABLED TO PEP UP SEXUALITY  </P> <P> A wild mushroom reportedly capable of restoring virility and enhancing  fertility is causing quite a scramble among tourists in western Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Hundreds of foreign visitors, mostly men, are tramping through fields and  forests in search of the morel, or Morchella Esculanta, which grows in the  region around Mt.  </P> <P> Romanija in the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Yugoslav news  agency Tanjug said.  </P> <P> Villagers tell visitors of the wife of a retired woodcutter who had 12  children, the last one when she was 57. Or there's 101-year-old Zada Smajic,  mother of 10, whose husband died a few years ago but was "full of vigor until  his last day."  </P> <P> The fungus grows mostly around the village of Preljubovici -- the name  translates as "adulterers" -- and is named after a Turkish governor several  centuries ago who is said to have discovered the mushroom's powers.  </P></p>

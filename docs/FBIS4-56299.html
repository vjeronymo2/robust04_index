			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ismael Romero, Victor Cardoso, Angelica Enciso, </F> Oscar Camacho, Juan Manuel Venegas, and Triunfo Elizalde]    [Text]  <H5>  There Is no Guarantee for Clean Elections, They </H5> Noted    Leaders of the National Action Party (PAN), the Party of the  Democratic Revolution (PRD), and representatives of human rights  organizations have demanded that the federal government explain  why it purchased riot gear and what its use will be because  "this is an ominous act reflecting anxiety within the government  and indicating its preparation to confront problems and social  demonstrations in the country." They believe this decision  suggests that the government will not be able to guarantee clean  presidential elections because it is preparing to face  postelection discontent.    Andres Rozental, deputy foreign relations secretary, denied  that importing riot vehicles reflects fears of possible  outbreaks of violence after the August elections. The official  said the purchase of armored equipment is "a natural development  in all world countries," adding that any claim it will serve to  control postelection disturbances is "irresponsible." Rozental  explained that importing 24 riot units was the responsibility of  the National Defense Secretariat, which has been totally silent.  The Media Directorate only stated "they do not know anything  yet." He criticized the U.S. newspaper that reported this for  doing so "without having any evidence," indicating that the  purchase is indeed related to possible postelection disturbances.    Juan Jose Castillo Mota, deputy of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI), justified the measure and said it was  about time to enforce the law and equip security forces with the  most modern technology. "The equipment is not to restrict  freedom of expression, but we must start to enforce the law with  groups of citizens who commit abuses during demonstrations,  especially when they block highways, an action that sometimes  involves 20 to 50 people. Thus, in these cases we must clear  highways and enforce the law," Castillo added.    Last Thursday, the SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS NEWS published a  front  page report claiming that in the past two months the Mexican  Government has imported at least 24 armored vehicles designed to  control riots and that "this is apparently in preparation for  civil disturbances after the late summer elections" in Mexico.  <H5>  Government Adopting Hard Line: PRD </H5>   During a tour of Los Angeles, PRD National President  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano said "the creation of the Mexican  Public Security Coordinating Board (CSPN) and the appointment of  Arsenio Farell to chair it shows that the government is adopting  a hard line. The purchase of the riot equipment has the same  purpose. "The government seeks to compensate for the evident  weakness of its presidential candidate with these kind of  measures."    Mario Saucedo, secretary general of the PRD CEN [National  Executive Committee], said everything seems to indicate that  this administration expects a citizen mobilization "because it  is planning to impose its candidate." There is no doubt, he  insisted, given the most recent measures, that "it will try to  implement this action at all cost."    Ricardo Valero, coordinator of the PRD deputies, pointed out  the most recent federal government decisions on security matters  "are disturbing and extraordinarily dangerous." He added that a  confirmation of the purchase of riot tanks in relation to the  creation of the CSPN and the reappearance of figures such as  Carlos Hank Gonzalez would "objectively" lead us to conclude  that Salinas de Gortari has no intention of supporting a  credible electoral process.    Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, spokesman for the Cardenas  presidential campaign, pointed out that these developments "are  clear signs of the entrenchment and hardening of the position of  the state." He wondered: "If they will guarantee clean  elections, what do they want armored vehicles for?    PRD Legislator Julio Cesar Garcia underscored the repressive  nature of a measure such as the one that was reported, because  it jeopardizes the constitutional rights of freedom of  expression and of conducting public demonstrations.    Garcia said the government is seeking ways to protect  itself and apply a forceful hand on possible protests following  the presidential elections of 21 August.    Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, also a PRD member, demanded  "specific information" from the government regarding the alleged  purchase of 24 riot units and an explanation of the purpose of  the purchase because the conclusion one might reach at this  point is that the goal is to impose a "hard-line policy" and a  policy of "confrontation." He added: "I do not wish to make  predictions or speculations, but we do hope this administration  is not thinking about using them to counter political  demonstrations" because this possibility, which is undemocratic,  reflects a false concept of national security."  <H5>  PAN: Lightning That Presages a Storm </H5>   Felipe Calderon, secretary general of the PAN's CEN, pointed  out that "this kind of purchase is disturbing because it  suggests that the government is preparing to confront future  political problems." He added that resorting to this kind of  equipment "as an element of repression" is no way to confront  the causes of the violence that is provoked in the country.  Actually, he said, a culture of political responsibility must  be promoted instead of the modernization of the apparatus of  repression.    PAN Federal Deputy Jose Paoli said that should the federal  government not explain the purchase of riot vehicles, this will  be demanded within the Chamber of Deputies. PAN Legislator  Manuel Rivera del Campo pointed out that, although the  authorities refuse to admit it, importing riot vehicles shows  that "it is clear that things are not going as well in the  country as they wish to make us believe because there are many  problems that the government has not solved. "It is not correct  to confront citizen protests or demonstrations through forceful  means because they will create more problems than those that  they are trying to solve," he added. Rivera noted that "the  government is expecting an ungovernable situation after the  elections and adopted this measure as a precaution against a  conflict in order to be able to subdue the demonstrators." He  warned: "This is lightning that presages a storm."  <H5>  Forceful Actions and Violence: ONG [Nongovernmental </H5> Organizations]    The national network of civilian human rights organizations  also gave its opinion on the 24 riot units that the Mexican  Government purchased in the United States. It stated that "if  there were political will, there would be no need for tanks to  face riots." "The purchase of this equipment suggests that there  will be no clean presidential elections," it added.    Mariclaire Acosta, of the Mexican Defense and Protection of  Human Rights Commission [Comision Mexicana de Defensa y  Proteccion de los Derechos Humanos], said: "We must realize that  the government is determined to face a major postelection  conflict." She underscored that these problems will be similar  to those faced in France, where political disorders are settled  through forceful and violent means.    Emilio Krieger, president of the National Association of  Democratic Lawyers (ANAD), pointed out that "this is a serious"  measure and that "one could presume that the government is  purchasing weapons in preparation for the elections." I would  like to know, he added, whether the purchase of these tanks is  related to the electoral process; this must be explained not by  the National Defense Secretariat or the Government Secretariat,  but by the president of the republic.    The Roads and Safety Secretariat said the weapons it plans  to  purchase seek to modernize the sector. It reported that the  pistols it will purchase will reportedly hold 18 rounds and  added that it is currently negotiating with a Swedish company  called Sixsahuer.    [Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish on 29 April on page 53  publishes a 150-word article stating that: "Enrique Jackson,  secretary general of the Federal District government, and  Humberto Benitez Trevino, attorney general of the Federal  District, said they know nothing about the purchase of riot  equipment."]</p>

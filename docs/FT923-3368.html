			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lilley omits interim pay-out LILLEY, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group which has been among the hardest hit by the collapse of the property development market, yesterday omitted its interim dividend. The group achieved an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.05m for the half year to June 30. However, the rise reflected a cut in interest charges from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 1m. At the operating level, profits were down from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 2.31m with the contracting contribution down by Pounds 1.83m at Pounds 2.23m. The passing of the interim dividend - 1p was paid previously - was blamed on a continuing 'hostile and uncertain' climate. Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman and one of the UK's leading company doctors, commenting on the group's interim results and depressed share price, emphasised that Lilley continued to have the support of its bankers and Tibest Tres, the company owned by two of Spain's largest construction groups which paid Pounds 24m for a 21.5 per cent stake in Lilley last autumn. He expressed hope that the publication of the interim results would 'dispel unfounded market concern about the group's position,' and said action to reduce group borrowings was continuing. In particular, he noted that the unwinding of joint commitments with London &amp; Edinburgh Trust earlier this year had reduced borrowings by about Pounds 10m, surplus housing land had been sold for Pounds 3.75m and Lilley's interest in the New Hong Tunnel Company had been sold raising a further Pounds 3.1m. Group turnover for the opening half year fell to Pounds 156.34m (Pounds 162.16m) and earnings per share slipped to 0.75p (0.91p). Annual overheads have been reduced by Pounds 4m following a review. Turnover of the contracting operations fell to Pounds 117.4m (Pounds 123.6m). Lilley said workload was still at reasonable levels, but business had been increasingly hard to secure and margins had been eroded throughout the industry. Turnover from specialist construction fell slightly to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 27.3m) but operating profits fell more sharply to Pounds 441,000 (Pounds 2.14m) reflecting reduced volumes in piling and US leasing businesses. In property development and housebuilding, operating losses were reduced to Pounds 359,000 after recording a Pounds 931,000 gain on the sale of the group's investment in Caledonian Land. In 1991, the section posted a Pounds 2.73m operating loss. COMMENT Lilley has been working as hard as it can just to survive. It is making all the right moves by cutting overheads, selling assets, reducing debt and getting out of the property development business. But although this seems to have satisfied its bankers and its new Spanish shareholders, the market has remained uneasy. Yesterday the stock gained 1 1/2 p to 8p. With full-year pre-tax profits forecast at around Pounds 3m the prospective p/e is 4. But with no yield to speak of, this is not a stock for the timid.</p>

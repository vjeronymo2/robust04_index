			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BALTICS MARK 'DAY OF TRAGEDY': ABSORPTION INTO SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> The Baltic republics on Saturday quietly marked what Lithuania called "a day of  injury, humiliation and tragedy," the 50th anniversary of the absorption of the  republics into the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Flags flew at half-staff in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, and Latvia  announced that its lawmakers had voted to nullify the 1940 declaration of  Soviet power.  </P> <P> For decades, July 21 had been celebrated as an official holiday in Estonia,  Latvia and Lithuania. But the three Baltic republics in the last year have  expanded their sovereignty and announced their intention to break with the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Lithuania's prime minister was quoted Saturday as saying that negotiations with  Soviet officials on the republic's March 11 declaration of independence could  start this week.  </P> <P> Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were independent of Moscow briefly between the  two world wars. But under a secret agreement signed by Kremlin dictator Josef  Stalin and Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler in 1939, they fell into the Soviet  sphere of influence.  </P> <P> Soviet soldiers moved in as Nazi forces attacked Poland, and under Soviet  pressure the parliaments of the three republics voted to join the Soviet Union.  They were admitted as Soviet republics in early August, 1940. Thousands of  Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians were killed or sent into exile or prison.  </P> <P> The Latvian Supreme Soviet voted Thursday to void the 50-year-old declaration  of Soviet power, Aris Yansons, an assistant to Latvian President Anatoly  Gorbunov, said Saturday.  </P> <P> The proclamation strengthened the Parliament's condemnation of the act in  February.  </P> <P> Lithuania's government said in a statement Saturday that "the 21st of July  remains a day of injury, humiliation and tragedy in our memory."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's main newspapers carried articles Saturday backing the  Kremlin position by depicting the Baltics' absorption into the country as  voluntary and calling for "responsibility and common sense."  </P></p>

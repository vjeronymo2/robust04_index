			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marisa Chimprapha] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh -- Cambodia is enjoying zero per cent  inflation for the first time since the 1993 election, the  government has stopped printing banknotes and has balanced tax  revenue with government spending, Finance Minister Sam Rangsi  said.    Before the election the country's inflation rate had reached  200 per cent, Rangsi said, adding that Cambodia should be  registered as the only country to reduce its inflation rate to  zero while its economy is developing after a decade-long war.    "The growth rate of the GDP in 1993 is 5 per cent and we  expect to increase it to 7 per cent this year," Rangsi said in  an interview with THE NATION.    Rangsi said that one year after the UN-organized elections  the government is still functioning, and civil servants and  police have been fully and regularly paid their monthly salary.    "One year after the election, the government can maintain  itself, not collapse. It can provide public utilities for the  people -- water, electricity and other facilities. We did not  collapse, although we got only US$13 million from the UN against  a promise of about US$60 million for the first six months after  the election," he said.    He blamed a budget deficit and inflation on the previous  administration of then Prime Minister Hun Sen, of the Cambodian  People's Party. The problem facing the country now was law  enforcement, he said.</p>

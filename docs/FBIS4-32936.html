			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos: "Two Summits"] </F>   [Text] Today's newspaper refers to Cuba's intention to  support -- and I quote -- integration at the fourth  Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in two  weeks -- unquote.    First, I want to remind our listeners that this will be the  fourth time that chiefs of state and government from Latin  America, Spain, and Portugal have met. They will meet without  having been called upon by the United States and without the  presence of its representatives to discuss matters of interest  to our countries.    Meetings like these used to be organized by the U.S.  Administration. It is still clear in my memory the image of one  of the latest calls for a meeting of Latin American presidents  or chiefs of state held, I believe, in Panama before the  revolution.    I remember Fulgencio Batista, with his greasy long hair and  brand new jean suit, following the traditional fashion among  leaders of the political chicanery. Batista, a legion of  dictators, and grandchildren of the Americans themselves were  present.    Today's summits are quite different from yesterday's  summits.  Meeting with Spain and Portugal without Americans present is  somewhat of a new thing. Three Ibero-American summits were held  in this manner, namely in Brazil, Spain, and Mexico. The fourth  will be held in Colombia.    Presidents of different political tendencies have attended  these summits, but there has always been mutual respect and  consensus on matters which are vital for our peoples. Fidel's  words and presence have always been present at those summits.    The latest summit approved a virtual sanction on the U.S.  blockade against Cuba, surely an exceptional achievement. It  seems these four summits have been too much for this great  northern country, which has decided to sponsor a similar summit.  I mean similar but not equal. I mean similar because it is  also a summit of chiefs of government, and I say that it will  not be equal because Cuba will not be present.    The U.S. summit will be held in Miami in December, while the  summit that will be held by the Ibero-American nations will  discuss, to a great extent, integration. As I said, Cuba will  try to promote this integration because this unity is vital in  our current world.    I want to remind everyone that integration means more unity,  especially in the economic field. We will produce for the  continent using raw material from the continent, and we will  trade among ourselves. Latin America, Spain, and Portugal  comprise such a large territory where there are all types of  climates, all productions, and all resources. What one country  lacks can be found in another, or vice versa. So, there should  be no artificial borders capable of hampering this common flow.    I said there should not be, but there are artificial  borders,  namely those imposed by the interests of the Americans which are  owners of half of the continent and who are against these  integrationist ties because they are not good for them. This is  why they have not been invited for the previous Ibero-American  summits because our language is very different. And now they  are making up their little meeting in Miami, as if it were a  consolation tournament, out of spite because they were not  invited to the previous summits.    All countries of the continent will be represented in Miami,  but not Cuba, as the strange maps of the Caribbean which are  currently made by the transnational companies, maps where Cuba  or our archipelago are not present. But one thing is true:  Although we are not on their little maps, Cuba and the Cubans do  exist, live, work, and fight. We might be blockaded, but we  have our own voice, out of tune, of course, with the U.S.  appetites. Perhaps for this reason, we are not invited to that  little party in Miami because they do not want to hear our voice  live.</p>

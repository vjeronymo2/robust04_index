			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspodent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good afternoon. Representatives of the government  and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] have been holding a meeting in the Mulungushi Conference  Center since this morning in the search for solutions to the  issue of swearing in deputies for Jonas Savimbi's organization  in Parliament. The issue has been under discussion since 3 June.  The outcome of this meeting, which is also being attended by  the mediators and observers, is not known. We will give further  details later on.    Meanwhile, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim told the TIMES OF  ZAMBIA today that his organization insists that the government  grant UNITA key posts in the Foreign and Interior Ministries, as  well as a number of posts at provincial government level,  regardless of offers made by the Angolan authorities in a spirit  of cooperation and national reconciliation. The TIMES OF ZAMBIA  reports that diplomatic sources confirm UNITA's position.  Moreover, Jorge Valentim also said that renewed military  operations in the country are affecting the morale of his  organization's negotiators. He also said that over the past few  days the relationship with government representatives has become  tense, and the two teams do not even shake hands before each  working session as stipulated by the rules.    Meanwhile, diplomatic circles have expressed concern about  the fate of the Angolan peace talks between the government and  UNITA and appealed to mediator Alioune Blondin Beye, the troika  of observers, the United States, Portugal, and Russia, to do the  utmost to put an end to clashes in Angola, so that negotiations  may be successful and a peace agreement signed.    The meeting between the government and UNITA teams has just  been concluded. Unfortunately, after heated debates, the  results are not the most desired ones. All that is known is  that contradictions resulting from the UNITA team's ploys  persisted in this working session. The negotiators will resume  the talks this afternoon to continue discussing the  abovementioned point which is becoming cantankerous.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sterling weakness turns shares lower CURRENCY fears took a hand in the UK stock market yesterday, and early gains in shares were reversed later when sterling slipped lower against the D-Mark on the foreign exchange markets, challenging its low in the European exchange rate mechanism. The FT-SE Index was only 4.1 off at the close of share trading, but this contrasted with an earlier rise of 13 points when London was responding favourably to the Bundesbank's decision to leave its Lombard rate unchanged. The slide in the pound implied a new threat of higher interest rates in the UK, and the stock market saw increased selling pressure towards the close of trading. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,359.4, with traders sounding nervous about this morning's opening in the London markets. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, last night reduced its year-end forecast for the FT-SE Index from 2,750 to 2,600, following downgrades to both its GDP and corporate earnings predictions. The 2,750 estimate is postponed until the end of next year. The investment bank's decision coincided with a simi-larly bearish review of the economy from Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, who warned yesterday that economic recovery will be delayed until 1994. The stock market's currency concern was also fuelled by weakness in the US dollar ahead of an important speech from President Bush and by rumours, denied by the German Finance Ministry, that a meeting of the Group of Seven ministers was planned. The stock market opened cautiously, unwilling to extend the modest recovery of the previous session in spite of the rally of 4.2 per cent by the Nikkei Average, which was offset by Wall Street's fall of 22 Dow points overnight. However, the blue chip stocks, inclined to drift easier while awaiting the outcome of the Bundesbank policy meeting, were quickly pulled upwards from an initial dip of six Footsie points by a firm opening in stock index futures. The Footsie was soon ahead by 13 points at 2,376.5. Trading volume was light at this stage and optimism restrained by the latest German money supply data, which appeared to set a gloomy backcloth for the Bundesbank meeting. The July money supply statistics for the UK had little effect, however. Although below its best levels, the London market held up at midsession and drew the expected benefit from the Bundesbank's favourable decision on German interest rates. The setback in share prices did not appear until the pound turned down, but the response from stock index futures was swift, and the underlying blue chips followed suit. Seaq trading volume increased to 425.9m shares, the highest daily total this week, as market traders nervously lightened their dealing books. The 393.7m shares traded across the Seaq network on Wednesday reflected retail, or customer, business in equities worth only Pounds 778m, still very poor in terms of profitability to the London securities industry.</p>

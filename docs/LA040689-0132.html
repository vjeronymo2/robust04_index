			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> ONE-RUN WIN OVER VALLEY MAY WAKE GLENDALE  </P> <P> Glendale College's 10-inning, 11-10 baseball win over Valley last Saturday  might have been more significant than the school's other Western State  Conference victories. It could have been a coming-out party of sorts for the  vacillating Vaqueros.  </P> <P> Has Glendale, which has struggled with consistency in posting an 11-14 record,  rounded the corner of mediocrity?  </P> <P> "I sure hope so," Coach Steve Coots said. "It's the first time we really  stretched and beat somebody ahead of us.  </P> <P> "I think (the potential) has always been there but we've always been a nickel  short. Hopefully, we're over the hump and going downhill now."  </P> <P> And Valley was no small hump. The Monarchs are 20-5-1 and ranked second in the  state.  </P> <P> Glendale trailed, 10-9, in the 10th inning but came back when Chris Majors led  off with a home run and Art Chute singled in the winning run.  </P> <P> But it was in the sixth inning that the ball began to bounce Glendale's way.  Marco Asselin was able to bunt a bounced pitch to squeeze in a run to give the  Vaqueros a 7-5 advantage.  </P> <P> Record setters: Occidental College softball Coach Mike Schmidt has grown  accustomed to the ribbing he gets from fellow coaches.  </P> <P> He's the winningest coach in Occidental softball history, but when you check  the history, that's not really saying much. The Tigers won just one game last  season and did not fare much better in the previous two seasons softball has  been a varsity sport.  </P> <P> The Tigers are 5-9 and 0-2 in Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic  Conference play this spring.  </P> <P> "Talent-wise I think we match up with just about everybody," Schmidt said. "But  it's hard to instill that, 'Hey, we should never lose a game attitude' when  it's never been there before."  </P> <P> Double time: Crescenta Valley High runner Morgan Bateman says he won't be at  his best in the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday.  </P> <P> At least he hopes he isn't. Bateman wants to save his best performances for the  state championships in June.  </P> <P> His coach, Keith Gilliland, agrees. "A lot of kids don't do well in the end,"  he said. "When kids hit that peak there's a tendency for them to start  panicking, especially when they see others improve around them."  </P> <P> Bateman, the Souther Section 4-A Division 800-meter champion, says he was  running much faster at this point last year. But his decision to run both the  800 and 1,600 this season has slowed him.  </P> <P> "I'm stronger but I'm just not as sharp yet," Bateman said.  </P></p>

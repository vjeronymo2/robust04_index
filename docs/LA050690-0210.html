			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: HIGH STYLE;  </P> <P> THE NEXT COMPUTER FASHION OF THE '90S  </P> <P> FOR A LONG time, computer lovers referred to the NeXT computer as "vaporware"  -- it sounded great but was never quite ready to enter production. Everything  about it sounded larger than life, including the $100,000 fee reportedly paid  to Paul Rand to design the logo (that's $25,000 per letter).  </P> <P> The NeXT is the brainchild of Steve Jobs, co-creator of the original Apple  computer and the Macintosh. Jobs claims that computers have a 10-year life  span: The IBM PC (introduced in 1981) is moribund, the Macintosh (introduced in  1984) has peaked, and the '90s, he boasts, will belong to the NeXT. Instead of  a conventional floppy or hard disk, the NeXT incorporates a state-of-the-art  removable, erasable optical drive. And its screen resolution is nearly twice  that of the Mac, to better display the reference books in digital form that  come bundled with the computer, including the complete works of Shakespeare and  Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary.  </P> <P> As a design object, the NeXT (for $10,000) fascinates. Instead of the customary  beige-colored keyboard, mouse and monitor, NeXT's are stark black. That plus  the jazzy connectors evoke an Art Deco look. The incongruous mix of advanced  technology and '30s future-world styling evokes the phantasmagoric worlds of  such '80s movies as "Batman," "Blade Runner" and "Brazil." Such unusual looks  help persuade buyers that the NeXT really is different from previous personal  computers.  </P> <P>  The NeXT computer system is available at all Businessland stores.

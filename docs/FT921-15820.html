			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Porsche sales slump in US PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car company whose earnings have suffered as a result of weakness in world markets, yesterday said sales in the US had slumped from 9,100 to 4,400 last year, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. In December, they totalled 270 cars against 800 the year before. The steep decline in what used to be its dominant market - it sold nearly 70 per cent of output in the US before business was hit by the 1987 stock market crash and dollar weakness - was generally expected in view of the recession in the US and the problems of the motor sector in North America. Porsche will next week spell out details of its performance at its annual press conference near Stuttgart. It has already said that net profits in its financial year to July 31 1991 fell to less than DM60m (Dollars 39m) from DM68.4m.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> JILL IRELAND: HER STORY OF RESILIENCE  </P> <P> Life Lines by Jill Ireland (Warner Books: $19.95; 352 pages)  </P> <P> By now, you've probably seen a lot of ink about actress Jill Ireland and her  new book, "Life Lines," an account of her son's struggle with drug addiction.  In these very pages, we've learned that Ireland is again battling for her life  against cancer -- a once-successful battle that was the subject of her 1984  best seller, "Life Wish." Even so, she is making plans to play herself in a  movie based on "Life Lines." Now, after all the hype, comes the chance to  actually read the book itself.  </P> <P> "Pain is inevitable," Ireland writes of the break-up of her marriage to actor  David McCallum and her love affair with Charles Bronson -- but the phrase also  describes each of the hurts and losses, great and small, that are recounted in  "Life Lines." From her short prologue -- an unattended miscarriage in a German  hotel room -- to the sustained account of her son's heroin and cocaine  addiction, Ireland has composed nothing less than a fugue of excruciating but  poignant memories: her distant recollections of a stay in a hospital at the age  of 11 months ('The sense of loss, the loneliness and isolation were more than  my little girl's mind could absorb"); the imagined outrage of her adopted son,  torn from his natural mother at birth and handed to a stranger ("Small nostrils  flared, seeking the smell of her, but he could not find it. The yearning grew  worse"); the death of a beloved friend ("Her face was made up in a way that did  not seem quite right," she writes of the open-casket funeral. "I redid her  hair, pulling it forward over her brow the way she used to wear it.").  </P> <P> Along the way, Ireland tells two tales of grief in parallel narratives. One is  about the devastating ill health -- "ulcerated colitis and Crohn's disease . .  . a colostomy, three intestinal surgeries, a trio of heart attacks, open-heart  surgery involving five bypasses, and subsequently a series of strokes" -- that  afflicted her charming father, Jack Ireland, whose "touch of the streets spiked  my blood and strengthened my character." And the other is about the alcohol,  cocaine and heroin addiction that tormented her adopted son: "A malevolent star  had cast a shadow on the light that should have shone protectively around  Jason."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Short Bursts of Prose  </P> <P> Ireland writes in short, intense bursts of prose, and each brief chapter is  full of observation and incident: a remembered fragment of song, an endearing  family ritual, a naughty limerick recited by the cherished grandfather.  Surprisingly, the book is not a dirge -- Ireland is a doughty and vivacious  storyteller who is quick to reassure us with moments of tenderness and joy. But  she is also a virtuoso at playing the heartstrings. And, sometimes, it's all a  bit too contrived, as when she sets up a 70-word chapter in order to depict her  young daughter crying over a fearful separation from mother: "But, Mama, I'm  just a little girl," young Zuleika pleads. "You are my lifeline."  </P> <P> At center stage in "Life Lines" of course, is Jason. Of the seven children that  she has raised, Ireland writes, "Jason was the only serious casualty, an  innocent bystander, shot by the stray bullets of decisions made years before he  was born -- marriages that did not work out, concepts of child-rearing passed  on from different eras and cultures. . . ." Young Jason was a bedwetter, an  asthma sufferer, a victim of dyslexia and hyperkinesia and -- much later -- a  drug addict. And Ireland torments herself over why Jason was so afflicted --  was it because he was separated from his natural mother at birth? Or because  Ireland so readily acknowledged that he was adopted "in my  let's-keep-everything-out-in-the-open idealistic attitude"? At the end of "Life  Lines," however, we are given other, far more squalid and terrifying  explanations of Jason's ill fate.  </P> <P> By the time he reached adolescence, Jason "spun out into the world with the  abandon of a banshee." We witness his first love affair, at the age of 16, with  an older married woman who introduced him to champagne and cocaine, among other  pleasures of the flesh -- Ireland hired a private detective to "bust" the  real-life Mrs. Robinson. Later, while Ireland was undergoing chemotherapy  during her first bout with cancer, she received the fateful telephone call:  "The kid's on the needle," a doctor said of Jason. "He's an addict."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trials Eerily Alike  </P> <P> The account of Jason's attempt to kick his habit is no less harrowing and  horrific than Ireland's fight against breast cancer. Indeed, many of the  medical and emotional trappings are eerily alike -- and the recurrence of  Jason's addiction now strikes us as an augury of Ireland's own renewed struggle  with cancer. "Although the cancer monster still sat on my shoulder, I carried  my burden more easily," she writes. "The weight I could not and would never  carry easily was the knot in my soul, the knowledge that my middle son was now  and forever a drug addict. But for now, Jason was clean and I was taking a  necessary respite from apprehension."  </P> <P> The real hero of "Life Lines" is Jill Ireland herself. She mostly resists the  temptation to depict herself as a rescuer or a martyr, but we come away from  the book with the sense that she is a woman of tremendous strength and  resilience, charm and courage. As her father said (in the last words he uttered  before suffering a stroke): "You've been a real brick through all of this."  </P></p>

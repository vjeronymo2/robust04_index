			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Petro-Canada steps up exploration in west as profits climb sharply Petro-Canada, the privatised national oil company that has been undergoing a restructuring, has reported a sharp increase in fourth-quarter profits. The group is also stepping up exploration in western Canada. Profits for the quarter advanced to CDollars 36m (USDollars 27m), or 15 cents a share, up 33 per cent from CDollars 27m, or 12 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.15bn, down 8 per cent. For the whole of 1993 profit was CDollars 162m, or 66 cents a share, up from CDollars 9m, or 4 cents, on revenues of CDollars 4.6bn, a fall of 2 per cent. The group's 1994 capital spending programme will total CDollars 555m, for upgrading its refineries and contributing to the offshore Hibernia oil project. PetroCan has been restructured since early 1992, with successive asset sales and cost reductions. Oil and gas output rose last year but operating profit declined because of lower crude oil prices. Downstream operations, however, improved significantly. In 1994 the group will invest CDollars 125m in western exploration, CDollars 155m in refining and CDollars 210m in the 25 per cent-owned Hibernia project. This is running into serious cost overruns, and PetroCan's original CDollars 1bn commitment over five years may not be sufficient. Hyundai of Korea, a platform contractor, is considering taking over management of the CDollars 5bn-plus project. Rio Algom, now primarily a base metals mining group, is raising CDollars 157m by a fully underwritten issue of shares with warrants attached at CDollars 22.50 per unit. Part of the proceeds will be used for investment in Chile's Cerro Colorado copper project. Canada Trust, with CDollars 150bn assets under management, has bought 80 per cent of Toronto discount broker Meridian Securities from the Royal Bank of Canada and management, and plans to move into insurance. CT has nearly 400 branches in Canada and owns a US savings and loan company.</p>

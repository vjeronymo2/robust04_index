			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating.  </P> <P> Among the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is  said to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's  intentionally spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: The alien turns  out to be a vegetable.  </P> <P> "Vampire's Kiss" (1989), directed by Robert Bierman. 96 minutes. Rated R. A  contemporary spin on the vampire fantasy, with Nicolas Cage as a neurotic New  Yorker who thinks a one-night stand (Jennifer Beals) has turned him into  Dracula. May be too offbeat for horror fans, but this clever, cartoon-ish  metaphor has bite.MARK CHALON SMITH  </P></p>

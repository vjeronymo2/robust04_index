			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: RH Macy records Dollars 671m loss R. H. MACY, the large US department store chain which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year, yesterday announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 671.6m in the three months to February 1 - covering the key Christmas sales period. The figures, however, are confused by various write-off and restructuring charges. The company made a Dollars 499.8m loss before interest and reorganisation expenses, but after a Dollars 284.9m unusual item. This compared with a Dollars 182.5m surplus in the same period a year earlier - when there were no unusual items. The 'above-the-line' unusual items derive principally from a Dollars 241m write-off of goodwill, in turn related to the purchase of the I. Magnin and Bullocks divisions from Federated Department Stores in 1988. There is also a Dollars 40m charge to cover the costs of realigning the group in the 'east' and 'west' divisions. The interest charge for the period dropped sharply, to Dollars 68.9m from Dollars 178.3m but Macy then incurred a further Dollars 102.9m charge for reorganisation expenses. Within this figure, the retail group is charging Dollars 76m for store closings, Dollars 16m for deferred debt expenses, and Dollars 8m for the write-off of preferred stock issuance costs. Sales for the period totalled Dollars 2.05bn, a decrease of 6.4 per cent from the same quarter in 1990-1. On a same-store basis, Macy said that the fall was slightly reduced, to a 3.4 per cent decline. For the first six months of the financial year, Macy's sales now total Dollars 3.66bn - a 0.5 per cent fall on a comparable store basis. Macy added that cash and cash equivalents on hand at March 13 totalled Dollars 250m. It added that it has not yet used the Dollars 600m debtor-in-possession financing facility which has been approved by the bankruptcy court. It said that it does not expect to do so in the spring season, although part of the facility has been committed for overseas letters of credit.</p>

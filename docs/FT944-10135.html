			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Egypt to resume talks with IMF Egypt is to resume formal talks with the International Monetary Fund this year, to try to break a deadlock between the two sides over devaluation of the Egyptian pound. A Fund mission is expected in Cairo before Christmas to discuss devaluation and a raft of other issues, including reform of Egypt's tax and trade policies and the pace of its privatisation programme. Agreement to give new impetus to formal negotiations followed brief talks in Cairo this week between Mr Atef Sidki, Egypt's prime minister, and Mr Stanley Fisher, the new IMF managing director. Direct negotiations foundered in July when a team of Egyptian ministers failed to reach agreement on devaluation and a package of related issues in Washington. The IMF has been pressing Egypt to devalue the pound as part of its three-year-old structural adjustment policies, saying the currency is as much as 40 per cent overvalued and seriously impedes attempts to generate export-led growth. The pound has been held at around EPounds 3.38 to the dollar for the duration of the IMF and World Bank stabilisation and structural reforms. The government has refused, saying devaluation would shatter hard-won confidence in the currency, which in turn has contributed to strong inflows of expatriated Egyptian money and reserves now topping Dollars 16bn. Neither Egyptian nor IMF officials would comment on this week's talks, but it is understood no substantive agreement was reached other than to resume negotiations. After the IMF talks, the government announced plans to sell shares in 17 public sector companies worth around EPounds 1.5bn (Dollars 440m) by January 17 to give a push to its hitherto sluggish privatisation programme.</p>

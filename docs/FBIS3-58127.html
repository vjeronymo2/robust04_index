			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels (DPA) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  pressed for closer political and military cooperation between  NATO and the reform states of Central and Eastern Europe. Kohl  told the heads of state and government during the opening of the  alliance's two-day conference in Brussels today that the  alliance had to take seriously the "understandable security  policy concerns" of the states of Central, Eastern, and  southeastern Europe. The people in these countries currently  felt they were living in a "gray zone of security."    For this reason, NATO's offer of "Partnership for Peace"  also  opened up the prospect of joining the Atlantic alliance. Kohl  stressed, however, that "nobody is able to give a concrete date  for this at the moment." Training for participation in  international peace missions could number among the joint  activities envisaged.    Kohl is also prepared to offer the reform states immediate  consultations if they are faced with a threat. This made clear  that the offer of a Partnership for Peace was not merely a  diplomatic cliche, "but a seriously intended step on the path  toward later membership," Kohl said.    No new rifts should be created in Europe. A relationship  based on partnership had to be developed with Russia and  Ukraine. Policies of partnership, responsibility, and  constructive involvement in international problems were expected  from the Russian side. Attempts at hegemony could not be  reconciled with these expectations, Kohl said.</p>

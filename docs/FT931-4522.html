			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Economy plan for Brazil outlined BRAZIL'S new economy minister, Mr Eliseu Resende, yesterday outlined a belt-tightening programme to rebuild the country's economy and curb inflation of over 25 per cent a month, Reuter reports from Brasilia. His appearance before the Senate to set out President Itamar Franco's economic plans was also designed to ease congressional worries about the government and his own appointment last week following the resignation of his predecessor, Mr Paulo Haddad, over appointments to the central bank board. Mr Resende largely repeated points made by himself and the president on combating inflation and lifting the economy from deep recession. The main goal, he said, was a 'selective return to economic growth from sustainable bases, generating more employment and more equal distribution of income'. Mr Franco would move to sell off more state companies at a faster rate, he said. State companies would also be made more efficient and he promised to limit investment in them. There would be 'rigid control and rationalisation of state companies'. Mr Rasende promised an 'austere fiscal policy. The national Treasury is going to spend less than it takes in', he said. Other points in his plan included continuing to open Brazil's economy, tax reform, exchange rates 'at levels adequate enough to promote exports', meeting Brazil's foreign debt commitments and strict spending controls. The minister also defended President Franco's tax package, due for a final Senate vote today, and its centerpiece tax on financial transactions. He said the Dollars 600m a month which it was estimated the tax would generate was 'extremely important to balance our accounts and bring our programme into effect'. Mr Resende also said the president would consult with supporters among congressional and party leaders before final details of his plan were released. Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, Inter-American Development Bank director, is to be the new central bank president.</p>

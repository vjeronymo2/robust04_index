			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN;  </P> <P> RICH A'S CAN GET RICHER WITH PICKS IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE DRAFT  </P> <P> Having used the annual June draft of high school and college players to help  build their budding dynasty, the Oakland A's have a chance to reinforce it with  seven of the first 66 choices in the three-day process that begins Monday.  </P> <P> And the A's seem to have the right formula.  </P> <P> They have drafted and developed three of the last four winners of the American  League's rookie of the year award -- Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Walt Weiss.  </P> <P> Their seven early selections in this year's draft include five compensation  picks for the loss of free agents Storm Davis, Dave Parker and Tony Phillips.  </P> <P> "We're excited," said Dick Bogard, A's scouting director. "We know we're going  to get some good players. Our biggest need throughout the system is pitching,  and that's what we'll try to address."  </P> <P> The Montreal Expos have a shot at an even bigger jackpot with 10 of the first  53 picks, the compensation for failing to sign their No. 1 selection of last  year and losing Hubie Brooks, Mark Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez as  free agents.  </P> <P> The Expos always have done well in the draft. All of their regulars, except  shortstop Spike Owen, were drafted and developed in the Expo system. Montreal's  problems surface when their players become eligible for free agency.  </P> <P> Said Gary Hughes, Montreal's scouting director: "We haven't had much success in  attracting or keeping free agents. But if we build a successful organization,  players will want to stay and players will want to come."  </P> <P> Everybody's No. 1 is pitcher Todd Van Poppel of Martin High in Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> But Van Poppel has said that he will attend the University of Texas rather than  sign. Is that leverage?  </P> <P> The Braves have the first pick and Paul Snyder, Atlanta's scouting director, is  spending the weekend in Arlington, trying to convince Van Poppel that owner Ted  Turner has a lot to offer.  </P> <P> If Van Poppel convinces the Braves that he will not sign, the Expos, who draft  11th, are expected to risk one of their top 10 picks on him, with the Braves  making Iowa shortstop Tim Costo their No. 1 choice.  </P> <P> Southern California players expected to go in the first round include  outfielder Tony Clark of Christian High in El Cajon, who is also considering  playing basketball at Arizona; first baseman Mark Newfield of Marina High in  Huntington Beach; catcher Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High in Westlake Village;  catcher Paul Ellis of UCLA; shortstop Aaron Holbert of Jordan High in Long  Beach, and pitcher Kurt Miller of West High in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Two local players with familiar bloodlines could go in the second round or  higher -- infielder Bret Boone of USC and outfielder Gary Mota of Fullerton  Community College.  </P> <P> Boone, who enhanced his status with an impressive display of power in NCAA  regional play, is coveted by the Boston Red Sox, for whom his grandfather,  former major leaguer Ray Boone, scouts. Mota is also being wooed by Arizona  State and has yet to complete the three years of college that his dad, Manny  Mota, demands of his sons.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, coming off what can be kindly called spotty performances in recent  drafts, select ninth in the first round but do not hold a second- or  third-round choice because of the signing of free agents Brooks and Jim Gott.  </P> <P> The Dodgers do get two compensation picks between the second and third rounds  after losing free agents John Tudor and Dave Anderson, and Scouting Director  Ben Wade said he expects to find quality players.  </P> <P> The Angels, who draft 24th, do not have a first-round selection because of  Langston's signing, but they are not upset. After making Jim Abbott their No. 1  in 1988 and Kyle Abbott their No. 1 in 1989, there is not another Abbott who  fits their No. 1 mold anyway.  </P> <P> There has been suspicion that the 1990 baseball contains the same juice as the  1987 model, but, although home runs are up in both the American and National  leagues over last year, the pace does not compare to '87, when the National  produced a record 1,824 homers and the American had a record 2,634.  </P> <P> The current American League pace projects to 2,165, the National to 1,531.  </P> <P> Through 40 games for every team, the yardstick employed by the Elias Sports  Bureau, there had been 378 homers hit in the National League, an increase of 83  over a similar period in 1989 but 106 behind the '87 pace.  </P> <P> In the American League, there had been 481 homers hit, an increase of 65 over  last year but 165 fewer than the '87 pace.  </P> <P> In analyzing the increase over last year, most cite the full-time availability  of Jose Canseco and Andre Dawson, the emergence of Cecil Fielder, the lockout  that left starting pitchers unprepared to sustain their stamina or throw  breaking balls through April and a deterioration of quality pitching in the  National League.  </P> <P> Having surpassed Ty Cobb's American League stolen-base record with his 893rd  steal Tuesday night, Oakland's Rickey Henderson is confident he will top Lou  Brock's major league record of 938 sometime in August.  </P> <P> "I want to be remembered as an all-around player, but I know that the  base-stealing will stand out," he said. "I expect to steal 1,200 to 1,500  before I'm through."  </P> <P> Fired manager Davey Johnson will get $850,000 in guaranteed salary from the New  York Mets through 1991, but the decision could prove even more costly to the  Mets if Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds make good on indications that  they will now leave as free agents.  </P> <P> Strawberry, eligible to go after the 1990 season, said Johnson's firing "pretty  much finalizes my decision."  </P> <P> He and Johnson had a number of confrontations, but Strawberry said, "Even with  all our disagreements, I love the man, I really do. He stood by me when it got  tough."  </P> <P> McReynolds, eligible to leave after the 1991 season, said of the Mets'  decision, "It stinks. I mean, I guess his history with the Mets doesn't matter  to the geniuses in the front office."  </P> <P> McReynolds may not have to think about moving far. Rumors persist that Johnson  will ultimately replace Bucky Dent as manager of the cross-town Yankees.  </P> <P> A headline in the New York Daily News the other day read: "Davey Preys While  Bucky Prays."  </P> <P> Acknowledged Johnson: "I'd like to manage the Yankees. I don't want to put any  pressure on Bucky, but I've learned to manage in the toughest market in the  league."  </P> <P> Of course, the Yankees make it that much tougher, considering the involvement  of owner George Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> Then again, Johnson wasn't sure who ran the Mets, calling General Manager Frank  Cashen and Vice Presidents Joe McIlvaine and Al Harazin a three-headed monster.  </P> <P> "At least with George you'd have some conversations," he said, pausing before  adding, "maybe too many."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, meanwhile, continues to leave the door open concerning Dent. He  told New York reporters in Chicago the other day that he considered Johnson "a  wonderful guy" and asked, "If you were the owner of a team 14 games (10,  actually) under .500, what would you do?"  </P> <P> One thing seems certain. Unless the Yankees -- who on top of all else lack  heart and guts, according to outfielder Mel Hall -- make a move in the  standings during a 26-game stretch against Eastern Division opponents that  began Friday, Dent will be out. Caught in the current crossfire, Dent's skin is  thickening in a hurry.  </P> <P> "It gets aggravating and annoying to hear the same questions every day," he  said. " 'Are you secure? Are you worried?' I don't even think about it. As I've  said, by the time I leave I'll be an armadillo."  </P> <P> The miseries continue to mount for the San Francisco Giants.  </P> <P>  -- Outfielder Kevin Bass goes on the 21-day disabled list and will be  sidelined two to three months because of knee surgery.  </P> <P>  -- Pitcher Rick Reuschel, 6-0 in May of last year and 0-5 in May of this year,  twists a knee and joins two other starting pitchers, Kelly Downs and Mike  LaCoss, on the disabled list.  </P> <P>  -- Another starter, Don Robinson, is activated after rehabilitating a  surgically repaired knee, only to suffer back spasms that require a cortisone  injection and leave him an indefinite starter today against the Houston Astros.  </P> <P>  -- Kevin Mitchell, batting .375 on the road through Thursday but only .253 at  home, where the Giants were 6-16 through Thursday, decides that the wind and  dust at Candlestick Park are too tough on his contact lenses and will try  glasses as a last resort.  </P> <P>  -- Will Clark, with one hit in his last 22 at-bats through Thursday, ends a  string of nine consecutive months in which he has hit .300 or better by batting  .203 in May.  </P> <P> The surprising success of his Minnesota Twins hasn't created any illusions for  Manager Tom Kelly in a division dominated by the A's.  </P> <P> What will it take for the Twins to win?  </P> <P> "A miracle. That's all, a miracle," Kelly said.  </P> <P> The San Diego Padres opened a 13-game home stand Thursday -- a make-or-break  span, perhaps. The Padres won three in a row and five of their last six on the  road after a team meeting prompted by Mike Pagliarulo's comments regarding the  selfishness of a leading San Diego player.  </P> <P> Pagliarulo didn't identify the player but left no doubt that it was Tony Gwynn.  </P> <P> The situation festered, with Gwynn and Pagliarulo exchanging media potshots,  until Manager Jack McKeon called the meeting. Gwynn reportedly exchanged views  with several players who supported Pagliarulo. Pitcher Eric Show and catcher  Benito Santiago were among others who drew teammates' fire for their attitudes.  </P> <P> "I know there were some hurt feelings, and I know a lot of guys didn't like  what was being said about them, but you don't have to be best friends to play  good together on the field," Pagliarulo said.  </P> <P> "I mean, if guys don't like me for what I said, get in line. I'll be damned if  I'm going to play for a mediocre team. I want to play on a winner, and I'm  going to do everything I possibly can to make it a winner."  </P> <P> Said Jack Clark: "There was a lot of bad stuff going on. When guys were  stealing bases, for instance, we'd actually step out of the way to give the  catcher a better chance of throwing the runner out.  </P> <P> "Now we're a team again. We've come a long way in the past week. I'm not saying  everything's perfect yet. We're still going to have a few more meetings to get  things ironed out, but this is a start."  </P> <P> Some comments . . .  </P> <P> General Manager Tom Grieve of the Texas Rangers on speculation that Manager  Bobby Valentine is in trouble: "I don't believe in firing the manager when  things go bad. That's a panic move, and I don't panic."  </P> <P> Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson on Bo Jackson's acceleration: "Yes, he  can really excel."  </P> <P> Recently retired pitcher Dan Quisenberry, on his decision to reject job offers  that would have put him on the road again: "I want to see what it's like being  married with children."  </P></p>

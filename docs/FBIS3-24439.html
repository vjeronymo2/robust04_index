In Mr. Boyko's opinion, the privatization of large and  medium-scale state enterprises is proceeding with ever  increasing success. As of today, 10,000 enterprises, at which 11  million workers are employed, have been privatized to the extent  of 70-80 percent. If the present rate is maintained--and right  now about 900 enterprises are being privatized monthly--by the  middle of 1994 they will number 13,000-14,000. In Mr. Boyko's  words, the number of shareholders in Russia comes to 40 percent  of the populace--much greater than in the United States or  England--and development of the securities market is exceeding  all expectations.    The holders of enterprise stock can be divided into three  groups, the general director stated. The first group, the  largest, comprises labor collectives themselves, which hold more  than 50 percent of the shares, as a rule. The second largest  group with respect to number of acquired shares consists of  major commercial structures which purchase shares of enterprises  at auctions. Finally we have the third group, consisting of  ordinary citizens.    In discussing the present state of privatized enterprises,  Maksim Boyko cited data from a sociological survey conducted by  the fund jointly with the World Bank. We see that 60 percent of  enterprises have started changing the selection and composition  of their production output, have replaced their suppliers of raw  materials, and have set about reducing the number of persons  employed in production. In Mr. Boyko's opinion, enterprises  converted to joint-stock operation and partially privatized  enterprises have been released from the guardianship of sector  ministries, and now independently determine their future plans.  It is likely that in the near future, some privatized  enterprises will begin issuing new securities. They require  financial and consultative assistance, however. The Russian  Center for Privatization intends to assist them in this.    In the words of Maksim Boyko, the center is developing  programs that should provide enterprises all the information  they need to exist under free market conditions and help find  foreign partners and investors. Last year the "Big Seven"  allocated $3 billion to establish the Fund To Assist  Privatization. It is expected that a portion of these funds will  go toward "technical assistance" programs. In addition, three  regional funds are being established: the Mid-Russia,  South-Russia, and St. Petersburg funds. According to Mr. Boyko,  it is planned to create similar funds in other regions.    Concerning the activity of check investment funds, Maksim  Boyko surmised that the most solid funds would now start a  search for their own character, reducing the selection of  securities they have and gradually shifting over to narrow  specialization.</p>

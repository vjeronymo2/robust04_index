			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- A Russian Government press  service official denied mass media reports on Wednesday that  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Tbilisi  during his vacation.    The official said that Chernomyrdin may visit Novorossiyisk  where a new Russian port is being built, but most likely in the  second half of his vacation.    The Russian prime minister is now vacationing on the Black  Sea. His spokesman Valeriy Grishin said earlier today that  during the vacation Chernomyrdin will continue working on the  second package of economic decrees which is now being drawn up  by the government.    The spokesman said that until the last minute it was not  clear whether or not Chernomyrdin will take his leave now,  mainly because of his active involvement in the work on the  package of economic decrees aimed at continuing economic reforms  in Russia. The first package was recently signed by President  Boris Yeltsin.    Grishin denied reports that Chernomyrdin would work on his  book during his vacation. "There will be simply no time left for  that. Besides, he needs rest too," he said.</p>

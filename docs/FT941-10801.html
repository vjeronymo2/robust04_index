			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Tory minister defends quangos The claim that the creation of quangos represented centralisation in government was 'preposterous' and the idea that they were unaccountable was 'absurd', Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday. He said quangos were an effective way of devolving responsibility for achieving policy objectives. They were not 'poodles in the lap of the secretary of state'. Mr Lang's speech in Edinburgh, on the theme of 'reinventing government', followed a Labour onslaught on quangos, or quasi autonomous non-governmental organisations. At the weekend Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said they were an abuse of democratic rights. Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife, said in the Commons yesterday: 'We see a situation where the public interest is playing second fiddle to private and vested interests. The promotion of the culture of closet Toryism is well to the fore. Nearly 5,000 people . . . are spending nearly Pounds 7bn of public money.' These bodies had 'very tenuous' lines of accountability to the Scottish Office, parliament, the press, MPs and the public, he said. Mr Lang said quangos such as school boards and health trusts in Scotland were examples of the 'exact opposite of centralisation' and were designed to carry the devolutionary process to the grass roots. They had many representatives of other political parties and 'still more of none,' he said. Quangos were accountable to parliament through their sponsoring secretary of state, with chief executives responsible to the accounting officer in the relevant government department. Mr Lang said quangos had a vested interest in securing policy success in a way that 'could not, perhaps, be expected of officials working in seemingly amorphous government departments'. The Conservatives had cut the number of quangos in Scotland by almost half since a 1980 report identified 84 executive public bodies, many of them created by Labour. Mr George Robertson, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary, said that the government's planned reform of local government would reduce the number of elected councillors compared with non-elected quango members.</p>

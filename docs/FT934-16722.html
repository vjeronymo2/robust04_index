			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The final argument IT LOOKED bad. The parliament building ringed by tanks, firing shell after shell at its plate glass windows. Inside, a huddled rump, the elected representatives of the people. Outside, a president who tears up the constitution, uses the army to impose his authority, and suspends opposition newspapers, egged on by the leaders of the 'free world'. It is bad, but that does not mean that Mr Yeltsin or his western backers are wrong. It is tragic that the post-Soviet power struggle in Russia had to be resolved in this manner, but it is not really surprising. What has been surprising up to now is the reluctance of almost all Russian parties to resort to force, and of the Russian armed forces to act as the arbiters of political conflict; and the widespread acceptance, in a country with little or no experience of democracy, of the idea that ultimately political power must be allocated by majority vote. Yet that principle, however valuable, is not by itself enough to resolve all conflicts. So much depends on who votes, and when, and for what. Most democracies have written constitutions to regulate those matters; but more important than any text is a social consensus, derived from tradition, about how things should be done. Vital principle In Britain, for example, there is a clear understanding among all parties that, if the monarch dissolves parliament on the advice of her prime minister, it is dissolved and new elections will be held. If Mr John Major lost a vote of confidence in the House of Commons, he would not need to send tanks to disperse his opponents. The issues in question were decided in Britain centuries ago, by people who were quite prepared to use the equivalent of tanks when a vital principle was at stake. Might is not right, but right without might is inoperative. Force is and always will be ultima ratio regum: the final argument of kings. In Russia, where these issues are now being decided for the first time, it is not surprising that that 'final argument' has had to be invoked. The locus of legitimacy was not clear. Mr Yeltsin had solid grounds for believing it lay with him, and took care to establish that this view was shared by the commanders of the armed forces. But his opponents were not convinced until the final argument was deployed. Indeed, so sure were they of their own legitimacy that on Sunday they took the initiative in attempting to seize power by force. The bloodshed that resulted is highly regrettable. But the outcome of the struggle is a matter of quite legitimate relief. Russia's crying need in present circumstances - and the overwhelming interest of the rest of the world - is for coherent government. It is not certain that Mr Yeltsin can satisfy it, but it is quite certain that his opponents could not. Economic autonomy Mr Yeltsin has won an important victory, even if at high cost. He owes it, to the dead as well as the living, to make sure that they have not died in vain. He must exploit his victory to the full, asserting his new-found authority not only in Moscow but throughout the federation. That does not mean installing a reign of terror, which would be repugnant to both Russian and international public opinion, and therefore counterproductive. It does mean dismissing officials who reject or ignore government decisions, and - much more difficult - replacing them with others who are competent as well as loyal. It means pushing ahead with the reforms that are giving economic autonomy to Russian individuals and firms. And it means organising new elections to settle the issue of legitimacy beyond doubt. Mr Yeltsin was said yesterday to have come round to the view that presidential and parliamentary elections should be held simultaneously. That would certainly be preferable to prolonging the agony, with a six-month presidential campaign straight after a three-month parliamentary one. Mr Yeltsin's victory yesterday will be pyrrhic indeed if he ends up with a new parliament no more co-operative than the one he has just forcibly dissolved. He has not got time to build a fully structured party. But he can and should endorse a full slate of candidates pledged to support him and his programme  -so that voters have a chance both to choose a president and to give him a majority he can work with.</p>

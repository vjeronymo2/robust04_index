			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPROGRAMMER ADMITS TARGETING AMISH WOMAN  </P> <P> A San Diego man who specializes in deprogramming cult followers has admitted  that he had tried to change the religious beliefs of an Amish woman.  </P> <P> Theodore Patrick Jr. of San Diego is being sought by police in the kidnaping of  Elma Miller, who was taken from her parents' home Oct. 31 and held for 20 days  while Patrick tried to sway her away from a religious splinter group.  </P> <P> Patrick invented the term deprogramming and turned the controversial practice  into a national movement in the early 1970s when parental complaints were on  the rise over the activity of authoritarian Christian and Eastern-based sects.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with the Ft. Wayne News-Sentinel, Patrick admitted  taking part in the attempted deprogramming. "I don't know what they (police)  are going to do," Patrick said.  </P> <P> Miller, 32, and her 9-year-old daughter, Annie, had lived in her parents' home  since she left her husband earlier this year. On Nov. 19, Elma Miller escaped  from a Mt. Vernon, Ill., farmhouse, telling police tales of being secreted from  home to home in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois.  </P> <P> Her estranged husband, Ezra Miller, 37, of rural LaGrange; her brother, Alvin  Yoder, 34; and Middlebury restaurateurs Robert Miller, 47, and his wife, Sue  Miller, 44, have been charged with conspiracy to commit criminal confinement  and conspiracy to commit burglary. They are free after posting bond.  </P> <P> Charges may be filed against people in three states who allegedly hid Elma and  Annie Miller in their homes, often keeping them in locked rooms, said LaGrange  County Prosecutor Susan Glick.  </P> <P> Charges also may be brought against Patrick, who allegedly led daily sessions  intended to bring Elma Miller back into the Amish church.  </P> <P> The deprogrammer wouldn't comment on the roles those charged played in the  abduction, but in general terms defended their actions.  </P> <P> "This man was legally married to her," Patrick said. "He had a right to take  her and talk to her. He had a right to get his family. He knew she was in  imminent danger."  </P> <P> Patrick said Elma Miller was abducted because she had joined a liberal Amish  sect whose charismatic leader is considering allowing his followers to have  phones and electricity. Rumors have circulated in the mainstream Amish  community that the sect's leader, Wilbur Eash, has supernatural powers.  </P> <P> Controversy is nothing new for Patrick, said Anson Shupe, a sociology professor  at Indiana University-Purdue University at Ft. Wayne. Shupe has written  numerous books on new religious movements.  </P> <P> Shupe worked with the LaGrange County Sheriff's Department to tentatively  identify Patrick as the deprogrammer by matching the description of the man and  his methods given by Elma Miller.  </P> <P> "Deprogramming an Amish may be a first," Shupe said. "This is another bizarre  story in his legend."  </P></p>

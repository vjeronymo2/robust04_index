In justifying its decision to hear the case in closed  sessions beginning with yesterday's session, the court stated  that "this is in conformity with the Penal Code and the adoption  of considerations related to public law, in view of current  circumstances and ramifications, especially pertaining to the  public interest and the position of the accused. Therefore, the  court deems it appropriate to hear the case in closed session."    Defense sources said that, in the course of the trial  yesterday, nothing occurred to make it necessary to change to  closed sessions. Most of the points raised had already been  raised in one form or another in previous sessions.    Defense sources also stated that the postponement for two  weeks instead of a month, as was the case in past sessions,  reflected the court's desire to expedite completion of the trial  and the issuing of verdicts.    These sources have expressed the belief that the sessions  will begin to be expedited, with greater progress being made in  the case. Sessions could be consecutive, at a rate of one every  two or three days.    Nevertheless, lawyers have refused to offer any  interpretation for the reasons for expediting the trial.  However, circles close to the litigation widely believe that  expediting the trial proceedings is related to the agreement to  hand over the second accused, Swaleh Naqvi, to the United  States. It is said that he will be surrendered within 120 days.    These circles stated that Naqvi cannot be surrendered while  his trial continues in Abu Dhabi. Perhaps this means that Abu  Dhabi is inclined to conclude the trial by next April, in order  to facilitate his surrender to American judicial authorities.    Counselor Muhammad Tamam, who is defending Naqvi, said that  he will not object to turning Naqvi over and that the trial that  Naqvi will have in the United States is related to other  matters, which are unconnected to the Abu Dhabi trial. Naqvi  will be asked about violations pertaining to the establishment  of banks within the United States.  <H5>  Reasons for Postponement </H5>   After the closed session, the Abu Dhabi court issued a  report  concerning the reasons for postponing the session yesterday. It  stated that the postponement was to give the defense the  opportunity to peruse all the documents presented to the court,  as well as to give them an opportunity to examine the Public  Prosecutor Office's memorandum, which had been submitted during  yesterday's session, and to give those who so desired a copy of  this memorandum. Another reason was to re-advise the first  accused, Agha Hassan Abedi, in writing, and to re-advise the  accused Ziauddin Akbar, who is imprisoned in Britain, by  diplomatic means.    The two accused were notified two weeks ago, but judicial  sources stated that the fact that they were outside the country  necessitated informing them again, so that they could have more  time.    At yesterday's session, the public prosecutor raised the  question of conflicts among the defendants' interests,  particularly those who are being defended by one lawyer. The  prosecution has requested that the defense be confined to one  defendant, since certain lawyers are defending several accused  at one time.    The lawyers thought the request strange, because this  question was discussed at the trial's first session. In the  prosecutor's presence, the judge had ruled that certain lawyers  could continue to defend two defendants at the same time, when  there was no conflict of interests. Yesterday, the court put off  consideration of the prosecution's request concerning the  question of conflict. It also agreed to hand over a copy of the  Ernst and Young, which is a part of the court records.  <H5>  Lawyers' Requests </H5>   At yesterday's session, the lawyers presented a joint  memorandum of requests relative to a number of defendants. One  of the most important of these requests was for files pertaining  to the shareholders' management committee, which was formed by  representatives of senior shareholders, whose members include  Ghanim Faris al-Mazru'i and Jaw'an Salim al-Zahiri. The request  also included calling the committee members to testify, if  necessary.    The lawyers submitted justifications for their requests. In  their memorandum, they said that these files might prove that  the suspicious loans, which their clients have been accused of  making, were made with the knowledge and approval of the  management committee, since they are influential persons with  right of disposition in accordance with the law. The memorandum  stated that compliance with this request might change the course  of the lawsuit.    In their joint memorandum, the lawyers requested the minutes  of actions and meetings of the certified accountants (Arthur  Andersen), which were conducted with the accused, because they  contain documents and records upon which their report was based.  This is required to enable the defendants to express their views  about these documents.    In their joint memorandum, the lawyers for the accused asked  for the reports of the accounting investigators of Price,  Waterhouse, the report of Neil Blair, and the report of the law  firm Allen and Afri [name as transliterated]. To justify this  request, the lawyers said that these reports clarify the bank's  situation. If they can establish that the accounts and  restrictions were healthy, then the accused would be cleared of  criminal activity.    The lawyers also requested the report of Ernst and Young,  upon which the public prosecutor's office has relied. They are  claiming civil rights, since the prosecution has not enabled the  defense to examine it, despite the fact that it constitutes  evidence.    They also requested the files of loans related to the  charges  against their clients, since these files constitute the "body of  crime." This would require placing those files in the court's  custody and consequently enabling the accused to examine them,  in order to show the soundness of procedures followed.    The lawyers pointed out that some of these loans had been  paid in full, while certain defendants have been implicated in  other loans without their having had a role regarding them,  inasmuch as these loans were made outside their jurisdictions or  after the approval of responsible officials.    In their memorandum, the lawyers requested that the accused  be released without bail. They pointed out that all the charges  related to them are connected and cannot be separated, inasmuch  as they must be considered one crime in accordance with Article  88 of the United Arab Emirates' Unified Penal Code. The maximum  punishment for this crime is three years. In view of the fact  that the accused have in fact completed that, they ought to be  released at once, because of the legal invalidity of their being  detained.</p>

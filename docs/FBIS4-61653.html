			<p>BFN     [Text] At a time when the CIS is trying to abolish customs  duties, Moldova and Belarus are introducing a free trade regime,  said Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich, at a ceremony  where he signed a trade and economic agreement for 1994 in  Chisinau between the two countries. The system of payments and  the unfixed exchange rate of both countries' national currencies  are the greatest obstacles on the way to implementing this  agreement, the Belarusian Government leader pointed out. The  unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems, in the  opinion of Vyacheslaw Kebich, will not hamper trade and economic  cooperation between Moldova and Belarus.</p>

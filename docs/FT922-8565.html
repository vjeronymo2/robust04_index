			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Russians to take over N-forces THE RUSSIAN government plans to take over at least part of the Commonwealth of Independent States strategic nuclear forces, the deputy head of the CIS general staff, Lieutenant-General Victor Barynkin, said yesterday. He did not specify what proportion, saying this had yet to be negotiated. Gen Barynkin said President Boris Yeltsin had approved the plan last week. This decision runs counter to a CIS agreement last December under which all former Soviet strategic nuclear forces were to remain under CIS joint command. Russia also wants to create its own missile early warning system. Gen Barynkin said the existing system could be 'full of holes' once Azerbaijan and Ukraine took over radar stations on their territory.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Scott's clean sheet As pulp manufacturers gather in London next week to negotiate their annual round of contracts with buyers, many are being asked about their environmental performance for the first time. Their answers may well be crucial. Scott, the world's largest tissue manufacturer, has decided to exclude suppliers that fail the group's environmental standards, even if they are cheaper than competitors. At stake is the 150,000 tonnes of paper Scott uses in the UK every year. In future, the 700,000 tonnes it consumes in Europe annually will be scrutinised. Martin Kybert, environmental affairs manager, explains that an assessment of the life-cycle of its products showed the greatest impact could be made in the manufacture of wood pulp. The company launched a two-year environmental assessment programme of its pulp suppliers. They were asked to provide details of their emissions, including carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Their forestry practices and replanting policies were also considered. The differences, says Kybert, were startling. In the worst case, one supplier produced 17 times more carbon dioxide than the best supplier. Scott dropped three of the worst suppliers, which were in North America and Scandinavia, while giving preferential treatment to the best. Those dropped represented 10 per cent of all its suppliers. 'Some of those excluded were really surprised. Nobody had ever asked them before for details of their carbon dioxide emissions,' said Kybert. One supplier is investing heavily in new plant and telephoning regularly to report progress. Kybert says Scott can gain competitive advantage through better environmental performance. Consumers are demanding products that are less damaging to the environment but that do not compromise on quality and value for money.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Explaura Holdings cuts loss to Pounds 1.1m Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.1m were announced by Explaura Holdings for the half year to June 30. Losses last time for the USM-quoted company, which quarries limestone aggregates in Newfoundland, Canada, were Pounds 1.7m. The loss reflected an extremely low level of activity, the company said, with sales restricted to existing stocks at its New York terminal. However, following the settlement in September of the strike which hit the concrete industry in New York, record daily sales were being achieved and the terminal was operating at maximum capacity. Turnover in the period halved to Pounds 585,000 (Pounds 1.1m). Losses per share fell to 0.72p (1.15p).</p>

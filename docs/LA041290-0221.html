			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ARMY PUTS SEOUL DISCO DISTRICT OFF LIMITS TO GIS  </P> <P> U.S. officials put a popular entertainment and disco district in Seoul off  limits to American personnel today in an attempt to stem anti-American violence  and protect U.S. soldiers.  </P> <P> A statement issued by the U.S. 8th Army for the 43,000 U.S. troops, thousands  of civilian employees and their dependents in South Korea said the Itaewon  entertainment district would be off limits indefinitely from midnight until 5  a.m., effective Friday.  </P> <P> Many American families live in the area.  </P> <P> It was the first time in recent years that U.S. military officials have placed  an entire South Korean district off limits to American soldiers and civilians.  Officials said it was being done to protect "the health and welfare" of U.S.  personnel.  </P> <P> "When lives are at stake, no measure is too extreme," said an unidentified  official quoted in the statement.  </P> <P> Itaewon is a shopping and entertainment area several city blocks long near 8th  Army headquarters. Foreign tourists, shoppers and U.S. military personnel shop  there by day, and at night its neon-lit bars and discos draw hundreds of young  Koreans as well.  </P> <P> The announcement was an apparent move to avoid clashes between South Korean  civilians and American soldiers who frequent late-night bars and entertainment  establishments.  </P> <P> On Sunday, a crowd of Koreans chased two U.S. military policeman and threw  bottles, bricks and sticks. Two vehicles, including a U.S. military patrol car,  were demolished, the windows of a police station were shattered and at least  half a dozen people were injured.  </P></p>

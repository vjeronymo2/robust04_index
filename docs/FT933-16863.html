			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ferfin woes prompt recapitalisation FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company saddled with total borrowings of over L31,000bn (Dollars 20.16bn), is expected to launch a big rights issue to recapitalise its shaky finances after a special shareholders' meeting planned for August 31. The assembly, announced at Ferfin's annual meeting yesterday, will formally write down the debt-laden group's capital after last year's consolidated losses of L1,667bn, Mr Carlo Sama, Ferfin's outgoing managing director, told shareholders that Ferfin's high debts and heavy interest charges had resulted in a L491.6bn loss for the parent company in the first five months of this year. The news, combined with fears of an impending rights issue, triggered a new record low in Ferfin's share price with a 10.3 per cent fall to L447.1 in Milan. Italian company law requires a write-down if a company's losses exceed two-thirds of its shareholders' funds. Approval for the write-down will almost certainly be followed by a capital increase. The rights issue is likely to formalise the position of Ferfin's five main creditor banks in effectively running the group. Earlier this month, Ferfin and members of the controlling Ferruzzi family called on the five leading creditor banks to prepare a rescue package, which should be ready shortly before the special shareholders' meeting. The banks, which could convert some of their debt into equity, yesterday began to take a bigger role at Ferfin with the confirmation of Mr Guido Rossi and Mr Enrico Bondi, two bank-appointed executives, as Ferfin's chairman and managing director respectively.</p>

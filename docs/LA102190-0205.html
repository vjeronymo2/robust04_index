			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN Q&amp;A: POTTED HEATHER PLANT CAN BE PLANTED OUTSIDE  </P> <P> QUESTION: For Valentine's Day I bought at the supermarket a flowering potted  plant called Scotch Heather. All the tiny pink bell-like flowers have fallen  off, but the foliage still looks good.  </P> <P> Should I toss this plant out or is it worth saving?  </P> <P> ANSWER: By all means, save it and plant it outside -- if you have the space.  This is Erica canaliculata, one of the best winter-flowering shrubs for  Southland gardens. It becomes a bushy six-foot specimen but can be kept lower  with pruning. As a cut flower, its branches will last for weeks -- in water or  out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Argument Settled on Bougainvillea Flowers  </P> <P> Q: My friend and I are having a little argument about his bougainvillea. I say  the flowers are tiny and white, and he says they are obviously big and red.  Who's right?  </P> <P> A: You are. The true flowers of bougainvillea are inconspicuous and white. The  showy part comes from three papery bracts, which are modified leaves. Other  plants with showy bracts that look like flowers are poinsettia and flowering  dogwood. Mary Ellen Guffey  </P></p>

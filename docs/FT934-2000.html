			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Food price falls help inflation to 26-year low: Steady increase in volume of retail sales shows consumers pushing economy towards recovery The Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation fell in November to its lowest level for 26 years, led by lower prices of food, second-hand cars and alcoholic drinks. At the same time the volume of retail sales continued its steady rise, confirming the view that consumers are slowly helping the economy to recover. The retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments, rose in the year to November by 2.5 per cent, after 2.8 per cent in the year to October. The headline inflation rate - the year-on-year rise in the RPI - was 1.4 per cent last month, the same as in October. The figures from the Central Statistical Office underline the weakness of retail price pressures. This is caused by shops cutting prices in a bid to build volumes and also by only muted rises in retailers' wage costs and the prices of products bought from wholesalers. Between October and November the RPI - which reflects the prices of a basket of 600 goods and services bought by households - fell 0.1 per cent from 141.8 to 141.6. In the six months to November the index rose by just 0.3 per cent. A big factor behind last month's weak inflation was a 0.7 per cent fall between October and November in prices of non-seasonal foods, the biggest in any month since June 1963. This was due largely to widespread price-cutting in supermarkets, particularly on soft drinks, bread, milk, tinned fish and a range of processed foods. In the year to November non-seasonal foods rose in price by a weak 1.9 per cent. In the same period all foods, including fruit and vegetables, affected by seasonal changes rose 1.4 per cent in price. Foods which have seen big reductions on the year include fresh fish, down 10 per cent, and pork, down 4 per cent. The average used car cost 2.9 per cent less last month than in October, which helped to push motoring costs including petrol down 1.4 per cent on the month, the biggest one-month fall for three years. In the year to last month motoring costs rose 3.5 per cent. Alcoholic drinks fell 0.5 per cent in price on the month, partly because many off-licences have cut prices in the hope of boosting pre-Christmas sales. In the year to November prices of these items increased 3.6 per cent, the lowest figure since 1988. Household goods including furniture, carpets and electrical equipment rose 0.5 per cent in price on the month, for a weak 0.9 per cent increase in the year to November. This was the smallest year-on-year rise since the CSO started records in 1974 and illustrates how the lacklustre housing market and pressure on disposable incomes is holding back demand. Other figures from the CSO showed that last month retail sales climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent from October, after a revised 0.3 per cent increase the previous month. Between September and November retail volumes rose 0.9 per cent compared with the June to August period, after a 1.2 per cent increase in the previous three months. In the year to the last three-month period volumes were up a healthy 3.6 per cent. The British Retail Consortium, a trade body, provided an element of festive cheer by saying sales of Christmas decorations and crackers in recent weeks had been 'well above' last year's levels. It said shops selling footwear, medicines and do-it-yourself goods had performed particularly strongly last month, while sales of electrical goods and carpets had been disappointing. Yesterday's inflation-adjusted figures underline how shop sales - which account for about a quarter of gross domestic product - form one of the strongest elements behind the UK's recent economic growth. According to the CSO, mixed retail businesses selling food and non-edible items had a fairly strong autumn, with sales volumes up 1.4 per cent on a three-month basis. In the year to the last three-month period these stores pushed up sales by 5 per cent. Food retailers saw sales rise 0.7 per cent between September and November compared with the previous three months. Over the year sales increased by 2.6 per cent. Retailers specialising in household goods increased sales by 2.4 per cent on a three-month basis and 9.5 per cent compared with a year ago. Clothing and shoe shops did less well, with sales rising a muted 2.1 per cent on a yearly basis and showing a 0.1 per cent decline over the past three months compared with the June to August period. The CSO said that, based on non-seasonally adjusted data, the average weekly value of retail sales last month was Pounds 3.11bn, up 6 per cent on November last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------            UK INFLATION RATE:  +1.4 PER CENT  ---------------------------------------------------------- Food (seasonal( (21)                        -0.6 percent Food (non-seasonal( (123)                   +1.9 percent Catering (45)                               +5.0 percent Alcoholic drink (78)                        +3.6 percent Tobacco (35)                                +8.6 percent Housing (164)                               -5.4 percent Fuel &amp; light (46)                           -1.6 percent Household goods (79)                        +0.9 percent Household sevices (47)                      +3.5 percent Clothing &amp; footwear (58)                    +1.4 percent Personal goods, serv.

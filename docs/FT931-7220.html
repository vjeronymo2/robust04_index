			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Costain appeals against US injunction - Court decision poses questions about future of December's three-year loan facility COSTAIN, like an ageing heavyweight who has seen better times, is beset by blows from all sides. Misfortune has piled upon misadventure as management has struggled to keep the international construction and mining business on its feet. The British-based company, faced with its latest setback yesterday, appealed against the granting of a permanent injunction by a United States court preventing it from selling its Australian coalmining and commercial property interests for Dollars 245m (Pounds 172.5m) to Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. Peabody, the US-based coal subsidiary of Britain's Hanson group, had asked Stephen Limbaugh, the district judge, to block the deal on grounds that Costain had previously agreed to sell it the Australian coal mining business for Dollars 200m. The decision in St Louis, Missouri, raises questions about a three-year loan facility negotiated with Costain's bankers in December; the facility was based upon the company receiving the proceeds from a sale to Altus. It remained unclear yesterday whether all or part of this arrangement would need to be renegotiated or what attitude lenders would take should Costain have breached the terms of the refinancing agreement. In the worst scenario, the banks could seek to put the British company into administrative receivership. That might allow the new operators to relaunch negotiations to sell Costain's Australian and US coal mining businesses unencumbered by legal actions. Among the reasons why banks may not adopt this course is that, having supported the company so far, they might as well allow the appeal to proceed. The construction company also retains the option to accept the lower Peabody offer for the Australian coal operations. With the pound's devaluation, that looks more attractive in sterling terms than when first negotiated last autumn. However, the sterling cost of Costain's borrowings, much of which are in the US, will have also risen. To allow such a well-known public company to fail would provoke a large political and public relations fall-out for the banks, which are already facing strong criticism. If administrators could successfully sell the coal businesses, it would leave the banks with the problem of disposing of Costain's construction and UK housebuilding operations, both of which would have a 'distressed sale' sign hanging over them. Although the banks may decide to remain with Costain, they cannot be pleased about how such a vital disposal has become ensnared in the courts. The group's debt, which was Pounds 344m when the rival deals with Peabody and Altus were concluded last autumn, easily exceeds its book value, which was Pounds 276m at the start of last year. Borrowings include Pounds 52m of loans due on the Spitalfield commercial property joint venture in London. Judge Limbaugh said that Costain, although still talking to Altus, had decided to accept Peabody's offer on October 19 because 'the banks were becoming increasingly concerned about Costain's position and at the end of that week Costain needed to have bank approval to make a payment to refinance the Spitalfield project'. He also revealed that Bouygues, the large French construction group, had been discussing the possibility of making a bid for the whole of Costain shortly before Altus emerged on the scene. The judgment is the latest in a series of setbacks for the group, which has seen its share price fall by almost 90 per cent in just over two-and-a-half years to 27p yesterday. Costain's stock market value of only Pounds 62m is less than a third of that of lesser-known domestic housebuilders such as Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Wilson Bowden and Wilson Connolly. A sale of the Australian coal operations to Peabody would still leave gearing of more than 70 per cent. Although UK housebuilding is showing signs of recovery, Costain has a poor track record in this market. US coal operations have been lacklustre. Only international contracting has displayed any promise. Margins on contracting however, remain low by comparison with other businesses. Costain, provided banks keep their nerve, has a lot of rebuilding still to do.</p>

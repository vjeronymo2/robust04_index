			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Battle for the soul of ITV - Turmoil in commercial television Careful viewers of ITV last Monday night would have noticed a strange sight. All the programmes made by Granada Television appeared to have been produced by the same person. As the credits rolled, the executive producer of Coronation Street, the top-rated soap opera that has been running for more than 30 years, was named as David Plowright. He was also named as editor-in-chief of World in Action, the award-winning current affairs programme as well as a raft of regional programmes. The rash of unusual credits marked a small insurrection by programme-makers. It was a signal of their extreme displeasure that the Granada Group, the TV company's parent company, had just announced the forced departure of Mr Plowright, executive chairman of Granada TV, one of the most respected exponents of a public service concept of UK commercial television that had produced triumphs such as Brideshead Revisited. Mr Plowright's departure is a powerful symbol of the current turmoil within the independent television system as it struggles with the aftermath of competitive tenders for new franchises, recession, and government policies for a more open network structure. The dismissal, less than four months after Mr Plowright successfully led the team that won Granada a new 10-year franchise with a remarkably low bid of Pounds 9m a year, has become the focus of opposing views about the future of UK commercial television. To programme-makers it is a row about quality broadcasting being forced to surrender to the desire for profit. The opposing view, endorsed within Granada's management, is a need to limit the power of barons within the independent television system and to emphasise the need for greater financial accountability. The situation is less black and white than either view would suggest. Mr Plowright's departure is more likely to have reflected a mixture of personality clashes, financial strains within the Granada Group and clashes about how much programmes should cost. For viewers, the picture for ITV appears to be entirely rosy with the BBC being trounced in the ratings. Below the surface, however, recession has clearly hit an industry that was supposed to be almost recession proof. ITV revenues grew from Pounds 1.326bn in 1987 to Pounds 1.614bn in 1989, were static in 1990 and fell last year to Pounds 1.587bn. This year, most analysts forecast a 2-3 per cent, inflation-adjusted increase in revenues. In addition the ITV system is still trying to come to terms with the effects of the 1990 Broadcasting Act with its competitive tenders for new franchises, insistence on a new network structure and a minimum quota of 25 per cent for independent producers. 'This legislation has fouled every bit of ground. All the things we said would fall out as a result are starting to happen,' said Mr David Shaw, director of the ITV Association, the industry trade body. The most pressing task is the problem of creating a network structure acceptable to the ITV companies and to independent producers, the Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body for UK commercial television, and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). At the moment the commissioning of new programmes for 1993, when the new franchises begin, has ceased. ITV had hoped to commission the first nine months of next year under the old network rules. 'The machine of ITV production is in pieces on the ground,' says Mr Charles Denton, chairman of Pact, the independent producers organisation, many of whose members are starting to suffer because of the lack of programme commissioning. Once that problem is resolved the OFT has to agree permanent arrangements for the network. A network director, who will be in charge of commissioning programmes, still has to be appointed. The signs are that the OFT will be offered a scheme in which independent producers will have the right to take their ideas to the network director but will be paired with sponsoring ITV companies when the programmes are actually being made. It is not clear whether the OFT will accept this relationship. Mr Denton insists he will be pushing for a fair, open market in programme production. Such a market in turn will create huge uncertainties and pressures for the traditional ITV companies with their studios and standing armies (although these have been reduced over recent years). If the in-house teams lose out to independents, further big job losses would be inevitable. The changes add up to a big restructuring of the system of programme-making within ITV. The process will not be helped by the wide disparity of successful franchise bids. There are fears that costly programme ideas will be torpedoed because high bidders such as Yorkshire Television, which paid Pounds 37.7m for its franchise (compared with Central which bid Pounds 2,000), will not be able to pay their share. For Granada TV the new financial realities are about to become only too clear. Sixty staff are expected to be made redundant in the near future. As for Mr Plowright he made it clear that despite 'having had the pleasure of reading my own obituary, I do not yet feel dead'. He added that he would continue to take part in the debate about the future of British broadcasting 'in the aftermath of a flawed piece of broadcasting legislation'. It could increasingly be a voice crying in the wilderness.</p>

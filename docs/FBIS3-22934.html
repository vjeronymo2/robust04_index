			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An unofficial source has stated that the number of  Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) police personnel might be  reduced by 30 percent following a decision by high-ranking  Interior Ministry officials. It is believed that PNP [Peruvian  National Police] General Luis Dominguez Soliz, the DINCOTE  Commander, has been notified.    The promoters of this decision believe a cut in personnel  will enhance the efficiency of police action. This opinion,  however, is not shared by most DINCOTE officers who say that  many times DINCOTE personnel cannot cope with the volume of work  in their fight against terrorism.    Reliable sources state that this decision reflects a  government decision to cut the DINCOTE budget and eliminate the  300-soles bonus given to its personnel.    It was leaked that the cut in DINCOTE's specialized  personnel  will be made in three stages. The first stage entails the  dismissal of 200 chiefs, officers, and subalterns, in February.    The second and third stages foresee the lay-off of another  100 detectives, thus concluding the personnel reduction.    It has not been disclosed what will become of those who will  be laid off.    Asked to comment on this, some officers noted that the  decision caused disappointment among DINCOTE personnel and a  split into two groups -- those who favor and those who oppose  the measure.    Officers pointed out that the latter group represent the  majority who believe a reduction in personnel will virtually  curtail the unit that has produced the most resounding successes  of the PNP.    Our source stated that the current budget was drafted when  PNP Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal Herrera was installed  as the DINCOTE commander.    It was precisely at that time that DINCOTE personnel made  the  so-called "most spectacular capture of the century," when they  arrested [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso without  firing a single shot on 12 September 1992.    Unless the Interior Minister reverses its decision, morale  will be further undermined -- especially that of subalterns  whose wages are very low.    One DINCOTE officer remarked that last month Interior  Ministry spokesmen announced a pay increase for subaltern  personnel, but this has not yet happened.</p>

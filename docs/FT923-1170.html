			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: BAe in need of defence Those who hoped that British Aerospace's interim results would dispel uncertainty about the company must be sorely disappointed. For all the management's insistence that it has grasped the nettle, thorny issues remain; the sharpest being actually signing the Taiwanese jet deal, progress on the Saudi Al Yamamah contract, the survival of the European Fighter Aircraft and the future cost of producing its turboprop airliners. Given all that, valuing the shares is extremely difficult. Fund managers must be secretly relieved that BAe is now small enough to ignore in their portfolio weightings. In the absence of an earnings stream, yield valuations are the conventional prop. But BAe's dividend outlook is still unclear. The company surely intends the proposed 3p interim dividend as a stable base for dividend growth, and if a similar final payment is made, yesterday's close of 113p would put the shares on a yield around 7 per cent. However, even that payment must depend on the success in the Taiwan deal and the generation of retained profits elsewhere. Asset valuations are also uncertain. If the company was broken up in current economic conditions even BAe's prime assets like Rover and some of Arlington's sites would be very difficult to move at anything other than fire sale prices. With a weak market worldwide the longer term reliability of defence profits may also be in doubt. And the cancellation of the EFA would deprive the company not only of much needed work for its Wharton plant later in the decade, but also of a platform for several of its missile systems. Denied solid valuation criteria, shareholders must now form a view on the management. Has the team provided for the thick end of the problems, as it claims, and can it unlock the value of BAe's assets without treading on more land mines; or will BAe remain accident prone? Mr John Cahill's record at BTR suggests investors should have confidence. But defence is a singular business and there are other managers further down the line used to the bad old ways. A turnaround will depend on his ability to convert or replace them.</p>

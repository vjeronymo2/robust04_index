			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WILD ABOUT HARRY  </P> <P> He's tall, dark and handsome, plays a mean piano and sings the standards --  very well, according to critics. Jazzman Harry Connick Jr. -- who's only 21 --  is hot!  </P> <P>  Consider: It was SRO during his recent four-week gig at the venerable Oak Room  of NYC's Algonquin Hotel. He recently wowed David Letterman's audience with a  bluesy New Orleans tune which segued into "Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll." The  following day, reports a Connick rep, Letterman himself put in a call, to see  if Connick could be a regular. Next Sunday, Connick hits NBC's late-night music  fest, "Sunday Night."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there's a Connick piece in the current Newsweek and a "People" blurb  in the latest Time. More coverage is due in GQ, Rolling Stone, Seventeen and  Sassy. For Esquire, he'll be featured in a photo spread on influential New  Yorkers in their bedrooms -- and Spin wants to include him in its upcoming  bathing suit issue!  </P> <P> So how's the piano man -- who's got two Columbia albums out -- responding to  all this attention?  </P> <P> "Ahhmm amazed -- and totally flattered," drawled Connick, adding modestly, "I  guess my age, and the type of music I play, has a lot to do with all this."  </P> <P> From New Orleans, where his dad is district attorney and his late mother was a  judge, Connick's been playing piano publicly since age 6, professionally since  he was 13.  </P> <P> "New Orleans is kind of 'in' right now, ya know," mused Connick, who's single.  "I don't have an ounce of Cajun blood in me, but I think people assume I eat  possum for breakfast. Maybe that's why some folks are interested in me."  </P> <P> Hitting the road, Connick's got gigs set in Japan and Europe. He'll do an L.A.  stand at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill April 11-16. Pat H.

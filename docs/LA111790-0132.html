			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES TALK TO VALENZUELA  </P> <P> The Padres have had preliminary talks with free agent left-hander Fernando  Valenzuela, Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, said Friday night. But  McIlvaine refused to divulge whether the Padres are willing to make the  starting pitcher a contract offer.  </P> <P> "We've had some contact with him," McIlvaine said, "but I can't tell you how  interested we are. I haven't even told his agent (Tony DeMarco). We'll just  have to wait and see."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, a six-time All-Star, spent the past nine years with the Dodgers  before filing for free agency. The Dodgers, who paid Valenzuela $2 million this  past season, said they are not interested in re-signing him.  </P> <P> Valenzuela, 30, was 13-13 with a 4.59 earned-run average this past season.  Although he pitched a no-hitter June 29 against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was  1-3 with an 8.40 ERA in his last six starts.  </P> <P> The Padres, who have an opening for the fifth spot in their rotation, also have  been contacted by left-hander Teddy Higuera (11-10, 3.76 ERA), who filed for  free agency from the Milwaukee Brewers. McIlvaine declined to reveal the  Padres' interest, if any.  </P> <P> In other news, the Padres completed their organizational meeting by obtaining  third baseman Tom Redington of the Atlanta Braves, who were attempting to  outright him on waivers.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (20): Prising open the public sector / A look at new rules designed to stop governments, local authorities and public utilities from shutting out foreign suppliers - Procurement A GERMAN company supplies chairs to Danish kindergartens. A French company provides road sweeping services to English local authorities. A British manufacturer bids to supply mail sacks to the German Post Office. Public sector contracts, traditionally closed to foreign suppliers, are slowly being opened up. A market worth Pounds 500m a year and equivalent to about 15 per cent of the European Community's gross domestic product is being weaned off national preferences. There is still a long way to go. Public officials spending taxpayers' money have been slow to perceive the benefits of buying in a pan-European market. But a raft of new EC legislation is helping shift entrenched attitudes. Six directives have been promulgated over the past five years to open up public procurement markets. The aim is to ensure that the Single Market takes effect in the public sector by preventing governments, local authorities and water, transport and power companies from discriminating against foreign suppliers. The cornerstone of the new regime is a requirement that public authorities publish the details of their larger contracts in the EC's Official Journal (the S series).* The same information is also available in electronic form through Tenders Electronic Daily, an EC database. In 1992 more than 9,200 public sector contracts were awarded, according to Euro-Bid Watch, a consultancy which analyses the EC's contracts data. Under EC rules, tender information is to be published in three stages. Advance warning of forthcoming tenders in what are known as periodic indicative notices or PINs is followed by details of individual contracts and finally by an announcement, within 48 days of the event, that a contract has been awarded. The new directives call for public authorities to provide sufficient information for all potential bidders to take part. Purchasers should not specify the use of a particular trade-marked product to exclude other bidders and where a European standard exists it must be used. To avoid placing an unfair burden on purchasers the EC has set minimum thresholds for the contracts which must be reported and has also drawn up rules preventing unscrupulous purchasers from artificially splitting contracts to remain below the thresholds. A further complication is the existence of three possible procedures for seeking bids: The 'open procedure', where all interested contractors or suppliers may bid; The 'restricted procedure', where only invited suppliers may tender and The 'negotiated procedure', where the public authority negotiates the terms of the contract with one or more suppliers. Once the purchaser has assessed all the bids it must award the contract to either the lowest bidder or 'the most economically advantageous' tender. This wording allows purchasers to take into account more subjective criteria but the factors taken into account must be published. Nevertheless, purchasers can still bend the rules. Many unsuccessful bidders will be unwilling to challenge a purchaser's decision for fear of losing all future business and even when public authorities stick to the rules, the multiplicity of purchasing organisations may put off all but the most determined. Also, some public authorities employ cumbersome tendering procedures which can make preparing bids expensive and time-consuming, especially for smaller companies. By the time details of a tender appear in the Official Journal it is often too late, experienced suppliers warn. Companies must build up good contacts with potential customers so that they have early warning of likely contracts. Companies new to this field should build up experience with public sector organisations in their own country before venturing abroad, experts suggest. And when companies do consider other EC markets they should start by focusing on just one or two. *Available from government publishing organisations such as HMSO in the UK or can be consulted at Euro Info Centres and chambers of commerce.

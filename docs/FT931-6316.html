			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Stakis justifies Pounds 90,000 payment STAKIS, the hotels and casinos group where the corporate rescue specialist Sir Lewis Robertson is chairman, paid Pounds 90,000 to Mr David Michels, its chief executive, when he joined the company in December 1991. This emerged yesterday from Stakis's report for the year to September 30 1992. Mr Michels was paid a total of Pounds 258,000 in the 1992 financial year. At the time he joined the company it was about to report a loss of Pounds 47.4m. Stakis said it had been necessary to offer Mr Michels special inducements to leave a secure and well paid job at Hilton UK, where he was deputy chairman and managing director. Directors now felt that, with Stakis back in profit, Mr Michels' extra remuneration had been well justified.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HITS 7-YEAR LOW;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: TREND HAILED BUT ANALYSTS WARN THAT OIL IMPORTS COULD BECOME A GROWING  FUTURE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> Record exports and shrinking oil imports helped push the nation's merchandise  trade deficit to a seven-year low in June, the government reported today. But  analysts saw oil as a problem in coming months because of the Mideast crisis.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the deficit dropped to $5.07 billion -- a 34.7%  decline from $7.77 billion in May and the lowest since a $3.96-billion  imbalance was posted in June, 1983.  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who had joined many analysts earlier in  predicting the deficit would drop significantly this year, was quick to note  the record $34.29 billion in exports.  </P> <P> "While the month-to-month figures can be erratic, the strong, positive trend  indicates increasing U.S. export competitiveness in the world marketplace," he  said.  </P> <P> The 4.6% increase in exports included not only $500 million in aircraft  shipments but gains in other business capital equipment as well.  </P> <P> Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, called the exports "good  news" because that sector "was the only part of the economy with any strength"  in June.  </P> <P> Gilbert Benz, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said the figure  will boost the second-quarter gross national product, which earlier had been  estimated to have grown a meager 1.2%.  </P> <P> "It's the one component that might help us skate around a recession in the  second half of the year," Benz said.  </P> <P> Imports declined 2.9% to $39.37 billion, helped by a $631-million drop in oil  costs.  </P> <P> Oil imports in June fell 14.6% to $3.69 billion. Americans imported 8.40  million barrels a day, down from 8.95 billion in May.  </P> <P> The deficit is the difference between imports and exports and, for the first  six months, was running at an annual rate of $91.62 billion. If it ended the  year at that pace, it would be the first deficit since 1983 under $100 billion.  </P> <P> Analysts were quick, however, to toss in the Middle East caveat.  </P> <P> "The Persian Gulf crisis is already generating oil price increases which likely  will contribute to a worsening trade deficit in the future," said John Howard,  international finance director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): US visa waiver The US visa waiver programme, which was due to end this month, has now been extended for another two years, writes Michael Skapinker. The programme allows the nationals of most European Union countries to travel to the US without a visa, provided they stay for less than 90 days. Journalists and government officials continue to need a visa. The legislation to extend the programme had been held up in Congress but has now been passed.</p>

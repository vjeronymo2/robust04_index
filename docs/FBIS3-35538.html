			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beirut, Feb 25 (AFP)--A clandestine Muslim  fundamentalist group on Friday [25 February] threatened to  assassinate PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, accusing him of  responsibility for the Hebron massacre in which 58 Palestinians  were shot dead.    "The traitor 'Arafat will not be the only one to pay the  price over this massacre, Jews in their synagogues will also  pay," the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of Palestine  said in a statement received here by AFP.    The group, which is opposed to the PLO-Israeli autonomy  accord signed last September, emerged several months ago. It  said in an Arabic-written statement it would assume full  responsibility for eliminating 'Arafat, adding that it had  already judged him.    The Hebron massacre was the result of the "odious policies  of  the United States, and its allies, namely (Egyptian President)  Husni Mubarak," the group said.    One or more settlers shot dead 58 Palestinians and wounded  dozens more when they opened fire inside a mosque at the Tomb of  the Patriarchs, which was packed for prayers during the Muslim  fasting month of Ramadan.</p>

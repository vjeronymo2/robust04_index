			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (3): A continental patchwork - Europe's shifting policies THE market for power generation equipment in Europe has been transformed in the past five years. The 1987 decision to privatise the UK electricity supply industry seems to have been one of the triggers for this change. Prior to this, the market was technologically and commercially stagnant, comprising a trickle of orders for coal and nuclear plant generally placed with long-standing suppliers. Now it appears highly dynamic, as five big industrial groupings scramble for orders for combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). The change is due to the availability of natural gas for power generation and the encouragement of competitive forces in the power generation sector. These were reinforced by a surge in electricity demand that accompanied the economic boom of the late 1980s, the prospect of the EC's Single Market, environmental concerns and the prospect of Eastern Europe becoming an important new market. These changes hastened a long overdue shake up of the world power plant supply industry, reducing the world market to just five major players, the three European-based suppliers, ABB, Siemens and GEC-Alsthom and two US-Japanese groupings, GE-Hitachi-Toshiba and Westinghouse-Mitsubishi. Previously, the last two had played little role in Europe, but now perceive a chance to gain a toe-hold. The changes have been most dramatic in the UK. Released from their obligations to nuclear power, to British coal and equipment suppliers, the generating companies have gone on a remarkable shopping spree. In the last three years, more plant has been bought than in the previous 15 years, despite little signs of conventional need for it. Firm commitments have been made for about 20 GW of CCGT plant (equivalent to about a third of total UK capacity) to enter service in the next five years. Most has already been ordered and each of the five world majors has won a share. The wave of ordering had nothing to do with the usual process of analysing demand trends and ordering just enough of the most economical plant to fill any gap. The sole criterion was whether the proposed plant had a good chance of making money for its owner. With equipment suppliers offering the plant on turnkey terms with strong performance guarantees, gas suppliers selling gas at attractive and stable prices and the distribution companies eager to sign up to take the output of the plant, the risks to the new generation companies were minimal. This, and the fact that they no longer had the pre-privatisation responsibility to operate the transmission grid, meant that few of the traditional utility skills of design and engineering were required. What was needed was good accountants and lawyers. Interests other than the plant suppliers will have found the results less attractive. Not much of the British coal industry is likely to survive this stampede to gas, while the scope for any nuclear revival after the 1994 Government nuclear review may well have been pre-empted. Much of the new gas-fired capacity is likely to generate at costs higher than the existing coal-fired plant that it will replace, but the contracts the CCGTs have with distributors mean that it will be the coal plant that has to go. Ultimately, it will be the electricity consumers who will foot the bill for this over-indulgence. The new Office of Electricity Regulation is under pressure to find a way of halting the flow of orders and few now expect much activity in the next five to 10 years. Whilst other countries in Europe seem to be following the UK's lead in reforming electricity supply, all is not what it seems. In Southern Europe - Greece, Portugal and Italy - changes are occurring which will allow independent power producers to get into the market. However, the rationale is much more a matter of pragmatism than dogma. Here, there is still plenty of potential for demand growth, as well as a current shortage of plant. However, the mainly state owned utilities have long been hamstrung by a chronic shortage of capital and, in some cases, public opposition to new power station developments. Allowing international companies to compete to build the required plants and encouraging industrial producers to build extra capacity are probably the only options open to them. Nevertheless, all the Southern European countries are contracted to receive large new volumes of gas, not always with a ready final market and the power plant suppliers can look forward to a reasonable market for CCGTs to burn this gas. The countries of Northern Europe have shown much more ideological commitment to the idea of reform: the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden are at various stages in restructuring their electricity industries. However, these are relatively small, mature systems with little scope for demand growth, often based on cheap hydro-power and reliable nuclear plant. The resulting volume of orders for new plant is unlikely to cause too much excitement to the suppliers. The countries of Eastern Europe, prompted by lending institutions such as the World Bank, are restructuring electricity supply to embody the free market principles enshrined in the new UK system. However, even allowing for the need to replace discredited nuclear power plants and polluting coal-fired plants, these markets may prove a disappointment. Economic recession and the introduction of more energy efficient processes are cutting deeply into electricity demand making the shut-down of the worst plant less painful. Investment capital is scarce and the first priority may be remedial measures to salvage as much as possible of the existing plant rather than building new stations. The two largest national systems in Europe, those of France and Germany, are notable absentees from the ranks of the reformers. The European Commission may extract some marginal concessions under its Single Market provisions. However, it seems unlikely that the formidable utilities at the heart of these systems and their associated lobbies, nuclear in France and coal in Germany, will readily give up privileges such as the ability to choose where, when and what type of power plant is built. The boom in plant ordering that has been seen in the UK is therefore unlikely to be repeated in the rest of Europe, not least because of the effects of the economic recession on electricity demand. Nevertheless, even France and Germany will not be able to resist some features of the new market indefinitely. Placing orders for plant with favoured national suppliers and maintaining a monopoly hold on the generation market are no longer sustainable policies. However, whether governments in Europe will be happy to surrender their leverage over the electricity supply to the market as completely as in the UKis more doubtful.

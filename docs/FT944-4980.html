			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Observer: Seconds out When 46-year-old boxer George Foreman last month regained the world heavyweight championship, big bucks were sure to follow. Now he's being offered an estimated Dollars 2m per advertising endorsement, or two thirds of the total income he earned for ads last year. Advertisers are hoping Foreman - a preacher as well as prize-fighter - will remain a suitable member of the shrivelled ranks of squeaky-clean sporting figures useful for such endorsements; possession of no unsightly stains is now a sine qua non in the US endorsement market, whose fingers have been badly burned by the likes of Michael Jackson. So you can now buy a Foreman-autographed glove in a display case for Dollars 399.95, or a rather cheaper signed photo of Foreman seconds after his November 5 victory over Michael Moorer. How long before he is endorsing slimming products?</p>

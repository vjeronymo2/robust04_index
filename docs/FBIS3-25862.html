"We will try to win the support of US companies through non-  governmental channels," said Zheng Hongye, Chairman of the China  Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).    Last year more than 300 big American corporations demanded  that the US Government extend China's MFN status without  political conditions.    The US Government will decide whether to extend China's  status for another year in June.    "To keep the trade status will not be an easy task," Zheng  admitted.    "Although there will be twists and turns on this issue, we  are confident that China will retain the status."    No country can ignore China's huge potential market, he  said.  China's total imports reached $103,95 billion last year.    Zheng said that the US Government should solve the issue of  China's status once and for all because it affects not only  Sino- American economic ties but also political relations.    This year CCPIT will intensify its non-governmental economic  and trade exchanges and co-operative work with Western countries.    Meanwhile, CCPIT will actively try to set up economic ties  with countries that have no diplomatic relations with China,  Zheng said, A business delegation is now visiting Latin American  countries, including Paraguay and Honduras, to improve mutual  understanding.    Promoting economic co-operation between the mainland and  Taiwan is one of CCPIT's priorities this year, Zheng said.    Last year CCPIT hosted 15 Taiwan delegations comprising more  than 300 businessmen.    Although people from many circles on the mainland have  visited Taiwan businessmen are still not allowed to enter the  island. Zheng said CCPIT will try to arrange the first visit by  a mainland business delegation to Taiwan sometime this year.    CCPIT also plans to hold a mainland commodities exhibition  in  Taiwan and invite Taiwanese companies to attend trade fairs on  the mainland.</p>

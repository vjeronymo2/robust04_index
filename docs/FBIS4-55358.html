			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 13 (ATA) -- Representatives from the  strike commission, the association of the families whose land  and property have been inundated by the Fierza Lake, and the  Presidency of the Kukes and Has Districts met yesterday  afternoon [12 May] with Premier Meksi, government  representatives and deputies. The participants in the meeting  said that the strike has only an economic character. They said  that the difficulties created in the Kukes district and  northeastern areas are greater than those in other districts.    The conclusions drawn in the five hour meeting were included  in a joint communique of the premier and the strikers.    The formula of solving the problem of those stricken by the  construction of the Fierza hydro-power station is the organised  removal to other districts of the families under the most  difficult living conditions, providing them with house and land.  The government members said this solution has long since begun  to be applied but it is delayed because of the verification of  the related lists. The families left without land in the  inundated areas are made evident first and free areas in other  districts are being found out.    Priority will be given to the families under very difficult  economic conditions, without land, job and other living means.    The participants in the meeting agreed that the problem be  solved in cooperation with all the parties. They decided that  measures be adopted to provide social assistance and improve its  structure as well as to compensate for the land, always  favouring those lacking the living means.    In the mean time, the land and homes of the inhabitants to  be  displaced will be used for solving problems of those that will  continue to live in those areas. The government's spokesman  reported that the government will help the removed inhabitants  with long term credits to build houses considering them as  shelterless. Funds of international organisations also are  envisaged to be used in this respect. Premier Meksi promised to  go and meet with the Kukes inhabitants soon.</p>

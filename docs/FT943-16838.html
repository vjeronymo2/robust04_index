			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Hong Kong reforms upset business community An extraordinary week for Hong Kong has left the colony's traditional power brokers, the business community, feeling isolated and a little angry. Many were opposed to any change in the political structure which did not have China's blessing. They view the reforms voted for in the early hours of Thursday morning as opening the way for Hong Kong to be dominated by populist politicians over whom they have little control. At an extended session of the Legislative Council (LegCo), lawmakers passed Governor Chris Patten's so-called democracy legislation. The law, which applies to elections due next year, broadened the franchise for 29 of LegCo's 60 seats. The remaining 31 seats will retain tight qualifications for voting, such as membership of a professional association or a company directorship. Mr Patten said on Thursday he would like to try to build a bridge between business and the democratically elected politicians in Hong Kong. 'We have got to try harder to get business to understand it would not be in Hong Kong's interest to sell out the Joint Declaration as a way of securing a quiet life,' he said. But the governor faces an uphill battle in convincing business folk that their interest best lies with local democrats rather than Beijing bureaucrats. For Mr David Chu, a property developer and China adviser, the governor's reforms represent 'a rapid change from an elite-run society to the other extreme where political power has been put in the hands of the grass roots'. Mr Chu's views are typical of Hong Kong's business community which, under British colonial rule, has been used to making agreements with government without the irritation of public consultation. The attraction to many local businessmen of close relations with Beijing is that they think they can recreate this relationship with the future sovereign. Mr Chu said he was concerned about the new 'functional' constituencies which would be created as a result of the governor's bill. Mr Patten has been able to achieve electorates with an average size of 255,000 by splitting the workforce into nine broad groups along industry lines. 'I am quite concerned,' he says. 'And I can see it in my own firm. The floor sweeper, everybody, will be voting in my construction constituency. They will out-vote me, but they will not represent me. Indeed, my interests are likely to be misrepresented.' Mr William Fung, managing director of Li &amp; Fung, a trading company, said Mr Patten's package was ridiculous when he announced it in October 1992 and LegCo's passage of it has not made it any less so. He said the 1995 elections would return members of LegCo who represented 'narrow and parochial' interests. 'We are not talking about democracy in the western sense, where the majority party becomes the government,' he said. 'LegCo should be a watchdog, a balance to a strong executive and as such it needs to be broadly representative.' Mr Simon Murray, group chief executive of Deutsche Bank Asia Pacific, also agrees that LegCo should be broadly based, but he thinks Mr Patten has got it right. 'Personally, I'm delighted with the LegCo vote,' he said. 'This is good for Hong Kong. If we don't have broadly based elections then we would have got a LegCo elected by small groups and beholden to them. All the deals would go to their backers.' Both Mr Fung and Mr Murray think there is a chance that China, when it resumes sovereignty in 1997, will not dismantle completely the reforms passed this week. 'Whether they change everything depends on how it functions,' says Mr Fung. 'But they will change some things.' The British government yesterday rejected recommendations by an all-party parliamentary committee in London for an independent human-rights commission in Hong Kong, writes Our Foreign Staff. The rejection was part of a reply to a report on Hong Kong by the foreign affairs committee, which prompted an angry reaction in Beijing because of its outspoken comments on Tibet and Taiwan. The British decision confirmed the view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, that existing legal arrangements, including a forthcoming Equal Opportunities Bill, are adequate to protect human rights. The UK government also told the committee that it was deeply concerned about human rights abuses through China, including Tibet, but it did not think it would help the Tibetans for London to try opening discussions on the region's future. 'Any lasting solution can be found only through dialogue between the Chinese government and the Tibetans without preconditions,' the report said.</p>

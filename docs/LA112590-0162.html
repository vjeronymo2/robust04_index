			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. IS READY TO OFFER U.N. RESOLUTION ON FORCE THIS WEEK, BAKER SAYS;  </P> <P> IRAQ: SECRETARY CONFERS WITH COLOMBIAN AND MALAYSIAN OFFICIALS, SEEKING SUPPORT  IN SECURITY COUNCIL.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced Saturday night that the United  States will go to the United Nations this week for a new use-of-force  resolution against Iraq which will specify a deadline by which Iraq must  withdraw from Kuwait or face the military might of the U.S.-led forces in the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Consideration of the resolution is expected to begin Monday or Tuesday with a  formal vote by the 15-nation council coming Thursday or Friday, Baker said in  an airborne interview with the Los Angeles Times and Reuters news agency at the  end of his remarkable, five-continents-in-five-days diplomatic odyssey to  consult on the issue.  </P> <P> Baker refused to speculate on the outcome of the vote in the council, where  nine yes votes and no vetoes are required for passage. U.S. officials have said  that they would not propose a resolution "unless it had a reasonable chance of  success."  </P> <P> But a senior U.S. official traveling with Baker said "the secretary is under no  illusions on this. We are in for a very tough fight."  </P> <P> Unofficial tabulations indicated that seven nations have committed themselves  publicly to vote for such a move, with another five -- including the Soviets --  likely to go along. Cuba and Yemen, which is the sole Arab state on the  council, were most likely to abstain or vote against the resolution.  </P> <P> Baker spoke with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for a half hour  before arriving in Bogota, Colombia, Saturday morning en route from a visit to  Yemen and Saudi Arabia. All indications are that Moscow will support the U.S.  overture and that China, whose foreign minister consulted this weekend with  Shevardnadze, will also go along.  </P> <P> He also spoke by phone with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas after leaving  Colombia en route to Los Angeles, where he met the Malaysian foreign minister  briefly at Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> The official U.S. two-paragraph announcement, released on the final leg of  Baker's grueling trip, said the United States as Security Council president  this month is inviting its members' foreign ministers to a meeting in New York  on Thursday.  </P> <P> "At that time, we will consider what additional steps the council might take to  achieve implementation of the 10 resolutions already adopted (by the Council)  in response to Iraq's unprovoked invasion and continuing occupation of Kuwait."  </P> <P> "Those actions must be implemented," the statement declared. "Our determination  to ensure their implementation should demonstrate to Saddam Hussein the need to  resolve this crisis peacefully and promptly."  </P> <P> In the interview, Baker said the council would consider "a resolution that  would authorize the use of all necessary means to implement the council's prior  resolutions."  </P> <P> The U.S. draft resolution, which will be distributed among members on Monday,  appears to propose a two-step procedure. Iraq would first be given a de facto  ultimatum to withdraw, after which the use-of-force provisions would come into  effect.  </P> <P> "The council will want to explore a resolution that would make very clear that  member states could utilize all necessary means (i.e., use of force) after a  certain date to implement the prior resolutions," Baker said. "And the clear  message of such a resolution to Saddam Hussein will be that there is still a  chance to resolve the matter peacefully within the time frame."  </P> <P> Baker declined to say what time frame the United States would propose, whether  weeks or months after adoption of the measure. "Further discussions" will be  held with council members on the point, he said, confirming reports that some  members, including the Soviet Union, have views different from the Bush  Administration on the deadline.  </P> <P> Indications were that the United States wanted a shorter period in order to  bring pressure on Iraq earlier, while other nations wanted more time for  sanctions to bite.  </P> <P> More broadly, "considerable debate" was expected on the resolution, Baker said,  even though he has consulted personally with the foreign ministers of all  council members except Cuba in the past three weeks. Whether he or an aide will  discuss the resolution with the Cubans has not been decided, he indicated.  </P> <P> Earlier, his consultations with the Colombians in Bogota and the Malaysians in  Los Angeles produced non-committal responses.  </P> <P> Virtually all states consulted by Baker have emphasized the preference for a  peaceful solution, as has Baker himself in presenting the U.S. view. His  remarks at a press conference in Bogota reflected the case he has been making.  </P> <P> Although the United Nations has called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from  Kuwait, Baker said, "so far we see no withdrawal and in fact, no inclination of  Saddam Hussein to withdraw. It is important to the United Nations and the  international community that U.N. resolutions be implemented," particularly in  halting aggression of larger nations against smaller ones, he said.  </P> <P> "We strongly prefer a peaceful and political resolution of this crisis," he  declared. "But perhaps the best way to achieve it is for us not to rule out the  option of the use of force. It may be the only thing that Saddam Hussein  understands . . . and if it (force) is to be a credible option, we must lay the  appropriate military and political foundations for it," both through a buildup  of military forces and a U.N. resolution authorizing their use.  </P> <P> Baker dodged a question on whether the United States might use force  unilaterally if it failed to get U.N. approval for the coming resolution. "We  would much prefer," he said, "to look to it (implementing past resolutions)  through the U.N. Security Council."  </P> <P> The response of Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Fernando Jaramillo was also  typical of the stand of the smaller non-permanent members of the Council,  including Finland and Ivory Coast, which have not openly committed to the  American case so far but which seem inclined to do so.  </P> <P> "Colombia really stands for peaceful solutions of conflicts," Jaramillo said.  "But Colombia cannot accept the fact that, through force, a party has violated  international order."  </P> <P> In the unofficial tabulation of votes for the U.S. resolution, the certain ayes  are those of the United States, France, Britain, Zaire, Ethiopia, Romania, and  Canada.  </P> <P> In the likely column are the Soviet Union, China, Colombia, Finland and Ivory  Coast.  </P></p>

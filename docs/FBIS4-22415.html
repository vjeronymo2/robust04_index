			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Toomas Sildam: "Estonia Does Have a State </F> Border, After All"]    [Text]    At a press conference held yesterday Tarmo Kouts,  executive director of the Border Guard Service, said that last  year 11.3 million persons were checked crossing the borders of  Estonia, 29,827 of whom were sent back, because they did not  have a visa or other necessary documents. Between check points,  2,562 persons were caught--for visa violations or illegal border  crossings. At the same time, illegal merchandise valued at more  than 3 million kroons (calculated at state prices) was  seized.    More than 1,300 persons were sent out, who had been here  illegally. Border guards discovered 640 falsified passports.    "Last summer at the port of Tallinn, for example, three  Kurdish refugees presented such expertly crafted Polish  passports that they were being used for the third time `around.'  Or let's recall the story of how some Kurdish refugees showed up  at the check point at Ikla, equipped with genuine Latvian  passports showing Azerbaijani as their nationality," said Tarmo  Kouts, executive director of the Border Guards Service.    There are 38 check points (12 a year ago) along Estonia's  borders, employing 2,446 persons. "Last year, their average  monthly salary was 871 kroons. Despite the old Estonian saw: Let  the wages match the work, we are still trying to maintain: The  work first, and wages later principle, but..." Tarmo Kouts  mused, recalling a current truism: "A cheap state official is  the most expensive kind."    Last year, however, the government did approve the concept  of  border guard, the decree for the Border Guard Service and, since  February 1 of this year, the new structure of border guard has  taken effect. But the biggest problems, supposedly, are still  stemming from gaps in legislation. Thus, Estonia does not have a  border law ("We hope it will be passed this spring," Tarmo  Kouts said optimistically), and a border guard law.    The legislative vacuum can lead to absurdities, where people  involved in the illegal transport of Kurdish refugees cannot be  punished.    Thus, on October 25, 1994, a party of Kurdish refugees was  taken aboard the Vessel Vironia from Pirita to the port of  Lindigo in Sweden. A criminal suit was filed against the  sailors, but the Tallinn City Court cleared them of charges,  because Estonia did not have legally fixed state borders...  During the night before October 27, 1992, 129 Kurdish refugees  were taken to the Bornholm island of Denmark aboard vessels Lyly  and Meotida. Two weeks later a criminal suit was filed, and  dropped on June 27 last year, again for lack of a "legally fixed  state border"... On February 2, 1993, the Vessel Revalia took  108 Kurdish refugees to Helsinki's Suomenlinna. The criminal  suit was dropped on June 30...    The border guards are very optimistic aboutbout the the  court  case coming up for March 7. In it, two men are accused of trying  to take 24 Kurdish refugees from Tallinn to Finland on a vessel  called Orbiit.    Tarmo Kouts believes that: "Border guards will already  start to benefit from the law on surveillance activity passed  this week, which will enable us to gather information about  events happenings in the border region, instead of relying on  police all the time."    About the incident of 66 Kurdish refugees discovered in a  refrigeration van on board the passenger ferry Estonia last  Saturday night, we now know that, according to preliminary data,  16 of these people had left the camp at Harku secretly. The rest  of them presumably came to Estonia at the beginning or middle of  last week, and had been hiding somewhere near Tallinn. How they  crossed the border (both entering and leaving Estonia), will be  explained by the heads of different government agencies. At any  rate, yesterday morning there was a meeting dealing with this at  the Ministry of the Interior that will be continued next Monday.</p>

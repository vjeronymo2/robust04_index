			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia tries again on mine ventures BOLIVIA'S STATE mining corporation, Comibol, has for the second time opened tenders for Bolivar, a mine producing silver, tin, lead and zinc. The move marks an attempt by the government to reinstate joint venture deals between Comibol and private companies, following their recent suspension. Three companies - Jordex Resources, Comsur and Breakwater Resources, recently taken over by Aritmeco of the US - have made bids for the mine, the value of which may be published tomorrow. Evaluation of the bids by the United Nations Development Programme will be completed within one month. Comsur's bid in the first round, which was rejected, was Dollars 25m and a planned 1,000-tonnes-a-day treatment plant. Meanwhile, joint venture contracts remain in the limbo to which they were condemned by the government in October, following union pressure and claims by parliamentarians that they were illegal. However, the government has taken the first step towards their reinstatement by attempting to rectify the legal position. Amendments to the original contracts proposed by the mining ministry have already been accepted by Cominesa, one of the two big companies involved, along with Brazil's Paranapanema. According to Mr Charles Bruce, executive vice president of Mintec, a Bolivian mining consultancy, Cominesa will attempt to enter the Tasna mine 'early next year'. Nevertheless, significant problems remain, not least the union opposition. The government will have to tackle the unions head on early next year - a general election is due on June 6 - if the joint ventures are to go ahead in 1993.</p>

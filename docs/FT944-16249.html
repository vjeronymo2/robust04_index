			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Warning on maritime services The problems of the Lloyd's insurance market and any tax changes which made London less attractive to its big Greek shipowning community could damage Britain's dominance of maritime services, a study warned yesterday. The report, commissioned by the Corporation of London, says that London's shipping services sector has survived the decline of the British merchant fleet but it must remain alert to possible threats. The researchers looked at the three biggest maritime sectors - marine insurance, ship broking and ship finance. These produce combined profits, before labour costs, of Pounds 1bn a year. Insurance premiums written in London are Pounds 3bn, shipbroking commissions are worth Pounds 400m a year and the shipping loan portfolios of London-based banks are worth about Pounds 7.5bn. The study was carried out as part of a review of the City of London's competitiveness in its main areas of activity. A summary of the 26 sectors covered will be published early next year. The study says London's shipping markets have maintained their position in competition with other centres because of their financial liquidity and the expertise of the people involved. The combination of services available in London means deals can be concluded in one centre. In marine insurance the size of the market means risks can be priced competitively and a good service can be offered in terms of claims handling and the diversity of risks accepted. But the recent poor financial performance of the sector and competition from continental European reinsurers could threaten London's position. Insurers must cultivate stronger links with other parts of the shipping industry and develop databases and market intelligence to avoid underpricing risks, the report says. The shipbroking sector depends on the presence of a high number of foreign shipowners, principally Greeks, and its position could be damaged if tax or other changes persuade them to leave. Piraeus in Greece has developed as a shipping centre. London has a strong pull on international banks offering shipping finance but a shift away from loans to equity finance and bond offerings could weaken its role. The US market is attractive for bond offerings while the Oslo stockmarket is increasing its share of equity listings but many equity offerings are still managed by UK merchant banks.

			<p>BFN     [Text] AUCKLAND, May 26 (AFP) -- The government of one of  the world's smallest states, the central Pacific republic of  Kiribati, has fallen amid claims of misuse of public funds by a  cabinet minister, according to a broadcast report Thursday.    A Council of State has taken over the day-to-day running  from  President Teatao Teannati moved out of the presidential  residency hours after he fell from power, the state-owned  Broadcasting and Publications Authority said.    In the 36-seat Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu, the assembly, the  ruling National Progressive Party suffered a defeat, 21-19, when  the opposition moved to set up a select committee to investigate  the misuse of public funds.    Opposition Maneaba Party MP Teburoro Tito claimed funds had  been misused in hotel accommodation, transport, entertainment  and gifts.    In an attempt to settle the situation, Vice-President  Taomati  Iuta proposed setting up a commission of inquiry, instead of a  parliamentary committee, but this also was defeated. Speaker  Beretitara Neeti then dissolved parliament. He now sits in the  interim Council of State along with the chief justice and the  chairman of the Public Service Commission.    Under the constitution, general elections are expected to  take place by August. Elections are normally held every four  years and another was not due until next year.    Kiribati, the former British colony of the Gilbert Islands,  consists of 33 islands scattered over five million square  kilometers (two million square miles) in the Pacific Ocean.    Its 68,000 people, known as "I-Kiribati," are predominantly  Micronesian. The word Kiribati is the closest local  pronunciation that the 13-letter island alphabet could manage  for Gilbert.    Its capital atoll, Tarawa, was virtually flattened by the  Americans when they landed marines there in 1943 to dislodge  Japanese forces, who had taken over most of the Gilberts.    The largest coral atoll in the world, Kiritimati or  Christmas, was used for atmospheric nuclear testing by Britain  and the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.    The Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu includes a seat for Banaba or  Ocean  Island although British phosphate mining all but destroyed the  island and most of its people have been resettled in Fiji.</p>

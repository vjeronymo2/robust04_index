			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Lie: "Search for Clues About Air Crash Continues"] </F>   [Text] Xian--The head of China Northwest Airlines, the  operator of the Tupolev-154 jetliner that crashed on Monday near  Xian killing all 160 people aboard, ruled out a quick  explanation of the country's worst air mishap, citing a lack of  information at this stage.    Gao Junyue, general manager of the airline, said it was  impossible to figure out the cause of the accident before all  the data in the black box flight recorder, which was found  largely intact at the crash site, was analyzed. This could not  be completed in just a few days.    Gao said the Russian producer of the Tupolev-154 jet will  send investigators to China soon, at the invitation of the  Chinese Government.    The general manager said the airline will compensate each  domestic victim 70,000 yuan ($8,090), as stipulated by a 1993  regulation issued by the State Council. Families of victims  from outside the Chinese mainland will receive $40,000.    The People's Insurance Company of China will pay another  100,000 yuan ($11,500) to each victim who had bought insurance  from them before boarding the flight. It was not known how many  of them had done so.    Gao said the crew reported, just two minutes after the  plane's 8:12 am take-off from Xian to Guangzhou, that the plane  was swaying uncontrollably. At 8:19, the crew said the shaking  became more violent at an altitude of 3,600 m and they demanded  to return to the airport. The authorities granted their request  and opened the runway and nearby airports for a possible  emergency landing.    Gao said witnesses reported one or two thunder-like  explosions in the clouds and saw the plane hitting the ground in  three large pieces: The nose, part of the fuselage and the  tail. Debris was later found scattered across a 2-square-km  area.    He said it was the first time in China's aviation history  that a passenger airliner had blown up in midair.    Gao said the plane underwent a major overhaul in 1992 and  had  flown 2,857 hours since then. It had flown a total of 10,000  hours. The Russian producer said the plane was considered to be  still new, as it was designed to fly 30,000 hours.    On June 3, the plane was reported to have some malfunctions.  It was soon repaired and was determined in test flying to be  satisfactory. Monday's fatal trip was its first formal flight  since then.    Gao said the unidentified foreign passenger on Monday was an  Australian instead of a Swiss as previously reported.</p>

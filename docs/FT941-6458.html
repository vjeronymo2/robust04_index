			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Local elections in Netherlands The Dutch go to the polls today in local government elections ahead of national elections on May 3, writes Ronald van de Krol from Amsterdam. Opinion polls suggest the two parties in the governing coalition - the Christian Democrats, led by the country's veteran prime minister Mr Ruud Lubbers, and the Labour party - would lose their majority if general elections were held this week, with the opposition Liberals and D66 registering sharp gains. A poll by the Nipo polling company suggests the Christian Democrat's support would fall to just 35 seats in parliament, from 54 in the 1989 elections, and Labour to 31 seats, down from 49.</p>

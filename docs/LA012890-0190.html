			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURE GORE;  </P> <P> HIS NOVEL, 'HOLLYWOOD,' IS JUST OUT, BUT THE GREAT CURMUDGEON IS NOT  CELEBRATING  </P> <P> IT IS DECEMBER, AND THE AIR is a wash of silky light, astringently cool, but  sunny enough to allow one to bathe in multiple sensations of warmth. Under  white canvas umbrellas in outdoor cafes the beautiful ladies of Rome in their  beautiful furs cross narrow ankles; old men read their papers and sigh over  remembered pleasures.  </P> <P> On this gorgeous day, the restorers' scaffolding that has obscured the pillars  of the Pantheon for a year has been removed; the building that is both  prototype (cave) and culmination (temple) of all the buildings on earth is  revealed in its amazing beauty. Gorbachev is in Rome talking to the Pope. All  the city -- Catholic, communist, everyone young and old -- is wreathed in  smiles. Perfection of weather and of hopes. The Berlin Wall is down. Old  shibboleths crumble. There is a spirited will to joy. It is easier than usual  to breathe.  </P> <P> "So, are you rejoicing?" I ask Gore Vidal.  </P> <P> "Whatever for?" he asks. "Surely rejoicing is somewhat premature," he says.  </P> <P> GORE VIDAL HAS LIVED DOWN THE STREET from the Pantheon, in the historical  center of Rome, since the mid-1960s; he lives in a penthouse with a wraparound  terrace in the Palazzo Origo -- one of the more resonant addresses in Rome. It  belonged to the noble family-by-marriage of Iris Origo, whose life was  distinguished by more than graceful prose ("Saint Bernardino of Siena" and "The  Merchant of Prato"). She had what Vidal calls a "good war" -- protecting her  contadini from the Fascists, hiding escaped prisoners of war and Allied  soldiers, feeding and housing the poor. Vidal knew Iris Origo and her  Anglo-Irish / American family, of course. He knows, as they say, Everyone.  </P> <P> One would think that to be in the proximity of this kind of nobility -- not of  rank but of heart -- would make one contagiously happy. And, as a gloss upon  one's happiness, one would, if one lived in the Palazzo Origo, have merely to  cross the street to Delfino's, where the Italian version of takeout is  purveyed: tender Roman artichokes in satiny olive oil, chicken alla diavolo  grilled to golden succulence.  </P> <P> "Does Rome still thrill you?" I ask Gore Vidal.  </P> <P> "I still look at it," he says.  </P> <P> In London, the city from which I have just come, copies of his new novel,  "Hollywood" (available next week in the United States), are heaped in the  windows of all the bookshops.  </P> <P> "I have no cause to say hosanna," he says.  </P> <P> A CAT CAN'T BE IN HEAT only three weeks after she gave birth, can she?" Vidal  asks. A slim, milky-white cat with pale green eyes insinuates herself among our  limbs, uttering a mournful cry of dumb lust. The elegant, kittenish creature --  who pleases Vidal because, motherhood notwithstanding, she (a Lolita in heat)  doesn't look the least like an adult animal -- gave birth to a poor thing with  a deviated septum. The offspring died in an attempt to suckle, drowned in its  own mucus. This week, Vidal, 64, is being operated on for a deviated septum  (which makes his face slightly asymmetrical and his voice nasal); he is  apparently not a superstitious man.  </P> <P> The drawing room is cold, the coldness of marble, and dark, very dark, though  the sun shines brightly on the terrace, and the great chandelier in the dining  room is blazing. The only source of heat -- the sun seems not to reach this  room -- are two bouquets of roses, yellow and orange, tightly curled.  </P> <P> The lobby of the Palazzo Origo, which houses a Berlitz school and a school of  the dance, is white and Brunelleschi-gray, with bits of antiquity casually  built into the walls, Roman-style. Vidal's apartment is achieved by means of an  open lift, on which hangs a sign proclaiming that to use the lift is Strictly  Forbidden, a sign that everybody -- Rome being a place where that which is  forbidden is permitted -- ignores.  </P> <P> We stand at first on the terrace, with its fresh view of Borromini's St. Ivo  alla Sapienzia, its white corkscrew steeple joyously boring into the sky; the  dome (from which wild flowers grow) of the Baroque St. Andrea della Valle; the  Roman Synagogue (which Vidal has never been in); and two hills, the Janiculum  and the Aventine. It is a shock to go from the sunny terrace to the dark living  room, like coming out of a movie theater into bright sunlight, only in reverse.  </P> <P> Tapestries, ancestral portraits, a fanciful -- kitschy and also rather lovely  -- mirror from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, leather, bibelots. I am pleased  to sit on a chair frequently occupied, until his death in 1985, by Italo  Calvino, of whom Vidal has written with affection and esteem. On the table in  front of me are sun-dried figs and walnuts on wooden skewers, made in Vidal's  villa in Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, south of Rome. On the table next to me  are a photograph of Paul Newman -- faded almost to sepia -- with a floppy dead  fish in his hand and a bewildered expression on his young face; an unframed  colored snapshot of Vidal, a still from the made-for-TNT movie "Gore Vidal's  Billy the Kid," in which he played a bit part; and, partially obscured by the  colored snapshot, a framed picture of a 1940s kind of woman's face -- arched  and stenciled eyebrows, dark glossy lips, shoulders framed in some heavy shiny  stuff. A dusky male servant pads quietly, making unobtrusive arrangements here  and there.  </P> <P> In this solemn Roman apartment, and from this particular chair, it seems  natural to speak of writers and writing. "You loved Henry James, no?"  </P> <P> "Oh, yes."  </P> <P> "So is there a contemporary writer you love? I know you loved Calvino." (In  fact, Vidal launched the Italian novelist in America in 1973. He reviewed all  of Calvino's books in the New York Review of Books, the principal outlet for  Vidal's essays since 1964; it was an act of writerly love.)  </P> <P> "That was about it," he answers.  </P> <P> "That was it? Just Calvino?"  </P> <P> "Well, I mean I like certain books, but there are no writers that really excite  me. . . . As you are Catholic, I suppose you believe you'll meet him some day."  </P> <P> "Calvino? I allow for that possibility. And you?"  </P> <P> "Christianity -- your idea of a suffering God who became man -- is just  ludicrous. Before Christianity came along we were doing very well. We had  philosophy for the most advanced, plain old superstition for the superstitious  and mystery cults for those who were worried about the afterlife. Something for  everyone. . . . Calvino is in my brain."  </P> <P> "So he's alive."  </P> <P> "Till the brain goes."  </P> <P> "Anybody else? Updike?"  </P> <P> "A very charming and very skillful writer," Vidal says. "But not very  intelligent. They wanted a right-winger and they got one. He should have been a  preacher. 'Reverend Updike' sounds exactly right to me."  </P> <P> "James Baldwin?"  </P> <P> "I respected him. He was so hostile to Mailer and to me and to other young  writers of the time, it was very hard to be around him. He only wrote one  really good book -- the one with 'Beale Street' in the title, a kind of perfect  novel, a small novel. You can make a small one come out properly, and he does.  It's the least piss-elegant."  </P> <P> Perhaps I am being unfair to him, I think; I broaden the question: "Who are the  writers you admire?"  </P> <P> "My favorite writers, when I was at the top of my energy and reading a lot,  were Apuleius and Petronius, and my roots are in them -- much more than in  Hawthorne or Melville, whom I don't care for. When your spiritual home is  classical, romantic woolly American writing is just very distasteful. 'Moby  Dick' is my idea of an irrelevant work. George Eliot is good -- you have to be  40 and know the world to know how good she is. I like the novels of Carson  McCullers; I like the short stories of Paul Bowles; I loved Waugh when I was a  kid, I don't think I could reread him; I enjoy Graham Greene, but he tends to  be 'the mixture as before.' I like some young fellow -- Ellis? something like  that, I can't think."  </P> <P> Vidal is elliptical in his praise, as one might be who shrinks from vulgar  effusion or who places himself under constraint not to use the word love,  believing that if he does, he will be held sternly to account for it. He has  been generous in print; in stylish and moving essays he salutes writers as  diverse as Saul Bellows and Tennessee Williams. When he speaks, in his chilly  drawl, he is inclined to become jejune.  </P> <P> And despite the sense he conveys that nothing -- including generosity -- counts  for very much, stories about his own financial and emotional generosity abound.  Writers speak of his willingness to bear their burdens when they endured  terrible personal crises; at least one artist owes her villa in Umbria to his  having come through with a personal loan at a crucial moment; a child in  Ravello owes her eyesight to his efforts. (He also has apparently abandoned  friendships for reasons tantamount, one ex-friend says, "to your saying you  think he's perfect except for one dreadful shirt.")  </P> <P> The Vidal-on-display is the Vidal who, in a series of noisy TV commentaries in  1968, traded venomous insults with William F. Buckley (he called Buckley a  "crypto-Nazi"; Buckley called him a "queer" and threatened to punch him); the  Vidal who sued Truman Capote for libel after Capote said in an interview that  Bobby Kennedy kicked a drunken Vidal out of the White House for placing a hand  on Jacqueline Kennedy's bare shoulder. (Jacqueline Onassis and Vidal are by way  of being related. Their mothers were married to Hugh D. Auchincloss. For a  while, according to Vidal, Jackie claimed him as a brother.)  </P> <P> The Vidal-first-met is Vidal-the-cynic (he calls himself a realist -- "an  unbearable thing to be") who performs his iconoclastic but not wildly original  liberal-left act on the "Tonight Show" (Johnny Carson and his then-wife,  Joanna, visited Vidal at Ravello when their marriage, soon to fail, was in  trouble -- this is one act of kindness Vidal can't not mention, perhaps because  names of the famous are delicious in his mouth); the Vidal who exchanged deadly  quips with Norman Mailer on Dick Cavett's TV show and publicly feuded with him  (They have since made it up: "We ought not to be acting out private dramas in  public to give our detractors purchase," he says).  </P> <P> The Vidal-first-met is a weary and attenuated version of the public performer.  He is tired. He is dully mischievous. He is sad.  </P> <P> SURELY THE WORD LUCKY must often have been applied to Gore Vidal. But not by  him.  </P> <P> Vidal believes that we are all brought up in "cages" and are doomed to know the  world only from the particular set of bars we find ourselves behind. His cage  was golden, the cage reserved for those born to privilege.  </P> <P> "How did you get out of your cage?" I ask.  </P> <P> "Ah," he says. "That's what everyone would like to know."  </P> <P> And that is what he is disinclined to speculate about, at least out loud. ("Are  wicked mothers invariably beautiful?" I ask, pursuing demons of my own. "Mine  was," he says. "Do you want to talk about your mother?" "No.")  </P> <P> In his bathroom hangs a picture of Vidal as a young Army warrant officer; he  was then invariably described as "devastatingly handsome." There are also  framed covers of Time and Newsweek -- one of Raquel Welch, his Myra  Breckenridge ("Myra Breckenridge" is the work most frequently attacked when  Vidal's moral probity comes under discussion; in his words, it is a novel  "about a homosexual who becomes a woman, falls in love with a girl and then  becomes, more or less, a man again."), another of Vidal himself, upon the  publication of his novel "1876." Outside the bathroom hangs a framed list of 64  signatures, those of residents of a small town in Maine who sent him greetings  on the occasion of his 64th birthday. ("Will Philip Roth receive that on his  64th birthday?" he asks.)  </P> <P> Parts of his childhood sound made-to-order by Hollywood and the other capital  of make-believe, Washington. His grandfather, Thomas Gore, was a blind Bible  Belt senator whom a bare-footed 7-year-old Vidal regularly escorted to his  Senate seat. His father, Eugene Vidal, was an aviation pioneer and a member of  Franklin D. Roosevelt's Cabinet. Vidal was the first child to cross the  continent by plane; he was 4.  </P> <P> He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1943. He was 17. He would never go  to college; he enlisted in the Army. When he was 19, stationed in the Aleutian  Islands, he wrote his first novel, "Williwaw," a critical success. In his third  novel, "The City and the Pillar," he wrote matter-of-factly about a homosexual  relationship. The book was not advertised in the New York Times (the Kinsey  Report wasn't either), and he complains of being "blackballed" by the literary  Establishment. He offers in proof that his next five novels were not reviewed  in the daily New York Times or in Time or Newsweek.  </P> <P> He wears these scars like stigmata. In 1976, he was elected to the National  Institute of Arts and Letters -- "the American Academy and 200 immortals and so  on; they sent me a very pompous telegram congratulating me, and I sent them a  little short telegram congratulating them on having elected me. And then I  said: 'I cannot accept this election as I already belong to the Diner's Club.'  I made so many enemies with that one. John Cheever told me it was the rudest  telegram he'd ever seen and so forth and so on. John said, 'Well, couldn't you  at least have said Carte Blanche instead of Diner's Club?' "  </P> <P> If generosity consists of being able to take as well as to give, it is fair to  say that Vidal is lacking in generosity. He has been financially and critically  rewarded. "Burr," "Lincoln," "1876," "Empire" and "Washington, D.C." -- his  "novels in history" -- have been best sellers. Altogether, his 12 books have  been translated into 20 languages and have sold an estimated 30 million copies.  His plays have been produced on- and off-Broadway. He has written box-office  successes for Hollywood. Jim Belushi just made a movie of one of his  screenplays; Vidal is talking with Martin Scorsese about another; Hollywood may  make "Hollywood" into a miniseries.  </P> <P> He has been a golden boy with perpetual promise perpetually renewed. He has  not, on the evidence, fared badly -- unless he wishes to be regarded as  prescient, as a political and sexual guru, undisputed king of the literary and  political mountains.  </P> <P> Can anyone want so much? He once wrote that "very early, the idea of fame --  eternal fame -- afflicted our race." Surely his wounds have had time to heal?  They suppurate.  </P> <P> "In 1984, I won the Pulitzer Prize for 'Lincoln.' " (In fact, he did not.)  "There were three judges, as always, and two voted for me. The third -- a lady,  some sort of novelist, I think -- said she would go public if this prize were  given to such a bad writer. How many Americans can tell good writing from bad?  I'm sure that little lady couldn't. They gave it to a very minor novel by a  very good writer, Alison Lurie. And that was my Pulitzer.  </P> <P> "Of course the little lady didn't mean I was a bad writer, she meant I was a  bad person; they always say bad writer when they mean bad person.  </P> <P> "Well, it's no more than I expected," he says, consulting a glass of Scotch. "I  don't want prizes, I don't want jobs in universities, I don't want to give  readings. They can't understand that I'm not like them.  </P> <P> "Am I sad?" The air, so cold, is thick with sadness. "My blood pressure must be  a sign that something is irritated by them; it's much more likely it's reading  the New York Times and not my own misadventures that sends my blood pressure  up."  </P> <P> He has been sitting sprawled on the sofa, his arms flung out, his pudgy fingers  splayed, his smallish feet neat in shiny black moccasins. The green pullover he  wears over a shirt untidily open at the waist to reveal a furry stomach wars  with the warring colors of his face -- flushed red over gray, the complexion of  a man with high blood pressure. He rises slowly and shuffles, this once  devastatingly handsome man, to the door.  </P> <P> GORE VIDAL FEELS "marginalized, demonized, trivialized." He says, "They find  ways to discredit me so I won't be taken seriously." "They" are the literary  Establishment, the government and "all of journalism -- the media is in place  to make it impossible for anyone to take seriously anyone who is serious."  </P> <P> "The Washington Times demonizes me. They have a cartoon of me that looks like  the devil, and the Washington Post trivializes me in the Style section. It's  all very giggly, just terribly giggly stuff." As for the New York Times, "I'm  high on their enemies list and they're high on mine."  </P> <P> "I cannot give print interviews and win. You are the invention of the writer."  And the media plague him with what he calls "the reverse." He cites an  appearance on the "Today Show." Tom Brokaw, then the host, kept bringing the  subject around to bisexuality, Vidal says. "I said, 'Look, Tom, bisexuality is  a late-night subject.' When Brokaw started for the third time, I said, 'Now I'm  going to talk about politics, we won't talk about me, we won't talk about your  favorite subject, bisexuality -- we'll talk about Jimmy Carter.'  </P> <P> "A year later, in Time, Brokaw said, 'There are some really tough moments in  the business; for instance, I remember when I was doing the 'Today Show,' I had  Gore Vidal on, and I wanted to talk politics and he wanted to talk  bisexuality.'  </P> <P> "I ran into Tom at a party and asked him why he'd lied. He pretended he  couldn't remember. They do it to me all the time."  </P> <P> "I must always be discredited because nothing I say is true -- because I'm evil  and an expatriate, and I hate America. They just go on, they drip torture. 'How  can he write about America when he doesn't live here?' I didn't leave America.  I've always had a house in America -- in Los Angeles -- and one in Europe. Many  people have two houses."  </P> <P> He has three. "I hate possessions but I have to have houses because I have to  have books. I buy houses to put the books in. I once had a house on the Hudson,  a Greek temple built in 1820. I finally sold it and got rid of everything. I  found that I owned 42 sofas. Just think of that. I do not have sofas now."  </P> <P> In 1960, Vidal ran for Congress in upstate New York, and although he lost, got  almost twice as many votes in a staunchly Republican district as the head of  the Democratic ticket, his friend John F. Kennedy. From 1970 to 1972 he was  co-chairman, with Dr. Benjamin Spock ("a funny guy -- looks like a mortician  and knows nothing about politics") of the People's Party. In 1982, he ran for  the Democratic nomination for the Senate in the California primary. He came in  second in a field of nine, with nearly 500,000 votes; he spent less than any of  the top four candidates -- about $50,000. Jerry Brown ("poor, innocent mouse")  spent, he says, a couple of million.  </P> <P> He said then that the American government is a government "of the rich, for the  rich and by the rich -- socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the  poor."  </P> <P> "Forget the politicians," he tells me, "they're the cosmetic government. The  real government are the very rich, something like a dozen families who always  pretend they don't have anything to do with it but of course they do. It's like  going to Rockefeller's house and saying, 'Well, he isn't in charge, he didn't  cook the lunch.' They hire the cooks, they hire the presidents, and they hire  the Congress."  </P> <P> He believes that drugs should be legalized. He believes that the government, or  "a rogue element in the CIA, the DEA or whatever, introduced drugs to gain  total control over the lives of everybody in America so that they can make  money. Mandatory blood tests, urinalysis, lie-detector tests. . . . They have  set up the infrastructure of a police state, and they're not going to give that  up. They know that sooner or later somebody's going to try to overthrow this  government."  </P> <P> "The Japanese hate us, and, which is worse, are contemptuous of us. They come  in every quarter and buy bonds that keep the government going. All they'd have  to do is not come in one quarter. There's no way of keeping up this famous  empire.  </P> <P> "America has not created a civilization. We've started every now and then: But  the waves of immigration meant we had to start all over again -- to absorb  people who brought certain things of value but slowed down other things. Now  we're taking in such huge waves, particularly from south of the border, who  apparently do not take our culture seriously at all."  </P> <P> These may or may not be incendiary beliefs. They're not novel.  </P> <P> It is difficult for me to understand his despair; it is perhaps a matter of  temperament. He inhabits, in fact, no gulag. He is denied no worldly success.  Do enemies of the state appear on the Johnny Carson show?  </P> <P> "If I spoke from a loser's stance," he says, "nobody would pay any attention to  me. I do this so well. Interminably. But I'm paying a toll. I don't mind, I  don't really mind at all. On the other hand, my blood pressure is very high,  and I have to take a beta blocker for hypertension."  </P> <P> A strange side-effect of the medication Vidal takes for his blood pressure is  that he is no longer able to cry. His eyes will not produce tears.  </P> <P> WE DRINK SCOTCH, we talk about phobias. He has a friend who is so afraid of  Fifth Avenue that he cannot even be driven down it in a limousine. The next  day, Vidal's greeting to me, as I come out of the creaky lift -- which he never  takes -- will be: "Did the streets get you?" Two of the characters in  "Hollywood" are so afraid of the dark that they cannot sleep alone; men, they  sleep with other men for comfort, not for sex.  </P> <P> "Hollywood: A Novel of America in the 1920s" is, of course, very much on Gore  Vidal's mind, though he sighs with mingled exasperation and wit: "What is the  joy of writing a novel? Finishing it."  </P> <P> Vidal calls "Hollywood" a "contemporary novel." It takes the reader through the  administrations of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding. It  parallels matters of state with the silent-movie world of the '20s, moving  between Washington and Los Angeles to make a perfect circle of corruption:  "Films fed the people involved; people involved fed the films. L. B. Mayer  reinvented America and the world. The world of Andy Hardy became echt-America,  and not only did America fall for it, the world fell for it. And eventually  they give us Ronald Reagan because he's a reminder of the great glory days,  standing tall -- city on a hill -- a visible reminder of something that was  imaginary to begin with. But it's soothing; and these are troubling times, so  it was inspired to have him there -- it was a disaster for the country, but it  was an inspired kind of artwork."  </P> <P> After his more personal books did not receive universal accolades, he might  have thought (though his intelligence surely would have advised him otherwise)  that there was refuge and safety to be found in writing historical novels, that  putting history on parade would make him less vulnerable than putting what were  perceived to be his own feelings on parade. Such hopes, if hopes they were,  proved illusory. And criticism from historians was more than he'd anticipated.  </P> <P> Whether or not it is legitimate to mix real characters with invented ones as  Vidal did became a question much vexed.  </P> <P> "I make it very clear, but people don't quite know how to handle it: People who  were figures in history I don't play around with; they do and say what they did  and said, as much as we can tell. After all, what is history? If you think  history is reading all the New York Times' statements about a President, you're  not going to get anywhere near it.  </P> <P> "What I have done is to take the narrative back to its origins, right back to  Homer. To Dante. To Shakespeare. To Tolstoy. I'm writing about the rulers, the  victimizers, the kings, the gods, the heroes. I am the chronicler of the  American republic -- which ought to be described in terms other than the  god-awful history books that kids are supposed to read and wisely don't."  </P> <P> Vidal has been attacked by academicians -- "scholar-squirrels" or  "hagiographers" to him -- for fictionalizing actual political figures. They  have fallen prey, he has said, to the naive delusion that there is "a final  Truth revealed only to the tenured few in their footnote mazes."  </P> <P> Much has been made of the flaws Vidal attributes to Lincoln: "Look what I've  gone through just with Lincoln's syphilis! Lincoln told his law partner that he  had syphilis: In fact he gave the name of the town and the name of the girl,  and the name of the doctor he went to in Cincinnati. There was no cure. It was  epidemic. And he had it.  </P> <P> "Every time I've made a whopper -- and I've made a few -- it's always been from  following 'authority.' I've always gotten it from the biography -- and the  biography's wrong.  </P> <P> "Well, it's coming to an end. I can't get the energy anymore for it."  </P> <P> "Hollywood" will be followed, he says, by the seventh and final installment of  the historical cycle -- a book "from my point of view, in the present, looking  back on 45 to 50 years."  </P> <P> He will never not write. "You can say about me that I don't possess my own mind  till I've written about it. I never know what I think until I write, and  sometimes I don't know then."  </P> <P> CAROLINE SANFORD, THE HEROINE of "Hollywood" insofar as "Hollywood" has a  heroine, says that the word "faithfulness" in marriage has absolutely no  application and makes no sense unless one has religious faith. Vidal concurs:  "Faith is a Christian word, fideles. It's not a word that would ever grab her."  Nor does it grab Vidal, who believes that "there is no such thing as a  heterosexual person or a homosexual person, there are only heterosexual or  homosexual acts. There is also no such thing as a heterosexual or a homosexual  sensibility. What on earth does Eleanor Roosevelt have in common with Roy Cohn?  One was a saint and the other a beast.  </P> <P> "What is wrong with other-sex even if you're married? What is wrong with  same-sex even if you're married? One would rather not be the occasion of  someone else's pain but we all are sometimes and that's part of being alive; it  goes with the turf.  </P> <P> "Genetically there's monogamy built into women -- they need nine months for  that egg and a long time to make a commitment. For a man, the sexual act is  quite enough, it doesn't have to lead to a relationship; sometimes it's far  more kinetically exciting knowing that it does not. Boys hate kissing, girls  start that stuff, you love that stuff. 'Just hold me,' that's all a woman  wants. Boys aren't like that."  </P> <P> Vidal has been with his companion, Howard Austen, for 40 years, a fact he will  not meet head-on in conversation. "Well, there you are," he says. "Fidelity is  such a large word. Human relationships change all the time. There you are.  </P> <P> "The Italians have sex right. They just do it."  </P> <P> Howard's voice sounds from his bedroom. Howard's bedroom is covered in antique  floral Roman wallpaper, muted reds and purples and hints of old gold --  Pompeian colors. Striped drapes and a striped bed canopy; chinoiserie. Curled  on the bed, drinking excellent coffee from eggshell china (a gold spoon), I  watch a documentary of Vidal's campaign in California. He looks young and fit.  </P> <P> It has grown darker and colder. In the drawing room, Gore Vidal pulls the  velvet drapes, lights the lights.  </P> <P> He likes to dish. . . .  </P> <P> Margaret Thatcher: "She became all boy to become all prime minister."  </P> <P> Nancy Reagan: "Poor Nancy, just in over her head."  </P> <P> Barbara Bush: "One knows that the beloved Barbara doesn't like anybody . . .  except 'our kind.' "  </P> <P> The Duke and Duchess of Windsor: "I liked her, she was very funny. Awfully  shrewd. He was, I think, the stupidest man I have ever met -- and there was not  much charm with it. We were once talking about coronations and I said that at  the high point of the coronation of the Roman emperor, two masons with trowel  and mortar appeared and said: 'We are here for your tomb, lord of the world.'  And the Duke said, 'Oh yes; I'm a Mason too, you know.' "  </P> <P> Charlie Chaplin: "Paulette Goddard told me he was uncircumcised. She couldn't  think of the word. She said, 'You know, he has one of those things.' I'd asked  her if he was Jewish or not because there'd been something about it in the  paper. 'Oh,' she said, 'with Charlie who ever knows? He lies all the time. But  you know,' she said, 'he has one of those things.' "  </P> <P> Jacqueline Onassis: "She's very -- quite -- intelligent. She got everything she  wanted. Specifically, money.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you a story: We were up in Hyannisport -- this is the first summer  of their presidency. After dinner I was playing backgammon with Himself. It was  just Jackie and me and the President. And he was laughing away at some  interview I'd given to Look magazine about what it was like growing up in  Merrywood (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Vidal had, at separate times, lived  at Merrywood, the Auchincloss estate in Virginia) when my mother was the  reigning Mrs. Auchincloss. I said, 'Well, it was a very unreal world. You  didn't know there was a Depression on when you were there -- there were five  white servants in the houses, a great, great social distinction in Washington,  where domestic help was usually black. Well, I became a private in the infantry  when I was 17, so I was not much affected by all that. Girls are different; if  you're brought up in an unreal world, you stay in one.'  </P> <P> "The President said, 'What's all this golden-season crap you've been peddling  about Merrywood? It was "The Little Foxes." ' He said, 'How do you explain how  all of you are such disasters?' There's seven or eight of us (children and  stepchildren, from Auchincloss' several marriages).  </P> <P> "Well, the President went down through the whole lot of us, saying why this one  was a failure and that one was a failure. He skipped Jackie and me. And Jackie  and I looked at each other and then we looked at Jack, and she said, 'Go on.'  </P> <P> "Jack got a little embarrassed. Jackie didn't say anything. I said, 'Well,  naturally we can't be like your family -- intimating that such perfection was  not given to mere mortals -- but if you do feel that we are individually flawed  by being the children or stepchildren of Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Jr., I would  put it down to one reason: Each of us had a mother he knew married only for  money.'  </P> <P> "Jack was quite shocked. He said, 'Oh, well you -- you -- you mean security.' I  said, 'No, I mean money, big money.' And Jackie said: 'Yes.' "  </P> <P> Barney Frank: "I was startled to see that Newsweek put Barney Frank on the  cover -- an act of absolute viciousness, anti-fag and anti-liberal, what's a  more beautiful combination to sell newspapers?  </P> <P> "All we hear is private lives. Isn't he a nice man? Is that her hair? He  certainly made a mess. But what does that have to do with legislation?"  </P> <P> Eleanor Roosevelt: "I saw a lot of Eleanor in the last 10 years of her life.  She was so down on sex. One couldn't imagine her in bed. But when I read her  published letters, I was convinced that her love (for a woman journalist) was  100% physical. She told me that after Roosevelt died, she found evidence that  he had broken his contract with her and continued to have an affair with Lucy  Mercer. FDR might have thought it was fun to take Lucy away from Eleanor -- she  was her girlfriend first. Eleanor went to her husband's funeral like Medea."  </P> <P> Jimmy Carter: "He was Rockefeller's creature. And Coca-Cola's before that. What  you want in a President is not someone nice but someone who has an interest in  the people at large -- not the people who gave him the money to get there. You  think he was a good man? What's that to do with it?"  </P> <P> THE NEWSSTANDS in Rome can't keep their customers supplied: Everyone wants to  read about the events in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "There are two things going on in the world," Vidal says. "One is a centrifugal  force to save the planet -- a bringing together of all the economies to  preserve the air, water and soil. Then there's another force at work, which is  that everybody is sick of the nation-state. So there will be some sort of  confederation which will allow freedom to the people within: Scotland will no  longer have to think about Westminster, Wales will be off on its own, so will  the Basque country. All the ethnic disturbances going on within the Soviet  Union will be resolved. If these things balance out, it will be ideal for the  human race: You would have a world state which could preserve the planet and  stabilize the economy, and simultaneously you would give individual groups,  tribes and factions a chance to be themselves within that world state.  </P> <P> "It's far more likely that the bad guys will take over the world government,  they'll forget to save the planet and we'll all be slaves."  </P> <P> It's a bleak view. So what, I ask, does he do to refresh and renew himself? "We  -- Howard and I -- go to Southeast Asia for at least one month in the winter.  Thailand, the old Thailand, the country. I have many Buddhist friends, and I've  started to learn meditation for my blood pressure. To remain tranquil and  serene, which can only be done by not wanting anything. And that's the trick.  Not wanting anything, you are on your way to enlightenment, on your way out of  a world that is painful because of desire. I'm doing kindergarten exercises --  you empty your head, all you think about is breathing, in and out, in and out.  Quite hard work, but it brings my pressure down. I know what true solace is but  I don't turn to it. I'm too much a Westerner and I'm too shaped in the jungles  of Washington to be anything but a carnivore.  </P> <P> "What is true solace? Not to be what I am. Stop thinking of yourself, stop  thinking of what you desire." "Are you afraid of death?"  </P> <P> "The Italians decide when you're going to be dead some time before you are put  in the ground. You can see it in Ravello. You can see old people becoming  non-people. I'm sure everybody's nice to grandfather at home; but in the square  there comes a moment when no one listens to him. Nothing harsh about it.  They're baby-mad, child-mad, and they're mad about themselves in middle age.  But there comes a moment, a shadow line, when a person ceases to be a person to  the town. Haven't you seen it in Ravello? In the square? The very old sitting  in a line? And then one day the line thins out."  </P> <P> I have seen them, the old, the very old, the young, the middle-aged; and I have  thought: One of the things I love about Italy is that the old are not despised.  And each Italian knows -- it is knowledge bred in the bone -- that he must die.  </P> <P> "There are plenty more where we came from," Vidal says.  </P> <P> "At my age," he says, "nobody is afraid of death. I think what you're afraid of  is the passage to it. I think I might take a shortcut."  </P> <P> I protest. Suicide sets a bad example, I say; and it is contagious. "There are  plenty more where we came from," he says.  </P> <P> JUST DOWN THE street, his servant is buying tangerines. The shop is brightly  lighted. The warm air is threaded with cold. In the piazza of the Pantheon,  everyone looks at home in his skin. The thin music of a flute comes from a  wandering musician. Lovers hold hands.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 500 MARCHERS PROTEST VERDICT IN MCMARTIN CASE  </P> <P> Several hundred residents, some pushing strollers and carrying signs and bumper  stickers declaring "We Believe the Children," marched through the streets of  downtown Manhattan Beach Saturday evening to protest the not-guilty verdicts 10  days ago in the McMartin Pre-School case.  </P> <P> Organizers said they planned the "children's rights" protest soon after a  Superior Court jury ended the 6-year-old case by clearing Ray Buckey and his  mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation charges. The jurors  could not reach a verdict on 13 other charges.  </P> <P> "The crime that occurred inside the courtroom was almost equal to the crime  that occurred outside the courtroom," Tim Wheeler, the father of two former  McMartin pupils, told about 500 cheering supporters at a rally after the  mile-long march.  </P> <P> Wheeler said parents have not lost faith in their children and continue to  believe that they were abused at McMartin and other South Bay preschools closed  in the face of child molestation allegations in the early 1980s. A major  question during the lengthy McMartin case became the degree of reliability of  evidence taken from children.  </P> <P> The marchers began at the Manhattan Beach police station, where the child  molestation allegations against Buckey, his mother and others at McMartin first  were reported.  </P> <P> Joggers and bicyclists on the Strand and patrons of the crowded cafes along  Manhattan Beach Boulevard shouted encouragement to the marchers. The dozens of  children in the group tied pink and yellow ribbons on fire hydrants, street  signs and car door handles along the route.  </P> <P> "I think the jury did what they thought was best," said protest spokeswoman  Elizabeth Aleccia. "I think the judge did an excellent job too. I think the  system itself is what failed. It made the children feel like they were to  blame."  </P> <P> Aleccia said her daughter, 14, was molested several years ago at another  Manhattan Beach preschool that is now closed. The girl "felt physically ill"  when she heard the verdicts, Aleccia said.  </P> <P> Christine O'Rourke of Redondo Beach said that, even though she does not have  children, she attended the march because she is tired of young people being  mishandled by the courts.  </P> <P> "When I heard the verdict I could hardly breathe," O'Rourke said. "This march  is not aimed at putting this case behind us. We're ensuring that it doesn't  happen again."  </P></p>

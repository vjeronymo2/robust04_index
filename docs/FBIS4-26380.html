			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- China's total of  exchange lines will reach 140 million by the end of this  century, becoming one of the world's largest telecommunications  networks, said Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of posts and  telecommunications, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA here  today.    He said that by the year 2000, the country will have all the  telecommunications techniques that exist in the world, and be  able to provide all the telecommunications services available  elsewhere in the world.    The modern telecommunications infrastructure, aiming to  provide an information super-highway for the national economy,  will have a considerable scale, he said.    The minister said that compared with Western countries,  China  is spared the pain of eliminating out-dated equipment, due to  its not- so-developed telecommunications infrastructure. As a  result, China's telecommunications construction can leap over  some development stages and technical levels which the Western  countries had gone through, and directly adopt highly efficient  new technology and equipment.    He said that the foreign technology introduced must be of  advanced level and suited to China's needs, [in] trying to  develop China's own electronic telecommunications industry with  the help of introduced technology.    In the construction of optical cables, China is aiming at  the  world's most advanced technology, Wu said, adding that the  world's most advanced optical cable network will be constructed  along the Tianjin-Shenyang-Dalian line.    He said that all the capital cities in China, except Lhasa,  will be connected by optical cables by June 1995. City and  county telecommunication bureaus will also enter the national  network.    Some 17 more major optical cables, to add to the present 22,  will be constructed by the year 2000 to intensify the  telecommunications coverage and take Lhasa and other cities in  Tibet into the network, Wu said.    China is adopting the automatic exchange switch system  directly, overleaping several stages of technological  development in other parts of the world, he said, adding that  some 89 percent of the exchange switches for urban  telecommunication systems in the country and 99 percent for long  distance calls are computerized.    The number of exchange switches increased by 12 million to  42  million last year, which is unprecedented in any other county,  according to Wu.    China will keep up the annual increase of 10 million  automatic exchange switches till the end of the century,  building the largest and most advanced telecommunication  networks in the world, he added.    Wu said the Chinese Government is paying increasing  attention  to the projects on national public information networks,  electronic currency and foreign trade and economic information  networks in order to meet the demand of China's economic  development and its entry into the world market.    He said that this would inevitably stimulate the growth of  the telecommunications infrastructure.    Wu said his ministry will continue the exchanges and  cooperation with foreign telecommunications giants in an effort  to import state- of-the-art technology, like high-speed optical  telecommunications system, digital mobile telecommunications and  network control system.</p>

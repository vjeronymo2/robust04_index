			<p>BFN     [Text] For the time being, FRG Interior Minister Kanther  does not plan to ban the right-wing extremist Republikaner. He  does not think that an application for a ban to the Federal  Constitutional Court would have a chance. The material that the  constitutional protection officers have collected on the party  so far is not sufficient for a ban, Kanther said. Instead, he  recommended struggling against the Repulikaner with political  means and ostracizing them in society.</p>

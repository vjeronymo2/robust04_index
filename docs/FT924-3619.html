			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK Car Registrations NISSAN Motor, the Japanese carmaker, is regaining ground it lost in the new car market last year during its prolonged legal conflict with Nissan UK, its privately owned former importer-distributor, Kevin Done writes. A year ago Nissan's share fell to only 2.3 per cent of the UK market, but by last month it had more than doubled its share to 5.5 per cent, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. Nissan took over direct control of its UK dealer network from the beginning of 1992 after dismissing its former distributor. Volkswagen of Germany is also recovering, helped by growing sales of its new-generation Golf. The Golf range accounted for 2.4 per cent of the car market in November, compared with only 1.3 per cent a year ago. That allowed the Volkswagen marque to capture 4.4 per cent of new car sales last month compared with 3.1 per cent a year ago. The VW group has also been helped by the success of Audi, its executive car division. The Vauxhall Cavalier and Rover 200 were the two best-selling cars in the UK in November, reflecting in part the growing weakness of Ford, the UK market leader, whose Escort fell to third place in November compared with first in the first 11 months.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 UK CAR REGISTRATIONS -

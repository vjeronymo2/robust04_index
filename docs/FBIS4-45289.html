			<p>BFN     [Text] In the last six months Peruvian Army, Air Force, and  National Police drug enforcement units located more than 100  clandestine airstrips in Upper Huallaga from where drug  "corporations" have been sending washed cocaine base to new  processing sites in the Andean Trapezium [an area in southern  Peru that includes Puno, Cusco, and Apurimac Departments and  parts of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, and Junin Departments] and  elsewhere in Peru.    The Army has used dynamite to destroy most of these illegal  airstrips, especially those with concrete runways. In other  cases either bulldozers or just picks and shovels were used to  tear up the landing strips.    Undercover agents who have infiltrated drug gangs have been  reporting, however, that the traffickers reopen at least a  quarter of the landing strips government forces destroy and are  constantly building new ones.  <H5>  Huanuco </H5>   According to information obtained in Leoncio Prado (Huanuco  Department) after Operation Aries, the drug "corporations" use  hundreds of peasants enslaved by the Shining Path [SL] to  rebuild these landing strips.    For example: 36 illegal landing strips have been destroyed  in Huanuco Department along the Frijol, Azul, Megote, Magdalena  and Camote Rivers and in the jungle areas of Santa Marta, La  Union, La Morada, Molope, Yanajanca, Cachicoto, Monzon, Santa  Rosa, Santa Martha, Primavera, Pavayacu, Bajo Sucre, San Pedro  de Chonta, Alto Huanuco, Cascarilla, Paraiso, and Alto Alianza.    Right now planes are operating again from the illegal  landing  strips in Monzon, Cachicoto, Santa Rosa, San Pedro de Chota,  Pavayacu, and Alto Huanuco, although the presence of Huallaga  Front military forces tracking fleeing members of the broken-up  Red Sea Battalion is hampering the flights.  <H5>  San Martin </H5>   Intelligence sources reported that 42 clandestine landing  strips built between 1985 and 1990 in San Martin Department with  the connivance of the political and military of that time have  been destroyed.    According to the sources, the attack on the drug  "corporations" began in 1991 because previous raids within the  framework of the so-called Operation Verde Mar [Green Sea] were  aimed at the "small fry" of the drug trade.    These landing strips were located in Ramal de Aspuzana, Alto  Uchiza, Alto Manteca, San Francisco, El Cairo, Quebrada de  Huachipa, Puerto Pizana, Polvora, Huicungo, Pachiza, Pucaypillo,  Bello Horizonte, Alto Aspuzana, Alto Espino, Cruz Pampa,  Cachiyacu, Huacamayo, Sion, Campanilla, Dos de Mayo, Barranca,  and Yanayacu. There also were landing strips along a branch of  the Puerto Pizana-Polvora Highway and along the banks of the  Balsayacu and Canuto Rivers. Washed cocaine base arrived at  these strips on rafts and motorboats.  <H5>  Ucayali </H5>   It has been reported that eight landing strips that were  being used not only to ship drugs but also to supply arms to the  MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] and the SL have been  destroyed in Ucayali.    These strips were located in Santa Ana, Aguaytia, Boqueron,  and Chumbillo and along a branch of the Federico Basadre Highway  near Pampas village. The latter strip has been destroyed  repeatedly, but the latest reports indicate that it is  apparently back in service.  <H5>  Loreto </H5>   Drug enforcement forces have destroyed 18 landing strips in  Loreto Department where chemical precursors are brought in from  Bolivia to turn washed cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride  at portable processing facilities.    These landing strips that the jungle has now swallowed were  located on the banks of the Putumayo and Napo Rivers and their  tributaries, and near San Fernando (Caballococha), Yanahuana (on  the Colombian border), Bellavista, Jerusalen, Yaguas, Huapaya,  Mishana, Remanso, Estrecho, Genaro Herrera, Baguzon, San Jose de  Yanayacu, Icarapana, and Vidal (where the Napo-Flor de Agosto  Highway begins). The landing strips in Flor de Punga-Requena and  Tumbipoca-Amazon River valleys also were destroyed. In the  process of the latter operations drug enforcement forces clashed  with some drug traffickers, whom they arrested.  <H5>  New and Reopened Landing Strips </H5>   According to recent reports, however, the landing strips in  Yanahuana on the Colombian border, Bellavista, and the Flor de  Punga-Requena and Tumbipoca-Amazon River valleys are back in  service.    It is also rumored that Colombian drug "corporations" have  had several new landing strips built on the Ucayali River's  banks and in the jungle of Madre de Dios Department, where  cocaine-processing laboratories operate.    Experts have indicated that gold prospectors who work along  the Tambopata River's banks are hired to build the new landing  strips.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Afghanistan's envoy to India said Afghanistan is prepared to attack Afghan  guerrilla bases in neighboring Pakistan unless the rebels stop their rocket  barrages on Kabul, the capital. Ambassador Abdul Samad Azhar told a New Delhi  news conference that 65 rockets struck Kabul on Monday, killing 18 civilians  and injuring 130. "If we have no choice, we will retaliate and we will attack  the bases in Pakistan," he said. There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan,  which has brushed off previous warnings.  </P></p>

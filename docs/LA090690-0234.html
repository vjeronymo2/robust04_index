			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT REVERSES POLICY ON DRUG EXTRADITIONS  </P> <P> In a major turnaround in Colombia's anti-drug strategy, President Cesar Gaviria  has announced that cocaine traffickers who surrender will not be extradited to  the United States.  </P> <P> The new president said his decree Wednesday is part of a plan to end  drug-related terrorism.  </P> <P> A year-old war between the government and traffickers fighting extradition has  left hundreds of people dead.  </P> <P> "Those who have been in crime and who have repented, and who voluntarily turn  themselves in to judges in order to freely confess their crimes, may be tried  by our judges based on our judicial order," Gaviria said in a nationally  televised speech Wednesday night.  </P> <P> In July, the Medellin cocaine cartel declared a unilateral cease-fire in its  terrorist attacks, apparently hoping that the new Administration would end  extraditions.  </P> <P> Gaviria, who was inaugurated Aug. 7, said in his speech that criminals who turn  themselves in will also face lighter sentences.  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Nippon Steel in Pounds 98m loss NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steel company, yesterday announced that it would post at least Y15bn (Pounds 98m) in pre-tax losses for the year because of the prolonged economic slump and the sharp appreciation of the yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company had earlier hoped for a pre-tax profit of Y20bn. Other steelmakers - Kobe, Kawasaki, NKK and Sumitomo Metal Industries - are scheduled to revise forecasts on Friday. Mr Shigeru Omori, Nippon Steel's vice-president, admitted the losses would be greater, but for realisation of profits from its securities portfolio. It will skip its interim dividend. Sales for the first half are expected to fall 8 per cent to Y1,090bn. The company revised its forecast for first-half year losses down from Y5bn to Y15bn. For the second half, Mr Omori said: 'The best our company can hope for is to post no profits but no losses either.' In 1992-93 pre-tax profits plunged by 71.2 per cent to Y28.9bn.</p>

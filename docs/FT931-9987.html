			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Investor group plans to take stake in Banesto A GROUP of investors led by JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is to take a stake of between 7 per cent and 10 per cent in Banesto, Spain's third-largest bank, as part of a Pta53bn (Dollars 452m) rights issue being prepared by the Spanish bank. JP Morgan's recently closed Dollars 1bn Corsair banking fund, and Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's chairman, will form the core of the investor group. The US bank has guaranteed that its group will invest Dollars 200m in the rights issue. Mr Conde's inclusion will raise his personal stake in Banesto from 2 per cent to up to 4.5 per cent. If the rights issue, one of the largest in Spain, is fully taken up and if Banesto's efforts to sell its affiliate, Banco de Madrid, to Deutsche Bank of Germany, are successful, Banesto will have rid itself of a cloud under which it has been forced to operate for nearly three years. The bank would then fall comfortably within the Bank of Spain's strict guidelines on the relationship between its capital and its exposure to industry. 'This is a lifesaver for the bank,' said Mr Juan Bastos, chief executive of the Madrid securities house, Gestemar. The issue is viewed by some as a bid by Banesto to gain manoeuvrability at a time when it is reducing its profits and seeking to dispose of its industrial assets in a depressed market. Under the terms of the three-for-one rights issue, JP Morgan will place shares with the investor group at Pta1,900 per share. In all, 35.11m new shares are being offered at a premium of Pta800 per share. In addition to the increased capital, Banesto would gain an important psychological lift through JP Morgan's endorsement of its business potential. The investor group is understood to have committed itself to stay with the bank for at least five years, and JP Morgan is likely to be given a seat on the Banesto board. JP Morgan issued a highly positive report on the Spanish bank before Christmas. 'Morgan is putting its money where its mouth is,' one Madrid analyst commented yesterday. Banesto reported a 27 per cent fall in its net profits during 1992 to Pta45.6bn due to a sharp drop in extraordinary income from disposals. It was nevertheless able to report a 17 per cent increase in the gross operating profit of its banking business, which totalled Pta119.6bn Having sold its industrial assets in oil refining and cement in the past two years, Banesto is now seeking buyers for its holdings in Acerinox, the major domestic stainless steel producer, and in Union Carburos, its industrial gases group. This strategy, which seeks a more reduced and flexible industrial portfolio, complements Banesto's attempts to improve income from its core financial sector.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Observer: Moving down Tut, tut. Observer hears that estate agents Healey &amp; Baker are trying to let some 'outstanding offices' on the 7th floor of the plush Lansdowne House in London's Berkeley Square. Is not this the nerve-centre of Charles and Maurice Saatchi, the advertising men who helped the Tories win the election? It sounds as if the bean counters running Saatchi &amp; Saatchi are trying to squeeze every last cent out of their assets and the brothers are going to have to do their bit. While the rest of the Saatchi advertising machine has long since decamped to cheaper premises, Charles and Maurice have held out in their palatial Lansdowne House offices. However, it seems that they may well soon be moving out. Healey &amp; Baker are offerring the offices for Pounds 42.40 a square foot, which is a good Pounds 20 less than Saatchi paid in the heady days of 1988. Any offers?</p>

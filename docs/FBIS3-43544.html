			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economic Upswing in Sight"] </F>   [Text] Attempts to create a favorable investment climate in  Namibia have created very promising economic prospects for the  next two years and beyond, according to the minister of Trade  and Industry, Mr. Hidipo Hamutenya. In his year-end review of  developments in the Namibian economy since independence and  prospects for recovery in the immediate future, Mr. Hamutenya  pointed out that there are "very positive prospects for an  economic upswing in the next two years and beyond," with new  investments totalling more than N[Namibian] $700 million to be  launched this year. Mr. Hamutenya says that the new investments  of more than N$700 million represents 15 percent of 140  projects, ideas, proposals, and profiles presented by potential  investors to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Areas of  interest in industrial investment ranges from cement, clothing,  the manufacturing of plastics, vehicle assembly plants, mining  activities, and fertilizer production.    Mr. Hamutenya said in the review that 165 delegations of  potential and real investors visited Namibia in 1993, compared  to 26 in 1992. He stated that the increasing international  interest in the Namibian economy is accompanied, however, by a  "disturbing tendency towards protectionism by Namibian  businessmen." As examples of this he cited recent controversies  surrounding investment plans by Pick &amp; Pay, Olympia Reisen,  City  Savings and Investment Bank, and the South African Breweries.  "It is sad that many potential investors leave the country  discouraged by the negative attitudes they encounter in the  local business community. Namibia's true interest is served by  expansion, not the restriction of economic activities in the  country, and it is such expansion of production lines and trade  which holds positive prospects for medium-term economic  recovery."    He points out that insufficient new investment by existing  local companies since independence has hurt the country's  economic development. Mr. Hamutenya says that while it is fair  to say that this lack of investment by local companies does not  indicate a lack of trust in the new political order, it is also  true that apart from the fishing industry, there has not been  any significant local investment since independence. "In other  words, except for the exchange of assets, concerning the  depreciation of existing capital stocks, very few of the  existing companies made any new substantial investments since  independence." Mr. Hamutenya added that the next three years  will be a period in which the analyses and policy compiled since  independence will be implemented in tangible projects. This  includes land reforms and the rationalization of the civil  service, two of the most important outstanding issues to be  addressed by government.    "Land reforms are central to the objective of fair economic  development." One of his main aims is to find "a reasonable and  fair way in which to transfer land from those who have too much  of it, to those who do not have it." The government is aware  that land is the most fundamental form of ownership and that the  issue could have negative socioeconomic and political  consequences if it is not addressed. The minister says that for  this reason the government looked earnestly at viable options to  resolve existing imbalances concerning access to land.    Mr. Hamutenya said that the rationalization of the civil  service is also essential for the reduction of "what is  obviously intolerable" -- namely, the level of continuous  government expenditure. "For the medium-term the government is  refocusing its budgetary policy to promote the growth of  productive economic investment". He also indicated that 1994  will be the year for ensuring that practical economic benefits  are reaped from investments.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Policies 'promote business start-ups' BOTH THE UK and Germany have experienced substantial growth in self-employment but the increase has been most dynamic in the UK, according to a report from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial Society, a charitable group. In its report, the group, which seeks to promote closer understanding between the UK and Germany, compares the phenomenon of self-employment in both countries and examines common characteristics and differences. The report says the UK economic and policy climate promotes start-ups, while that in Germany favours maintaining those already self-employed. Policymakers need to understand the implications of self-employment for the labour market, it says. Self-Employment in the UK and Germany.

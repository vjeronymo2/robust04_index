			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Karstadt edges ahead Karstadt, Germany's biggest retailer following the recent purchase of Hertie, yesterday reported slightly improved annual earnings of DM226.8m (Dollars 137.4m), up from DM224.1m in 1993. Group turnover in the first five months of this year soared by 31.7 per cent compared with the previous year, to DM11bn, helped by strong demand for tourist services. Turnover in 1993 rose to DM13.3bn, up from DM12.2bn the year before. The dividend is increased by DM1 to DM13. However, Mr Walter Deuss, chief executive, underlined warnings given by competitors that the retail market was still in a 'recession' despite forecast economic growth. 'Given the only slight change in the number of unemployed there is no sign of a fundamental improvement in the consumer climate,' Mr Deuss said. The company spent about DM1.6bn earlier this year to buy Hertie, Germany's third biggest retailer, but said it would take about five years to integrate the two groups fully.</p>

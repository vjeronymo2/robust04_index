			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Major to reassure Yeltsin over air strikes Mr John Major will seek to persuade Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, that threatened air strikes against Serbian forces do not signal a break with the west's commitment to a negotiated settlement in Bosnia. British officials said Mr Major, who arrives in Moscow on Monday for two days of talks with the Russian government, would tell Mr Yeltsin that there was no question of Nato 'taking sides' in the civil war. Amid anger in Moscow over the Nato ultimatum, Mr Major will stress his view that US commitment to a more active role in the search for a settlement will enhance the prospects of an agreement. He will also emphasise the limited nature of the threat to use military force against the Serbian forces besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. In spite of denials from Downing Street, senior British ministers confirmed yesterday that Britain had backed the Nato warning to the Serbs only under intense pressure from the US administration. Mr Major plans to deliver a calculated snub to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic party, during his visit. Officials said that representatives of all the main parties in the Russian parliament had been invited to meet Mr Major at a reception at the British embassy - except Mr Zhirinovsky. In spite of the British prime minister's determination to emphasise western support for Mr Yeltsin, he will deliver a firm warning that the Russian leader must not slow the pace of economic reform. Mr Major will also signal his desire for faster progress towards a market economy by holding talks with Mr Yegor Gaidar. Mr Gaidar, the architect of the reform process, last month refused to serve in Mr Yeltsin's government. Officials said that Mr Major wanted to reinforce the message delivered last month by President Bill Clinton of the US that western financial support for President Yeltsin depends on the reform process continuing. The British prime minister is expected to sign new political and economic agreements to strengthen ties between the two countries. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, plans to combine the Moscow trip with a meeting with the leaders of the three Baltic states in the Latvian capital of Riga. This is said by officials to be the first visit by any foreign secretary to the Baltic states.</p>

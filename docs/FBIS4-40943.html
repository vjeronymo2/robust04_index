			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 21 ITAR-TASS -- More than one-third of  Russians polled in a recent survey by the Public Opinion Fund  said it is in the interests of the country to reunify Russia  with other former Soviet republics in one state. But one-fourth  of the respondents in the poll said they were against any  reunification with any country.    Asked what countries should be given preference in the  unification process, three percent favored Azerbaijan, four  percent Armenia, 24 percent Belarus, four percent Georgia, 13  percent Kazakhstan, three percent Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], four  percent Latvia, three percent Lithuania, eight percent Moldavia,  four percent Tajikistan, three percent Turkmenia, four percent  Uzbekistan, 24 per cent Ukraine and three percent Estonia.    Thirty-four percent called for reunification with all former  Soviet republics.    Only 13 percent of those polled were uncertain.    The poll of 1200 respondents was conducted in June, and its  results were published in the BUSINESS WORLD WEEKLY on Tuesday.</p>

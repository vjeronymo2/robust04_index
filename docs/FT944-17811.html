			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Mitsubishi enters bidding for S Wales region of British Coal Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, has joined the bidding to take over British Coal mining assets when the state company is privatised this year. Its participation in a bid for the south Wales region is a boost for the privatisation, which has largely failed to attract the involvement of overseas companies in spite of worldwide marketing. Mitsubishi is only the second foreign company to be a confirmed bidder for any of the five regions on offer. The other is Alcan Aluminium of Canada, which is bidding for British Coal's north-east England region in partnership with Ryan Group of the UK. Mitsubishi is joining Taylor Woodrow, the UK construction company, and Kier Mining, a UK coal company, to bid. Taylor Woodrow confirmed the joint venture yesterday, although Mitsubishi was unable to comment. Mitsubishi, Taylor Woodrow and Kier are thought to have roughly equal stakes in the venture. Mitsubishi has wide industrial interests including coal. It is involved in Australian mining through its Mitsubishi Development subsidiary and in UK coal trading through Mitsubishi Corporation Coal Sales. Taylor Woodrow has been involved in UK mining since the 1940s and has opencast interests in south Wales and Northumberland. The combination of the two companies, together with the much smaller Kier Mining, presents a powerful bidding partnership for British Coal's most popular region in the privatisation. The confirmation of the bid means that at least eight companies or consortia are bidding for the nine opencast sites in south Wales, whereas the central England regions - where virtually all of the deep mines are based - are thought to have attracted just three or four serious bidders each. Wales is attractive because of the relative abundance of high-quality coal near the surface. British Coal produces about 2.4m tonnes a year from the region, all of it from opencast sites. Although south Wales has smaller coal sale contracts than other regions, National Power, the electricity generator, wants long-term deals from the post-privatisation owner to supply its Aberthaw power station. It has already signed a 10-year deal with Ryan Group for 1.5m tonnes of coal a year from south Wales. The deal is conditional on Ryan's winning the bid for the region.</p>

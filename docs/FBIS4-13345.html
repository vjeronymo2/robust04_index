			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cairo AKHBAR AL-YAWM in Arabic on 9  April carries on its front page a 500-word summary of the  results of a public opinion poll commissioned by AKHBAR AL-YAWM  and carried out by the Administrative Development Center of  Alexandria University's Commerce College. The poll deals with  Egypt's regional policy, particularly its relations with Israel  following the Cold War.    On pages 3 through 6 the paper carries a 3,000-word report,  illustrated with graphics, listing the questions and answers in  the poll. On page 4 the paper writes:    "This is the second time--the first was during the vote on a  third presidential term--that the public opinion unit of the  Administrative Development Center in the Commerce College of  Alexandria University and AKHBAR AL-YAWM has cooperated in  exploring public views on the strategy that Egypt should follow  in light of new developments taking place during a critical  juncture in the history of the Middle East."    The paper notes that the poll was designed to shed light on  the public response to an article by Chief Editor Ibrahim Sa'dah  published on 26 January 1994 under the headline "Welcome to  Challenge." The article was followed by a debate in the same  paper among writers assessing the implications of the peace  process. Sa'dah, the paper recalls, sees a "challenge" in which  the country has to choose among the following courses:    "1. Holding on to the cold peace with Israel until a  comprehensive, just, and acceptable peace is achieved in the  Arab region.    "2. Turning the cold peace into a warm one and fully and  promptly normalizing political and economic relations between  Egypt and Israel, in view of the urgency with which others are  moving to normalize their relations with Israel in one form or  another.    "3. [Selecting a course lying within] the spectrum defined  by the two above-mentioned options."    The pollsters, the paper explains, sent a three-part  questionnaire to "a random sampling of 5,000 individuals from  various parts of the country."    To a question in part one of the questionnaire, 4,879  respondents, or 98 percent, say they read Sa'dah's article.  Some 3,335 respondents, or 81 percent, say they agree with  Sa'dah's call for "a new thinking in Egypt's relations with the  countries in the region, including Israel."    To questions in part two of the questionnaire, 3,885  respondents, or 94 percent, say they are "ready to get over the  scars of Arab-Israeli relations and transcend the pain of the  war." Those who are not ready to forget the past number 230, or  6 percent.    Those who believe that "transforming relations between Egypt  and Israel into warm cooperation is conditional on the signing  by all parties of the peace agreements" number 3,250. Those who  do not see a need for such a condition to be made number 865.  [percentages not given]    Some 3,916 respondents, or 95 percent, think that "Egypt's  relations, communications, and cooperation with the countries of  the region without exception should be conducted publicly."  Those who do not share this belief number 199, or 5 percent.    Agreeing that "Israel's repeated aggression reflects  negatively on relations among the countries of the region" are  3,257 respondents, while 858 disagree. [percentages not given]    Some 3,315 respondents, or 81 percent, believe that "the  emergence of a Palestinian entity in accordance with the recent  agreement will have a positive effect on relations within the  region," while 800, or 19 percent, disagree.    Those who believe that Egypt should "wait for the features  of  the new international order to take clear shape before it  changes its current policy of maintaining a `cold peace' with  Israel" number 261, while 3,845 respondents think that Egypt  should not wait for this to happen. [percentages not given]    Disagreeing with Menachem Begin's view that "peace could be  achieved with Jewish brains and Arab money" are 3,969  respondents, or 96 percent. Some 146 respondents, or 4 percent,  agree with Begin.    Some 688 respondents, or 17 percent, think that Israel  "should disavow its `from the Nile to the Euphrates' claim as a  condition for cooperation and joint efforts." Those who see no  need for Israel to disavow such a claim number 3,427, or 83  percent.    Agreeing that "the Egyptian role in building a new regional  peace and security system will diminish" are 154 respondents,  while 3961 do not believe in a diminished Egyptian regional  role. [percentages not given]    Those who believe that Egypt "has dealt efficiently with the  challenges of peace so far" number 3,416, or 83 percent.    Some 3,586 respondents "believe they have stopped  classifying  countries in the region into foes and friends," while 529 still  adhere to this categorization. [percentages not given]    In the third part of the questionnaire, the respondents are  asked the question: "What are the issues that you believe the  important dialogue [commentaries written by intellectuals in  response to Sa'dah's article] has left out?" The respondents  cite the following issues:    "1. The ability of the leaderships in the region to  understand the new developments and deal with them intelligently  and prudently.    "2. The water problem.    "3. Disarmament and regional mutual security arrangements.    "4. GATT and its effect on Egypt and the region and the  interaction of economic relations in the area."</p>

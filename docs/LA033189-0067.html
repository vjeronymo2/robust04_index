			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST FELINES  </P> <P> The reason for the small number of cats among White House pets ("White House  Cats: Why So Doggone Few?" by Kathleen Hendrix, March 27) should really be  quite obvious. The White House is a residence for a politician, and a  politician likes to control a situation, to be in charge, to give orders, and  to be obeyed. A dog is an ideal subject for such a benign dictator, being  cheerful, loyal and not at all questioning. A cat, on the other hand, chooses  to walk by itself, obedient to no man -- unless it suits the cat.  </P> <P> Never forget that essential oxymoron: My cat.  </P> <P> CLEMENT SALVADORI  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

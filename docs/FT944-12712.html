			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Chemicals - Other markets Following ICI's third-quarter figures, which drew a dull response from the London stock market last Thursday, three continental European majors produce their progress reports this week. DSM, which built its business on the ruins of the Dutch coal mining industry, is like ICI in that it is highly involved in the commodity chemical part of the business and will benefit most from a strong recovery in prices for a number of petrochemical and plastics products since August, says Hoare Govett. The broker expects DSM's sales to rise to Fl 2.3bn from Fl 1.9bn, compared with the third quarter of 1993, and pre-tax profits to come out at Fl 138m against a corresponding loss of Fl 79m. It says that prospects for the last quarter are even better, as in this period the third-quarter price increases will be reflected fully in the results. Goldman Sachs, too, has produced a sector preview in which it says that Akzo Nobel, which combined its Dutch and Swedish components last year, should bring net third-quarter earnings of around Fl 330m into its figures on Wednesday, up from Fl 247m the year before, the rate of increase easing from 48 per cent in the second quarter to over 30 per cent in the third. Goldman says that investors will be looking for any evidence of pressure on margins from cost increases further upstream. Both brokers expect Rhone-Poulenc, due on Thursday, to show figures which bring it out of loss for the first time this year. Hoare Govett reckons that an increase in operating margins from 6.8 per cent in the third quarter of 1993 to close on 10 per cent should produce net attributable profits of some FFr465m, against a loss of FFr300m in the year-earlier period. Meanwhile, Goldman expects moderate out-performance from the French stock, saying that its apparently poor earnings performance in the first half of 1994 reflected erratic non-operating items; and that at operating level, and excluding exceptional items, Rhone-Poulenc's experience should have been in line with its peers.</p>

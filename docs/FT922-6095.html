			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Banks asked to provide Pounds 500m for Canary Wharf BANKERS to Canary Wharf are being asked to provide another Pounds 500m loan facility to keep the project owned by Olympia &amp; York Developments out of the hands of the receivers and to build the Jubilee Line Underground extension to Docklands. This is far more than the banks originally hoped they would have to provide. However, bankers said yesterday they were cautiously optimistic that the loan package would be approved. The 11 banks, which include Citibank of the US, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Credit Lyonnais of France, Royal Bank of Canada, and Barclays and Lloyds of the UK, are reconciled to honouring O&amp;Y's agreement with the UK government to provide Pounds 400m towards the costs of extending the Jubilee Line. On the other hand, they are counting on the government to rent 500,000 square feet of office space at Canary Wharf for more than 2,000 civil servants. 'We need the government to sign up for the space at the same time as we sign the loan agreement', said a banker. Bankers have been persuaded by the government that it cannot subsidise the project by taking the space at an uneconomic rent. However, they believe the Pounds 15 a square foot price being offered is a commercial rate. The government's negotiations with the banks are being co-ordinated, on behalf of the prime minister, by Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal. A banker involved in the negotiations admitted the Canary Wharf lenders faced sizeable losses on the loans they had already made to the project. 'But there is a good chance that over a 10-year period we might recoup some of those losses if Canary Wharf is kept afloat', he said. To date, banks have provided a core loan of Pounds 566m to Canary Wharf and a finance lease of Pounds 58m. There is also a separate Pounds 450m loan from four Canadian banks and Pounds 100m from the European Investment Bank. The 11 bank creditors must at the very least agree to provide Canary Wharf with an additional interim loan facility of Pounds 20m by the end of the week if the company is to avoid filing for insolvency protection in the UK. Their plan would be to approve the full Pounds 500m by mid-June. The Pounds 500m has two elements: Pounds 300m is needed to furnish the buildings, provide inducements to potential tenants, complete the small amount of construction work outstanding on phases 1 and 2 of the project and pay the Pounds 100m first two tranches of O&amp;Y's contribution to the costs of building the Jubilee Underground line. Another Pounds 200m is required to meet interest payments to banks on existing loans. However, the banks will try to find outside investors who would refinance individual Canary Wharf properties. If they succeed, the Pounds 200m facility would still be needed as a guarantee to these outside investors that their interest will be paid.

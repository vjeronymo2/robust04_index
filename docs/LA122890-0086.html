			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ISRAEL;  </P> <P> EXPULSION OF FOUR PALESTINIANS BARRED  </P> <P> The Israeli Supreme Court temporarily barred the expulsion of four Palestinians  suspected of being leaders of the Muslim fundamentalist Hamas movement in the  occupied territories. Lawyers for the four, from the Gaza Strip, had argued  that the expulsions would violate the Fourth Geneva Convention on treatment of  prisoners under occupation. The expulsions will be delayed until the court  completes its deliberations.  </P></p>

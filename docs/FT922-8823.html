			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (4): Nottingham's pupil - Towards a new university LEADERS OF Lincolnshire's public and private sectors are trying to grasp an opportunity they lost a generation ago, and which probably will not recur for another generation. It is to set up a new university. The broad lines of how this will be done are now clear. The detail of the planning will be evident by the summer. The university will be based on one or more of the existing colleges of higher education. It will start as a university college, under the wing of either Nottingham Polytechnic or Nottingham University, and then, by the end of the decade or early in the next, it will strike off as an independent institution. The origins of this attempt came out of thinking among local business leaders, and first emerged in a 1990 report of the Confederation of British Industry. Business leaders were worried that the intellectual flower of the county tended to bloom outside. They wanted more young people to stay, to provide the intellectual stimulus for local business. They wanted the commercial benefits which can spin out of a strong relationship between industry and the academic world. The first thought was that the university would be a private sector venture and, indeed, there were talks with the University of Buckingham about how it might be brought about. But as local interest in the project grew and the public authorities became involved, the running was taken over by the Lincolnshire County Council. This resulted in a switch away from an exclusively private sector approach to an examination of ways in which a university of more orthodox background might emerge. It became clear that the easiest way was to invite an institution from the outside to foster the new university. The examination came at a good time. Not only are student numbers increasing sharply and expected to do so for the rest of the decade, but the methods of financing students are changing; so that, instead of travelling hither and thither to study, they are more likely to stay in the area of their home. Lincolnshire County Council invited half a dozen interested tertiary educational institutions to make public presentations of how they would develop the existing county educational system so that, in a few years, a new university might emerge. From these six, Nottingham Polytechnic and Nottingham University have been chosen for detailed negotiations. At the end of July, one of these two will be chosen to give birth to the new university. Largely because it has been made clear there will be no government funding to help this process, the search will shortly begin for commercial sponsors of the university. Both the Nottingham institutions believe it will take around Pounds 30m to set it up. If there is a shortfall, there will be some resort to the money markets. But Lincolnshire County Council itself may provide help: it is one of only two local authorities in the UK to be free of debt and, at the same time, it has substantial landholdings.</p>

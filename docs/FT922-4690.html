			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Seagram's drinks profits ahead SEAGRAM, one of the world's largest drinks groups, says its international spirits and wine business improved profit in the first quarter ended April 30 because of a broad restructuring, especially in Europe, and a sharper focus on premium and core brands. But overall group net income slipped to USDollars 167m, or 44 cents a share, from Dollars 188m, or 50 cents a share, in the 1991 first quarter. 'Margins continued to improve despite the lost contribution of divested brands and difficult economic conditions in North America, Europe, Japan and Brazil,' said Mr Edgar Bronfman Sr, chairman. The Tropicana fruit juice unit turned in a strong performance but operating income was negatively affected by heavy investment in international expansion. Seagram, one of the world's top four drinks groups, said sales dipped to Dollars 1.24bn from Dollars 1.4bn because of the brand divestments and foreign accounting changes. Final operating income from the drinks and juice businesses was Dollars 166m, against Dollars 165m. Including Dollars 69m dividends received from the Du Pont chemicals giant, owned 25.5 per cent by Seagram, income after taxes was Dollars 120m, or 32 cents a share, up 4.3 per cent from a year earlier. But Seagram also shares in Du Pont's unremitted earnings and these were sharply lower in the quarter because of the impact of the recession on Du Pont's results.</p>

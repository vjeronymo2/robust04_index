			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- The political  crisis facing the Dominican Republic was reflected today in the  explosion of five homemade bombs in various streets of Esperanza  municipality without causing any casualties, the police reported.    The bombs were hurled by hooded individuals and one of them  exploded near the headquarters of the Dominican Revolutionary  Party (PRD) headed by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential  candidate in the 16 May elections who has made accusations of  fraud. A police report said that there were no casualties but  there were several arrests of individuals presumably responsible  for the attacks. The police and Army initiated a surveillance  operation along the streets to prevent another attack.    The political crisis erupted when the elections closed with  the PRD making accusations of a "scandalous fraud" planned by  the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer at the Central  Electoral Board (JCE) computer center.    Tourism representatives reported that numerous trips,  especially from Europe, were suspended because of the news  generated by the crisis facing the country. "The Dominican  Republic political situation is a threat to the tourism industry  which generates substantial revenues for the country," an  important tourism businessman pointed out. The Dominican  Republic is visited by 1.4 million tourists who generate more  than $130 million, the equivalent of 70 percent of its  exportable goods.</p>

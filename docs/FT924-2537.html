			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dasa expecting loss in spite of sales rise MR MANFRED Bischoff, chief financial officer of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace unit of Daimler-Benz, said group sales in 1992 would rise to DM17.3bn (Dollars 10.8bn) from DM12.3bn last year, but it would post a loss, Reuter reports. However, much of the rise in sales would be due to the first-time consolidation of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, the German partner in the Airbus Industrie consortium. Mr Bischoff added that Deutsche Airbus would show a net profit of around DM400m in 1992, down from DM420m.</p>

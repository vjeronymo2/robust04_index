			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The ruling coalition was  moving Monday [17 April] toward selecting Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata as the successor to outgoing Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, political sources said. Representatives of  the coalition will agree Monday afternoon on a policy platform  for the formation of a new government and coalition chiefs are  likely to sign the accord the same day, coalition sources said.    Veteran politician Michio Watanabe, 70, of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who expressed his intention  Sunday to leave the party in a bid for the premiership, hoping  to gain the backing of the ruling coalition, will make a final  decision on the proposed move Monday, faction sources said.    LDP President Yohei Kono Will meet Watanabe again at 1:30  P.M. [0430 GMT] Monday to attempt to dissuade him from leaving  the party, LDP sources said.    Kono, who has himself vowed to run in the Diet election as  his party's official candidate, urged Watanabe on Friday to drop  his ambitions for the premiership in order to maintain party  unity but met with no success.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  [of Japan], the largest party in the seven-party coalition, said  Monday he opposes nominating Watanabe as the coalition's  candidate for premiership, party officials said. He made the  remark at a meeting with Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic  Socialist Party, the officials said.    Murayama also expressed opposition to Watanabe being invited  to join the next cabinet in a position such as deputy prime  minister, they said.    A senior member of the Watanabe faction in the House of  Councillors said Watanabe may not quit the party.    Watanabe said Sunday, "I have a conviction that a cabinet of  national salvation should be formed to overcome the present  difficult situation."    "I could not become (prime minister) only with LDP support.  As I have to ask for the support of many people, I will  naturally renounce my party membership," he said.    But so far, only some 20 LDP members are expected to quit  the  party to follow Watanabe if he decides to make the break.    Meanwhile, five LDP House of Representatives members who  support Watanabe's bid for the premiership quit the party  Monday. They are Seiichi Ota, Taku Yamamoto, Shizuo Sato, Koji  Kakizawa and Shokei Arai. They are members of a suprafactional  study group in the LDP called the "liberals."    Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, quit the party  Monday. He said he will join Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a  key party in the coalition.    Five other LDP lower house members who quit the party  Friday,  led by Michihiko Kano, former director general of the Management  and Coordination Agency, formed a new party Monday called New  Party Mirai (Future).    Fumihiko Igarashi, a lower house member of Hosokawa's Japan  New Party, told reporters he and two other members will quit the  party and act as independents.    Kano hinted that the new five-legislator party may throw its  parliamentary weight behind a prime ministerial candidate who is  backed by the ruling coalition.    Kano expressed his party's willingness to take part in the  ongoing policy-making discussions now under way among the seven  coalition parties. The talks, which began last Saturday, are  aimed at reconciling coalition members' differences in key areas  of policy.    "If we and the ruling coalition could reach an agreement to  share the same policies, then we could cast our ballots to  nominate as the next prime minister a candidate recommended by  the coalition side," he said.    Kano also called on other LDP legislators to join his new  party.    "I call on people who once tried to accomplish political  reform, together with us, to be courageous and take actions in  order to bring about a realignment of the political community,"  he said.    Kano said he "has given high marks to both" Hata and  Watanabe  as able politicians.    He said, "although Mr. Watanabe expressed views different  from ours regarding political reform, I commend him for his  intention" to break with the LDP.    New Party Mirai will advocate as its tenets an emphasis on  the wishes of the public, compliance with public promises,  contributions to U.N.-led peace-building efforts, expansion of  the social infrastructure and transfer of the central  government's administrative authority to local governments,  party officials said.</p>

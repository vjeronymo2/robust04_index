			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC ministers in fresh attempt to end banana row EUROPEAN COMMUNITY farm ministers will tonight make another attempt to reach final agreement on the new banana regime they endorsed in principle last December. After a meeting which began on Tuesday and ran into Thursday morning, the ministers failed to sign off on measures which would set a quota for cheap Latin American banana imports of 2m tonnes, with an Ecu850 per tonne tariff on imports above that level. In December, Germany and Denmark - which at present occupies the EC presidency - opposed the new regime, but the Netherlands and Belgium have since raised objections. In an acrimonious meeting this week, UK agriculture minister Mr John Gummer accused the Dutch and Belgians of reneging on their commitments, while EC farm commissioner Mr Rene Steichen was prepared to keep ministers in Brussels until the March 1 deadline for legal endorsement. Germany will certainly vote against the new regime anyway. But to meet the objections of its allies, the commission said it would: Agree upward adjustments of the quota, in line with market demand, on a regular basis; Give assurances that traditional importers of Latin American bananas would not be prejudiced by the new licensing system in the proposals; And regard any significant price rise as an indication of a shortage which would require a review of the import regime.</p>

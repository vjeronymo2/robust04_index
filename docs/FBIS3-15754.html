			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Russia's call for convening another international  conference on the Middle East in Madrid gained support from the  conflicting sides and from the other cosponsor of the peace  process, the USA. This statement was made at Wednesday's  briefing in Moscow by Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister,  Igor Ivanov, who had just returned from a tour of Mideast  countries.    According to him, "the well-planned action" in Hebron, where  an Israeli settler discharged a submachine gun and killed about  60 Palestinians, "disrupted the entire negotiating process and  inflicted a mortal wound on the emerging understanding." "The  tragedy in Hebron gave rise to a wave of activity among those  who oppose the peace process," the diplomat stressed.    The goal of his mission, he explained, was to evaluate the  situation that took shape in the wake of the tragedy in Hebron,  and discuss the possibility of "reciprocal compromises". "In  the course of contacts the issue of security guarantees in the  occupied territories rose to the foreground," Ivanov said.    The diplomat called for adopting by the U.N. Security  Council  as soon as possible a resolution that would guarantee safety for  the population in the occupied territories, and stipulate  conditions for international presence there. "It's impossible  to resume the negotiating process there at a stroke. A tragedy  has occurred, and old conditions are no longer satisfactory.  What is needed is actions designed to guarantee that such  things will not happen again, and conducive to the  implementation of agreements already reached," he pointed out.</p>

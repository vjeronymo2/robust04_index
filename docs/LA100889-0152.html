			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARRIER REMOVAL FOCUS OF MINE BLAST PROBE  </P> <P> A federal mining investigator contends that a cinder block barrier was removed  illegally from inside a coal mine about 15 minutes before an explosion that  killed 10 people last month.  </P> <P> Michael Finnie, a special investigator for the U.S. Mine Safety and Health  Administration, said in a sworn statement submitted to a court Friday that  removing the barrier disrupted air currents in the Pyro Mining Co. mine,  creating dangerous levels of explosive methane.  </P> <P> Ron Siler, president of Costain Coal Inc., parent to Pyro Mining, said last  month that a barrier was taken down inside the Western Kentucky mine the  morning of the explosion Sept. 13, but he said it was removed after the fatal  blast, not 15 minutes before.  </P> <P> He also contended that removal of the barrier could not have been a factor,  even if it came before the accident.  </P></p>

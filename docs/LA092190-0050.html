			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> UNFULFILLED PROMISES AT CUCINA  </P> <P> Can a restaurant be judged by the art it displays?  </P> <P> This question came to mind recently in Pasadena's Old Town when I was visiting  Amedeo Cucina. In a former incarnation the place was the Italian Fisherman. A  year ago, Amedeo Costantino, the Fisherman's owner, closed down his clubby,  pricey restaurant, gutted the place and reopened as this upscale yet more  casual cucina.  </P> <P> It looks and feels like a corporate exercise in trendiness. There's an open  kitchen. There's ceiling truss. There are pasta and pizza, risotto and  radicchio, carpaccio, too. And there's original art displayed.  </P> <P> I had ample time to study the art one night both before and after the orders  were taken at my table. When we sat down, we'd been given two pretty and tasty  crostini, crisp little toasts topped with chopped tomato and basil, and we ate  them right away. Our hunger piqued, we diverted ourselves at first by looking  around at the other diners, and then at the mid-sized paintings hung about the  room. In their favor, the paintings were unpretentious and earnestly executed.  Otherwise, there wasn't much to recommend the work. "Let's hope the food's  better than the art," my friend said as we waited . . . and waited.  </P> <P> For a while it seemed that we would never get to judge the food. Eventually, a  waiter spoke crossly to a busperson and we received some warm, crusty bread for  dipping into some herbed olive oil. When, finally, our appetizers arrived, I  was happy to see my friend happily eating his grilled eggplant with cheese,  which was peppery and tasty.  </P> <P> My salad, however, confused me. I'd ordered mixed field greens and was  expecting the sort of lettuces most other restaurants serve when a field is  advertised as the source of the greens -- things like mesclun, lambs quarters,  chicory, dandelion, or some exotic mint. But this salad was made of iceberg and  romaine, exactly the kind of salad found in a coffee shop, complete with grated  carrot and shredded red cabbage. Thinking there had been a mistake, I told the  waiter. "I had the field greens salad. Unless I'm mistaken, these aren't field  greens."  </P> <P> "You're right," he said. A good five minutes later, another salad arrived and  it looked exactly like the first salad, only fluffed up a bit. I said no more.  </P> <P> It turns out that the food and service at Amedeo's is very much like its art:  aspirations are very grand, but they generally far exceed results. A waiter,  for example, very professionally takes our orders without notes, and then, the  wrong food arrives. And the menu makes promises that are rarely realized. The  gnocchi al pesto turns out to be gluey dumplings in a pool of a thick, rich  cheesy cream sauce flecked with basil. The tirami su is 90% coffee-drizzled  ladyfingers bound together with the scantest amount of mascarpone cheese. One  night's expensive special, described as extra-large Hawaiian scampi, was  actually pretty skimpy. Once we got the shrimp out of their sizable shells,  there was hardly any meat. What's worse, the shrimp was dry and burnt-tasting.  Another time, we're told that the kitchen ran out of the T-bone for the Mini  Steak alla Fiorentina -- will a New York do? Fine, but the New York is  overcooked, tasteless and so tough it seem impossible that the meat was  marinated as promised on the menu.  </P> <P> If you happen to find yourself eating at Amedeo Cucina, it may be helpful to  know that the rotisserie-cooked chicken is passable. And while the Italian  sausage with roasted peppers may not come on a "bed" of polenta as promised,  it's good and the meager little squares of fried polenta on the side are quite  nice too.  </P> <P> Between the paintings on the wall and the food on the plate, there's a lack of  discernment at work in Amedeo Cucina. After all, radicchio, open kitchens and  original art are no substitute for inspired cooking, considerate service and  prices commensurate with the quality of the meal.  </P> <P>  Amedeo Cucina, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. (818) 792-2236. Open for lunch  Monday through Friday; dinner seven days. Reservations suggested. All major  credit cards. Full bar. Dinner for two, food only, $30 to $70.  </P></p>

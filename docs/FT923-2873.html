			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Austrian central bank backs German move MRS Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, yesterday defended the German Bundesbank's interest rate reductions as 'enough for the moment.' Mrs Schaumayer said the turbulence in currency markets had been caused mainly by 'psychological factors.' Therefore, 'a clear signal' should kill them off. Larger reductions would have given the impression there was an emergency within the European Monetary System or that the Bundesbank had caved in to pressure. She thought the German government and central bank had 'walked hand in hand,' recognising the need for a political decision to emphasise commitment to the EMS. In July, the Austrian central bank, which pegs the Austrian schilling to the D-Mark, allowed its discount rate to remain below the German rate, reflecting the continuing strength of the Austrian economy and robust capital outflows. But it has now realigned it. Mrs Schaumayer said this was because 'our inflation got a little worse and Germany's got a little better.' However, the Austrian central bank has cut its main open market intervention rate, the Gomex rate, by 0.5 per cent to 9 per cent, leaving it slightly below the German open market tender rate of 9.2 per cent.</p>

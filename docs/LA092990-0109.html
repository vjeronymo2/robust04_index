			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER PROSECUTOR'S JAIL TERM IN SEX CASE CALLED TOO LENIENT  </P> <P> An ex-deputy city attorney was handed a one-year jail term Friday for  soliciting sexual favors from a teen-age defendant in exchange for a lighter  sentence.  </P> <P> Prosecutors criticized the sentence as "too lenient," but Los Angeles Superior  Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin cited George Schwartz's lack of a criminal record  and the damage already inflicted on the former city attorney's professional  reputation as reasons for deciding against the recommended four-year maximum  prison term.  </P> <P> Schwartz, 44, of West Hills, was also ordered to pay a $500 fine and was placed  on five years' probation for his June 4 conviction on one count of felony  bribery.  </P> <P> Schwartz served 10 years with the city attorney's office in Van Nuys before he  was fired in August, 1988, because of the allegations. As he sat in court  Friday alongside his 13-year-old son, Darren, Schwartz denied the charge and  said his attorney had that morning filed an appeal on the conviction. Schwartz  remained free on $20,000 bail pending a ruling on the appeal.  </P> <P> During the trial, prosecutors played an audiotape recorded secretly by Laura  Kazemi, who was 18 when Schwartz prosecuted a misdemeanor check-forgery case  against her in 1988.  </P> <P> On the 75-minute recording, Schwartz is heard telling Kazemi that if she  acceded to his sexual requests, he could help her gain a more lenient sentence  on charges she had already pleaded guilty to. Her case was later dismissed.  </P> <P> "The tapes were quite descriptive," said the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty.  Herb Lapin.  </P> <P> Harland Braun, Schwartz's attorney, said his client "didn't intend to go  through with the proposal," but was conducting his own investigation to get  evidence to prove Kazemi was trying to bribe him.  </P></p>

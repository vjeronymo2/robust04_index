			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JUNE CONSTRUCTION SPENDING DOWN 0.8% TO LOWEST LEVEL IN 8 MONTHS  </P> <P> Construction spending in June slumped 0.8% to its lowest level in eight months  as declines in housing and government projects offset a gain in commercial  building, the Commerce Department said today.  </P> <P> Residential, non-residential and public projection activity fell to a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.7 billion, the lowest level since  October, the report said. The decline followed a 0.6% gain in May and a 0.8%  drop in April.  </P> <P> Activity for the first six months of the year was only 2.9% above the same  period in 1988, an increase that doesn't even make up for the 4.8% rise in  construction costs.  </P> <P> Economists have been expecting construction to be weak this year because of the  Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign, which ended in the spring, to fight  inflation with higher interest rates. Since early June, the central bank has  reversed course, allowing interest rates to decline modestly, and analysts now  expect construction to rebound at least a bit.  </P></p>

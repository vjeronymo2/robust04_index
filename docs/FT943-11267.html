			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / US threatens sanctions on Japan: Tokyo given 60 days to meet demands on market access The US yesterday launched trade sanction proceedings against Japan in an effort to force the Tokyo government to open its market to imports of telecom and medical equipment. At the same time the US was on the brink of trade retaliation against Canada as a deadline approached for resolving a row over Canadian wheat exports. The worsening disputes are a test of Washington's resolve after much tough talking about market access in Japan and about protecting US interests. Japan now has 60 days to meet US demands or face the risk of higher tariffs on selected Japanese exports to the US. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, formally set the sanction proceedings under way by identifying Japanese government procurement practices as discriminatory against imports of US telecom and medical equipment. These are two fields where US producers claim they are highly competitive but yet have been unable to make gains in the Japanese market. Mr Kantor said he was acting in response to Japan's 'failure to address long-standing discrimination against US suppliers'. Talks over Canadian wheat exports to the US were still unresolved late yesterday. A Canadian delegation had returned home after talks were broken off, though the two sides maintained telephone contact in an attempt to avert imminent US sanctions. US farmers are upset at Canadian wheat exports to the US and claim the Canadians are successful because of 'unfair trade' practices. The US is reluctant to take action against Japan and Canada. Critics already claim its tough approach to Japan has destabilised the two countries' trading relationship and driven the yen up and the dollar down. Retaliatory action against Japan or Canada, or both, would be the first since the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation was signed in Marrakesh earlier this year. The US has only a flimsy rationale for limiting Canadian wheat exports. The US International Trade Commission, acting on a request from President Bill Clinton, recently found that Canada's wheat sales had damaged the US price support programme. But three of the six commissioners found the harm to be minimal and recommended only weak sanctions. Mr Clinton is expected to decide as early as today what action, if any, to take to curb wheat imports. Even if there is retaliation, it might be temporary. The US law under which the action would be taken will disappear in January when the new World Trade Organisation comes into effect as successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. US and Japanese negotiators have been reporting progress in their row over telecom and medical equipment - but not enough. Japan last week gave the US a detailed compromise proposal containing elements of 'objective indicators to measure progress' in market access, as demanded by the US. Japanese negotiators had not held out much hope that this would be enough to stave off the start of sanctions proceedings. As a result, Tokyo has been calm in facing the prospect of trade sanctions proceedings being launched. A foreign ministry official said yesterday Japan would continue to seek a resolution to the issue within the framework talks on trade set in motion a year ago. Japan is resisting US demands for 'objective criteria' to measure improved penetration of Japanese markets. Another difficulty is the US demand for a pact calling for 'significant increases' in access and sales in Japan. US takes hard line on 'dumping' Page 4</p>

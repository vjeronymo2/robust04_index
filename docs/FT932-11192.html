			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Australia changes TV rules again THE AUSTRALIAN government has again been forced to amend its policy on subscription television, this time to contain embarrassment over the outcome of last week's bidding round for the initial licences. On Friday, the government awarded the first licences to operate satellite subscription television to little-known companies UCOM and Hi Vision, which bid ADollars 177m (USDollars 125m) and ADollars 212m respectively. The companies won the bidding despite intense competition from larger international consortia, notably a combination involving Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television network. This consortium, which included Telecom Australia, the government-owned telecommunications carrier, was reported to have offered ADollars 70m. US Continental Cable group is said to have bid ADollars 53m. The government said it received a total of 50 separate bids for the two licences. The decision to award the rights to the licences on a strictly 'highest bidder' basis has stunned the Australian media industry, which had been confident that one licence would be awarded to the Packer-Murdoch consortium. Under the rapidly-revised bidding rules, if UCOM or Hi Vision fail to put up the cash involved in their bids, the tenders will be awarded to the next highest bidders. This time, however, the winners will have to provide a non-refundable 5 per cent deposit within three days. Under the original rules, tenders had to be accompanied by ADollars 500. Bid winners are now required to raise the bid amounts 30 days after getting clearances from the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Trade Practices Commission, the competition regulator. The process was widely criticised within the media industry yesterday for allowing highly speculative bids from groups that did not have strong financial backing or little or no enough experience in operating television networks. In a statement on Monday evening, Hi Vision said Philips Australia, GEC and Marconi were likely participants in its licence. UCOM has not issued a statement on its plans. The government's change of tack is the latest in an 18-month saga of policy lurches on pay-TV that includes battles within the Labor government and opposition parties, lobbying by fearful TV networks and a court battle. 'However, potential deficiencies in the current arrangements have been noted in recent days and it is desirable to provide a systemic solution for the future in the allocation of broadcasting licences generally,' Mr Bob Collins, transport and communications minister said. The government has changed its pay-TV policy several times since the first draft was published in November 1991. It opted for one exclusive licence, then two, excluded the state broadcaster, and then guaranteed it two channels, allowing non-satellite cable at the same time.</p>

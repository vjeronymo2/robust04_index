			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Threat from space I EXPECT you think I was wrong-footed by Ross Perot's withdrawal from the race for the White House, but in that you would be wrong. For those who have been visiting Mars, I was recruited, just last month, as the London-based member of the Committee To Elect Ross Perot. I was exceedingly well paid. Ross Perot liked me, asked me to fly to Dallas, was constantly amazed at the richness of the data I faxed from London. When Perot withdrew from the scramble for the presidency, I imagined my life would return to normal. I went on holiday. I joined a luxury barge cruise on the River Saone in Burgundy. But life is never simple. No sooner had Perot withdrawn in ignominy than Bill Clinton phoned from New York to ask me to join his campaign team. Wearily, I agreed. 'You were going great guns for Perot,' said Clinton soothingly, 'so why not switch horses? The Democrats need you. Me and Al need you. We're going right to the wire.' 'Are you offering money?' I asked the governor. 'Only I'm cruising on the Napoleon. We've just left Macon. On a cruise like this the passengers play Monopoly for bearer bonds.' 'We can pay you something,' said Clinton. 'But we're not Ross Perot. What we want you to do is cover our backs in Europe and the Middle East. Feed us data. Stuff about Nato. Where is Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is Italy going down the plughole. Nothing you couldn't handle. And we want Big Ideas, Mike. Things to crush Bushie with, especially ahead of the Republican convention. Do you have Big Ideas?' 'Of course I do,' I mumbled. 'So lay one on me, Mike. Hit me with a big one. You're a baby boomer, too, just like me and Al. I'm sure you're on our wavelength. Hit me with a biggie.' I thought furiously. 'Here's one,' I said. 'Back in April I visited the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to research an article about Nasa's Seti programme, its Search for Extraterrestial Intelligence, which starts on October 1. The programme involves a systematic search of the microwave radio spectrum for signals of intelligent origin. 'My article was snappily written. Mega-short sentences. Very Beverly Hills, fast-paced and up-beat. But it was suffused, you might say, with my own conviction that our galaxy pulses with intelligent life, and that the Seti programme is an entirely admirable venture.' There was silence from New York. 'Yet now I have changed my mind,' I said. 'I have changed my mind after talking to my good friend Jared Diamond, author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee. We're basically chimps, Mr Clinton. More than 98 per cent of human genes are shared with two species of chimpanzee. In his book, Jared explores the ways in which we are uniquely human yet still influenced by our animal origins. 'Anyways. Jared is excessively worried by Nasa's Seti programme. He finds it mind-boggling that the astronomers now eager to spend Dollars 100m on Seti have never thought seriously about the most obvious question: what would happen if we discovered extraterrestrials, or if they found us. 'Our own experience on Earth offers useful guidance,' says Jared. 'We have already discovered two species that are very intelligent but technically less advanced than us - the common chimpanzee and pygmy chimpanzee. Has our response been to sit down and try to communicate with them? Of course not. Instead we shoot them, stuff them, dissect them, cut off their hands for trophies, put them on exhibit in cages, inject them with Aids virus ..and destroy or take over their habitat.' 'Mr Clinton,' I concluded. 'Jared says that for practical purposes we are unique and alone in the universe. But he also says it is suicidal folly to try and communicate with the very few civilisations that might exist. 'If there really are any radio civilisations within listening distance of us, then for heaven's sake let's turn off our own transmitters and try to escape detection, or we are doomed,' says Jared. 'So there is your Big Idea. Tell the American people that Seti must be halted; that Bushie, in his ignorance, is endangering the Earth. Tell the people that only the Democrats stand between Earth and invading mobs from other planets. What is your current poll lead, 20 points, 25? You could double that, Mr Clinton. As easy as apple pie ..' But the line had gone dead.</p>

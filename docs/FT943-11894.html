			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / US-Canada farm trade war looms A farm trade battle between the US and Canada came closer yesterday as trade ministers from both countries again failed to settle their dispute over Canadian wheat sales in the US. Mr Roy MacLaren, the Canadian trade minister, spoke only briefly after meeting his US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor. The two sides had discussed many other issues, he said. They now understood each other on grain and 'will be in touch' in the immediate future, he said. However, the Clinton administration is under strong pressure from a few influential senators to act quickly under a US law which allows the president to limit imported commodities found to interfere with the US price support programme. That statute is likely to be abolished with the launch of the World Trade Organisation, which could happen in January. The Canadians have threatened to retaliate against any US sanctions. Their scope for action is wide. Canada is a key market for many US grain products. All six members of the US International Trade Commission this month found that Canada's wheat sales had interfered with the price support scheme. However, in recommendations sent to the White House last Friday, three concluded that there were several reasons for 'the small adverse impact' on wheat prices, including last year's US floods and unfavourable weather in both countries. The three also said Canadian grain had been given competitive advantages through its rail subsidies and the Canadian wheat board. The three commissioners recommended 10 per cent tariffs on quantities of non-durum wheat which exceed 1m tonnes and 10 per cent tariffs on imports of durum when that exceed 500,000 tonnes. The other three commissioners recommended stiffer penalties.</p>

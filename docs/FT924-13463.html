			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Oasys Global system is launched OASYS Global, one of the three electronic trade confirmation systems selected by the International User Group last February, was launched yesterday after four weeks of client testing, writes Tracy Corrigan. By the end of this week, about 20 clients will be linked up, according to Mr Robert Hayim, general manager of Thomson Financial Services, the system's developer. Thomson expects a ratio among clients of 30 per cent institutional investors to 70 per cent brokers. Electronic confirmation of the details of trades replaces the current system based on telex and facsimile. The development of the three systems was instigated by the International User Group, a group of institutional investors and stockbrokers who want the systems to become standard products in the securities industry. The London Stock Exchange's Sequal is on target for delivery at end of October, according to an official. Trax, the International Securities Market Association's product, will start testing with selected clients at the end of the month, and is due to go live in December.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Irish ruling on abortion cites risk to mother's life THE Irish Supreme Court yesterday ruled that abortion is legal under the country's constitution, if it is carried out to protect the life of the mother. The ruling follows the Supreme Court's overturning last week of a High Court injunction which prevented a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to Britain for an abortion. It is likely to have far-reaching effects on Ireland's hitherto strict anti-abortion legislation. A 1983 'right-to-life' constitutional amendment formed the basis of the High Court judgment. The High Court took the view that under the amendment the unborn child's right to life prevailed over a perceived threat to the girl's life after she had threatened suicide. However, Judge C J Finlay, the Supreme Court chief justice, ruled: 'I am satisfied that . . . there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother by self destruction which can only be avoided by termination of her pregnancy'. Only one of the five Supreme Court judges dissented.</p>

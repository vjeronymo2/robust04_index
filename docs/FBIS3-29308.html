			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have ended  in failure without settling bilateral conflicts. Since the  point at issue lies in the controversy over the basic problem on  introduction of numerical targets, the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI] has responded coolly to the breakdown,  saying: "It was somehow predictable." MITI intends to deal with  U.S. pressure on Japan, which is expected to intensify in the  future, by frequently resorting to the method of enlisting  cooperation of auto and auto parts makers to increase purchases  of U.S.-made products (known as the corporation approach).  However, prospects for the framework talks still remain utterly  unknown. Even if the talks should be resumed, it would be  difficult to find a way out unless our two nations should come  to share a common understanding of the objective criteria.  Thus, discussions may have to be resumed from the starting  point when the decision was made to set up the framework talks  last July.    In analyzing the talks, a senior MITI official said: "The  yen's sharp appreciation is a menace to us but we do not think  that the `verbal intervention' will last long. It will also be  difficult for the United States to take unilateral sanctions  based on laws such as the U.S. Trade Act." His comments  indicate that since mutual cooperation in the industrial area  has deepened and since sanctions will affect Japan in only a few  sectors, such sanctions may not bring about serious damage.    If the United States should invoke its Trade Act and take  unilateral sanctions, such as raising import tariffs on  semiconductors, American users will be forced to use expensive  Japanese products because higher costs will result in higher  prices. Thus, MITI argues that in the long run, it will be  American consumers who will suffer disadvantages.    Meanwhile, the two countries had the hardest time at the  recent talks on autos and auto parts. And concerning these  talks, MITI indicated its confidence, and said: "Cooperation  between the private sectors of our two countries will further  deepen regardless of the future development in the framework  talks." A source at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association [JAMA] also said: "We will continue to promote  bilateral cooperation in the industrial area." In this way,  JAMA shows its intention to promote the corporation approach,  which MITI advocated at the recent talks, so as to show the  United States how effective it is.    However, the corporation approach gives no guarantee of an  increase in the amount of procurement and it will take a long  time to produce any results. In this connection, it is hard to  expect that with the approach of the by-election this fall, the  Clinton administration will tolerate the trade imbalance in the  auto sector, which amounted to as huge as approximately 2.45  trillion yen (in 1993).    "Numerical targets will not be accepted because it will lead  to managed trade." This is a fair argument for Japan to claim.  However, in view of the fact that the trade surplus has remained  unreduced, it will be difficult to win U.S. understanding.    Since the numerical targets issue has become something like  a  debate on philosophical problems, rough sailing can be expected  at future talks. Therefore, for the time being, the private  sector will be asked to try to achieve the "invisible numerical  target" by resorting to the corporation approach to steadily  increase the purchase of U.S.-made products.</p>

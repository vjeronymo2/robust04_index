			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- An investment consultant,  testifying before the Diet on Wednesday [11 May], described as a  "lie" former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remark that his  father-in-law asked the consultant to help him buy shares in the  world's largest telephone company, Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT).    Shuzo Fujiki, the 60-year-old president of the Tokyo-based  stock consulting firm, Random Walk, told the House of  Councillors Budget Committee that the Hosokawa side asked him in  1986 to act as an intermediary in securing a huge loan to buy  NTT shares. "Telling a lie is outrageous as the truth is the  truth. We must not allow lies to go unchallenged,'' Fujiki told  the session.    Fujiki said Hosokawa asked him through Yusei Kuwahata,  their common acquaintance, to help secure the loan to buy the  300 NTT shares.    Kuwahata, former president of a computer information  magazine, earlier told a news conference that he went to the  southern Japan city of Kumamoto around August 1986 to invite  Hosokawa to buy the shares during a meeting at a golf course  clubhouse restaurant. "Mr. Kuwahata told me that then Kumamoto  Gov. Hosokawa expressed his desire to tender his bids at a NTT  share bidding, if only he can raise the (necessary) funds, as he  has the collateral to put up, although he does not have the  money," Fujiki said.    "Following that conversation from Mr. Kuwahata, Mr.  (Masatoshi) Miyama (Hosokawa's chief financial secretary)  contacted me, asking me to introduce a financial institution to  lend money, as Hosokawa has collateral, but not money," he said.    Fujiki said he complied with the request by introducing the  Tokyo Shoken Kinyu financing company to Hosokawa and then  arranging for Miyama to meet the "responsible person" of the  financing company in Fujiki's presence.    After the financing deal was struck, Fujiki said, "Mr.  Miyama asked the Tokyo Shoken Kinyu executive if it would allow  Hosokawa to use the name of a person other than himself in  borrowing the money, as Hosokawa is renowned as the Kumamoto  governor."    "The senior executive replied the firm will accept it (the  other person's name)," he said.    The executive made a "bold decision" to lend as much as 418  million yen to Hosokawa in view of his prestigious social  standing as the Kumamoto governor despite the fact that the  collateral was worth only 180 million yen, he said.    "Tokyo Shoken Kinyu would never have extended the loan if  Mr. Hosokawa had been a person without any credit worthiness,"  he said. He said he did not know the name of Hosokawa's  father-in-law until his name was reported by the media, as the  Hosokawa side proceeded with the loan deal without informing  him, once the loan arrangement was made.    Fujiki's testimony contradicts Hosokawa's own earlier  statement to the Diet that his late father-in-law, Shohei Ueda,  and not Hosokawa himself, initiated the investment deal, asking  Hosokawa for help in securing the necessary loan. Hosokawa's  father-in-law died last May.    Hosokawa repeatedly told the Diet he pledged his  condominium in Tokyo as collateral to take out the 418 million  yen loan from a stock investment financing firm and offered the  money to his father-in-law.    Hosokawa dropped his bombshell resignation announcement on  April 8 to take the blame for a "fresh suspicion" on his  personal finances, which he said is different from the NTT deal.    NTT listed tenders for its shares from corporate and  large-lot individual investors willing to purchase more than 100  shares Oct. 4, 1986, before offering the shares for smaller-lot  public subscription.    The Hosokawa side succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares  for which he had submitted bids on professional advice from  Fujiki, the investment consultant said.    Hosokawa reportedly made a capital gain of 200 million yen  by selling off 199 out of the 300 NTT shares in two  installations in February and March 1987 at an average price of  1.38 million yen. The remaining 101 shares are still in  possession of his wife, Kayoko Hosokawa.    According to Fujiki, Hosokawa reneged upon his promise to  pay 10% of the net proceeds from any sell-offs of the NTT  shares as a "consulting fee." Hosokawa also broke the promise  to allow the consultant to dictate the timing of the sell-offs,  he said.    Later, Miyama visited Fujiki's Tokyo office and asked for  Fujiki's consent to lower the sum of the consulting fee to 10  million yen, he said, adding he accepted the request.    In a related development, the Social Democratic Party (SDP)  joined the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist  Party in demanding the Diet summon Miyama as a witness to clear  up the suspicions.    SDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka told a  news conference, "We cannot help demanding the summons of former  Secretary Masatoshi Miyama as a witness. If necessary, we  should also demand the summons of Mr. Hosokawa."  (endall) 110705 macdonald bm131105.001 st 11/0816z May</p>

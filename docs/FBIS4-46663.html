Cheremisin; UDC 528:629.783]    [Abstract] The already demonstrated effectiveness of the  Etalon passive geodetic satellites is further discussed. They  were launched for increasing the accuracy in determining and  predicting the parameters of motion of vehicles in the GLONASS  system, refining geodynamic parameters and constructing  corresponding models of these geodynamic parameters. Refined  models based on Etalon observations can represent an improvement  over models now used for the GLONASS system and can be used in  constructing a highly precise model of the nongravitational  forces acting on navigational satellites, as well as in solving  problems directly related to increasing the accuracy  characteristics of the GLONASS system. It is believed that this  will make it possible to solve a wide range of geophysical  problems: refinement of fundamental geophysical and astronomical  constants, construction of a model of the internal structure of  the Earth and formulation of a theory of its rotation. A table  gives the characteristics of the Etalon passive spacecraft. The  observations made it possible to construct a highly precise  model of motion of passive spacecraft taking the following  perturbations into account: Earth's gravitational potential,  gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, gravitational  attraction of Venus and possibly Jupiter; pressure of direct  solar radiation and that reflected from the Earth. The Etalon  passive spacecraft in the future can be used for solving all  problems within the framework of the GLONASS system and for  increasing the accuracy of fundamental geophysical and  astronomical parameters. The means by which these goals can be  most effectively attained are outlined.</p>

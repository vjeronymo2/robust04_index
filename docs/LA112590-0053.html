			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MAINSTREAM VALUES' VS. CAMPUS PLURALISM;  </P> <P> CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE;  </P> <P> 'CORRECTNESS' IS INTOLERANCE BY ANOTHER NAME.  </P> <P> A rising issue at American universities is "political correctness." Activists  on both sides at Harvard make their cases.  </P> <P> A university can be seen as a forum for many voices. But the voices being heard  today at Harvard and other campuses do not properly represent the many  individual opinions and beliefs in the university community. "Politically  correct" students and administrators have grown increasingly intolerant of the  conservative message during the past 20 years.  </P> <P> Their vocal coalition has determined not only to corner the market on ideas,  but also to suppress any alternative points of view. This dogma of political  correctness has forced conservative and religious groups into the closet.  Within the last year, however, we conservatives have made a resurgence at  Harvard, exposing the stifling politically correct mode of operation that had  rendered so many of our voices impotent. But the struggle has just begun.  </P> <P> What is it about Harvard that impels many to look with disdain upon their  upbringing? To ridicule their parents? To laugh at the institutions through  which they have grown and prospered?  </P> <P> This environment demands a conservative revolution. In this climate our  organization, the Assn. Against Learning in the Absence of Religion and  Morality (AALARM), has sought to promote traditional American values -- ideals  of faith, family, country and community.  </P> <P> We, like most Americans, have been taught the importance of God and the  community of the church. The ideals of faith and religion play an integral role  in our lives. We unfashionably respect our parents, recognizing that rebellion  for rebellion's sake shows contempt for the value of experience.  </P> <P> We have been taught that the important lessons of the human experience are  learned through interdependence, not isolation. Only within the community can  individual human beings reach their highest potential.  </P> <P> The clearest manifestation of our communal instinct is a love of country. These  are the values that have made America strong. But, unfortunately, these beliefs  are incompatible with politically correct dogma at Harvard.  </P> <P> Moral relativism and secular humanism have been tacitly adopted as the official  university religion. For example, the college promotes unrestrained sexual  activity by providing "morning after" abortions and 100% of the funding for  clinical abortions. The University Health Services also charge unsuspecting  parents for student contraceptives. These items appear without special notice  in billings, as would cough syrup or aspirin.  </P> <P> But our most formidable task to date has been the promotion of traditional  family values in the face of vociferous and imperious homosexual activists.  Many licentious homosexual activities have occurred at Harvard facilities,  evoking no concern among the administration and many students. Recently several  men were arrested for lewd behavior by Harvard police in the publicly  accessible Science Center restroom. This area is rumored to be a virtual  brothel for anonymous homosexual acts. The outrage on campus, appallingly, was  directed not toward the accused men but toward the police for their intrusion.  </P> <P> The central predicament for Harvard conservatives is simply being heard. At a  recent debate between AALARM and a homosexual organization, our statements were  rarely audible over the hissing, booing and obscenities of gay supporters.  Politically correct students regularly destroy the posters and publications of  AALARM. Harvard's conservative publication, Peninsula, which appeared for the  first time last year, has had hundreds of issues removed from dining halls and  student dorms and destroyed. Administrators as well have attempted to thwart  our operations. After we postered Harvard Yard, a university official removed  AALARM posters and delivered them to the dean of students in an unsuccessful  attempt to see us punished for our beliefs. Recently, the administration,  through an assistant dean, denounced AALARM in the Boston Globe. In committing  such shameful acts of censorship they have violated our freedom of speech, and  in quashing our voice, have breached students' freedom of thought.  </P> <P> George Washington once said, "Let us raise a standard to which the wise and  honest can repair." Ironically, these words have been immortalized on the wall  of the Harvard Union -- on a campus rife with moral decay. Until now this  message has been in vain. But, conservative groups such as AALARM and  Peninsula, have the courage and tenacity to stand up to the politically correct  oppressors. Harvard, the finest educational institution in the world, is dear  to us, and for that reason we cannot be silent.  </P> <P> We stand out as a glimmer of hope, not only to the Harvard community but also  to the people of tomorrow who will be raised, educated, and cared for by the  people of today.  </P></p>

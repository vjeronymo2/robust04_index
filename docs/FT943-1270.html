			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / How to spend it: Class in a name BUGATTI is one of those names that resonates through the years even for those who have never seen one of the legendary cars. Bugatti, we all know, stands for class, for cars that are the stuff of dreams. Though it is well over 100 years since the Bugatti story first began, it was only three years ago that the family decided to create a range of products that would draw on the impeccable image and standing that Bugatti had throughout the world. The earlier generation of Bugattis were astonishing designers. Father Carlo turned out hundreds of drawings for everything from furniture to silver and glass, while Ettore, who designed the unforgettable cars, also turned his hand to ships, aeroplanes and trains. With this rich archive to draw on the family decided to open a design studio in Ora, near Bolzano in Italy, and begin a modern, rejuvenated launching of Bugatti products. Almost everything the Bugattis do is linked, however tenuously, with the romance and glamour of motoring, harking back to its golden days. Luxurious wraps of cashmere backed with softest suede are perfect for keeping delicate bones warm whilst driving in an open-topped car. Soft suede motoring trousers have subtle extra curving seams which can be let out so that there is plenty of room for the knees to bend and the trousers retain their shape. There are warm gilets, of softest suede or leather, exquisitely made, which by virtue of skilfully placed zips also double up (yes, seriously) as shopping bags or knapsacks. There is a beautifully designed shootingstick-cum-umbrella and, of course, obligatory motoring accessories such as sun-glasses (Zeiss lenses in anti-glare tempered crystal and flexible hinges - all very sleek), watches (Ettore Bugatti used to present watches to his victorious drivers), pens and leather goods. The Bugatti hand-bag is one of the few long-established products. Ettore Bugatti designed it for his wife, it was made for him by Hermes and has been a classic ever since. At the new Bugatti shop the basic design is untouched but two-tone versions in racing colours, for instance, can be ordered. The locks are in the shape of the car radiator. This may read like the stuff of every would-be luxury goods house but the quality and the attention to detail is exceptional. Leather notebooks, wallets and albums, for instance, have beautifully hinged covers so that the leather does not wear out. Metals are carefully worked, fabrics the finest possible. Prices, of course, are not low - the cashmere and suede rugs are Pounds 1,600, the Bugatti bag starts at Pounds 808 but silk ties enlivened with motifs of old cars are just Pounds 48. The new Bugatti shop is at 20 Beauchamp Place, London SW3 and - for serious collectors of special cars - the first new Bugatti car designed since 1952 is available (for Pounds 285,000) from the Bugatti showroom at 49/51 Cheval Place, London SW7.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL PREPARES FOR DEVELOPMENT VOTE  </P> <P> The City Council took action this week to clear the way for a final vote July  17 on a controversial residential and commercial development proposed for the  former Santiago Creek Golf Course and nearby creek bed.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to speed the review of final data on the development  plan and hire a consultant to review traffic studies of the area before the  July 17 meeting.  </P> <P> Some of the 150 residents at the meeting favored a longer period of study for  one part of the development, a proposal to delete the extension of La Veta  Street from Cambridge Street to Tustin Avenue. Many of those who oppose the  speedy review sported bright yellow badges that identified them as members of  the Santiago Creek Greenway Alliance, a coalition of homeowners and  environmentalists who want to preserve the creek as open space.  </P> <P> Councilmen William Steiner and Gene Beyer sided with those residents, saying  that one month was not enough time to study the impact of dropping the La Veta  extension. But the council majority decided that after four years of arguing  over the fate of the 37-acre site, a final decision on the development should  not be postponed again.  </P> <P> On July 17, the council will vote on a general plan amendment to delete the La  Veta extension and consider environmental reports on the project.  </P> <P> The development, Villa Santiago, would call for filling in the creek bed in  order to build 160 single-family homes, a seven-acre shopping plaza and a  3.5-acre greenbelt.  </P> <P> However, both supporters and opponents of the project expressed relief that  after more than four years battling for control of the 37-acre site, a final  decision could be made as early as next month.  </P> <P> The developer of the project, Lynn Burnett, said he is optimistic that the plan  will be approved next month. In the last two years, Burnett said the project  that started as a 471-unit apartment complex has undergone four revisions and  slowly gained support from the community.  </P> <P> "To me the real story here is not that 100 people show up with banners and  flags," Burnett said of the crowd Tuesday. "To me the story is that a couple  years ago, 350 people showed up and were very vocal and very hostile" toward  the project.  </P> <P> Opponents of the project have said that filling in Santiago Creek would destroy  one of the few greenbelts left in the city and eliminate an important flood  wash, creating a hazard in heavy rains.

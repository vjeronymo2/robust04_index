			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: A cubist of classical order - William Packer visits a Georges Braque exhibition in Martigny MARTIGNY is the small, ancient town that commands the Swiss end of the St Bernard Pass, where it comes down into the Rhone valley above Lake Geneva. It is the sort of place where the traveller might think of stopping for an agreeable lunch, or overnight perhaps, but no more than that. And yet here, for the past dozen years, in the Foundation he set up in memory of his elder brother, Leonard Gianadda has been putting on exhibitions of international museum quality. It is a most unusual institution - concert hall, Celto-Romano archeological site, sculpture garden, motor museum and gallery all in one. A member of the audience may well find himself sitting within a fragment of Roman wall to hear the music, or further back with a current masterpiece at his shoulder. From Klee, Goya and Giacometti, Schiele and Lautrec, to Moore, Modigliani and Chagall, the record speaks for itself. Until the autumn it is the turn of Georges Braque, in a full but succinct retrospective. No-one goes to the Fondation Gianadda in expectation of the copious and exhaustive review: the hanging space is but the four walls of the central hall, augmented as necessary by a screen or two, with a small side-gallery usually reserved for drawings or, as in this case, prints. But it is no bad thing for the exhibition organiser to submit to such discipline, as the Gianadda shows repeatedly bear witness. The Braque show is characteristically beautifully chosen, full of surprises and closely focused. Braque was born in 1882, a year younger than Picasso, his great partner in the Cubist adventure. He died in 1963, loaded with honours - yet, of all the heroes of the School of Paris in its golden age, he remains an oddly shadowy and elusive figure, at once acknowledged and overlooked. He was no such prodigy as Picasso, his student work competent enough but remarkable only for being his student work. He was no radical innovator such as Matisse, and the fauve paintings here seem tentative and even academic against those of Derain and Matisse himself. Yet the seriousness of his engagement is always clear, and with the transition from fauve to proto-Cubist, hinting at Cezanne in 'The house on the hill' of 1907, the mature and distinctive artist declares himself. The subsequent encounter with Picasso was, of course, decisive, changing his life, and yet who would now say who was the dominant partner of the two? The issue is still critically alive, questions of actual authorship still unresolved. Yet the difference between the two protagonists comes into focus, and the wonderful run here, of Braque's analytical cubist and later synthetic cubist paintings and collages, advance the process remarkably. Braque is, above all, the cubist of classical order and simplicity, calm, stable, the work set not rigidly but essentially upon the vertical and the horizontal. Picasso, by contrast, was ever the expressionist in sensibility, the work active, mouvemente, working off the dynamic of the diagonal. While Matisse was in sort ever the fauve, and Picasso by turns all things to all men - expressionist, symbolist, surrealist, classicist and expressionist again - it was as a cubist that Braque came to himself, and so in essence he remained throughout his life. Cubism turned him from the fauve colourist he could never be to the tonal painter he truly was. And it was by cubism too that he fixed upon the still-life, which was to be his constant subject and which supplies the greater part of this exhibition. There are unevennesses, of course, and a falling-off towards the end, though not without interest in the small late landscapes that pay modest homage to Van Gogh. But the strength of the show lies with the magnificent sequence that takes us through from cubism to the large still-lifes and studio interiors of 1930s and 1940s, that have the space and scope of landscape, and yet the close intimacy of the known place and the familiar object. The space is diffracted yet open and coherent, the form fragmented yet resolved, the whole contradictory yet imaginatively convincing, the surface undemonstrative yet dense, rich and subtle. It is the work of a profound master, and a lovely exhibition. Georges Braque: Fondation Pierre Gianadda, Martigny Switzerland; until November 8</p>

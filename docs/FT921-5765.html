			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Treuhand sells half of state firms GERMANY'S Treuhand agency said yesterday it had sold off close to half of the 11,427 former East German state companies or subsidiaries in what is the world's biggest privatisation programme, Reuter reports from Berlin. 'We have done just about half of our work,' the Bonn government agency, overseeing the establishment of a market economy in the east since shortly before German unification in 1990, said in a statement. The Treuhand said 5,584 concerns had been privatised as of February 1 and 5,843 remained in its stable. Most of the companies emerged from Communist rule gravely uncompetitive and have had to shed workers and rely on special subsidies to survive. Some 1.15m jobs and almost Dm140bn (Pounds 49bn) in investment have been secured through privatisation of companies or properties, the Treuhand said. It did not mention that eastern Germany's unemployment has soared from almost nil to 17 per cent.</p>

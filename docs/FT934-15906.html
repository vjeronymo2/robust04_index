			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Campari slumps After worse-than-expected results Campari, the sporting clothes company, took a battering from the market and its share price fell 49 to 93p. One analyst said that although the results were far worse than feared the market's reaction had been 'pretty phenomenal'. The poor results have been attributed to a combination of poor sales and fundamental problems with supplies from the Far East. A similar case in textiles came with Martin International whose results forced its price to slide 38 to 49p.</p>

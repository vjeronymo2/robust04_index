			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SETTLES WRONGFUL-DEATH SUIT OVER SON SHOT BY GEORGIA DEPUTY  </P> <P> An out-of-court settlement has been reached in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed  on behalf of the family of a Mira Mesa man who was shot to death by an  auxiliary sheriff's deputy on a Georgia freeway.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge Anthony A. Alaimo of Brunswick, Ga., blocked release of  the details of the settlement, which was reached last week.  </P> <P> The suit was filed last October in U.S. District Court for the Southern  District of Georgia and sought $12 million in damages for the death of Mark  Charles Nanz, 29.  </P> <P> "We're just glad that the civil courts were able to do what the local courts  were unable to do, and that is impose punishment on the people involved,"  Nanz's father, Chuck Nanz of Chula Vista, said Tuesday. "We're hoping that the  federal Justice Department will pursue the charges against the parties  involved."  </P> <P> Nanz was shot and killed in April, 1989, when the trucker with whom he had  hitched a ride led police on a four-county chase along Interstate 95 in  southeast Georgia.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad it's over," said Nanz's mother, Leah M. Archibeque of Mira Mesa,  who declined to comment further.  </P> <P> The 50-mile chase began in Glynn County just before dusk and ended in Bryan  County when an uncertified Liberty County auxiliary deputy fired several shots  into the cab of the truck, injuring the driver, Klaus Kirk of Denver, and  fatally wounding Nanz.  </P> <P> The Nanz family alleged that, when the truck finally stopped, Kirk and Nanz  were dragged from the cab and beaten by a McIntosh County deputy and a Liberty  County deputy. The suit contended that Liberty County was negligent in allowing  uncertified auxiliary deputies to carry guns.  </P> <P> Liberty County Deputy Johnny Ryals and McIntosh County Deputy Charles Wallace  were found guilty of beating Kirk and Nanz last year. Both deputies were given  brief jail sentences, community service work and fines.  </P> <P> The family was not satisfied with that punishment, according to Chuck Nanz.  </P> <P> Liberty County Sheriff R. V. Sikes and Detective John Dasher also were named  individually as defendants because "they're supposed to be responsible for  their people" and what they do, said attorney Charles Ashman, who represented  Nanz's family.  </P> <P> Glynn and McIntosh counties were included in the suit because they failed to  properly control the chase in their jurisdictions, Ashman said, adding that  Bryan County was accused of "a failure to respond appropriately" to a medical  emergency.  </P> <P> "We're happy that some justice is being administered insofar as the way Mark  was killed," Chuck Nanz said.  </P> <P> Associated Press information was used in compiling this report.  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Aitken out of US with Dollars 54m disposal AITKEN HUME International, the financial services and banking group, is to pull out of the US market with the sale of its fund management business for a maximum consideration of Dollars 54m (Pounds 38m). The group, which in 1989 sold all but three of its diverse businesses in an effort to stem losses, is left with just its private banking operations in London and Guernsey. Mr Ziad Idilby, chairman, said the group had not yet decided how it would use the proceeds from the sale of National Securities &amp; Research Corporation. However, a statement issued yesterday said the group did not intend to use the proceeds for acquisitions or expansion of existing businesses. The sale price represented a significant increase over the Dollars 30m-plus paid for the fund management business by Aitken in the early 1980s, Mr Idilby said. 'It was more or less an offer we could not refuse.' The disposal was the result of several approaches, either for NSR alone or for Aitken Hume as a whole, received in recent months. Aitken finally agreed to sell NSR - which manages some Dollars 2.7bn in assets - to Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance. Last year NSR contributed pre-tax profits of Dollars 4m on total income of Dollars 17.8m. The deal bars Aitken from competing against Phoenix in the US mutual funds industry. A total of Dollars 14.8m will be held in escrow pending settlement of certain outstanding issues. Mr Idilby added that the net asset value of the group would be 67p a share after the disposal.</p>

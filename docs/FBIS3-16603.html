			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 17, BNS -- Estonia is going to turn to  the European Union [EU] for mediation in its talks with Moscow  on the Russian troop withdrawal.    Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia, Vaino  Reinart, began consultations on the issue in Brussels, a press  release by the Estonian Foreign Ministry says.    The release issued today also says Estonia accepted Russia's  proposal to hold the next round of talks in Moscow on Apr. 5-6,  "despite a number of statements by Russian leaders, that are  difficult to explain, on breaking off the negotiations and  transfering the agreed final date for the withdrawal of troops."    The Estonian Foreign Ministry reminds that at the past round  of the talks held in the seaside resort of Lohusalu near  Tallinn, "the Russian side refused to pull out its remaining  2,600 troops from Estonia by the earlier agreed deadline -- Aug.  31, 1994. The Russian representatives also moved forward new  conditions for the troop withdrawal and did not propose a date  for the next round" of talks, the statement says.    Estonia also says that a "quick and powerful" reaction from  the West had influenced Russia to continue talks and abide by  the troop withdrawal deadline.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A bit offside on set-aside Sir, Alison Maitland's article 'Farm leaders attack set-aside delay' (November 29) on the National Farmers' Union concerns about the European Parliament's delay in agreeing to a reduction in set-aside was spot on. As a farmer, I heartily agree with Sir David Naish's fury at 'verbal sparring' by politicians at the expense of farmers, and their urgent need to get on with winter drilling. But not all politicians are the same. As Conservative agriculture spokesman, I made precisely this practical point during the November sessions of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. For a farmer, set-aside is a waste of valuable resources. Any reduction, however small, is a step in the right direction. And the Conservatives and their Christian Democratic allies - alas, no longer a majority in Strasbourg - were consistent in urging swift approval of this measure. Those who held things up were the Socialists and Greens, 25 of whom walked out of the debate in Strasbourg last month to ensure there was no quorum. Fortunately the issue came before the parliament again last week, and this time we overcame plans - from the same people - to delay it further. When the vote was taken, we got the measure through. Labour says it objects to the Common Agricultural Policy. But presented with a golden opportunity to do something about one of its worst elements, we saw it instantly bend with the wind, or possibly some passing hot air. My political colleagues on the left ought to take a peek outside. Robert Sturdy, MEP for Cambridgeshire, Cambridge CB3 7QJ</p>

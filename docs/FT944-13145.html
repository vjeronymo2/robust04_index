			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Burlington raises Santa Fe bid The battle to create the largest railway network in the US intensified yesterday when Burlington Northern increased its bid for Santa Fe Pacific to Dollars 3.2bn from Dollars 2.5bn as its rival suitor, Union Pacific, refuted claims that its own offer for Santa Fe would never receive regulatory approval. Santa Fe has rejected Union Pacific's bid - valued at just under Dollars 3.2bn - from the start, advising its shareholders to accept the friendly offer from Burlington. Shareholders are due to vote on the proposed merger on November 18, and yesterday's substantially higher offer from Burlington was clearly intended to cement approval of the deal at the vote next month. A spokesman for Burlington said the company was able to increase the value of its bid by 25 per cent because it had discovered since submitting its first offer in June that 'the synergies (available from the merger) are significantly greater than we at first thought they would be'. He said the two companies now believe that within three years of the merger being approved they should be able to generate about Dollars 1.5bn in annual operating income from their combined businesses. The original estimate put combined yearly income at less than Dollars 1bn. Union Pacific, however, is determined not to give up without a fight, and yesterday announced that five railway industry experts the company had hired to study its offer for Santa Fe concluded that the merger between the two railways would have good prospects of being approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the government regulatory of railways. Ever since Union Pacific launched its higher bid for Santa Fe, doubts have been expressed over whether federal regulators would allow a merger between two railways whose prime routes are in direct competition with each other.</p>

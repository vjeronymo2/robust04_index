			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Duracell to close Crawley plant DURACELL, the US battery group, is to shed 320 jobs at its plant in Crawley, West Sussex, as it rationalises its European manufacturing and distribution operations. The company will wind down the components plant by August and transfer production to one centre in Aarschot, Belgium, where it runs the biggest alkaline battery factory in the world. Duracell had been considering the move for many months but decided to close the Crawley plant only after it failed to find space to expand capacity. Duracell employs 750 people in the UK, with 650 based at the components plant and technical centre in Crawley.</p>

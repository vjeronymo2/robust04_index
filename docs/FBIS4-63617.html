			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Russian Parliament's upper house  Vladimir Shumeyko believes that the Duma should suspend its  debate of a federal bill on media coverage of state power  structures and return it for additional scrutiny.    As Interfax has learned from well-placed parliamentary  sources, Shumeyko addressed to Duma's Chairman Ivan Rybkin a  letter, saying that "the bill looks like an army drill  instruction and has nothing in common with democracy and the  free press." Its enactment, in Shumeyko's view, "may induce a  significant infringement of the freedom of the press in Russia,  and endless and senseless law-making activity since both the  Constitution of Russia and the Federal Media Law would have to  be changed."    Drafted by the Information Policy and Communication  Committee, the bill contravenes article 29 and many other points  of the federal Constitution. In Shumeyko's opinion, "the  constitution's ban on censorship is covertly breached by a whole  range of the bill's clauses."    "Although the draft law starts with independence guarantees,  it ends with threats of trial, criminal punishment, penalties  and sanctions. Yet, in Russia's Penal Code there isn't a word  about punishing a journalist for doing or not doing what a state  body wished him to do," Shumeyko remarked.</p>

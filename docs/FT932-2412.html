			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: China steps up efforts to clear bonds backlog CHINA has intensified its campaign to rid itself of a large backlog of unsold treasury bonds after initial attempts to interest the public in a Yuan30bn (Dollars 5.2bn) issue met with limited response. China's State Council, or cabinet, this week urged provincial governments to redouble their efforts to clear the backlog. It also repeated its ruling banning localities from issuing securities, including equities and debt, before quotas of state treasury bills were sold. The latest instruction to provinces follows a disappointing public response to a decision taken in May to raise interest rates on three- and five-year treasury bills by 2.5 per cent to 12.52 per cent and by 3 per cent to 14.06 per cent respectively. China's finance ministry reports that only Yuan8.3bn, or 28 per cent of the total treasury bonds on offer, was sold by the end of May. 'The target for state bonds must be met, as funds raised from the bonds will be used mainly for the construction of key state projects . . . and had been included in the 1993 state budget,' an official said. With inflation running in China's larger cities at around 20 per cent, and with investors attracted by the prospect of speculative gains from China's fledgling stock markets, government paper has held little appeal. The weakness of the yuan is another factor against bond sales. The yuan has depreciated against the US dollar by more than 40 per cent in the past year or so, prompting a rush to buy dollars on the black market. People have also been buying gold as a hedge against the depreciating yuan. China's efforts to establish a free market in treasury bills by ending compulsory purchase requirements for individuals and enterprises in 1991 appears to have suffered a setback. Pension funds are now being obliged to buy bonds. Private businesses are also being pressured to do so. Mr Liu Zhongli, the finance minister, is planning to go on television to urge citizens to buy bonds as part of their contribution to China's development. He said China was considering an overhaul of its system of distributing bonds, which at the moment relies on a fairly unsophisticated system of underwriting. It also planned to devote more effort to marketing new issues and would adopt a system of public auction in due course.</p>

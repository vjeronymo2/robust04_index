			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Washington </F> Ignores the Interests of Its Allies"]    [Text] The United States does not mind harming even its own  allies by ignoring their legitimate national interests and  regional relations. The clearest example of this is the harm  done to Turkey by the unfair blockade that the U.S.  Administration has imposed on Iraq in the name of the UN  Security Council.    A few years ago, at the beginning of the unjust blockade on  Iraq, we were the ones who were warning of its potential harm.  Today, it is Turkish officials who are speaking about the harm  that has been done to their economy and who are demanding the  removal of the blockade on Iraq.    This is not all. Turkish officials, beginning with President  Demirel and Prime Minister Cillar and including several other  senior officials, have expressed their concern about the adverse  effects of the blockade on the Turkish people and economy, as  well as its effects on living and security conditions in Turkey.    The last to express such concern was Masoud Yilmaz,  president  of the Motherland Party, who called for the opening of the  al-Khabur border post with Iraq. Addressing a rally in Shirnak  [as transliterated] on the Iraqi-Turkish border, Yilmaz called  for the resumption of border trade to improve economic  conditions in the area. "The economic crisis and widespread  unemployment in the area have reached an intolerable level," he  said.    What Yilmaz said constitutes the substance of Turkey's  appeal  to the international community to completely lift the oil  embargo on Iraq. So far, Turkey has incurred losses amounting  to $20 billion as a result of its participation in the blockade  on Iraq.    THE NEW YORK TIMES has quoted Turkish officials and foreign  diplomats as saying that Turkey is going through a sharp  economic crisis manifested by a drop in the exchange rate of the  Turkish lira, deficits in the balance of trade, foreign debts  amounting to $68 billion dollars, and an annual inflation  ranging from 50-70 percent.    The question here is: How long will the United States  continue to ignore the will of the international community and  the interests of its allies by keeping the unfair blockade on  Iraq?    There is no doubt that Washington faces growing  international  pressure due to world conviction that Iraq has fulfilled all its  obligations under Resolution 687 and agreed to permanent  monitoring under Resolution 715 and that it is now up to the  Security Council to meet its commitments toward Iraq and apply  Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which permits Iraqi oil exports  without delay.    The unfair blockade on Iraq harms the interests of many  world  nations. Iraq has a solid economy and strong relations with  many states. These states cannot possibly be compensated for  their normal relations with Iraq. Thus, Turkey, Bulgaria, and  many others can no longer endure the negative effects and  results of the unfair blockade and continue with the dangerous  U.S. game of maintaining aggression and savageness against Iraq.    The blockade is besieging those who are imposing it. This  fact is clear to the Iraqis who resolutely continue to rebuild  their country and create new factors daily in order to overcome  the negative effects of the blockade while also determined to  inflict final defeat on the evil aggressors and to continue  building their country under the flag of the great leader Saddam  Husayn.</p>

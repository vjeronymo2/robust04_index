			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS: ALBANIA NOW OPEN FOR TOURIST BUSINESS  </P> <P> The changes sweeping Eastern Europe have reached even isolated Albania, which  recently lifted a ban on American travelers that had been in effect for more  than four decades. The move is a result of Albania's desire to rejoin the  community of nations and restore diplomatic ties with the United States.  </P> <P> U.S. officials held talks with representatives from Albania last month, with  Albania expressing interest in developing trade and tourism even before full  diplomatic relations are established.  </P> <P> In recent years, the only Americans allowed to visit this small country  bordered by Greece, Yugoslavia and the Adriatic Sea were those of Albanian  descent. Now, any American can travel there via group tours arranged through  the state tourism agency, Albturist.  </P> <P> European companies such as London-based Regent Holidays have been running tours  to Albania for years, working first through friendship agencies and then  through normal business arrangements. Many companies take tours out of Athens,  but to date no American companies are arranging tours from the United States.  </P> <P> Boston-based Kutrubes Travel Agency -- (617) 426-5668 -- hopes to develop such  tours in the near future. The only North American agency running full tours to  Albania is Exotik Tours of Montreal. Exotik offers seven trips between now and  November out of Toronto and Montreal, with 12- and 19-day itineraries that  visit as many as six Albanian cities and include one night in Paris.  </P> <P> Costs begin at $1,350 for the 12-day tour and $1,675 for 19 days, including Air  France flights from the Canadian cities, plus all hotels, meals, guides,  transportation and transfers. Lead time for obtaining a group visa is a minimum  of three weeks. For more information, contact Exotik Tours, 1117 St. Catherine  Street West, Suite 806, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3B 1H9, (514) 284-3324.  </P> <P> It is theoretically possible for individual travelers to visit Albania for a  day by taking the ferry from Corfu. Arrangements can be made at the ferry  terminal, although visa problems could arise.  </P> <P> Albania is a rural, agricultural country of 3.3 million with few roads or  automobiles. Understandably, the country's tourism infrastructure is not on a  par with Western Europe, but the hotels are adequate, the food is good and  guides are competent.  </P> <P> Albturist doesn't employ any full-time guides, so most are moonlighting college  or university professors.

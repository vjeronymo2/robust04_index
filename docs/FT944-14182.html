			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Gaullists try to stem infighting over presidency The increasingly aggressive edge to the rivalry for the French presidency between Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac yesterday brought yet another appeal for calm within the ruling Gaullist RPR party. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR as well as foreign minister, wrote in yesterday's Le Monde newspaper that he was 'amazed at the degradation of the political climate' in France, and urged the rivals eventually to come to some understanding about which of them should run for the Elysee. But the past week has seen Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac reject each other's overtures, and resort ever more to the dagger - and less to the cloak - in their contest to run as the main conservative standard-bearer in next May's elections. In the apparently escalating power struggle, a new threshold was crossed yesterday when, in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Balladur complained that Mr Chirac had not spoken out in support of the government's strong franc policy during the currency crisis of mid-1993 for fear of offending the RPR, of which Mr Chirac is the president. 'For a long time, Jacques has taken refuge in his party as if it were a citadel. Is this really the spirit of the Fifth Republic?', queried the prime minister. Hitherto the two rivals have avoided attaching each other's name to the darts they keep firing off. Mr Balladur's criticism of Mr Chirac concerned an incident more than a year old. However, it was couched in exactly the terms in which the Balladur camp today sees Mr Chirac's fatal weakness - that the RPR president is simply too partisan ever to win the Elysee, and that only Mr Balladur has enough cross-party appeal to thwart a possible socialist contender like Mr Jacques Delors. The opinion polls so far support this thesis. Mr Chirac's supporters hit back yesterday. Mr Jean-Louis Debre, a senior RPR politician, criticised the prime minister for his 'useless and irresponsible' words about Mr Chirac. Mr Debre reminded Mr Balladur that he had once put in writing that a prime minister should concentrate on governing and stay out of politicking for the Elysee. The prospect of an increasingly bitter and politically destabilising Gaullist civil war is, according to many bank economists in Paris, one of many factors that has caused foreigners to pull their money out of French stocks and bonds at the rate of FFr100bn (Pounds 12bn) in each of the first three quarters of this year. Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac differ more in style than policy, though over the weekend Mr Chirac raised a further question mark over his commitment to European monetary union (Emu) when he said the final decision to move to Emu should be put to a referendum, just as the Maastricht treaty had been.</p>

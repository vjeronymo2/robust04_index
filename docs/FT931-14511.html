			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: Time to appraise the role of the Group of Seven Rarely has the world economy faced so many difficulties and rarely have international policymakers appeared so incapable of dealing with them. Inadequate growth, rising unemployment, the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks and the integration of the former Communist states into the mainstream global economy pose challenges for governments in nearly all industrialised countries. Businesses everywhere talk of globalisation and interdependence. And yet nations have problems working together for a more prosperous world. The Group of Seven - the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Canada - has become a forum for squabbles. It presents a sorry picture to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the incoming US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Lawrence Summers, who is expected to become the senior US Treasury official responsible for international affairs. Mr Bentsen indicated last week that he wanted to revive the group. He could have a big task on his hands. By last year, when it had become clear that the 1990s would be no easy decade, there were hopes that adversity would foster solidarity among the G7 members. But whether on big issues, such as the Gatt trade talks, or relatively small but important matters, such as a Dollars 700m (Pounds 460.5m) fund to make safe Soviet-built nuclear power stations, the G7 record has been one of issuing fine sounding statements followed by no result, or worse, a deterioration of relations inside the group. It is as well the G7 is not obliged to issue an annual report on its activities. A year ago, finance ministers in Garden City, Long Island, pledged to strengthen world economic growth. But no initiatives followed. Indeed, all countries stuck to their existing policies. In April, Russia topped the finance ministers' agenda, partly because the G7 could not agree how to foster growth. Perhaps nobody can have a coherent answer to Russia's problems. But the G7's response of help for self-help has been niggardly compared with the support provided by Germany for the former east Germany. Well before July's Munich world economic summit, it was clear it would decide second-best solutions to the problems of sluggish global activity, the Gatt talks and support for former Soviet republics and eastern Europe. One aim of the summit had been to boost consumer and business optimism. A week after the G7 leaders returned home, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate, dealing a blow to confidence and helping to set in train last autumn's crisis in the European Monetary System. Munich showed how far the G7 member states had turned inwards. The US administration was focusing on November's election. Economic slowdown and political disarray were diverting Japan's attention. The EC countries' preoccupation with the Maastricht Treaty had intensified after the Danish referendum in June. Indeed, the EC's problems and the EMS crisis overshadowed the September meeting of G7 finance ministers which was held three days after sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism and on the eve of the French referendum on Maastricht. Admittedly 1992 was an exceptionally grim year. But the G7 had been losing muscle since the mid-1980s when the group achieved some success in stabilising currencies. Its efforts to control the dollar were successful largely because the member nations' economic policy priorities coincided and worked with the grain of the market. The group has rarely proved capable of co-ordinating policies where contentious domestic political issues are involved. The G7 has to assume that the US Congress or the Bundesbank council will not listen to its exhortations. Repeated declarations on the need for a speedy conclusion of the Gatt trade talks have failed to bring the trade negotiators to agreement. A specific weakness sapping the G7's strength is the imbalance arising from the increased strategic and political clout of the US relative to its economic power. The US is now the world's one undisputed superpower. But its share of world output has slipped to about a quarter from a half since the second world war. A decade of deficit spending under presidents Reagan and Bush has created constraints on economic policymaking. The US aspires to lead in the G7. But its economic weakness results in its policymakers usually producing ideas that require others to pay the bill. The result has been acrimonious disputes over burden sharing between Germany and the US in particular. It may be, as Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the Bonn finance ministry, suggested last week, that the vast changes in the world since 1989 have simply overstretched policymakers, in that they are having to adapt to too many problems in too short a time. Another problem is that policymakers tend to be on different wavelengths. They rarely work from internationally agreed common data and it takes time to reach a common analysis. A number of changes could improve the G7. One suggestion is to involve trade ministers in G7 talks in the same way as finance ministers. But perhaps the time has come for a more thoroughgoing appraisal of the G7. Is it simply a fair weather system: something that countries can afford when the going is easy, but are quick to dump when conditions get tougher at home? How far can the group influence the global economy when it lacks links with China and has only the loosest of ties to developing countries? Does it make sense to include four members of the EC in the G7? The jury is out on the G7. But fears that international economic and political relations could begin to resemble those of the 1930s are reason enough to hope that the international community can make more success of co-operation. Otherwise, as Mr David Hale, chief economist for the Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services, says: 'The world could drift towards a cold peace more akin to the troubled years that followed the Treaty of Versailles rather than the prosperity which followed Bretton Woods.'</p>

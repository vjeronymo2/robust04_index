			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Admiral advances 11% on market penetration boost ADMIRAL, the Surrey-based computing services company, boosted pre-tax profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.18m for the first half on the back of an improvement throughout its businesses. The shares responded via a 10p rise to 470p. Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, described the result for the six months to June 30 as 'highly satisfactory'. He noted, in particular, increased market penetration of client server technology - through which the company enhances the efficiency of computer networks by using the power of personal computers and relegating the mainframe to a database. Admiral was benefiting from related product sales and the resulting software development, training and consultancy work. Mr Brendish added that since the company was listed on the stock exchange in 1987, 80 per cent of its customers had returned to do further business. Mr Ceri James, managing director, said the first half had seen a significant advance in all its market sectors. He wasparticularly pleased with the growth in industrial and commercial business, which now accounted for more than 25 per cent of turnover. Defence accounts for 30 per cent and the financial sector for 33 per cent. Admiral has six autonomous operating companies - four in the UK, one in Australia and one in Singapore. The four UK companies provide information technology consultancy, systems development, training and software products. The group has carried out development work for the Switch debit card and for the Tracker system of identifying and recovering stolen cars. Turnover increased by almost 30 per cent to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 13.6m) and operating profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 2.06m. Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 249,000 to Pounds 129,000. Mr James said group turnover had risen on higher product sales and the larger number of staff. At the end of the half year the company employed 660 people, compared with 602 at the end of last year and 509 at the end of 1991. The Australian company was 'doing well but not as well as expected'. Earnings per share rose to 13.3p (11.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.7p to 2p.</p>

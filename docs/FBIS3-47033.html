			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Koji Watanabe, ambassador to Russia, by </F> reporter Tsuneo Kitamura; place and date not given; first  paragraph is SANKEI SHIMBUN introduction]    [Text] The fact that ultranationalist forces made great  advances in the recent election for the new Russian Federal  Assembly was a great shock to Western nations. Depending on  future political changes, Russia may become an "unstable factor  in the world." Consequently, moves have been observed within CIS  member states, East Europea, and among Western nations to  reexamine their strategies toward Russia. We asked Koji  Watanabe, newly appointed ambassador to Russia who will assume  his new post in late January, about Japan's policy toward Russia  with which there exists a territorial dispute.    [Kitamura] How do you evaluate the election results for the  new Russian Federal Assembly?    [Watanabe] The results were quite unexpected. The emergence  of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the ultranationalist leader of the  Russian Liberal Democratic Party, and the fact that the  reformists did not make sufficient efforts to communicate with  the people, were factors leading to such an outcome.    [Kitamura] Could the results have any effect on Japanese  policy toward Russia?    [Watanabe] I do not think Zhirinovskiy's "diplomatic  arguments" will be reflected in the Russian Government's  diplomatic policies. However, it is also certain the  dissatisfaction of Russians who are suffering because of their  living conditions and their nationalistic feelings are reflected  in Zhirinovskiy's remarks. Therefore, we must be cautious about  this.    [Kitamura] Could the results hamper progress in negotiations  on the territorial issue?    [Watanabe] I cannot tell. When President Boris Yeltsin  visited Japan last year, a basic framework for territorial talks  was agreed on between the leaders of the two nations. What is  important is to persistently negotiate within this framework to  strive for concrete progress.    [Kitamura] Moves have been observed among Western nations on  reexamining aid to Russia. What is your view on this?    [Watanabe] It is true some nations are on the alert, but  basically there are two opinions. The first is that more active  support should be provided to Russia, and the second is that a  few changes should be made on how such aid should be provided.  Japan maintains it should not change the basic policy on  Russian aid which has been continued so far, provided President  Yeltsin continue with his reform efforts.    [Kitamura] Voices have also been raised in Japan urging  caution regarding aid to Russia at this time. How do you feel  about this?    [Watanabe] It is very important, not only in terms of world  peace but also for Japan as a neighboring country, that Russia  develop into a stable and democratic nation. It is also of  great significance for Japan to provide support toward such a  goal together with other major industrialized nations. Of  course, I also realize the importance of public support on this  matter.    [Kitamura] What is your view on cooperation between Japan  and Russia regarding security in the Asia-Pacific region?    [Watanabe] Although Russia's existence is very important for  this region, we must discern Russia's moves in order to  determine how we can actually cooperate with Russia,  realistically speaking. After all, Russian politics is centered  in Europe.    [Kitamura] Russia has sought Japanese aid concerning its  dumping of radioactive waste at sea. What is your view on this?    [Watanabe] For its part, Japan must help Russia since  bilateral relations would be seriously affected should such  dumping reoccur.    [Kitamura] Are there any plans for Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to visit Russia?    [Watanabe] I have heard a new Russian cabinet will be  inaugurated around 10 January. Vice ministerial-level meetings  are to be held in January to prepare for Foreign Minister Hata's  visit to Russia. I hope Prime Minister Hosokawa will also be  able to visit Russia soon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's former Prime-Minister Leonid Kuchma stands  the best chance to win the presidential race. According to the  sociological service Sotcis-Gullap, 18 percent of the voters  favored his candidacy in March. In December 16.6 percent of the  voters did so.    The service polled a total of 1,200 people older than 15  throughout Ukraine to find out that Viacheslav Chernovil (10  percent in March and 9.1 percent in December) and President  Leonid Kravchuk (11 percent in March and 16.5 in December)  emerged as two other frontrunners.    The People's Rukh movement decided to refrain from running  its own presidential nominee.</p>

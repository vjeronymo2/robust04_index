			<p>BFN     [Text] Implementing the party Central Committee's third  plenum resolution on renovating and revamping the party, the  nation has made encouraging achievements over the past two years  in its efforts to train and develop newly-recruited party  members. Almost 50,000 new party members were admitted during  1993, an increase of 38 percent over the previous year. Among  these, 43 percent were admitted by grassroots party  organizations, the highest percentage in several years.    The An Giang provincial party organization has concentrated  its efforts on developing party chapters in hamlets and housing  clusters. In 1993, about 50 percent of the province's  newly-recruited party members came from rural areas. Many came  from 21 of the 26 hamlets that had never before admitted party  members.    Party organizations in Thai Binh and Hai Hung Provinces also  admitted more members as a result of their efforts in holding  refresher courses for cadres responsible for recruiting new  party members.    Party organizations in the Army have paid special attention  to recruiting officers, non-commissioned officers, and national  defense and professional personnel. In 1993, the Army admitted  more than 8,000 new party members, 95 percent of them under the  age of 30.</p>

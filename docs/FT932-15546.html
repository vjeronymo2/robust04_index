			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / City shudders over Mackie case: A look at the trial's repercussions THE CONVICTION of Mr Thorold Mackie, an investment analyst with Edinburgh stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White, for insider dealing has sent ripples of concern far beyond the Scottish financial community. Some City analysts believe the case calls into question the basis on which they can meet company directors. It has come at an awkward time for the government, which is seeking to persuade the City that it has nothing to fear from moves to widen the scope of legislation in this area. Mr Mackie, 39, was fined Pounds 25,000 after being found guilty of using confidential information that the Glasgow-based waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan was intending to issue a profit warning in 1991. He was accused of 'counselling and procuring' two colleagues to sell the company's shares for clients, saving the clients Pounds 1.39m by acting ahead of the announcement. The analyst denied that he was told about a formal profit warning by Mr Peter Runciman, then chairman of Shanks, when they met 13 days before a profit warning was issued to the Stock Exchange. Mr Mackie said he downgraded his profit forecast for the company after being told by the chairman that there 'would be little by way of growth in earnings per share', but insisted he would have remained silent if he had been made an 'insider' in the manner suggested. People in the Edinburgh investment community are still reeling from the guilty verdict in the case, partly because of their personal knowledge of Mr Mackie and partly out of concern about the verdict's implications for analysts and the investment business in general. An investment analyst in Edinburgh who did not wish to identified said: 'Knowing Thorold Mackie I find it as inconceivable that he would have done what he is convicted of doing.' He added: 'An analyst would prick up his ears at the very mention of the words 'profit warning' and Thorold would have come back from the meeting and not told a soul. He would have gone straight to his compliance officer. 'Equally, knowing Peter Runciman I find it inconceivable that he would lie. It looks like a misunderstanding.' The Stock Exchange, which investigated Mr Mackie's actions, insists the case 'is no signal whatsoever. It does not change the law'. The government is, however, currently widening the scope of legislation against insider dealing through the Criminal Justice Bill, bringing the UK into line with a 1989 European Community directive. After protests from the City and industry Treasury ministers have been forced on to the defensive, giving reassurances in the Commons that the government has no intention to alter present market practice fundamentally. In particular, the government has stressed that there should be no threat to meetings with analysts, when directors answer questions and give guidance on a company's performance and prospects. The authorities say there is a clear distinction between such briefings and the handing over of price-sensitive information. The distinction can seem a fine one. Share prices routinely move after briefings to analysts which alter stock market views of a company's performance. Analysts act as the eyes and ears of the investment institutions which own most of the British equity market. The market dislikes surprises, so companies often prefer to fine-tune expectations through analysts rather than to issue profit warnings or other information direct to the Stock Exchange. The Mackie case highlights the grey area between the strict letter of the law and market practice. Both sides in the Mackie trial accepted that an offence would indeed have occurred if Mr Mackie had acted on the basis of advance notice of a profit warning. The jury clearly preferred Mr Runciman's version of events. As the two men met alone, it was difficult to establish sufficient corroboration of what was said - a point the pending appeal is likely to focus on. The members of the jury were told by the judge that they could take into account the surrounding facts and circumstances - particularly Mr Mackie's telling colleagues of the reduced profit outlook, which caused them to advise clients to sell. What alarmed investment analysts was that Mr Mackie's behaviour after the meeting also seemed entirely consistent with his version of events. A fellow Edinburgh analyst said: 'I would have to resign if I were to alter my behaviour as a result of this verdict. If I took it literally I would have to take a tape recorder to every meeting with a company I went to, and agree a written summary of what was said.' The case has caused unease partly because regulatory authorities have been trying to give the reassurance that the new legislation will not 'start a witch-hunt', and have been urging the City to be reassured by how few prosecutions have been mounted in this area. Mr Mackie is the first analyst to be charged under the 1985 Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. A total of 35 prosecutions have been launched under the act in the past five years, producing only 12 convictions. The same Edinburgh analyst said: 'What worries me is the fact that the government chose to mount a prosecution in this case. That makes me feel no-one is safe. 'It's symptomatic of a government that doesn't understand the City and is substituting legalism for morality,' he added.</p>

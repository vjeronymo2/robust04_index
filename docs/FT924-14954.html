			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Longer leading index falls BRITAIN'S longer leading index, which pinpoints turning points in economic activity 10 months in advance by tracking a number of different economic indicators, fell for the third consecutive month in August, suggesting that the recovery is not yet under way. The shorter leading index, which highlights turning points about four months in advance, suggests more optimistic prospects for the economy. It has risen steadily since the beginning of the year. The Central Statistical Office said the 0.3 per cent fall in the longer leading indicator mainly reflected a fall in share prices.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (19): Firms criticised over fees and standard of advice - Ray Bashford examines the role of foreign advisers INTERNATIONAL advice to Poland is not in short supply. Most of the international auditing, accounting and consultancy firms which flocked to eastern Europe at the start of the decade have nested in Warsaw. Their main task has been to revise auditing and accounting methods and standards to conform with EC practice; and prepare state owned companies for privatisation and sale to foreign and local investors. But the activities of highly paid foreign advisers have come in for criticism both over the standard of advice on offer and the fees charged. Some western firms echo these harsh words, but only in veiled reference to their competitors. Mr Jurgen M. Wilms, the principal at McKinsey, the firm of management consultants, says: 'We call some of the early consulting work 'gold rush consultancy.' Two years ago, he adds, the demand from the government and from companies was unlimited. 'This is over,' he says. 'Now the international agencies are spending money more carefully and the Poles, through experience, are becoming much more critical of the sort of advice they are getting.' Western companies working here are reluctant to detail their own charges, but justify their fees on grounds of their higher skill levels, greater experience and the need to recoup heavy start-up costs on training and development. Mr Jon Newbery of Arthur Andersen, the firm of accountants, is one who argues that the benefits received by Polish firms fully justify his firm's fees. Another consultant, who declined to be named, backs him, but cited a recent case of a Polish firm which concluded that a local bank was profitable. 'We went in and found that it made losses of about 60 times the estimated profit. If someone had bought that bank they would have been in real trouble,' he said. Bain and Company, which undertook sectoral analysis in the detergents, cables, industrial gases and the telecommunications industries, claims that for each Dollars 1 in fees it has earned the state treasury Dollars 50 in revenues from subsequent acquisitions and capital investment. Ms Henryka Bochniarz, a former industry minister who is president of Nicom, one of Poland's leading management consultants is an outspoken critic of foreign firms. But she also blames the ministry of privatisation for ignoring Polish firms with greater local knowledge. 'With money supplied from international funds the government used exclusively foreign firms,' she says. 'The government ignored the advantage we had of knowing how some of these companies worked - particularly at the time when people were afraid to talk because they might get into trouble.' She adds that exclusion from this work means that local firms have been denied the transfer of knowledge which would strengthen domestic standards and she further points out that this is contrary to the government's general rule of obtaining maximum knowledge and skill transfers. Mrs Bochniarz also believes that certain leading international auditing firms and investment banks offered second-rate management consultancy work during the early years. She quotes a recent government study which concluded that advice on all aspects of the privatisation of an average Polish firm with a staff of 1000 carried out by a local firm would cost ZL400m (Dollars 25,000), compared with ZL2bn charged by foreign advisers. Foreign advisers reply that the benefits of their work are sometimes not fully appreciated because the government sits on their findings. Meanwhile foreign accountancy and management consultancy firms are highly complimentary about the motivation and educational standards of their local employees, as they expand recruitment of cheaper local staff. But this also has its negative effects. Government ministries - especially the finance ministry, which is recruiting extra tax and customs officers - complain about losing promising staff to foreign firms which offer substantially higher salaries together with international training. Universities are also hunting grounds for prospective staff. For example, Arthur Andersen is hiring 50 graduates, which will raise its total staffing level in Warsaw to 165 by the end of the year. Only 15 of these will be expatriates, compared with 17 during the first year of operations, when the firm's total work force was only 34 people. Mr Newbery insists that his company is now a Polish company with a foreign parent; he forecasts that the first Polish national will be made a partner within three years. Mr Antoni F. Reczek, an Anglo-Pole, talks of a similar rate of growth at the accountancy firm of Cooper &amp; Lybrand, where total staff numbers should rise from 85 to 100 by the end of the year. Only 12 are expatriates. Similarly, McKinsey and Company, which opened its office in Warsaw last February, is giving international training to 20 locally hired staff as it raises standards and gives local staff greater responsibility. Mr Wilms sums up: 'My job is to make myself obsolete.'</p>

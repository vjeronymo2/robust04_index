			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Recovery 'quicker than expected' in W Midlands A QUICKER-than-expected recovery from recession is leading to demands from the west Midlands that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should avoid large increases in tax or cuts in expenditure in the Budget. The latest survey of regional business performance from Wolverhampton and Warwick business schools and Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, shows that more than half of the 1,022 companies in the survey increased profits, and more than a third took on more labour over the last six months. 'Major employers, during the last six months, appear to have ceased the haemorrhage of labour which has taken place over the last three years,' says the analysis, published today. The survey shows west Midlands business more optimistic than at any time since winter 1990. There is a distinct difference from the east Midlands, where a similar exercise indicated a slowdown in the pace of recovery. In the west Midlands the proportion of manufacturing companies working at full capacity has increased steadily to 29 per cent; in the east Midlands it dropped from 27 per cent in the spring to 20 per cent. Assuming that annual economic growth will be higher than the 1.25 per cent forecast in the last Budget, the survey suggests that Mr Clarke is under less pressure to cut the public sector borrowing requirement. Growth can save him from 'having to make too many unpopular decisions', it says. 'It would be folly to kill this recovery by over-reacting when a light hand on the tiller would be more effective.'

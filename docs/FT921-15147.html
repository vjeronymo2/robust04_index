			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Hopes of growth continue to wane ECONOMISTS' expectations of UK growth this year are on the slide. The latest survey of UK forecasts by Consensus Economics, a company that monitors economic forecasts in 30 countries, shows that growth in Britain is expected to be only 1.4 per cent this year. As recently as New Year's Eve the Financial Times's survey of 23 forecasters produced a consensus forecast of 1.7 per cent growth for UK gross domestic product this year. Consensus Economics' survey of 34 forecasting bodies was carried out on January 6. Its average forecast of 1.4 per cent compares with the company's previous consensus forecast in December of 1.7 per cent growth and the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast of 2.3 per cent GDP growth this year. The survey reflects growing pessimism about the UK economy among leading economists since the start of the year. Warburg Securities, for example, cut its projection for this year's GDP growth sharply this week to 0.8 per cent from 2 per cent, adding that it expected growth of only 0.4 per cent in non-oil GDP. Consensus Economics said the lower growth expectations reflected weak consumer confidence and demand, continued problems in the housing sector, softer export market growth and last month's tightening of monetary policy by the German Bundesbank, which has frustrated hopes of lower British interest rates. The Consensus survey also came after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, admitted that the government's Autumn Statement forecast was 'somewhat over-optimistic'. Yesterday Mr Lamont began a two-day meeting to discuss the economy and the March Budget with Treasury ministers and officials. The survey indicated that economists expected some recovery this year and a quickening of GDP growth to about 2.4 per cent next year.</p>

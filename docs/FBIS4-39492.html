			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crimean Supreme Soviet decided today to set up a  new working group for further talks with Kiev and to define its  authority.    The parliament's presidium will put forward candidacies for  participation in the delegation by the next regular meeting  which will take place in a week (on 17 June).    This decision was adopted after most of Crimean deputies had  withheld their approval of the final document signed by the  Crimean parliament working group and the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet deputy commission signed on 3 June and stating that  Crimea was a part of Ukraine.    The working group on the coordination of Ukrainian and the  Crimean legislation was established last week in Simferopol in  order to put forward proposals on coordination of the Ukrainian  and Crimean constitutions by 15 June.    Crimean Chief Negotiator Sergey Nikulin stated that some  pro-Russian deputies though it was necessary to sign a document  with more decisive formulas mentioning Crimea as an independent  republic.    However, Nikulin said that the Ukrainian and the Crimean  delegations had tried to prevent forceful methods of settlement  of the discord in the legislation.    The present conflict between Kiev and Simferopol emerged  after the Crimean parliament had restored the Crimean  Constitution in its version of 6 May 1992, providing for a  treaty basis for relations with Ukraine and for dual citizenship  for Crimeans.</p>

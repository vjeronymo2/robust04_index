			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Run-of-the-mill debates - The Nordic pulp industry is under pressure to change its bleaching methods When it comes to stirring up public antipathy towards the pulp and paper industry, a picture of a horribly maimed fish goes a long way. Or so Greenpeace in Germany found several years ago, when as part of a campaign to promote 'totally chlorine-free' (TCF) pulp and paper production, it put out a spoof version of the magazine Der Spiegel, complete with photographs claiming to show the devastating impact which pulp mill effluents could have on marine life. It must rank as one of German Greenpeace's most successful campaigns. By common consent, the environmental organisation did much to create the consumer pressure which has forced many German publishers, paper manufacturers and merchants to go 'totally chlorine-free' in the last two years. This in turn has forced a number of pulp mills which supply the German market to find substitute bleaching agents for the chlorine compounds they use. 'German Greenpeace took the initiative against chlorine and it has succeeded,' says Pertti Laine, director of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation's industrial and environmental unit. 'We have had to invest billions of markka to change our bleaching methods.' The latest in a long line of such investments will come on stream next month when Metsa-Botnia's Kaskinen mill in western Finland inaugurates a new ozone bleaching plant as part of its commitment to TCF production. At least 10 Nordic pulp mills now have the capacity to produce TCF pulp, and nearly all of them have started these operations in the last couple of years. The investments have had to be made despite the severe financial squeeze which has gripped the industry as the pulp price has plummeted from more than Dollars 800 (Pounds 570) a tonne in 1989 to the Dollars 400 a tonne level which prevails today. The impetus has come because 'nobody can afford to lose the German market', according to Richard Cockram, a consultant with the UK company NLK Consultants. Germany is not the only country where environmentalists are pressing for TCF. Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, as well as the Nordic countries are all now leading consumers of TCF pulp, helping TCF's share of Europe's graphic papers market to more than double from seven per cent to 15 per cent in the past year. But the trend has been much slower to catch on in the UK, France, Italy and other European countries, where consumers have been reluctant to pay extra for TCF. There is no doubt that TCF pulp production costs more, simply because it requires substantial investment in new machinery. Thus the pulp mill wants a TCF premium from the paper manufacturer, who wants one from the publisher, who in turn wants one from the end-customer. This may be relatively easy to achieve in buoyant markets. But during the recession it has undoubtedly caused a squeeze which means not everyone in the chain is receiving the premium they require. Hans Burmeister, marketing director of Sweden's Sodra Cell, the biggest supplier of TCF market pulp in Europe, says his company is generally managing to obtain the DM100-DM150 (Pounds 41-Pounds 62) per tonne premium from German customers which it needs to cover its additional costs. But the premium is only relative to a very depressed general pulp price, he notes. The recession has also intensified the debate about the most effective and cost-efficient TCF bleaching process. Some mills just use hydrogen peroxide, but this is very costly; some use a combination of hydrogen peroxide and enzymes, but the pulp produced is less bright. More recently, a number of mills have started using ozone, as this enhances pulp brightness. But the development has not been universally welcomed because the gas is very reactive and highly poisonous. A more fundamental debate centres on whether TCF is any more environmentally-friendly than the ECF (elemental chlorine-free) bleaching process it is replacing. The latter uses chlorine dioxide and is far less damaging to the environment than elemental chlorine which is being rapidly phased out. In modern ECF mills, emissions of chlorine compounds can be as low as 0.3kg-0.4kg per tonne of pulp produced, which is well below the 50kg level common only a few years ago. A study by a group of Canadian scientists has added spice to the ECF/TCF debate. It has found evidence of fish being damaged by pulp mill effluents, irrespective both of the bleaching process used and whether it carries out any bleaching at all. It concludes there is something toxic in pulp-mill effluent, but that this cannot be attributed to the bleaching plant. The question is whether such studies will slow growth in TCF demand or merely change the focus of the debate from chlorine dioxide to the wider issue of effluent-free pulping. Christoph Thies, a paper specialist with Greenpeace in Hamburg, is confident the trend towards TCF is irreversible. He gives two reasons for his view. First, increased recycling will create pressure for cleaner input of raw material. Second, he says that chlorine has to be eliminated if pulp mills are to achieve their wider ambition of totally enclosing their water systems so that they discharge no liquid effluent at all. 'TCF is only a step on the way to an effluent-free mill,' he states. The view that TCF demand will continue to grow is supported by NLK Consultants, although it notes that this is a European issue and has not yet become an important concern in the US. It believes European demand for TCF pulp will grow from 1.8m tonnes in 1993, a 15 per cent market share, to 3.2m tonnes in 1996, a 25 per cent share. But its predictions also show a persistent gap between consumption in the German-speaking and Nordic markets and the rest of Europe. It expects 70 per cent of the fine paper consumed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and the Nordic states to be TCF grade in 1996 against only 10 per cent for the rest of Europe.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Most Muni/Coops, some IOUs, and some NUGs/IPPs support postage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamp rates and criticize distance-sensitive pricing due to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependence upon power flow studies involving a base and a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case. Many commenters note that power flows on a transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system are in constant change, thereby creating a very large number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of possible system parameters that could be included in load flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses and therefore requiring many simplifying assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, any attempt to derive a normal base case power flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on which to model an incremental power flow would be flawed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unreliable, particularly for individual utilities located in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavily interconnected networks. Therefore, these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prefer the administrative convenience of postage stamp rates over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the complexity and questionable accuracy of distance-sensitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates based on power flow studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Contract Path Versus Measured Power Flows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The mismatch between the contract path for a transaction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the actual flows creates pricing and equity concerns. Utilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are split regionally on whether to adopt loop flow, or parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> path, pricing reform or retain contract path pricing. Most Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilities favor retaining contract path pricing. Western utilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain that the topology of the WSCC makes it well suited to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of phase shifters to control the loop flow problem. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the development of Flexible AC Transmission technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may provide additional devices to augment existing control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many utilities in the Midwest and the East favor adopting loop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow pricing because over time contract path pricing has left many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems uncompensated for parallel flows. These utilities argue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contract path pricing is outmoded because (1) transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services have become long-term single direction transactions, (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many new market entities do not own transmission so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reciprocity is not possible, and (3) negotiated solutions are less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible as competition expands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many utilities in favor of loop flow pricing are concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the associated transition costs are formidable. Parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flows constantly change with changes in the dispatch of generation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, some utilities urge the development of RTGs first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before implementing loop flow pricing. In fact, there is general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement that RTGs are an appropriate institution for addressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many of the industry's problems including pricing issues and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> siting and construction of transmission facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While there is widespread dissatisfaction with contract path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing outside of the West, there is considerable uncertainty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about how to address the parallel flow problem effectively. Many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties believe that contract path pricing and loop flow pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be combined to address the problem, while other parties believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these two methods are incompatible. Still other parties offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an array of variations on the contract path pricing and loop flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing methods. For example, Hogan's ``contract network'' approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and PacifiCorp's proposal are variations on the contract path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing method. The GAPP experiment, which the Interregional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transmission Coordination Forum stresses as the way to identify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing method to compensate for parallel flows, is a preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of loop flow pricing. The Texas Planned Capacity Wheeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service and Southern Company's Transmission Cost Actual Path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pricing are also examples of loop flow pricing. Finally, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties argue that alternatives to contract path pricing should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursued on a voluntary basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Spot Pricing for Non-firm Transmission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Few commenters express outright opposition to spot pricing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but most advocate a cautious approach to implementation. Those in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the latter category comprise a diverse group of IOUs (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEI), coops, state commissions and industrial groups. Many suggest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that spot pricing schemes should continue to be studied, but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered for implementation at this time. Some encourage the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission to conduct experiments similar to the Southwest Bulk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Power Experiment and the WSPP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those opposed to spot pricing generally believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits are not worth the costs. Some argue that the successful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of spot pricing for transmission requires a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive market in generation that does not now exist. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some commenters that see promise in spot pricing argue that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary market institutions and technology exist today. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cite the operation of tight power pools, electronic bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boards, and the WSCC experiment as evidence of this fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters argue that the ``up to'' transmission rates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many utilities now use for non-firm transmission service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively approximate spot transmission pricing. However, others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that rate design for spot transmission pricing raises a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of difficult issues, such as the use of one-part versus two-part rates, and the appropriate definition of the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

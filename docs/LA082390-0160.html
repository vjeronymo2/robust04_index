Under an agreement announced Wednesday, Columbia  University will also use half of the building as a biotechnology center.  </P> <P> The university had wanted to tear down the Audubon Ballroom in Washington  Heights, where Malcolm X was slain 25 years ago, but agreed to the compromise  under pressure from a citywide coalition of black activists.  </P></p>

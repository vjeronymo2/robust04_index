			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON: ANGLERS ENJOYING BEST BARRACUDA RUN IN OVER A DECADE  </P> <P> Barracuda fishing is setting the pace this summer.  </P> <P> Fishermen are enjoying one of the best runs since 1977 when a 28-inch limit  went into effect.  </P> <P> According to marine supervisor Don Schultze of the Department of Fish and Game,  if the size limit had not been established, this year's big run may never have  occurred.  </P> <P> "The catches now being made are similar to those recorded in the 1950s and '60s  and may go higher," Schultze said.  </P> <P> Before 1971 there was no size limit, Schultze said. Marine biologists pushed  for limits because they were concerned about future barracuda stocks.  </P> <P> Barracuda is a migratory fish that puts up a good fight when hooked. It is one  of the most sought after spring and summer game fish.  </P> <P> The bite continues in a wide area. South Bay anglers have been catching the  daily 10-fish limit on day and twilight trips to Rocky Point, the Horseshoe  Kelp Beds and at Catalina Island.  </P> <P> Traditionally, July is albacore-watch month. The tasty white-meat tuna could  arrive at any time and rumors often fly as to their whereabouts. But no big  sightings have been made yet and private boat and landing owners are getting  nervous.  </P> <P> The Redondo Sportfishing half-day boat City of Redondo returns to the landing  Saturday after a year-and-a-half of refurbishing. The boat was heavily damaged  by the storms that wracked King Harbor and destroyed part of the breakwater in  January, 1988.  </P> <P> The American Bass Assn. is sponsoring its first On-The-Wall Saltwater  Tournament at Cabrillo Beach on Saturday night. Check-in time for skiffs is 4  p.m. at the Cabrillo launch area. Fishing begins at 6. Weigh-ins will be at 1  a.m. Sunday. Two fishermen are allowed per skiff and $500 in prizes will be  awarded. For more information call Dave at 376-1026.  </P> <P> CATCHES OF THE WEEK:  </P> <P> William Miller of Gardena, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the Rigs, caught  the Whopper of the Week when he hooked a 31 1/4-pound yellowtail using sardine  as bait.  </P> <P> Al Contreas of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Happyman in the bay, caught a  25-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Jeff Dubuys of Torrance, aboard the Sea Spray at Twin Roads, hooked a 23-pound  halibut.  </P> <P> Wilber Johannes of Long Beach caught 21-pound white sea bass at Catalina Island  on the El Dorado.  </P> <P> FISHING REPORT:  </P> <P> Surface action for sand bass and barracuda remains steady. Catalina white sea  bass action has slowed, with calico bass and barracuda making up most of the  catches.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing, the Happyman on two half-day trips brought in  225 sand bass, 75 barracuda, nine bonito and one halibut. The Spitfire fished  the bay and anglers hooked 260 sand bass, 80 bonito and a halibut.

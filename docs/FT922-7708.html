			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: Scales of excellence for fish THE WRITING is on the wall: Europe will soon be awash with AOCs, DOCs and DOGs - government certificates applied to every form of quality food and drink. It appears to have been the Spanish who first had the bright idea of taking the Denominacion de origen used for their wines and extending it to food, but the French were not slow to catch on. Now Brussels is learning of the pressing need to protect the best Norman carrots with an appellation controlee. If they succeed, the carrots will enjoy a similar stature to the best of burgundy or claret. And where are the British in all this? Simply nowhere. There isn't even a working translation for appellation controlee. These thoughts occurred to me as I was tucking into some of the best lamb I had ever tasted. The lamb came from the Shetland Islands; from a dwarf, native breed which feeds on seaweed. This gives the flesh a delicacy of flavour which outstrips even the famous salt-meadow lamb of the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy. Yet no one seems to have had the idea of marketing it elsewhere in the British Isles. Shetland Salmon is a further case. There are now 59 salmon farms in the Shetland Islands making what is acknowledged to be the best of all British farmed salmon. However, once again there has been no move to integrate the salmon into the European quality system bar awarding the fish a quality seal on the islands themselves. It was indeed salmon and not lamb which took me to the Shetlands. I accompanied a party of Master Chefs led by their president, the Earl of Bradford. All the chefs agreed that salmon was too good a seller to be limited to the wild salmon season; all except one had used farmed salmon when no wild fish was available; all of them left the Shetland Islands impressed with what they had seen. Pretty well all the chefs admitted a preference for wild fish, but they had reservations: a young grilse was too small and tasteless, while an old fish caught in the river was of no use at all. If the quality of farmed fish was never equal to the strong flavour of the best wild salmon, it was always better than the worst wild fish. One of the chief problems up to now, however, has been the oiliness of farmed fish. This oil comes from their feed, which is made up of shrimps and fish offal and their indolent, idle lives. With a farmed salmon, Gerald Roser of Rosers in St Leonards told me, you had to be pragmatic. If it was oily you marinated it and served it as gravad lax. Martin Lam of London's Escargot agreed, except that he felt the solution was to grill the oily fish, and grilling accorded well with modern conceptions of how salmon should be prepared. The oiliness of the tame salmon, however, may soon be a thing of the past. Efforts are now being made to lessen the oil content in the feed and to starve the fish for three weeks prior to slaughter, thus ensuring that the fish uses up some of its oil. Tests will determine the oil content so that it will be possible to choose an oily fish for grilling or the barbecue or a drier fish for poaching. The oil was also a result of the overcrowding in the pens, the best of which are out at sea in the Shetland voes or bays. In farms like that of Gibbie Johnson in Vidlin efforts have been made to give the salmon more room to swim about. It is still not ideal, however, and a submerged camera shows the rather miserable fish looking like commuters on the London Underground, only occasionally rising to the surface for a spirited leap before returning to the crowded depths. The fish may feel it's a dog's life, but the system appeals to the many local otters. John White of the Shetland Salmon Company told me that the otters managed to get into the pens and take random bites out of the fish they found too large to lift. They took the smaller fish on to the pen walkway and there enjoyed an al fresco picnic. The farms have served the local community. The Islands' population has dwindled to about 25,000 over the past decades, with many of the crofters emigrating to New Zealand where life is somewhat less arduous compared to farming this beautiful windswept archipelago. First came the oil, then the salmon farms. Now a ghillie working for Gibbie Johnson earns as much as Pounds 20,000 a year and doesn't risk his life out on the high seas. An appellation controlee (or whatever you call that in English) might be a fine reward for the people who have revitalised the agricultural vocation of this most distant outpost of the British Isles.

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / STEVE HARVEY  </P> <P> As celebrity endorsers, actors James Garner and Jack Lemmon were on the winning  side in the primary, recording TV ads opposing Propositions 118 and 119, the  reapportionment proposals.  </P> <P> But another Hollywood celebrity, Jack Klugman, didn't fare as well.  </P> <P> Klugman posed with a candidate for Riverside County coroner in newspaper ads  that proclaimed: "Coroner Quincy says: 'Tom Decker's My Man. He's a Cut Above  the Rest." Decker finished fourth, or as "Coroner Quincy" might have ruled,  dead last.  </P> <P> More than a dozen stunned constituents telephoned county Supervisor Kenneth  Hahn to confess they thought they were voting for him when they cast ballots  for Kenneth P. Hahn for county assessor.  </P> <P> "One person said he was really shocked when he saw a man making a speech on TV  and the name 'Kenneth P. Hahn' flashed under his picture," laughed Lynn  Sakamoto, a spokesman for Hahn, the supervisor.  </P> <P> The Other Hahn, a deputy assessor not related to the supervisor, surprised  himself and those ubiquitous "political observers" by nearly outpolling  incumbent John J. Lynch. The two will face each other in a runoff.  </P> <P> Not all of the Other Hahn's supporters thought he and the supervisor were the  same person. Lela Batiste, a secretary in the supervisor's office, said she  heard from a couple of callers with a different message.  </P> <P> "They congratulated him (Kenneth P. Hahn)," she said, "because they thought he  was the supervisor's son."  </P> <P> The surprising result in the assessor's primary no doubt has incumbent Lynch  wondering what he has to do to get a little name recognition around here.  </P> <P> After all, since taking office, Lynch is believed to have set a record for  county officeholders by affixing his name to 17 doors in the halls of the Hall  of Administration.  </P> <P> The owners of Western Exchange Inc. in Hollywood say they've been receiving  other people's mail for months. Letters intended for companies ranging from the  Screen Actors Guild to the publisher of a bondage magazine. Letters addressed  to destinations ranging from Fullerton to Bakersfield.  </P> <P> "We're worried that the letters we send out haven't reached their destinations,  either," said Executive Vice President Robert Kundel.  </P> <P> The Postal Service says it's trying to iron out the problems.  </P> <P> Western Exchange has reason to be concerned about mail deliveries. And so do  its addressees.  </P> <P> The company's a collection agency.  </P> <P> Over the years, artist David Rose has fashioned courtroom sketches of such  defendants as Patty Hearst, John DeLorean and Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie.  </P> <P> Now he's recording scenes from a trial of endurance -- construction on Metro  Rail's Red Line project.  </P> <P> "I started getting seriously interested in drawing construction work about 15  years ago," Rose said. "The workers on a construction site don't put on any  airs -- what you see is what you get. As an artist, that's very refreshing."  </P> <P> Rose's collection of pastels and watercolors are on display in "The Subway  Builders," an exhibit in the Bridge Gallery connecting City Hall with City Hall  East.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, we await the verdict on Metro Rail.  </P> <P> In the last several months, Southern Californians have introduced a  drive-through supermarket, debated over whether to make a carwash a cultural  monument, and proposed building a monument over the Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> But Chicago columnist Mike Royko and other needling Southland-ologists needn't  fear that we're running out of innovations.  </P> <P> In fact, just the other day, a memo was circulated introducing a new entree at  the L.A Times cafeteria . . .  </P> <P> Tofu enchiladas.  </P> <P> We're so excited that we've decided to start an Only in L.A. menu  item-of-the-week survey.  </P> <P> P.S. to applicants: We already know about kosher burritos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The term "smog" is believed to have first been used by L.A. newspapers on Sept.  18, 1944, though there were reports of "smoke nuisances" in the sky in July,  1943.  </P></p>

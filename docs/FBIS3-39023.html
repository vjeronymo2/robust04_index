And  yet, with regard to Bosnia, they have done everything. They  have feigned humanitarian anger and engaged in the flights of  fancy of an armchair colonel. Not forgetting, of course, to be  photographed in Sarajevo -- the scene of all the crimes.    All the governments, from Left to Right, from Washington to  Paris, and including London, are as bad as each other. All were  guilty of the same negligence. And in a few days, France has  managed to change the situation. It has been immediately  followed by the United States. Together, they have proposed to  their NATO partners that they give the Serbs between 7 and 10  days to withdraw their artillery to a radius of 20 km around  Sarajevo. Failing which, the West will carry out air strikes.    It is all perfectly clear. Of course, one would have wished  that this determination had been displayed earlier. It would  have spared many human lives in Bosnia. The West is arriving  late, but it is arriving. Moreover, this is thanks to France.  Although it has old habits in the sphere of passive diplomacy,  it is sometimes capable of going into action. That is what  happened last Sunday following the massacre at the Sarajevo  market, when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe forcefully asked NATO  to send an ultimatum to the Serbs.    Until then the Western countries had hypocritically passed  the Bosnian buck among them. At regular intervals, the United  States turned accusingly toward Europe. And the reverse was  true. If one could do nothing it was because of the other's  impotence. The two then agreed to point the finger at their new  scapegoat -- the United Nations -- although they were its  guardians. Their caution and duplicity eventually became  criminal.    The months went by and then the years. And the shells  continued to fall on the civilian populations, as on Gravelotte  [scene of battle in Franco-Prussian War 1870-1871]. Each time  the pressure mounted in the international sphere, the  Machiavellian Serbs took a step backward and the West returned  to its concerns. Yesterday, during the NATO meeting, they  repeated the same farce. By concluding with the Bosnians an  "immediate cease-fire" agreement in Sarajevo, and by accepting  the principle of the withdrawal of heavy weapons which will be  placed under the control of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].    For the first time in a long time, therefore, it is France  which has led the field. Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Balladur were  on the same wavelength, the foreign minister was able to  convince some people, intimidate others, establish alliances,  and above all form a bloc with the United States. The  international community could no longer sit back and watch the  Bosnian tragedy while 28,000 Blue Helmets -- potential hostages  -- were intended to intervene between the warring sides. Nobody  yet knows how the story will end: Mr. Juppe in particular and  our country in general will at least have made some attempt.    It is often by preparing for war that you make peace....</p>

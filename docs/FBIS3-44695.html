			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Deputy Premier  and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said here today that  Sino-Japanese cooperation in the coming years should be  future-oriented and conducive to world peace and prosperity.    In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Hata noted that  friendly Sino-Japanese relations, which were normalized in 1972,  have entered a new phase and should be broadened for the benefit  of the international community.    Hata, who leaves for Beijing tomorrow on an official visit,  reiterated Japan's support for China's reform and modernization  drive.    "A long-term and sustainable economic development in China  is  of vital importance," he observed. "China's bid for a socialist  market economy, if it succeeds, will have a significant bearing  on the global economy, and on peace and stability in Asia and  the world at large."    He discounted the threat of China's military buildup, saying  China will not "go for big-military power status" despite its  efforts toward arms modernization.    On the question of Tokyo-Taiwan ties, the foreign minister  said that the Japanese Government has been committed to  maintaining only non-official contact with Taiwan since 1972.    Although there are divergent views on the issue in his  country, Hata noted that Japan's Taiwan policy is unchanged, and  promised that it will remain so in the future.</p>

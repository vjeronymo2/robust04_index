			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Drive to save wildlife 'would cost Pounds 800m' Arresting the extinction of species of wildlife in the UK would cost Pounds 800m, the price of a few miles of motorway, Professor Bob May of Oxford University told the British Association yesterday. He pointed out that most of the species that have existed on the planet are already extinct - the difference is that in the past 100 years the rate of extinctions has been 100 to 1,000 times as fast as it is in the fossil record. In Britain there have been some isolated successes, such as the reintroduction of the red kite and the sea eagle. But many other species were in danger of extinction. Farmland birds such as the tree sparrow, the linnet and the partridge are in precipitous decline, and a host of insects and invertebrates are vanishing fast, he said. Dr Jeremy Thomas of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology told the conference that if present trends continued, one third of the UK's butterfly species would disappear within 50 years. Prof May, one of the world's leading population biologists, said the main species under threat in the UK were birds and invertebrates. Most of the mammals remaining in Britain were safe from extinction, although most of the really exciting ones which once lived in the UK - such as the wolf, the beaver and the bear - had been extinct for hundreds of years. Prof May said there were proposals to reintroduce wolves on the island of Rum, in the Inner Hebrides, where there were enough free-living deer to support a viable wolf population. Beavers, which would improve several wetland habitats could be introduced on a much wider scale. However, at present there were no definite plans to reintroduce either species. According to Professor John Lawton of Imperial College in London, our present nature reserves are 'too few, too isolated, and frequently too poorly managed' to allow effective conservation. The decline in the butterfly population is as severe in nature reserves as it is elsewhere.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON;  </P> <P> DEVIATED SEPTUMS  </P> <P> Question: At first my husband thought he must have a cold because his nose was  always stopped up. When the stuffiness didn't clear up within a couple of  weeks, he was certain he had an allergy.  </P> <P> When that didn't clear up within a couple of months, he went to his doctor and  was told he had a deviated septum. I'd like to know what that is, what causes  it, and how common it is.  </P> <P> Answer: Obstruction of the nasal passage, as with a deviated septum, is not  uncommon. As in your husband's case, many people tend to attribute nasal  congestion to a cold or an allergy. Quite often they don't think of seeing a  physician until they begin to realize that they are not being helped with  medication. The symptoms of nasal obstruction include breathing through the  mouth, noisy breathing, and an inability to breathe deeply.  </P> <P> Some nasal passage obstructions, such as a deviated septum, are due to injury;  some may have occurred at the time of birth. In individuals with a deviated  septum, the wall dividing the two nostrils is pushed to one side so that one of  the passages is blocked.  </P></p>

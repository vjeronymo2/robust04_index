			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TODAY'S QUOTE  </P> <P> "The bomb was built to kill and he had the bomb, so we felt that if the  officers made a mistake, it just wasn't important."  </P> <P>  -- Unnamed juror in the trial of makeup artist Donald Lee Morse, convicted of  murder in the deaths of two police officers killed while dismantling a pipe  bomb in Morse's basement. Although the trial judge disallowed defense arguments  that the officers caused their own deaths by carelessness, jurors said they  heard enough hints to know what the defense lawyers were getting at.  </P></p>

The explosion broke windows in several buildings and caused  a  fire in a six-story building which was promptly extinguished by  the firemen. The explosion occurred when a fuel supply vehicle  was filling the restaurant's tanks on Jimenez Avenue. The  explosion was so strong that early reports asserted that it was  an attack on the building where the Office of the Attorney  General is located.    According to one employee, all of the windows at the  Attorney  General's Office were shattered and there was confusion for  several minutes.</p>

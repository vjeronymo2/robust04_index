			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nova turns in strong result at nine months NOVA, western Canada's most conspicuous corporate turnround of the recession, reported a strong result for the first nine months of 1993. The company said that capital spending would rise substantially to handle growing demand for capacity in its natural gas pipeline system. Nova, which is concentrating on building its core pipeline and petrochemical businesses after a brush with failure two years ago, has put its Novalta Resources gas production unit out to tender. It expects firm bids later this month. Analysts value the unit at CDollars 200m or more. Nine-month net profit was CDollars 159m (USDollars 121m), or 37 cents a share, up 43 per cent from CDollars 111m, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.4bn, an increase of 9 per cent. Third-quarter profit was CDollars 45m, or 10 cents, down 4 per cent from CDollars 47m, or 11 cents, on revenues of CDollars 828m, up 10 per cent. The decline was due to a lower regulated rate of return on pipeline operations. The nine-month period included a 6 cents a share gain on the sale of its interest in an Italian manufacturing concern. Nova also gained from a lower Canadian dollar and lower level of debt. Chemicals remained in the black in spite of depressed markets, and requests for pipeline services in 1995-96 were up 'very significantly', said Mr J. Edward Newall, chairman and main architect of Nova's revival. Capital spending, mainly for the pipelines, will average CDollars 500m-CDollars 600m a year in 1994 and 1995 and could reach CDollars 600m-CDollars 700m in 1996. Cashflow from petrochemicals was positive and Nova believes prices should improve late in 1994.</p>

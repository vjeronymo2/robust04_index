In the booklet entitled  "The 1994 Constituent Assembly Elections," the UPC position is  claimed to portray the National Resistance Movement, NRM, of  President Yoweri Museveni as a foreign occupation government and  dominated by foreigners.    Wagulo, who was arrested this morning by police officers at  the UPC headquarters in Kampala, was due to appear in court this  afternoon, but Chief Magistrate Jorokamu Bamwine, who was to  hear the case, refused to hear it because Wegulo was brought in  after office hours.    The charge sheet says Wegulo and others still at large in  February in Kampala did utter, print, publish for sale and  caused the booklet to be distributed.</p>

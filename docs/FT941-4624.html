			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BICC profit of Pounds 104m fails to cover pay-out The absence of exceptional items helped BICC, the cables and construction group, post significantly higher pre-tax profits last year. However the profits were again insufficient to cover the group's maintained dividend. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 104m from a restated Pounds 63m the previous year when profits were reduced by property and Channel Tunnel provisions totalling Pounds 39m. Group turnover increased by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 3.92bn (Pounds 3.65bn.) Operating profits were flat at Pounds 135m, excluding a Pounds 2m acquisition contribution last year and the substantial property and Channel Tunnel charges in 1992. Earnings per share were 15.4p, just ahead of the 1992's restated pre-execeptional level of 14.7p. Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said the group had again been successful in generating cash from its operations and this, taken in conjunction with signs of improvement in some of the group's markets, had led the board to recommend a maintained final dividend of 13.25p making a full-year total unchanged at 19.25p. The shares fell 16p to close at 438p. He said the results, 'continued to reflect the exceptionally difficult trading environment which we have experienced over the last three years'. 'We now have two very strong and competitive businesses, which are in excellent positions to benefit from improving market conditions. recently we have seen some signs of improvement in Australia, North America and the UK, and other European markets are likely to stabilise in the current year. Accordingly, we expect to see our performance improving in 1994.' In construction Balfour Beatty posted operating profits of Pounds 40m, up Pounds 3m on the previous year on turnover that slipped to Pounds 1.83bn (Pounds 1.85bn.) Over the past five years Balfour Beatty has generated Pounds 150m of profits. The group's other core business, cables, was affected by continuing market weakness. BICC Cables, which mainly operates in Europe, saw profits fall by 14 per cent to Pounds 67m from Pounds 78m the previous year on turnover that increased to Pounds 1.05bn (Pounds 946m.) Profits in the UK, however, held up well. Sir Robin said the decline was largely attributable to losses incurred in power cables in Spain. There was also a softening of demand for cable in the Italian, German and Portuguese markets. COMMENT BICC has been forced to dip into reserves again to maintain the dividend. With its main markets around the world showing signs of improvement, a similar move should not be required again this year. The group has a clear strategy, the balance sheet is strong and its businesses have been rationalised. Pre-tax profit of about Pounds 140m are expected this year producing earnings of about 20.2. With a lofty prospective p/e of 21.7, the stock is supported only by its generous yield.</p>

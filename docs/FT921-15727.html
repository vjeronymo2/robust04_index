			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Observer: High-tech livery A trifling 598 years after London's merchants, the mercers, set themselves up as the City's first livery company, the Court of Aldermen has welcomed its 100th recruit, the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists. With green and gold livery and the motto cito (swiftly), the 316 members are united in an appreciation of computers either as makers or users. Freemen of the new company include Lord Weinstock, chairman of GEC, Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, and Sir Brian Jenkins, the current Lord Mayor. More obviously, its ranks include Peter Bonfield, chairman of ICL and Hilary Cropper, chief executive of the computing services group FI. This year's master is Alan Benjamin, a former director of communications at ICL. The world of livery companies may seem anachronistic in the computer age but the information technologists are devoting themselves to the same good works livery company have espoused through the ages - education, training and medical research.</p>

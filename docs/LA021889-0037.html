			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFORMAL OPINION SAYS UZI ALREADY IS ILLEGAL IN STATE  </P> <P> The popular Uzi assault rifle is illegal in California under current state law,  according to an informal attorney general's office opinion being prepared for  county prosecutors and local law enforcement agencies. Chief Deputy Atty. Gen.  Nelson Kempsky told The Times Friday that a letter will be sent to local  officials across the state next week offering help in prosecutions involving  possession or sale of the Uzi carbine.  </P> <P> If the opinion were to be upheld in court, it would mean that a state law  making it a felony to sell or possess rifles under a certain length has gone  unnoticed for years, as it applies to Uzis that are sold in California.  </P> <P> Kempsky said the letter will, in essence, tell prosecutors, "We will cheerfully  take on any cases that need to be worked through the appellate courts and offer  our assistance . . . in information and research."  </P> <P> The opinion is based on a state law designed to make it more difficult to  conceal weapons. The law bans rifles that measure less than 26 inches in  length. The Uzi carbine measures 24.4 inches with its folding stock collapsed  and can be fired in that position.  </P> <P> The letter will stress that the law is not "crystal clear," said Kempsky, and  that prosecutors would have to be prepared to prove that the Uzi carbine is  "intended to be fired from the shoulder" as rifles are now defined in  legislation passed last year.  </P> <P> The unofficial opinion resolves a disagreement within the attorney general's  office about whether a new definition of rifles contained in legislation passed  last year includes Uzis, because they can be fired from the hip as well as the  shoulder.  </P> <P> Attorneys familiar with the issue say that prosecutors will also have to prove  that the Uzi should be measured with its stock folded, rather than extended, as  is done by federal authorities. The weapon is 31.5 inches long with the stock  extended, making it legal in that configuration.  </P> <P> The opinion that the Uzi is illegal because of its length as measured with the  stock folded has at least one precedent. The attorney general in Michigan,  basing his opinion on state code language similar to California's, concluded in  1985 that Uzi carbine rifles are illegal in that state. The weapons were  subsequently removed from gun store shelves or modified to meet the law.  </P> <P> Kempsky stressed that it would probably take more than a year for an Uzi  possession or sale case to work its way through trial and appeal in California.  </P> <P> "That's another reason," he said, "that we think it's important to proceed with  assault weapon legislation (that would ban not only Uzis but other such  weapons)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Weapon  </P> <P> The Israeli-made Uzi is one of the most popular weapons among drug dealers and  gang members in California, according to law enforcement officers around the  state. California sales account for about 10% of Uzi's U.S. business, according  to Action Arms, the sole importer of the weapon.  </P> <P> The semiautomatic Uzi can be fired either from the shoulder, with the stock  extended, or from the hip, with the stock collapsed. It holds up to 32 rounds  of 9-millimeter bullets, which are pistol rather than rifle ammunition.  </P> <P> Under the Michigan attorney general's opinion, dealers and owners may legalize  the weapons by installing permanent wooden stocks, welding the folding stocks  in their extended position or by lengthening the barrels so that the rifles  measure at least 26 inches.  </P> <P> But a large part of the Uzi appeal, gun experts say, is due to the image of  Israeli commandos shooting their fully automatic weapons from the hip, with the  stocks folded down. The gun does not have much sales appeal as modified under  Michigan law, said Ed Deershutzen, owner of Guns Plus in Lansing.  </P> <P> "They're just a big clunky pistol at that point," he said.  </P> <P> In 1987, Action Arms introduced a new model Uzi to the American public -- the  mini-carbine -- with a truncated body but a longer barrel that causes the  weapon to measure 26.1 inches, with the stock collapsed.  </P> <P> The mini-carbine is available in Michigan and could be expected to take the  place of its predecessor on California gun dealer shelves if the original is  banned on the basis of length.  </P> <P> But the sales appeal of the mini-carbine is unproven. Action Arms reported  2,000 sales during the weapon's introductory year, whereas more than 75,000 of  the original carbines have been sold since the weapon was first marketed in the  United States in 1980, according to the company.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the district attorneys offices in two California counties that  are perhaps most affected by Uzi violence -- Los Angeles and Alameda --  declined to comment on the unofficial opinion from the attorney general's  office prior to reading it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criminal Case  </P> <P> In Alameda County, a criminal case is pending against a defendant for  possession of an Uzi -- perhaps the only such charge ever lodged in California  -- but the arrest occurred last year, and the significance of the case became  somewhat clouded when the new definition of a rifle went into effect this year.  </P> <P> Ironically, the confusion stemmed from an attempt to clarify the legal status  of the Uzi.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Elihu Harris (D-Oakland), concerned with the increasing use of Uzis  by drug dealers in the East Bay city, asked the attorney general's office last  year for an opinion on the weapon's legality.  </P> <P> Harris' query was based on the fact that the California Penal Code, as then  written, made it a felony to sell or possess "a rifle . . . or any weapon made  from a rifle . . . (whether by manufacture, alteration, modification or  otherwise) if such a weapon, as modified, has an overall length of less than 26  inches."  </P> <P> Last Aug. 17, Allen Sumner, senior assistant attorney general, wrote to Harris  giving a guarded unofficial opinion that the Uzi was illegal.  </P> <P> "Although the legality of the Uzi under present law is not at all clear,"  Sumner wrote, "we believe that this weapon is already prohibited. . . ."  </P> <P> Sumner went on to explain that the issue is complicated, in part, by the fact  that the weapon has been openly sold for years in California without a legal  challenge.  </P> <P> "The Uzi has been on sale in the state for some time," he wrote, "indicating  that local law enforcement officials have apparently concluded that it is legal  under current law. This is a factor which courts would take into consideration,  making successful prosecution more difficult."  </P> <P> Still, Sumner said in conclusion that he believed that a "sounder reading" of  the Penal Code would prohibit the sale or possession of the Uzi.  </P> <P> Harris subsequently introduced the bill last year to attempt to remove any  confusion over the issue, including the prohibition of "a rifle with an overall  length of less than 26 inches."  </P> <P> But the bill also included the definition of a rifle that was not in the old  law:  </P> <P>  "As used in this section, the term 'rifle' means a weapon . . . intended to be  fired from the shoulder. . . ."  </P> <P> The language is similar to the federal definition of a rifle and is the same  language used in Michigan's gun code, but it alarmed some lawyers in the  attorney general's office and elsewhere who had not seen the legislation before  it was passed.  </P> <P> On Dec. 5, Deputy Atty. Gen. Blair Hoffman wrote in an unofficial opinion to  Dave Karp, mayor of San Leandro, that the new definition of a rifle appeared to  exempt weapons shot from the hip.  </P> <P> "Weapons intended . . . to be fired from the hip, which are often more  dangerous," he wrote, "appear to be legal and, indeed, unregulated."  </P> <P> But other opinions within the attorney general's office and elsewhere differed,  and after several weeks, the issue was resolved in favor of the letter being  prepared offering to help county prosecutors in cases involving the sale or  possession of Uzis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UZI CARBINE  </P> <P> The Israeli-made Uzi is one of the most popular weapons among drug dealers and  gang members in California, according to law enforcement officers. Sales in the  state account for some 10% of Uzi's U.S. business.  </P> <P> Ammunition: 9mm  </P> <P> Barrel length: 16.1 inches  </P> <P> Length stock extended: 31.5 inches  </P> <P> Length stock folded: 24.4 inches  </P> <P> Weight (unloaded): 8.4 lbs.  </P> <P> Magazine: 20-, 25- (standard) and 32-round  </P> <P> Manufacturer: Israel Military Industries  </P></p>

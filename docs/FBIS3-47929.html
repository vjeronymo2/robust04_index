			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] FOREIGN Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said  Thailand would not consider the Burmese ethnic minorities'  request to use Thailand as a venue for peace talks with the  Rangoon ruling military junta.    "But if the (Burmese) government itself asked for that, we  will consider it," Prasong told reporters. [passage omitted]    Prasong also refused to make a direct comment on a recent  report that Rangoon might release opposition leader Aung San Suu  Kyi in July this year. The minister however said that only the  Burmese government, aware of how the world community views the  situation in Burma, would know what it should do. [passage  omitted]    The junta's powerful secretary Lt Gen Khin Nyunt said the  legitimate period of Suu Kyi's house arrest would expire in  July. Burma's law limits the period of house arrest to a maximum  of five years. [passage omitted]</p>

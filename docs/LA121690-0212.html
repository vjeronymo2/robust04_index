			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RATING THE ENTERPRISE ZONE;  </P> <P> THESE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS HAVE HAD MIXED SUCCESS. SOME WONDER IF THEY  ARE WORTH THE EFFORT.  </P> <P> In a rough, graffiti-stained neighborhood south of downtown Los Angeles are two  businessmen, Richard Breen and Lance Kluger, who are polar opposites when it  comes to the merits of enterprise zones.  </P> <P> Count Breen a supporter of these programs designed to boost investment and  create jobs in poor areas. Breen used the plan to qualify for a low-interest  government loan to expand his shipping business that might have otherwise moved  to the suburbs.  </P> <P> "It worked," he said. "It was win-win" for himself and the city.  </P> <P> Forget it, says Kluger. His experience with the enterprise zone became a costly  fiasco for his family's clothing business after a city-sponsored development  loan fell through. "We're sorry we ever met anyone from the city of Los  Angeles," Kluger said.  </P> <P> So it goes these days for enterprise zones in Los Angeles and elsewhere  nationwide. The zones so far have been a mixed bag, with some successes but  many failures, sparking doubts about whether these well-intentioned social  experiments are worth the effort.  </P> <P> Enterprise zones have taken over where urban renewal programs and the War on  Poverty have left off. They are public-private partnerships to provide  businesses in depressed areas with certain financial incentives, mainly tax  breaks, if they hire the hard-core unemployed or expand their operations within  the zone.  </P> <P> At issue is whether the private sector can be any more effective than  government in cleaning up and reviving areas plagued by deep-seated social and  economic problems. So far, true success has been rare.  </P> <P> Enterprise zone advocates says these programs reduce welfare costs by hiring  the unemployed, infuse declining neighborhoods with new investment and act as  catalysts in forcing local officials to focus on development and employment  issues.  </P> <P> Yet, the evidence to date indicates that enterprise zones do not have the  firepower to make meaningful change in areas that need it most. They have yet  to get federal backing despite a decade of effort.  </P> <P> State-run zones have done little to improve inner-city neighborhoods like  Watts, where unemployment, poor education, discrimination, apathy and crime are  overwhelming problems. Hiring programs in these neighborhoods have met with  little success, government officials concede.  </P> <P> "If you ask me for an honest opinion if enterprise zones work in the inner  city, I'd say no," said Juanita Tate, a community activist in South-Central Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Enterprise zones have also been criticized as unfair, inept and difficult to  analyze. Government officials are often at a loss to quantify the effectiveness  of their programs and how many jobs they have provided to those who most need  them.  </P> <P> Yet, the zones have worked in some industrial neighborhoods that still have a  business base and in rural communities that have high unemployment rates  without debilitating crime problems. Officials in Porterville and Madera in  California's Central Valley say the enterprise zones have spurred their  redevelopment efforts.  </P> <P> The U.S. government has never passed a meaningful enterprise program because  the zones, tagged "revenue losers," have been a low priority in a time of  domestic spending restraints. Without federal backing, most of the state  programs have never really taken off.  </P> <P> "State taxes do not affect business decisions like federal taxes do," said Alan  Eric Jones, head of the Evansville, Ind., zone. "With federal incentives some  of these programs would take off like Roman candles."  </P> <P> Enterprise zones were again eliminated from the most recent federal budget  accord after being approved by the Republican and Democratic leadership in  Congress. The program was eventually cut out because it was expected to cost  the government more than $1 billion over four years.  </P> <P> First embraced by former President Ronald Reagan, the zones are a favorite of  Jack Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Bush Administration  is expected to try again next year to pass a federal program.  </P> <P> Most experts believe that even the best zones are doomed to limited success  unless the federal government implements its own program. Currently 37 states  have enacted their own programs since the early 1980s. California passed two  separate, but similar, programs in 1984 that operate side by side.  </P> <P> Though most state programs are said to be ineffectual, about a dozen appear to  have made genuine, if modest, progress. The state of California, for example,  boasts that enterprise zones produced more than 6,700 new jobs last year on  total investments of $300 million.  </P> <P> California has 19 zones statewide, including five in Los Angeles, with plans to  add more. Others are located as far north as Eureka and as far south as  Calexico. Seven are located in Central Valley cities, including Fresno and  Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Though the zones attract little public attention, their merits have been  fiercely debated in academia and government. Their cause was dealt a blow in  1988 when the General Accounting Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, panned  the enterprise zone program in Maryland.  </P> <P> Yet, the enterprise zone concept received a major boost last year when a study  by Marilyn Rubin, an associate professor at City University of New York,  concluded that the enterprise zone program in New Jersey yielded the state a  minimum of almost $2 in new taxes for every $1 spent.  </P> <P> Even if the zones are successful, they are often viewed as unfair because they  favor certain neighborhoods and cities over others. Cities usually compete  fiercely to get the enterprise zone designation.  </P> <P> "It's always controversial," said S. Charles (Gary) Garofalo, who heads New  Jersey's enterprise zone program. "You always have some cities saying: 'Why do  they have this and we don't?' "  </P> <P> The early evidence shows that the success of state-sponsored enterprise zones  hinges on far more than financial incentives, such as tax breaks. Experts said  the programs are only going to work well if local governments are adept and  aggressive in marketing the zones to the business community and cutting through  red tape at City Hall to facilitate development.  </P> <P> "If you just declare the zone and say: 'Here are the tax breaks,' businesses  will just yawn," said Michael Jenkins, head of the San Diego enterprise zone  program.  </P> <P> One of the most successful urban zones in California is located in southeast  San Diego, a rundown but still viable neighborhood that is on the rebound,  according to state and local officials. A new industrial park along Interstate  15 is the crown jewel of the area's redevelopment effort.  </P> <P> One businessman in the San Diego zone, Diego Aguilera, stands to reap a major  windfall in tax relief because he recently purchased a new $200,000-press for  his commercial printing business, located in a drug-plagued neighborhood not  far from the Coronado Bridge.  </P> <P> The state sales tax that he paid on the press, about $14,000, can now be used  as a credit against this year's income tax. Aguilera says he'll use the savings  to buy added equipment.  </P> <P> "Whoever set up the enterprise zone had a great idea," said the 56-year-old  former newspaper pressman.  </P> <P> The enterprise zones have helped to breathe new life into depressed parts of  California's Central Valley, where unemployment is high and incomes are low.  Second-tier cities there are scrambling to grow and diversify their tax base to  reduce their dependence on agriculture, the traditional economic staple.  </P> <P> Madera claims to have lured 13 major new businesses into its enterprise zone in  the past year, setting off a construction boom in the sleepy town of 25,000  people 25 miles north of Fresno. Among the new buildings in town is a  $12-million distribution center built by Gottschalks, a department store chain.  </P> <P> Porterville, a town of about 30,000 people nestled against the western edge of  the Sierra Nevada mountains, about a three-hour drive north of Los Angeles,  received a huge economic shot in the arm last year when Wal-Mart, another  department store chain, chose to build a distribution center in the city's  enterprise zone.  </P> <P> The size of 22 football fields, the $30-million Wal-Mart facility is expected  to employ at least 600 people and be the third-largest employer in town when it  opens next year. "This is the biggest thing that has ever happened to  Porterville," said City Manager C.G. Huffaker.  </P> <P> What remains difficult to pinpoint -- and it's a problem in all zones -- is the  exact role that the enterprise zone plays in luring new business to a depressed  area.  </P> <P> Though Wal-Mart stands to save millions of dollars in state taxes, company  officials have indicated that the enterprise zone was a not primary factor in  their decision. The most important considerations were the quality of  Porterville's work force and its easy access to major highways, they say.  </P> <P> Possibly the nation's most successful enterprise zone is in Evansville, an Ohio  River town of 130,000 people where about 4,000 new jobs have been created since  its zone began in 1984.  </P> <P> With able management and strong support at City Hall, the zone is credited with  sparking a turnaround in Evansville's aging industrial sector that had been  hard hit by plant closures in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> There are two enterprise zones in the back yard of downtown Los Angeles, and  the results there have been mixed at best. One zone is in the Central City  area, located just south of the Santa Monica Freeway, and the other is farther  south in Watts.  </P> <P> In Watts, enterprise zones have done little to attract new business or  ameliorate deep-seated social and economic problems.  </P> <P> "Watts is a tough sell," said Paul Hiller, head of the state zone program for  the California Department of Commerce. "Outsiders know there are better places  to set up shop."  </P> <P> Indeed, Watts is worse off today than it was before its devastating riots 25  years ago, claims Jasper Williams, a city official who recently took over as  head of the Watts zone. "The disenchantment is more obvious and people have  less hope today," he said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, about 415 new jobs were created last year in the Central  City enterprise zone, whose location makes it a natural business distribution  point.  </P> <P> "We're definitely a key element in what's happening," said Williams, who ran  the Central City zone until recently. "But quite honestly, because of the  location, a lot of this (business activity) would have happened anyway."  </P> <P> Business leaders and government officials also concede that few of the new  hires are the hard-core unemployed who need jobs the most. Hiring these  applicants allows companies to qualify for tax credits, but successes are few.  </P> <P> Drug problems disqualify some applicants and most of those hired do not last  long in the tough entry-level jobs that require heavy manual labor, businessmen  and government officials say.  </P> <P> "If all you have been doing is sitting around and watching Oprah Winfrey, that  (heavy) lifting gets old fast," Williams said.  </P> <P> A major setback in the Los Angeles zone program occurred last year in what  became a nightmare for Lance and Ben Kluger, a son-and-father team whose  clothing business bearing their name has been a fixture in the Central City for  decades.  </P> <P> The Klugers were to be pioneers in a city-sponsored industrial bond program  that was highly touted by Mayor Tom Bradley at a press conference as a way to  help business expand within the Los Angeles zones.  </P> <P> The Klugers were perfect: successful and stable. And they planned to use the  low-interest bond fund to finance a new manufacturing facility on 29th St. The  $7-million complex was to provide 200 new jobs and cut short the Klugers' plans  to move their operations from the Central City to Orange County.  </P> <P> Shortly after Bradley's press conference, disaster struck. A European bank,  Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN), unexpectedly withdrew its commitment to provide  a letter of credit that was a key ingredient in implementing the $6.25-million  bond issue.  </P> <P> Without the letter of credit, the sale fell apart, leaving the Klugers without  permanent financing. Most painfully, they lost a good-faith deposit of $62,500  that was part of the agreement.  </P> <P> The Klugers eventually got half their deposit back, but have sued the city of  Los Angeles and ABN to get the remaining amount. As a postscript, they went  ahead with their expansion using private lenders.  </P> <P> Ted Berkowitz, head of the city's private-placement bond program, termed the  Klugers' case "unfortunate," adding "this is not the message we want to be  sending out to the business community." ABN, which Berkowitz blamed for the  snafu, declined to comment.  </P> <P> The major success story in the Central City zone is widely acknowledged to be  Richard Breen, who was persuaded to expand his shipping operations on Hooper  Street. With a $1.35-million low-interest loan from the city, Breen turned an  adjacent junk yard into a loading dock rather than move his entire business,  known as Daylight Transport, to the City of Commerce.  </P> <P> The move saved the city close to 100 jobs and meant an additional investment of  more than $5 million into a struggling but still viable commercial district  that has about 2,500 businesses and a population of more than 45,000.  </P> <P> Breen has few illusions about doing business in the inner city. Crime is a  continual problem around his guarded, fenced-in compound, which he likens to a  "fortress in Indian territory."  </P> <P> Occasionally, murder victims appear outside the compound on nearby railroad  tracks and gang violence is always a fear. On one occasion, Breen said, a  Daylight Transport sentry was menaced and surrounded by gang members after he  foiled their robbery attempt of a woman near his guard station.  </P> <P> Police arrived and made arrests, but some gang members vowed revenge, Breen  said. "Their last words were: 'We'll be back,' " he recalled.  </P> <P> Respected by local community figures, Breen is a former social worker in New  York City and a one-time "hippie" who turned trucking entrepreneur after  trekking to California in the mid-1970s. A wealthy man now, he says the only  solutions to cleaning up the neighborhood are new jobs and viable businesses  that will retake the area "block by block."  </P> <P> "Social programs don't work, but private enterprise will," he said. "I know.  I've seen it from both sides."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENTERPRISE ZONES AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> * What: Enterprise zones are state-designated economic areas that offer tax  breaks and other incentives to businesses if they expand their operations  within the zone or relocate there.  </P> <P> * Why: To create new jobs by encouraging private investment in poor areas.  </P> <P> * Where: Located in 37 states nationwide, including California. There are 19  enterprise zones statwide, including five in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Prime minister plays a long game: The strategy behind the ministerial appointments MR JOHN Major has tried to play a long game in selecting his ministerial team below cabinet rank. The prime minister has looked to pre-empt disgruntlement among Conservative parliamentary ranks across a four or five year parliament. A fourth election victory could easily turn to irritability or complacency among backbenchers. Consulting closely with Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, Mr Major has promoted ministers he believes might yet become cabinet material. Mr Major believes that stamping his own mark on the government, to replace that of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, is an evolving process that still has some way to go. The selection is nevertheless somewhat eclectic. Fellow cricket fans like Mr Robert Atkins, moved by Mr Major to become minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office, have survived against expectations. Mr Nicholas Soames, who few expected to see in ministerial office, has started on the junior ranks at agriculture. The biggest change in direction is likely from the expanded Department of Trade and Industry team under Mr Michael Heseltine. Industry policy will become the immediate responsibility of Mr Tim Sainsbury, the cautious former parliamentary private secretary to Mr Heseltine. Export promotion falls to another Heseltine admirer, the affable and energetic Mr Richard Needham, promoted from the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Tim Eggar will take the DTI's new responsibilities for energy policy. Another theme is the pre-eminence of the Treasury - reflected also in the trading yesterday of senior civil servants between the Treasury and 10 Downing Street. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the 40-year-old new financial secretary to the Treasury, is regarded as highly able and a potential cabinet minister. Mr Anthony Nelson, the new economic secretary, will enhance the job by taking in the Treasury's new responsibilities for the financial services industry. Elsewhere Mr Major has followed an almost textbook course of balancing right and left within his party. He has Thatcherite No Turning Back Group supporters in his cabinet. In lower ranks he has Mr John Redwood, the new environment minister, Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, and Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister. At the same time he appointed Mr Robert Hughes to the government whips office. Mr Hughes was a parliamentary private secretary to former Tory prime minister Mr Edward Heath. Mr Major has offered some of the new entrants a government post when they must have thought they had become confirmed backbenchers. Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Ireland Office minister and former campaign manager of Mr Heseltine, had been passed over many times before. Mr Nigel Forman, junior education minister, has been brought in from the cold after being parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor blamed by many Tories for mismanaging the economy. The official explanation is that Mr Major wanted to tap talent from across the party. But it also reduces the number of long-standing backbenchers harbouring resentment for being overlooked. For bright entrants or relative newcomers there remains the prospect of promotion as ministers who fail to make the grade are pulled out.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN FULL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CABINET:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service: John Major, 49                 salary pounds  76,234 Lord Chancellor: Lord Mackay of Clashfern, 64          pounds 106,750 Foreign Secretary: Douglas Hurd, 62                      pounds  63,047 Chancellor of the Exchequer: Norman Lamont, 49                     pounds  63,047 Home Secretary: Kenneth Clarke, 51                    pounds  63,047 Trade and Industry Secretary: Michael Heseltine, 59                 pounds  63,047 Transport Secretary: John McGregor, 55                     pounds  63,047 Defence Secretary: Malcolm Rifkind, 45                   pounds  63,047 Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords: John Wakeham, 59                      pounds  50,558 Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons: Tony Newton, 54                       pounds  63,047 Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: John Gummer, 52                       pounds  63,047 Environment Secretary: Michael Howard, 50                    pounds  63,047 Welsh Secretary: David Hunt, 49                        pounds  63,047 Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: William Waldegrave, 45                pounds  63,047 Scottish Secretary: Ian Lang, 51                          pounds  63,047 Secretary of State for National Heritage: David Mellor, 43                      pounds  63,047 Northern Ireland Secretary: Sir Patrick Mayhew, 62                pounds  63,047 Education Secretary: John Patten, 46                       pounds  63,047 Health Secretary: Virginia Bottomley, 44                pounds  63,047 Employment Secretary: Gillian Shephard, 52                  pounds  63,047 Chief Secretary to the Treasury: Michael Portillo, 38                  pounds  63,047  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MINISTRIES:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: Minister - David Curry.

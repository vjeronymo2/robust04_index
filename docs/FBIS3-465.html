It was  suspected three or four people were involved in the weekend  burglary which was discovered on Monday morning. Air Force  police and the South African Police [SAP] were immediately  called in to investigate, the statement said, but the SAP on  Tuesday denied it was involved in the investigation. The Air  Force said further details could not be released at this stage  because it could hamper the investigation.</p>

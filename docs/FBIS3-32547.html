			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio today rejected rumors of  divisions in the Armed Forces and confirmed that the Army plays  an important role in consolidating and strengthening democracy.  De Leon thus countered newspaper reports of a split in the Army  created by peace talks between the government and guerrillas.  Rumor has it that the Army has split into three factions: the  first being the military personnel who were removed following  the self-inflicted coup attempt by the later deposed President  Jorge Serrano in 1993, the second being the "hard-liners," and  the third being those who support institutional rule.    According to SIGLO VEINTIUNO, the "hard-liners" oppose talks  with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Alliance [URNG] and  support the president, but only on certain conditions. The  newspaper says those military personnel are willing to join the  removed officers to resume armed field actions against the  guerrillas if the government gets the United Nations more  involved in the peace talks. According to an agreement signed  between the guerrillas and the government in Mexico on 10  January, the United Nations will moderate the peace talks, which  are scheduled to resume early in March.    The president labeled the reports as false and added: "I am  not worried about rumors. I am convinced that the officers are  aware of the role they play in the democratic process. There  could be differences of opinion, but no division." De Leon said  the Army feels fully responsible for the country's institutional  order.    The president spoke at the Main Square in front of the  government building shortly before meeting with Monsignor  Prospero Penados del Barrio, Archbishop of Guatemala. De Leon  said the Archbishop's visit was of a personal nature, although  they would also discuss subjects related to the country's  political, economic, and social crisis.    Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez has also  reiterated the Army's support for peace talks but opposed the  creation of a truth commission to investigate human rights  violations perpetrated since armed conflict began in 1960.    De Leon said discussions on human rights with URNG will have  to include all related aspects, but he declined to give any  additional details.    Finally, Gen. Enriquez said the Armed Forces object to the  creation of a truth commission because it would disregard the  Army and would polarize rather than assuage the population.</p>

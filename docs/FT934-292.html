			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Italian sector is expected to remain leader of the pack - European bonds rallied strongly in 1993 while the US caught the jitters after a good start For most investors, 1993 was the year of the European bond bonanza, with fixed-income markets fuelled by falling interest rates, slowing inflation and faltering economies. Next year is likely to bring more of the same as Europe's economies continue to limp along, monetary policies remain accommodating and fiscal tightening limits supply. However, 1994 promises to be a more difficult year as the European bond rally loses steam in the second half and markets re-focus on political risk, budget deficits and economic recovery. Moreover, the low yields prevailing in most markets will make double-digit performance next year hard to attain. Few markets still offer yields above 6 per cent and 'besides the lower-running yield, this also means lower capital gains potential, and at the same time higher risks,' says Mr Reiner Back, head of fixed-income strategy at DB Research in Frankfurt. On a global comparison, last year's best-performing market was Italy, which rose 31.67 per cent in local currency terms, according to data compiled by JP Morgan. That was followed by Spain, up 30.93 per cent, and Denmark with a 21.24 per cent rise. The US and Japan provided the poorest returns, yielding 10.30 per cent and 13.36 per cent, respectively. European bonds are expected to outperform other markets again next year, lifted by central banks' continued easing of interest rates. Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets, expects European short-term rates to fall another 250 basis points on average by the end of 1994, with the German discount rate - currently at 5.75 per cent - reaching 4 per cent by the summer and 3.5 per cent by year-end. That should put German bond yields, at historical lows in real terms, under further downward pressure from a weak economy, decelerating inflation and a tighter fiscal stance. The 10-year benchmark bund yield, at around 5.65 per cent, is widely expected to drop below 5.5 per cent, with some economists going as low as 5.2 per cent. One risk factor in Germany is the country's election marathon, with 19 polls slated for the year. Given the weakness of the economy and soaring unemployment, political shocks caused by extreme voting patterns could be possible. According to Ms Cottrell, the risk period for bunds is likely to be not so much the October federal elections as the period between the Lower Saxony regional elections on March 13 and the European elections on June 12. 'A large protest vote may prove more unsettling for the markets than the October election,' she notes. French bonds should do well, although they may be prone to political jitters around the European parliament elections and in the run-up to the 1995 presidential elections. However, the country's low and falling inflation rate, torpid economy and record unemployment are expected to promote sharp rate cuts, helped by the continuing strength of the French franc. The UK bond market put on a dazzling performance this year, posting an annual return of 20.88 per cent. Gilts rallied sharply after the November 30 budget, helped by favourable inflation developments which saw the retail price index fall to a 26-year low in November. The low-inflation, slow-growth scenario is expected to underpin gilts early next year, bolstered by prospects for some more rate cuts by the Bank of England. Most observers expect at least another  1/2 -point off the 5.5 per cent base rate, with an increasing number of analysts calling for 4 per cent base rates by year-end. 'The highest returns are likely during the first half of 1994 reflecting the positive combination of lower short-term rates and a continuing rally in overseas bond markets,' predicts Mr David Walton, economist at Goldman Sachs. He expects the 10-year gilt yield to drop below 6 per cent in the next few months, from about 6.20 per cent at present. However, he warns that some of these gains might evaporate in the second half, with the yield curve steepening as the international environment becomes less supportive and investors begin to worry about a rise in UK inflation. Meanwhile, Europe's high-yielders remain everybody's favourite, with Italy expected to lead the pack. 'In this low-yield environment, the quest for good returns will push investors into the high-yielders which still offer potential for yield convergence towards the hard core,' said Mr Back at DB Research. While Italy's national elections - likely to be held in spring - will keep the country's currency and bond market volatile, economic fundamentals and the prospect of further rate cuts will buoy Italian bonds, he says. Ms Ros Lifton, European economist at Nomura Research Institute, expects the Italian bond market to outperform all others in the next six months and sees 10-year yields falling some 100 basis points by mid-1994 from the current 8.41 per cent. Italy's fundamentals are promising, with inflation set to drop below 4 per cent and the fiscal outlook improving after the successful passage of the 1994 budget. Spanish bond yields are expected to decline further, although they are likely to lag behind Italy. The minority socialist government is having trouble implementing labour market reforms, and with a general strike planned for January, the peseta is likely to be plagued by political tensions. Spanish fundamentals - rising inflation and an overshooting budget deficit - do not bode well for aggressive cuts in interest rates, which are needed to revive the economy and reduce record unemployment. Meanwhile, a tighter policy stance by the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to have much impact on European bonds. 'The dislocation of US and European business cycles suggests a fairly muted link between US and European yields,' says Ms Cottrell. Moreover, with worldwide economic activity expected to remain subdued and oil prices seen as remaining stable, commodities prices are unlikely to fuel inflation pressures.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Hafiz al-Asad yesterday received a  delegation of the 1948 Palestinians led by 'Abd-al-Wahhab  Darawshah, who are in Damascus to offer condolences on the  nation's loss of Staff Major Engineer Paratrooper Basil al-Asad.  [passage omitted]    Delegation member Talab al-Sani' made a speech in which he  said: At the outset of my speech I would like to say that this  delegation represents all of Palestine, from the Galilee, the  triangle, and the Arab Negev. This delegation includes people  from Yafo, 'Akko, and Haifa. This shows they are a vital part  of the Arab nation. Every day they experience attempts to  uproot them from their land. But, they are standing fast on  their Arab land. We always say we are part of the Arab nation.  We are proud of our Arab identity. We are ready to pay the  price. A week ago, after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  there was a massive uprising inside 1948 Palestine. A youth  from the Negev city of Rahat was also martyred. Tens of people  were wounded. This shows these people are a vital part of the  Arab nation, despite political boundaries and the political  siege imposed on us. We have not forgotten our affiliation.  Neither have we knelt down or bowed our heads.    Your Excellency, I would like to say that in addition to  what  my brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah said, that Syria's position,  your wise position at the Geneva summit, has put the Israeli  Government in a corner, in a defensive position, because they  have always used Israel's security as a pretext, as if security  is only for one side and that the other parties and states have  no security. We believe the occupier is Israel, that the  aggressor is Israel, and that the side carrying out repressive  and oppressive measures in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is  Israel.    Israel will not be able to use its powerful media to  propagate its claims that the Arab world and the Arab states  threaten Israel's security. Your wise position advocating full  withdrawal for complete peace has put Israel and the Israeli  Government into a corner. The Israeli Government is trying to  find a way out of this impasse with weak justifications. The  world knows, the Israeli Government knows, and the Israeli  people know these justifications are very weak.    They say the news media did not enter into and did not  participate in the summit. We believe peace cannot be lasting  if it is not a just peace. If peace is not just and is imposed  in accordance with transient circumstances and facts, then there  will be no peace, because circumstances and facts can change.  For peace to be lasting, it must be just. Just peace guarantees  all Arab people's rights. These rights are indivisible. We  have an example of a separate peace in Egypt. This separate  peace could not prevent wars on the Lebanese front and in the  West Bank and the Gaza Strip where our heroic Arab people have  their intifadah.    In order to have a comprehensive peace, there must be  coordination. We believe in the unity of the cause, the unity  of the struggle, and the unity of the solution. Our fate is  one. We hope there will be an end to political boundaries.  But, this is a hope for the future that will be governed by  future circumstances and developments. Now, at the current  stage, there is a need for coordination, because Israeli efforts  are aimed at imposing peace, or at suggesting there is peace  without actually implementing peace on the ground. Israel tries  to penetrate the Arab world economically and to propagate the  idea of a Middle Eastern market, while continuing to occupy the  West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and southern  Lebanon.    We believe the occupation of southern Lebanon is the  continuation of fighting there. Territory has never been and  will never be a means of defense, but the cause of continued  fighting. We have always said we are proud of your wise and  honorable stands and your political wisdom, which is recognized  by enemies before friends. We have faith in Syria's leadership  role. We hope God will grant you success as a leader of the  Arab nation and a leader of Syria.    God willing, peace based on the establishment of a  Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, will be  achieved. God willing, the Syrian flag will fly over the Golan  and peace will prevail in the region.    Poet Mustafa al-Jammal, chairman of the 'Ara and 'Ar'ara  council in the Triangle recited a poem titled Damascus, in which  he reviewed the glorious past of Damascus and Syria's role in  Arab struggle throughout history. He offered condolences to the  president on the homeland's loss of Staff Major Engineer  Paratrooper Basil al-Asad.    Professor Khalil 'Ataminah from B'ir Zayt University recited  a poem in praise of Basil al-Asad in which he expressed his  heartfelt condolences to the president and the Syrian people on  the homeland's loss of Basil al-Asad. He praised Syria's  militant stands throughout history.    The president replied to the speakers of the delegation  members, saying: I was pleased with this meeting. I was  pleased with this fraternal atmosphere. You prove, through what  we heard from you, that boundaries and borders cannot cancel  sentiments and history. We will continue to be sons of one  nation. We will continue to aspire and work for our glory and  dignity. Your are now in your country. This is not only my  opinion, but it also expresses the feelings of all citizens in  Syria. [passage omitted]</p>

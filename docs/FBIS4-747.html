			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nimrod Mabuza] </F>   [Text] Statements made by a certain country that Swaziland  is not a democratic country has irked the government. Minister  for Foreign Affairs, Mr Solomon Dlamini told the House of  Assembly last night that government has sent several protests to  that country. The country was not named. However, it is assumed  that the country referred to is the United States of America.    Recently, a report on human rights in Swaziland, prepared by  the United States Department attacked the Tinkhundla  [traditional community councils] System, saying even last year's  elections were not democratic.    Mr Dlamini was replying to a question from Kwaluseni MP,  William Msibi who asked the minister what was government doing  to discourage the country from continuing to make defamatory  remarks about Swaziland. Further, Mr Msibi said the continued  derogative statements made by this country about Swaziland did  not show any respect for this country. In reply, Mr Dlamini  said government has protested several times to the government of  this country. He said some of the replies that they got from  the government of that country is that, it is one of their  responsibilities to monitor the political system of the  particular country they are accredited to.    Mr Dlamini also said government has also protested to the  government of that country about its envoy, whom he said, used  to meddle in the affairs of this country.    Motshane MP, Robert Anthony Mabuza asked the minister to  inform the House if it was true that there was a diplomatic  blunder in the appointment of the Swazi envoys, announced by  Prime Minister, Prince Mbilini in February. In reply, Mr  Dlamini said it is true that the diplomatic procedure was not  followed in appointing the new Swazi envoys, adding that there  were pressing isf+?s, resulting in the diplomat?c blunder. He  said it is true that the count?ies were informed after the  announcement was made, which is not supposed to be the case.    Mr Mabuza also wanted to know what will happen, should any  of  the Swazi Ambassadors and High Commissioners be rejected by the  countries they have been accredited to. Mr Dlamini said  although it has not happened before, another country can be  asked to accredit him. However, he told the MPs that there is no  policy covering such unforeseen circumstances.    Khubuta MP, Phillip Vonya Dlamini asked the minister to  inform the House on the period expected to be stayed by an envoy  abroad. He also wanted to know if the husband of the woman  appointed is consulted first. Mr Dlamini said he was asking  this to avoid a situation whereby, the husband, who may not be  qualified may be called upon to go and stay with his wife abroad.    Mtfongwaneni MP, Roy Nicholas Fanourakis asked the minister  to inform the House on the criteria used in appointing High  Commissioners and Ambassadors. In reply, the minister said the  appointments are done by the King. He said it is therefore,  difficult for his ministry to know if the husband is consulted  before his wife is appointed. However, the minister said his  office does consult when officers are seconded to the missions  abroad. The debate and replies on this ministry took less than  40 minutes. In most ministries which have so far been debated,  they sometimes take two days each.</p>

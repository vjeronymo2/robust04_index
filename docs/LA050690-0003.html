			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL MOSCO  </P> <P> The men who wait for work at El Mosco have been accused of being "dirty,"  "rude" and "intimidating"? As recent immigrants and for the sake of survival,  perhaps they are simply mimicking the society that surrounds them.  </P> <P> The article told of quite a few dirty, rude and intimidating Norteamericanos.  </P> <P> We must abandon our "them" and "us" attitude because these people will not stop  migrating in search of a better life. And we cannot expect decent behavior from  people who have been shown none.  </P> <P> LESLIE MAXWELL, Mammoth Lakes  </P></p>

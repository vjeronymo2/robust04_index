			<p>BFN     [Text] The press center of the Georgian Defense Ministry  briefed INTERFAX on what happened on 5 May in the village of  Mziuri of Abkhazia's Galskiy district. According to the  press-center, at approximately 1700 on 5 May some fifteen armed  paramilitaries drove up to plunder the Georgian-populated  village. The villagers called for help and Georgian military  police arrived. The police surrounded the paramilitaries and  ordered them to surrender. In response, the paramilitaries  opened fire and wounded two police officers. Five  paramilitaries were killed and four taken prisoner. The  remaining few escaped.    What a Georgian police unit was doing on Abkhaz-controlled  territory, was something the press center refused to tell  INTERFAX.</p>

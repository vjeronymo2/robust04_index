			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PENDLETON PUTS 2 LIVE CREW ALBUM OFF BASE; CLAY MIGHT TOO  </P> <P> You can't be as nasty as you wanna be if you want to sell your record albums to  local Marines.  </P> <P> Rap group 2 Live Crew's controversial, profanity-filled record "As Nasty As  They Wanna Be," was pulled last week from the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base  store, officials said.  </P> <P> The album, branded obscene by a federal judge in Florida, could also be pulled  from stores at the Marine Corps air stations in El Toro, Tustin and Yuma, Ariz.  </P> <P> "We did sell the album, but after the stories broke about how it was obscene,  we pulled it," said Master Sgt. George Spear, a Camp Pendleton spokesman.  </P> <P> Action won't be taken at the air stations until Brig. Gen. David V. Shuter  gives the top-selling record a listen, said Staff Sgt. Gloria Nacoste, a Camp  Pendleton spokeswoman. Shuter is commander of Marine Corps air bases for the  Western United States.  </P> <P> Camp Pendleton officials are also considering yanking another profanity-filled  record, "The Day the Laughter Died," by controversial comedian Andrew Dice  Clay.  </P> <P> Danny Goldberg, president of Los Angeles-based Gold Mountain Records, blasted  the action against 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> "There isn't anything on that album that soldiers haven't heard during basic  training," Goldberg said. "Personally, I am no fan of the album. But the  government shouldn't be music critics."  </P> <P> Skywalker Records, the group's Miami-based label, is appealing a June 6 ruling  by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez in Florida that the album is obscene.  Group members Luther Campbell and Christopher Wongwon and a record store owner  in Broward County, Fla., have been arrested on obscenity allegations.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Marines who can't buy the album will still have a chance to  hear the songs from "As Nasty As They Wanna Be." 2 Live Crew has scheduled a  concert in Los Angeles on Monday.  </P></p>

According to  statistics, industrial enterprises at the township level and  above throughout the province produced an aggregate industrial  output value of more than 7 billion yuan, an increase of 13.4  percent over the previous year. Budgetary industrial  enterprises throughout the province produced an aggregate  industrial output value of 3.35 billion yuan, an increase of  15.8 percent over the previous year; they earned sales income of  4.6 billion yuan, an increase of 55 percent; and materialized  285 million yuan of profits and taxes, an increase of 24.47  percent.    Last year relevant departments and enterprises increased the  momentum of reform and promoted development by means of reform.  The relevant departments identified more than 500 documents  which contradicted the Regulations on the Transformation of  State-Owned Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms, and reduced  their intervention in enterprises. The province's mandatory  plans on industrial products were reduced by 53 percent.  According to new demands and changes, the province selected 16  enterprises to contract for investment and output, and 25  enterprises for the trial- implementation of a shareholding  system or shareholding cooperative system. More than 60 percent  of small, state-cooperative commercial enterprises exercised  civilian management under state ownership. Three kinds of  reforms in enterprises also switched from a single nature to a  comprehensive one, 40 percent of enterprises introduced an  all-personnel contract system, 47 enterprises were merged or  absorbed, and 4 enterprises were closed because they had  suffered serious losses for long periods.    These enterprise reforms helped improve economic returns and  arrested the decline in their production. By the end of last  year, the province registered sustained and healthy development  in heavy industrial production; large-scale increases in the  electric power, machine building, metallurgical, nonferrous  metals, and building materials industries; and a turn for the  better in light industry, which has fluctuated in the last few  years. Production in the major areas was comparatively balanced.</p>

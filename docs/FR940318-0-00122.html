			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Designated Submitters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested clarification on who has primary responsibility to notify EPA under SNAP. EPA recognizes that a potential substitute can be developed for introduction into one of the SNAP sectors at several points in the manufacture-to-use chain. EPA considers responsibility for notification under SNAP to reside with the person who first introduces a substitute not otherwise exempted from reporting requirements into interstate commerce. Therefore, for example, if a chemical manufacturer introduces a substitute into interstate commerce for sale as a fire extinguishing agent to replace an ODS-based extinguishing method, the manufacturer is a designated submitter under SNAP. If a system manufacturer or a chemical formulator buys an agent from a chemical manufacturer and subsequently formulates or engineers it for introduction into interstate commerce as a substitute for an ozone-depleting means of fire suppression, then in this case, the system manufacturer or formulator is the designated submitter. If an end-user develops a proprietary blend or means of fire suppression using chemical or physical inputs purchased from manufacturers or formulators and then enters that product into interstate commerce as a replacement for ozone-depleting means of fire suppression, then the end-user is in this case the designated submitter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical manufacturers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Chemical manufacturers producing a substitute in its final form are required to notify the Agency of the existence of that substitute. For instance, if a chemical manufacturer intends to market a new chemical as a substitute foam blowing agent to companies that manufacture insulation products, the chemical manufacturer would be required to notify the Agency about the existence of the substitute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Formulators. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A formulator is engaged in the preparation or formulation of a substitute, after chemical manufacture of the substitute or its components, for distribution or use in commerce. Formulators usually only sell substitutes based on existing chemicals, since they do not ordinarily possess chemical manufacturing capabilities. Chemicals used in such substitutes are frequently in common use and have already been accepted for general use through other chemical review programs such as under TSCA or FIFRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, to the extent that these formulators can be considered to be directly responsible for production of the substitute for an end-use, for example by offering a tailored formulation for an industrial cleaning process, these formulators would be subject to reporting requirements as outlined in this final rule. In such cases, the formulator is best suited in the manufacture-to-use chain to present information on how substitutes based on existing chemicals are or could be used. In cases where the manufacturer of a chemical is also the formulator of a blend, the manufacturer would be responsible for meeting reporting requirements on the substitute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does not foresee a situation where any person who simply re-packages a substitute, i.e. does not in any way alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the substitute, would be the designated submitter. However, if the act of re-packaging a product is intended solely to allow for the introduction of a substitute into interstate commerce, that person would be the designated submitter under SNAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> End-users. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, end-users of substitutes will not be obligated to meet the reporting requirements discussed in this final rule, except in rare cases where the end-user and the producer of the substitute for commercial introduction in final form are the same person. While the Agency expects that this situation will occur infrequently, several large companies have developed substitutes for their own use and subsequently have notified EPA of their intent to offer those substitutes for commercial sale. Because EPA intends to require end-users to report only on those substitutes they plan to introduce into interstate commerce, evaluating and listing such substitutes will not stifle research and development innovations by end-users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Exemptions From Reporting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has identified several situations in which notification under the provisions of section 612 will not be required. These exemptions from reporting are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Substitutes already listed by EPA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As part of this final rule, the Agency has already completed the review of numerous class I and II alternatives and has determined that these substitutes are either acceptable or unacceptable. In preparing these determinations, the Agency evaluated information either on file or supplied in response to the NPRM published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 12, 1993. The substitutes list and supporting risk screens are described in more detail in section IX. No further submission is needed for any of those substitutes already listed as acceptable or unacceptable in this final rule. However, further information may be required for those substitutes listed as pending review in appendix B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small sectors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Most ozone-depleting substances have been or are currently used in large industrial sectors such as refrigeration and air conditioning or foam blowing. However, there are also numerous small uses of class I or II substances that fall outside of these major use sectors. While small use applications for class I and II compounds are varied and numerous, in the aggregate these small uses do not contribute substantially to ozone depletion. The Agency estimates that across all sectors these varied but small sector uses comprise in aggregate at most seven percent of total U.S. consumption of ozone-depleting substances. For more detail on the Agency's analysis and rationale for exempting small sectors, readers should refer to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for SNAP (58 FR 28094) published May 12, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

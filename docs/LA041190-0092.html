			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: GRAY HAIR CAN WASH YEARS OF SUCCESS DOWN THE DRAIN  </P> <P> For 15 years, Vince Boyle was on the other side, the side that hired and fired,  the side that came up with all sorts of creative excuses for handling the  unpleasantries of corporate personnel policy.  </P> <P> As vice president for human resources, Boyle was in on the power meetings. He  knew the mind set well.  </P> <P> "It's not what's written down," he says. "It's what's said in the boardroom  that counts. . . . It's a feeling, a psychological feeling."  </P> <P> So when the time came, nobody spelled it out. Vince Boyle says he knew what was  coming all the same.  </P> <P> "I could see the bullet headed straight at me."  </P> <P> At 56 years old, Vince Boyle was too old, a virtual relic in the leaner, meaner  world of corporate America. His company, an international financial firm in  Newport Beach, preferred to call his departure part of a reorganization.  </P> <P> "I was the only one who had gray hair and some of them were older than me,"  Boyle says. "This was a joke in our company. Then you see them on the street,  after we were all let go, and they all look like me. They were dyeing their  hair."  </P> <P> That was six years ago. Boyle hasn't had a steady job since.  </P> <P> He takes what he can find, which isn't much. His wife works. He volunteers. He  sends out resumes, hundreds and hundreds of them. Most aren't acknowledged.  </P> <P> Vince Boyle has done everything right. Except grow older.  </P> <P> Jim Young, who will be 65 this month, left Texaco voluntarily after 17 years,  seeking new challenges. He started his own oil-refining company, a small  operation in Signal Hill, and more than tripled his income. In 1979, his best  year, he reported an income of $92,000 to the IRS.  </P> <P> When the industry began hurting, and his company went belly up, Young became  executive director of an industry-lobbying group for 15 months. That ended in  1984.  </P> <P> Today, listed last among the "highlights of qualifications" on his two-page  resume, is this: Mature, dependable and very personable with good sense of  humor.  </P> <P> That helps.  </P> <P> Young has had to sell his house. For the past two years, he's been rooming with  his ex-wife in her mobile home in Huntington Beach. He can't find a good job.  Potential employers tell him that he's overqualified. He says that he'll take  way less.  </P> <P> They don't answer his letters. They say they'll keep his name on file. They  lie.  </P> <P> "They equate being old with being all used up," Jim Young says.  </P> <P> For the past five months, Young has been working behind the deli counter at a  Ralphs supermarket, serving salads and slicing cold meats. The department  manager is 26 years old. Young earns $5.75 an hour, working on the average  about 25 hours a week. He wishes that they would put him on full time.  </P> <P> Stanley Vitt, who lives in Orange, has a similar story. At 60 years old, he  takes what he can, a little here and there. He is divorced; his two children  grown. He has cleaned out the college fund that he set up for them years ago.  </P> <P> Three years ago in January, Vitt and 41 other professionals were let go. He was  a national sales manager -- in the wrong division. His company, in the  machine-tool industry, shut it down.  </P> <P> "For about a year after I was laid off, I thought I could get back into the  industry," he says. "I went on probably 30, 40 interviews. After about 20, 30  minutes, I'd be out the door, or they'd keep me there an hour, telling me that  I was overqualified, that I was too senior a manager."  </P> <P> Vitt, Young and Boyle are friends. They met through their involvement with  Rancho Santiago College's now-defunct Older Worker Task Force, of which Vitt  was chairman.  </P> <P> They've talked to all sorts of community groups in Orange County. They can  spout statistics, they can dispel myths. They are in good health, eager to work  and contribute.  </P> <P> The men talk of the graying of America, the declining birth rate, the  downsizing of corporations nationwide, the two-way street that is company  loyalty and the shortsightedness of companies that value youth over experience.  </P> <P> The county's official unemployment rate of 3% doesn't include older workers  such as them, who have been out of work for more than six months, who may be  listed as "early retirees."  </P> <P> "We've defined the problem," Young says. "But you don't get anywhere just  defining it. We haven't cracked that wall of age discrimination, which is alive  and well."  </P> <P> "We're part of a throwaway society," Boyle says. "They should use us for Earth  Day, recycle us."  </P> <P> We are having this conversation in my office, exchanging bits of horror stories  about the realities of the workplace in Orange County, where youth reigns  supreme.  </P> <P> Young tells of a co-worker at Ralphs who thinks that he's quite a brain. He  explained to her that the deli scale with the digital display interprets .25 as  a quarter-pound. She had no idea why that would be.  </P> <P> At the pizza parlor that he owned a few years back, Boyle noticed that the  workers had lined up their watches on a shelf near the front counter. He asked  them to put them in the back, out of public view.  </P> <P> Then one of Boyle's six children, who was managing the restaurant, explained  why the watches were there. The employees didn't know how to read the clock on  the wall. The watches' digital displays told them the time.  </P> <P> The men say they've given up on self-pity, that now they're just talking common  sense.  </P> <P> "Ten years from now, we would not be sitting around here having this  conversation," Young tells me. "Industry, businesses, will be forced to hire  older workers. Demographics do not support today's attitude."  </P> <P> After about an hour and a half, the men take their leave. They're heading for  lunch together, to talk some more. They've got time to spare.  </P> <P>  Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Readers may reach  Klein by writing to her at The Times Orange County Edition, 1375 Sunflower  Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626, or calling (714) 966-7406.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: MARK HIS WORDS, 60 HOME RUNS STILL POSSIBLE  </P> <P> In the long history of major league baseball, only 10 men have hit 50 or more  homers in a season. Only two have hit 60 or more.  </P> <P> It's been 28 years since anyone hit 50 in the American League. That would be  Roger Maris, who hit 61 in 1961.  </P> <P> When he did that, the then-commissioner of baseball, quaking in his concern for  the memory of Babe Ruth, put an asterisk next to the achievement in the record  book, noting that it was done in a season eight games longer than the ones Ruth  played in. The commissioner was afraid, apparently, that the 60-homer season  would become commonplace with expansion.  </P> <P> Ford Frick needn't have worried. Not only has no one hit 60 in that league  since, no one has even hit 50.  </P> <P> Will anyone ever hit 60 again? Will anyone even hit 50?  </P> <P> I took the problem to one of the young men I consider to be a prime threat to,  one day, get an asterisk after his name -- Mark McGwire.  </P> <P> McGwire is a hitter for the Oakland Athletics, who looks as if he had just  walked off a Saturday Evening Post cover -- sandy hair, blue eyes, just a hint  of freckles. He's as strong as truck-stop coffee and as uncomplicated as a  summer day, the All-American type who seemingly can deal with the everyday  pressures of big league baseball as nonchalantly as the Babe himself.  </P> <P> McGwire hit more home runs, 49, in his first year than any other rookie who  ever played and might have hit 50 if he hadn't shortened the season to go home  for the birth of his first child.  </P> <P> Very few people have hit 100 home runs as quickly in their big league careers  as McGwire. His teammate, Jose Canseco, is one. Tony Conigliaro of the Boston  Red Sox was another.  </P> <P> So I thought Mark might be a good man to ask what it might take to hit 60 home  runs now. Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco Giants is 18 homers ahead of him  this year -- but Mark is 14 ahead of Mitchell lifetime. And four years younger.  </P> <P> Are 60 homers in a season even possible?  </P> <P> McGwire thinks so.  </P> <P> "I know guys who can do it," he said. "Freddy McGriff of Toronto, Jose  (Canseco), Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry."  </P> <P> What about Mark McGwire?  </P> <P> McGwire sighed. "Well, it would depend on a number of factors."  </P> <P> Such as?  </P> <P> "Well, let's see. It'd go about like this:  </P> <P> "1. The media. You have to take into account what the media would do today as  you got closer. I don't think those old-time ballplayers like Ruth and Maris  had that to contend with. (Oh, yes, Maris did!)  </P> <P> "Today, you would have Channels 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and '60 Minutes' and every  magazine and newspaper in the country on your doorstep, in your locker, in the  shower. To hit 60 home runs, you'd need to concentrate solely on your game and  these distractions wouldn't help.  </P> <P> "2. Jose Canseco. You need the other dangerous hitter in the lineup behind you  or ahead of you. Ruth had (Lou) Gehrig. Henry Aaron had Eddie Mathews. Maris  had Mickey Mantle. (Willie) Mays had (Willie) McCovey. Frank Robinson had  Brooks Robinson.  </P> <P> "I would need Jose Canseco. Or vice versa. You need that other hitter so the  pitchers can't pitch around you, so that you get pitches to hit. You can't get  60 home runs swinging at ball four all season."  </P> <P> "3. Adjustment. You're not going to get the same pitches all year long. What  you hit home runs off the first half of the season, you're not going to get the  last half. Pitchers will make you hit something else. They're not going to  throw you what you've shown you can hit.  </P> <P> "You have to adjust to a new location or a new speed. That's why a lot of guys  have a flock of home runs by the All-Star break but tail off after that. You  don't get 60 homers in a half a season."  </P> <P> "4. Health. You have to stay healthy and injury-free. You have to be able to  fight off fatigue. September might be the most important month. (Ruth hit 17  home runs in September of the season he hit 60.) And if you're mentally  fatigued, your timing is all off.  </P> <P> "5. Pull. I don't mean influence, I mean pulling the ball. I get most of my  home runs to left-center or center. To hit 60, you have to pull the ball a lot,  get your share of foul-line home runs. I don't think it's possible to hit 60  420-foot home runs. Too many things have to go just right.  </P> <P> "6. Patience. I never, or almost never, hit a home run while I'm trying to. I  didn't even know I was a home run hitter when I was coming up. I just tried to  hit the ball fair some place. That's when you get home runs. I led the nation  (with 32 home runs) when I was in college (at USC). Then I hit 24 home runs at  Modesto. But a home run happens. You don't forceit."  </P> <P> It's been a generation now since anyone even hit 50 in the American League. Lou  Gehrig never hit 50. Neither did the all-time homer champion, Henry Aaron.  Neither did Roger Maris, except for his record year.  </P> <P> The only batters who hit 60 were left-handed, but all but three of the nine who  hit 50 were strictly right-handed -- Ralph Kiner, Mays, Hack Wilson, Hank  Greenberg, Jimmie Foxx, George Foster. Mantle was a switch-hitter, Johnny Mize  and Ruth were lefties.  </P> <P> Are even 50 possible?  </P> <P> McGwire laughed. "Well, I would need some great September!" He has 21 to date.  </P> <P> Does he aim for 600 lifetime?  </P> <P> McGwire shook his head. "What my goal is has nothing to do with that. I want to  win a WorldSeries."  </P> <P> Well, there's one way to look at that: Every guy who has ever hit 60 home runs  has led his team to a World Series victory. Look it up.  </P></p>

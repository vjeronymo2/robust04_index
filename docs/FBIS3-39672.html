			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara Feb 21 (CTK) -- Turkish Defence Minister  Mehmet Golhan today practically rejected a personal initiative  on a solution to the situation in Bosnia put forward by Antonin  Baudys, his Czech counterpart.    At his meeting with Baudys, who is currently on a three-day  visit to Ankara, Golhan said that the initiative "does not  reflect the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina." The  Turkish side above all rejects the assumption that the conflict  was religiously motivated.    "In our opinion, it is above all necessary to keep intact  the  territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,  a state recognised by the United Nations and the international  community," Golhan said, adding that "Bosnia and Herzegovina  must not be partitioned."    He hinted that Ankara's view is that the Bosnian (mainly  Muslim) Government led by President Alija Izetbegovich is the  only legal party to the conflict.    Handing over powers to an executive goodwill committee is  seen as inadequate because it basically involves the division of  the republic, Golhan said.    At the same time, however, Golhan praised Baudys's  initiative, saying that "similar proposals contribute to ending  the war in Bosnia and that is what makes them welcome."</p>

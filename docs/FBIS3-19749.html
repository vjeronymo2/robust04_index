			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with "Just Order" cofounder Suleyman Karagulle by </F> Rusen Cakir via FAX from Bishkek; date not given: "What Erbakan  Is Doing Is Not Just Order"]    [Text] Along with increased votes for the Prosperity Party  [RP] has also come the party's "Just Order." Suleyman Karagulle,  who made a significant contribution to creation of the project,  does not believe that the RP and Necmettin Erbakan are sincere  about the "Just Order." Karagulle lives in the Kyrgyzstan  capital, Bishkek, and answered our questions by FAX.    [Cakir] Is the "Just Order" platform that Necmettin Erbakan  proposed the same as the one you developed?    [Karagulle] Erbakan and I worked together on the "Just  Order." We agreed on almost all of the sentences. We had no  disagreements except for one or two matters. Nevertheless,  phrases were changed over time. Meanings change even if the  words do not. Different things can be understood by the same  words. You understand this only in practice. I cannot say  anything because we have not seen it in practice.    [Cakir] You said on the news that the RP considered the  "Just  Order" a means of propaganda and did not intend to implement it.  Do you still feel this way?    [Karagulle] I said that the project had nothing to do with  the RP platform, that the RP had done no preparation for it, and  that it has talked about it rather than implement it. This talk  may be only to win votes. You must ask them, not me, what  happens next. I am forced to make this statement because they  have the power, but are not doing anything. They are better at  implementing the existing order. This prompts hesitation about  the Just Order. I want to tell people again and again that what  Erbakan is saying is true, but what he is doing is not the Just  Order.    It does Erbakan no harm for me to say this. The Just Order  has opponents within the RP, and it is Erbakan's job to win them  over. Moreover, the West also fears the Just Order. If they  would learn the facts, they would not be so opposed.    The RP may be angry at me, but they are always angry at me  anyway.    [Cakir] What do you think will happen if the RP wins the  election?    [Karagulle] Nothing will happen if the RP wins. The other  parties will tighten up at the table and give the RP room. They  cannot solve problems with this logic, and today's hard times  will continue and grow worse. A single party cannot solve  Turkey's problems, but the Just Order can.    There is no majority system under the Just Order, but a  national coalition. It is an order that recognizes the rights of  one sheep as well as the other 99. The RP is saying "Just  Order," but is chasing after a majority system. And it will take  advantage of the tyranny of the order. This is what will happen,  but they are the "false dawn" (false enlightenment). True  believers in the just order will come after them, and they will  save humanity.</p>

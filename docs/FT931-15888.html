			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Master of character movies - Nigel Andrews talks to the hottest director in Hollywood, Rob Reiner STATURE in the film industry comes in different shapes and sizes. There are slightly-built wunderkinder like Spielberg and Scorsese: pocket-size prodigies grappling with their mega-projects. And then there are big, bearish men like Rob Reiner who look as if they missed vocations as wrestlers or nightclub bouncers. Reiner is currently wrestling with the burden of being the hottest film-maker in Hollywood. As director of A Few Good Men, he has just overseen the cinema's first ever 'global premiere'. The Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson drama, in addition to opening in 50 countries on the same date, has so far grossed Dollars 80m at the US box office and is tipped for about a dozen Oscar nominations. The only question in the minds of some Reiner fans is: 'Was the this the film we hoped for from the maker of When Harry Met Sally and Misery?' On meeting the director, you do not want to ask this first. If he was never a bouncer, he might have been. And he was everything else before taking to direction, including a two-time Emmy award-winning actor for his role as the son-in-law in All In The Family, American TV's answer to Till Death Us Do Part. Before that he had his own family show, stranger than fiction. Son of film farceur Carl Reiner (The Jerk, All Of Me), he was born into a household dense with the human fall-out from the famed Sid Caesar TV show of the 1950s, whose writers included not just Reiner pere but Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and Woody Allen: just the crowd to crush the self-esteem out of a innocent ten-year-old. But when Reiner became a film-maker, it was with a comic masterwork of his own. This Is Spinal Tap (1984) is a feature-length mockumentary about a fictive British rock group. Its deadpan hilarity - many thought it was about a real group - went unappreciated for half a decade, since when it has become a cult. Later Reiner movies - Stand By Me, The Sure Thing, The Princess Bride, Harry/Sally, Misery - are startling for the Rorschach randomness of their genres and styles: romantic comedy, road movie, fairy tale, Gothic thriller. 'I hope all my films are about human experience,' Reiner volunteers: 'that they don't rely too much on car crashes, special effects, explosions. What I like to do is find a main character I can identify with, whether it's the writer in Misery or the struggling lawyer in A Few Good Men or the guy with an accident-prone love life in When Harry Met Sally.' Hence the off-kilter realism of Reiner's best work. When Harry Met Sally is as good a comedy of relationships, rueful, unblinkered and hilarious, as any outside Woody Allen. And Misery is a no-tricks Stephen King story directed with simple power and humming performances (James Caan and Oscar-winning Kathy Bates). So what is Reiner doing directing A Few Good Men, already nicknamed in Hollywood 'A Few Big Names'? Unlike his previous chamber pieces, here is a formula movie built to Formula-1 standards. Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson don the goggles as the Guantanamo Bay Grand Prix roars towards the chequered Oscars. That the movie, based on Aaron Sorkin's Broadway play about a Marine base murder, is a crowd-pleaser is beyond doubt. (Si monumentum requiris, read the Variety charts). Reiner also claims a little subversive boldness for it by citing the non-cooperation he had from US military in the matter of using real bases and personnel. 'I had an interview at the Pentagon with the assistant to the Marine Commandant. I said, I think you're being very parochial; you want this movie to be a recruiting film. But it's not an indictment of the Marine Corps, if anything it's a celebration of the military justice system. I think you should take the high road.' They didn't. But to the film's credit, its substitute low-road locations seem the real thing. So - for much of the time - does the conviction with which Cruise's wastrel-turned-hero Navy lawyer is played and directed. 'I was interested in his personal struggle. Kaffee (Cruise) is trying to escape the shadow of his father to become his own man.' So, on scrutiny, are most Reiner protagonists. Stand By Me was about a gang of boys who 'grow up' when they encounter a dead body. The Sure Thing and When Harry Met Sally were comedy-romances about the tussle between grown-up love and eternal-teenager sex. And what interested Reiner in filming Stephen King's Misery was not the eek-gasp Gothic stuff but the story of a novelist trying to outgrow his best-selling juvenilia. 'He's a successful creative person trying to break away from the mould and establish himself in a new way - but fearful he'd do badly. It's what I had felt on leaving All In The Family and trying to establish myself as a director. It was difficult for others to see me in a new light. So Misery for me was a metaphor for an artist's struggle to grow, and the demons he must face inside himself.' Yet one wonders if Reiner has conquered his own demons and tyrants. His best earlier movies, especially When Harry Met Sally, are more mature works than A Few Good Men. While the first pursues its personal idea through daringly plotless alleys and high-risk casting (neither Meg Ryan nor Billy Crystal were yet stars), the new movie is a Well-Made Film big with superstars and impersonal takeaway themes. Perhaps Reiner realises that Hollywood giveth and Hollywood taketh away. Even running one's own production company - and Reiner's Castle Rock is the most successful in town - is no guarantee of eternal survival. A Few Good Men looks suspiciously like a sop to the box-office from a film-maker who wants to stay solvent while cultivating the unique cottage industry he has created in Beverly Hills. 'It's very difficult to be artistically free in Hollywood today,' Reiner says. 'Most film companies, certainly most studios, are not run by people whose main interest is film. The average major studio is a tiny speck on the portfolio of a multi-national corporation. They're not in the business of putting on shows but of turning out 'product'.' So if AFGM looks like product, let's hope it's part of the prosperity strategy for Castle Rock: designed to allow Reiner and Co to go on making their low-cost character movies that chart the moods and mores of a changing America. The most courageously funny scene in modern cinema - and one epitomising Reiner's touch at its best - comes in When Harry Met Sally. It's the moment when Meg Ryan performs fake-orgasm noises in a crowded restaurant before a horrified Billy Crystal. A male director here created one of the great feminist moments in film. And no one who sees and hears it forgets. Who, though, I asked Reiner, was the supporting actress who then capped the scene with the funniest line in the film? She plays a customer who says to a passing waitress, 'I'll have what she just had.' 'That was no supporting actress,' says Reiner. 'That was my mother.'</p>

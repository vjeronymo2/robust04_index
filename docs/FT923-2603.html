			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Sellafield work halts after leak A SEEPAGE of six gallons of plutonium nitrate is expected to halt reprocessing at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield plant in west Cumbria for a further four weeks, the company said yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. No radioactivity escaped into working areas or the environment, the company said. BNFL, which stopped reprocessing last week after the seepage from a plutonium evaporator was discovered, is preparing a report, which will require Nuclear Installations Inspectorate approval, on plans to recover the liquid. The company said no employees would be laid off. It still hoped to catch up on its reprocessing programme, which is its core business.</p>

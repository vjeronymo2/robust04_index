			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Be prepared - and be armed: Patching over differences at the EU summit will test the Belgian prime minister The man who will chair the summit of European Union leaders in Brussels at the end of this week started his career as chief of the Flemish Association of Catholic Boy Scouts. If that conjures up a picture of an overgrown schoolboy in shorts, think again. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister, is blunt-talking, stocky and - in the judgment of both allies and enemies - very tough. More significantly, Mr Dehaene, 53, will come to the summit on December 10 and 11 as one of the only leaders already trying to implement in his own country a far-reaching austerity plan. The aim is to improve Belgium's competitiveness, promote employment and cut the government deficit. Given that the summit will be seeking solutions to those problems at a European level, Mr Dehaene's role as chairman will be more than honorific. 'The Belgian government's action is explicitly integrated into the European context,' Mr Dehaene said last month. 'The plan that the government is preparing has to be considered as one component of a co-ordinated European plan, as a contribution to the (European Commission's) white paper (on growth, competitiveness and employment).' EU leaders had a taste of Mr Dehaene's no-nonsense chairmanship at October's special summit in Brussels, when he helped forge agreement on where to locate the most important new EU institutions, such as the central bank. In spite of an acrimonious row in the afternoon between Britain and Spain over the site for the European medicines agency, Mr Dehaene announced a deal in time for supper. But this week's summit will have none of the celebratory overtones of the October meeting, which was called in part to mark the entry into force of the Maastricht treaty. It will tackle issues that go to the heart of political differences between European leaders. Finance ministers gave a flavour of what could be in store in their first discussion of the Commission's thoughts on the white paper two weeks ago. The UK and Germany forced Brussels to water down guidelines for boosting economic growth and halting the rise in unemployment, and other ministers picked holes in the white paper. Under such circumstances, Mr Dehaene's experience in wringing compromise out of feuding parties, regions and linguistic groups in Belgium should stand him in good stead. 'He's a typical Belgian type of negotiator. These people are used to hammering out compromises and never giving in,' said one EU diplomat. 'I think we've already experienced under the Belgian presidency more late-night sessions than ever before.' At the same time, the recent talks on a national austerity plan have made the Belgian prime minister painfully aware of what will be at stake at the December summit. Mr Dehaene originally hoped Belgium could climb out of recession with the help of a 'social pact', which would unite unions, employers and the centre-left coalition government around a balanced series of measures. As it was, within 36 hours of the start of formal three-way negotiations at the end of October, the socialist unions had walked out. In the next three weeks, he formulated a plan with the socialist and Christian Democrat members of the coalition. Under the plan - the most ambitious since the war - real wage increases will be frozen for the next three years, spending on family allowances, healthcare and pensions cut by BFr75bn (Pounds 1.4bn), the cost of hiring labour reduced, and certain indirect taxes increased. But the unions will not let the prime minister forget that he forged a deal without them. Union federations aligned with the coalition parties have carried out rolling strike action to protest against parts of the plan, in particular cuts in social security and what they consider inadequate provisions for improving employment. A general strike 10 days ago caused chaos, and the socialist unions are planning a large demonstration to coincide with the summit. Meanwhile, the government is short on popular support. An opinion poll published a fortnight ago indicated that nearly three-quarters of Belgians wanted the government to resign. As one Belgian newspaper headline put it: 'Le plan Dehaene seduit la bourse mais deprime la rue' (Dehaene's plan charms the stock market but depresses the streets). Economists are already warning that, if the government backs down or breaks up under such pressure, the limited short-term benefits of the plan's announcement (a stronger Belgian franc, lower interest rates, rising equities) will be quickly lost, and the long-term economic consequences could be catastrophic, with the country's budget deficit spiralling out of control. Mr Dehaene has won the support of parliament for a fast-track procedure to transform the plan into formal legislation, but he is still trying to placate unions and employers, and this week begins a further round of talks with the various sides on possible adjustments to the programme. Interviewed yesterday on Belgian television, he said changes would affect the execution of the plan, and not the balance of measures. His advisers hope these amendments will be enough to mollify the plan's opponents without disillusioning those economists and outside investors who originally welcomed the programme. Mr Dehaene is used to such political balancing acts. Since taking over as prime minister in March 1992, his government has had to produce five packages of budget measures to curb the deficit. In March, the prime minister was forced to offer his resignation to the king to persuade his coalition partners to sign up to further cuts in spending, reinforcing the impression that he is a strong captain at the head of a weak team. Before that, he managed to put together a two-thirds majority in the Belgian parliament - including opposition parties - to vote through constitutional reforms transforming Belgium into a federal state, with further powers devolved to its regions. 'He's a little bit of a bulldozer,' said Mr Xavier Mabille, a political analyst at the Centre de Recherche &amp; d'Information Socio-Politiques in Brussels. 'But when one sets strong arguments against him, he is sufficiently intelligent to realise that he has to negotiate.' For the summit, Mr Dehaene will need his negotiating skills more than his bulldozing capacity. The task before EU leaders is not to come up with a programme of legislation, as the Belgian government has done, but to set out the guidelines for co-ordinated national and European policy. But at the same time, the Belgian presidency has indicated that it will aim to strengthen the Commission's growth plans, not dilute them. Given that the Belgian government is already taking the heat at home for its proposals, that is not surprising. Mr Dehaene believes the Belgian austerity programme will make an important contribution to a European plan, but he also sees Belgium benefiting from a co-ordinated European growth and competitiveness policy leading to monetary union. If, as Mr Mabille says, Belgium is 'a little Europe', it is emitting mixed signals to other EU leaders still agonising over budget cuts. When he opens the summit on Friday, Mr Dehaene will almost certainly have to explain away demonstrating workers on the streets outside the conference chamber, play down the consequent unpopularity of his coalition, and provide evidence of his government's will to implement all of the austerity plan. But he will also be armed, unlike many of his counterparts, with concrete evidence of how his country is trying to confront the larger problems facing the Union. Like all good scouts, he will be prepared.</p>

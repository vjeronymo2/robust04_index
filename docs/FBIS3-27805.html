Billy Graham and his party left here Tuesday,  concluding their six-day visit to the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea.    While staying in Pyongyang the pastor and his party visited  different places.    After going round the Chilgol revolutionary site, the pastor  said he was deeply moved by visiting Chilgol after reading the  great President Kim Il-song's reminiscences.    The guests met with officials of the Central Committee of  the  Korean Roman Catholics Association and attended divine service  at the Chilgol Church.    They inspected the tower of the chuche idea.    After the inspection the pastor wrote in the visitor's book  that the tower of the chuche idea graphically represented the  philosophical idea of the great President Kim Il-song and was  very inspiring.    The guests were shown round the Korean folklore museum and  the Mangyongdae School Children's Palace.    Rev. Billy Graham hosted a party Monday evening upon the  conclusion of his Korean visit.</p>

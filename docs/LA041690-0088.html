			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> RESTAURANT'S OWNER KILLS ALLEGED ROBBER  </P> <P> Two men were in custody Sunday on suspicion of robbing a Vietnamese restaurant  where a third alleged robber was shot to death by the owner during the  altercation, police said.  </P> <P> Chuc Van Nguyen, 25, and Tam Cong Huynh, 21, have been booked into County Jail,  while Cuong Chi Nguyen, the 53-year-old owner of the eatery, was released after  questioning without being charged, Police Lt. Andrew E. Hall said.  </P> <P> Investigators determined that Cuong Chi Nguyen shot 24-year-old Hoang Van Le  about 11:30 p.m. Saturday in self-defense after the three men entered Mai-Hong  Restaurant intending to rob it, Hall said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the three men were arguing with the owner of the restaurant when  he pulled out a handgun and shot Le several times in the chest. Officers  arrived before the suspects could flee, and paramedics pronounced the Garden  Grove resident dead at the scene, Hall said.  </P> <P> Hall said Le and his friends were armed but did not use guns to threaten  Nguyen. He did not know what type of weapons they were carrying.  </P> <P> Cuong Chi Nguyen, who lives in Fountain Valley with his family of nine, was not  at the restaurant Sunday.  </P> <P> "He's very upset," his daughter, Diep My Nguyen, 26, said. She also said she  had worked at the restaurant Saturday night but went home early and was told  about the shooting by a friend who had heard about it. THUAN LE  </P></p>

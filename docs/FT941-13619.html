			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (6): Mediation is quicker and cheaper - The UK is one of several countries following the US in alternative dispute resolution 'Conflict is eternal,' notes Tony Willis, managing partner for litigation at Clifford Chance - a good vantage point from which to make the observation. But as impatience with the problems of litigation mounts, it is not surprising that the UK is following the US lead in embracing alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as a means of resolving contentious matters. 'Essentially, the heavy costs, delays, uncertainties and unwieldy processes of litigation common to all common law countries are the main reasons for people turning to ADR,' says Professor Karl Mackie, chief executive of the Centre for Dispute Resolution (CEDR) in London. As he explains, 'the evolving business culture characterised by rapid change, emphasis on fast responses and getting value for money set against a Dickensian legal system make a powerful cocktail for change.' Mr Willis, who is himself experienced in ADR, confirms that the problems of litigation are now often unacceptable to clients and advisers. While in the US the term ADR usually includes binding arbitration, in the UK it normally refers to non-adjudicatory techniques. 'For commercial disputes,' observes Professor Mackie, 'mediation, which bears a close resemblance to negotiation, is overwhelmingly the most popular ADR form in the UK.' Nevertheless, other techniques may be suitable for particular disputes. Executive tribunals - called mini-trials in the US, and more formal in nature - involve case appraisal by executive evaluators and a neutral chairman; the judicial appraisal scheme launched recently by CEDR, similar to the US 'rent-a-judge' system, provides retired judges and lawyers to assess the legal merits of a case and to narrow the issues for those considering litigation. Though unsuitable in some cases, for example, where injunctive relief is required, ADR generally offers many advantages over litigation, including a wider range of solutions, a better control of risk and confidentiality. Another significant benefit, says Roger Myddelton, Grand Metropolitan's group legal director, is that ADR can help preserve the commercial relationship because it need not involve allocations of fault. 'The process looks forwards rather than backwards.' But it is in the cost area where ADR's benefits are especially tantalising. 'For a major matter in the commercial court, costs can run into millions of pounds,' says Mr Willis. Costs at CEDR are based on the amount in dispute and range from several hundred to over a thousand pounds a day, depending on the amount in dispute. Most mediations, however, settle in one to three days: a recent CEDR-arranged mediation of a dispute involving Pounds 27m, set for a 12-week hearing, lasted just one day. In the US, as in England, about 90-95 per cent of filed cases are resolved before trial, so there is often little reason for companies not to try ADR early on. But ADR is a more recent phenomenon in the UK than in the US. Since its launch in 1990, CEDR has had some 360 cases, worth approximately Pounds 1.5bn, referred to it, and mediation has a 90-95 per cent success rate. 'After some initial reluctance ADR's growth rate shows a steep increase,' says Professor Mackie. 'The influence of a skilled trained mediator means it is much more powerful than private negotiation.' The recent experience of Colin Gilbert, group legal director of Eurocopy, bears this out. CEDR arranged a mediation for the company's Pounds 300,000 dispute involving a client and three leasing companies. The trigger to try ADR was the desire to preserve the client relationship. Mr Gilbert says: 'I thought there was little common ground, but I was astounded.' The matter was resolved in just one day, with the parties representing themselves. Costs were about Pounds 1,000 each. Mr Gilbert is experienced in litigation; his estimate of legal costs on the matter was about Pounds 40,000 each. Surviving the experience successfully has cemented the relationship between the parties, he says. Most CEDR cases are domestic, but its international referrals are growing - a consequence of the growth of international trade, the complexities of cross-border litigation and the growing recognition of ADR's value. Elsewhere, the trend is similar. Sydney is the home of the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre, established with government backing in 1986. New York has one of the oldest ADR centres: the Centre for Public Resources (CPR). Interest is growing elsewhere. CEDR has recently received a European Commission grant to consult on the development of ADR in continental Europe. Yet despite the increasing interest in ADR among the private sector, and the high settlement rates in litigation, courts in England until now have provided no incentives to settlement. As Mr Willis of Clifford Chance points out, while in Germany and France judges may intervene to influence the parties to settle cases, in England they do not do so. 'But ADR can provide the missing element,' he says. It may now do so. Aware of public dissatisfaction with litigation, legal regulators are beginning to recognise ADR. The commercial court has now established a court-annexed ADR scheme, prompted by the recommendations of the 1993 Heilbron Report on the civil courts (which was damning in its findings). Legal advisers to court litigants must ensure that parties are informed of the most cost-effective means of resolving particular issues and disputes. The commercial court clerk keeps a list of ADR services. This includes numerous former commercial court judges and ADR bodies such as CEDR. Prof Mackie notes that while the Lord Chancellor's department has expressed an interest in ADR, no formal approach for discussions on the subject has been made to CEDR. Experts say that parties must be willing to seek an agreed solution for ADR to be effective - but the spectre of full litigation is a spur. 'ADR nearly always works better in conjunction with traditional means of adjudicative dispute resolution, or at least with their availability,' says Mr Willis. 'ADR is not a panacea, and the sometimes arduous disciplines it requires need to be learnt.' While the take-up rate of ADR in England has been faster than in the US, Mr Willis believes that the spread of business people with a detailed knowledge of the area remains thin. Top management is likely to be most interested, given its responsibilities, although the US practice of some chief executives pledging to endeavour to resolve disputes by ADR may not take off so soon in the UK. Still, Mr Willis says that in many cases ADR presents a better solution in resolving disputes and there is growing experience in the field. Education and familiarity remain the key. 'People's scepticism is usually overcome when they appreciate the system's common sense, simplicity and effectiveness,' says Professor Mackie. In-house lawyers have long seen effective dispute management as important to their role. GrandMet's Mr Myddelton fosters ADR. Of those in private practice, Professor Mackie says, 'lawyers have a constructive role to play in ADR but some may feel there is no financial incentive to encourage its use, so clients also need to be more assertive with legal advisers.' Nevertheless, he is optimistic. 'As lawyers become more experienced in ADR they will develop a better sense of how it can contribute to their practice. We are on the verge of a big growth in ADR.'</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Indian MPs savage the financial establishment: The Bombay stocks scandal inquiry Rarely can a parliamentary inquiry into a financial scandal have produced such a comprehensively damning report as that published yesterday by Indian MPs examining last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay stock market scandal. The committee criticised almost every aspect of India's financial markets - its banks, brokers, leasing companies, industrial groups, state-owned industry, the Reserve Bank of India and the government. It catalogued hundreds of sins of commission and omission in language bordering on the Biblical and called for punishment with a withering disregard of extenuating circumstances. As one Indian newspaper editor said last night: 'It's full of simulated moral outrage.' The scandal involved the illegal siphoning of funds from banks to the stock market through the collusion of bankers, brokers, and public and private sector companies. MPs pull their punches in respect of only two people - Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. In Mr Narasimha Rao's case they refrain from commenting on the explosive allegations made this summer by Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal, that he tried to bribe the prime minister with a suitcase full of money. In Mr Manmohan Singh's case, the committee avoids holding him responsible by name for his ministry's alleged failings - though the report does say in scarcely veiled language that 'the responsibility and accountability of the minister of finance to parliament cannot be denied.' Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Manmohan Singh escaped because of their political importance. Opposition members of the committee said yesterday they would have pursued both ministers more vigorously given the chance. The ruling Congress (I) party's success in keeping Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Manmohan Singh's names off the list of the guilty indicates that the political impact of the report may be limited. Nevertheless the committee was fiercely critical of virtually everyone concerned: Mr Manmohan Singh's plea that a distinction be drawn between his direct responsibilities and those of the ministry and institutions he oversees was rejected. 'Such a distinction cannot be sustained by the constitutional jurisprudence under which the parliamentary system works.' The finance ministry failed to anticipate the scandal, to respond to it properly, to manage the effects, to apply the necessary post-scandal reforms and to punish the guilty resolutely. Among other shortcomings, the committee found that the ministry's representative attended only 15 of 49 meetings of the Reserve Bank of India's central board in 1986-92. MPs say this was negligent. The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) was accused of ignoring warning signs as far back as 1986; of not following up the findings of inspection reports; of turning a blind eye to irregularities and of being soft on foreign banks for fear of upsetting India's international creditworthiness. Three present or former senior officials are accused by name of 'gross dereliction of duty.' MPs recommended establishing a Board of Financial Supervision inside the central bank to assume from the main board overall responsibility for banking supervision. Banks were accused of management failings, including lax checks on transactions and book-keeping. The finance ministry was accused of being negligent in its role of appointing the senior director of the many state-owned banks. MPs recommended reform of the recruitment procedures to bring in candidates from outside the civil service. Foreign banks were blamed for originating the scandal and becoming the biggest players in it, and for throwing overboard 'all principles of prudence and safety.' Standard Chartered Bank, ANZ Grindlays, Citibank and Bank of America, the main operators in the inter-bank securities market among foreign banks, were singled out for particular attack for allegedly breaking Indian laws and infringing laws in their own countries. Public Sector Units were criticised for allowing their funds, mostly secured via cheap government-backed credits, to be recycled into stock market investments. 'All this was public money and all who were playing with it were public servants.' The Bombay Stock Exchange was second only to the foreign banks as a target for the committee's venom. Insider trading by brokers, reluctance to publish price data openly, ineffective audits and tax returns and virtually non-existent punitive action on the part of the stock exchange authorities were all highlighted. The committee urged the finance ministry to crack down quickly and heavily on individuals involved in the scandal and still occupying senior positions in banks, brokers and elsewhere. The banking laws should be strengthened to include harsher penalties for wrong-doing. Stringent penalties should be imposed on foreign banks 'including suspension of their licences'. MPs accepted that the creation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog which started operating after the scandal, would improve regulation. But they said it had come too late and needed to be tough. The committee wrongly linked the scandal to the economic liberalisation which started in mid-1991. In fact, the origins of the affair pre-date reform and its causes lie in the complex mix of restrictive regulations and ineffective supervision which characterised the pre-reform financial system. MPs urged the government to give full weight to improving supervision saying 'deregulation without effective checks and balances would be an unmitigated disaster.'</p>

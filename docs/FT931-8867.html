			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sparkle goes out of glamour stock - Malaysia's partially privatised power utility WHEN Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's electricity utility, was partially privatised early last year, it became an instant glamour stock. Within hours, shares were changing hands at nearly double the initial offering price of MDollars 4.50 (USDollars 1.70). Tenaga quickly became Malaysia's biggest listed company, with a market capitalisation of nearly MDollars 30bn (USDollars 11.4bn), accounting for more than 20 per cent of total stock market value. But the lustre has gone out of Tenaga. Both local and foreign investors have become disenchanted and on the Kuala Lumpur stock market last week the shares fell 7 per cent, reducing the total market value of the company from MDollars 28.35bn to MDollars 26.4bn. The reasons for Tenaga's decline range from acts of God to management deficiencies and political in-fighting. Things started to go wrong on September 29 last year, when the lights went out through most of peninsula Malaysia. Power in many areas was restored only after several days. Preliminary estimates of industrial losses due to the blackout came to more than MDollars 200m. Mr Samy Vellu, the energy minister, blamed the power failure on a freak lightning strike - an 'act of God'. Not everyone, and that includes some government ministers, was satisfied. While about 25 per cent of Tenaga is in private hands - with a fifth of that controlled by foreign fund managers - the company is still under the control of the ministry of finance. Critics say Tenaga is still bureaucratically run, with little accountability in many areas and too much government interference. The company also finds itself caught up in high-level political arguments between Mr Vellu and other cabinet ministers. There has been anger that a full report on the September 29 blackout has still not been made public. Recent nervousness about Tenaga has been caused by renewed blackouts in many areas. But the company says that essential maintenance and building work means that a certain amount of power shedding will continue for another year. It says peak demand in Malaysia's fast growing economy has been greater than anticipated and has called on heavy industrial users to adjust working hours to off-peak periods. This suggestion does not seem to have gone down well with industrialists or with some members of the government. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, who, as minister of trade and industry, deals with foreign investors in the country, describes as 'intolerable' the number of complaints she has received. 'Tenaga's current performance is not up to the mark,' she says. A system of rebates has been proposed to compensate industrialists. But some companies say they are investigating legal action against Tenaga. Most worrying for Tenaga and its future prospects have been suggestions that other companies be invited to participate in running the national grid, now solely in its hands. Independent power producers have already been invited to build, operate and own a number of power stations in Malaysia. The first such project, a joint project between National Power of the UK and a local company, is due on stream by 1995. Analysts point out that Tenaga has good prospects - if present difficulties can be overcome and if the government does not decide to drastically limit the scope of its activities. Tenaga made pre-tax profits of MDollars 1.41bn in the year ended August, 1992, up from MDollars 702m previously. It has gained not only from the massive infusion of funds from its partial privatisation in May last year but also from the appreciation of the Malaysian dollar against the US dollar, which has resulted in a reduction in the company's dollar loan portfolio. Tenaga has entered into several projects with UK companies; it is likely to benefit substantially from the fall in the value of sterling, particularly in the purchase of high cost electricity generating equipment. Tenaga is confident that once the present problems are overcome, medium and long term prospects are bright. 'Tenaga is a good investment in the long term,' says Dr Ani Arope, Tenaga's executive chairman. 'In a rapidly industrialising economy like Malaysia's it is even more attractive because electricity demand has not peaked and will continue to pace the GDP growth for many years ahead.' But public and government patience is wearing thin. 'The power crisis is a priority for the government,' says Mrs Aziz. 'If Tenaga cannot meet demand, then the private sector will have to come in. Tenaga will have no more monopoly of electricity supply.'</p>

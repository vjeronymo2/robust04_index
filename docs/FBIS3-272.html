He is believed to have been arrested  in February of this year, after Andre Santana Pitra Petroff, the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party,  MPLA-PT, government's interior minister, had accused him of  incitement in the incidents that led to Bloody Friday on 22  January of last year in which many citizens of Bakongo origin  were murdered by the MPLA-PT's police. PDP-ANA had accused the  MPLA-PT government of involvement in that massacre.    Once the PDP-ANA's militants had learned that their leader  had been detained, they asked the United Nations to intervene  and secure his release, but so far nothing has been said  concerning Lando Vitor's whereabouts. This matter is beginning  to worry the Angolan opposition.</p>

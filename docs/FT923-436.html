			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Technology: Apple's Newton slow to ripen: Technically Speaking AS A veteran Apple Computer watcher, one learns to tolerate hyperbole. Apple is a company whose vision has frequently overreached its ability to execute. Newton, the 'personal digital assistant' that Apple previewed in May, now appears to be the latest example of this failing. Apple is 'less and less convinced there is a market for these things in the near term in the consumer market', John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive, is reported to have told an industry conference in California last week. But wasn't Newton supposed to usher in a new category of products that 'use digital technology to bridge the gap between personal computers and consumer electronics', to quote Apple press releases? Apple officials cannot verify exactly what Sculley said last week, but attendees at the conference say that he backpedalled on earlier extravagant claims. Sculley stressed the business applications of Newton - a hand-held electronic notepad. Listeners came away with the impression that Newton will be too expensive and limited in function to have a broader mass-market appeal. Newton will initially sell to 'individuals who will use it primarily in connection with their business', Apple officials explain. Sculley was merely attempting to balance perceptions that Newton will be a consumer product by describing its potential uses in business, they say. The computer might, for example, replace weighty maintenance manuals for complex machinery, or a doctor might use it to file patient notes. 'Our perception of the market for Newton has not changed,' Ken Wert, marketing manager of the Apple PIE division, insists. There has been some confusion, Apple concedes. Indeed so. Last January the company trumpeted its plans to launch a new category of 'digital consumer products' at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a gathering of manufacturers and retailers. In May, Apple followed up with a glimpse of Newton, its first-generation 'personal digital assistant' technology. Speaking again at the Consumer Electronics Show, this time in Chicago, Sculley hailed the announcement as 'the birth of a mega-industry'. Not unreasonably, many concluded that Apple would target and price Newton as a mass-market consumer product, although competitors in the hand-held computer market were sceptical even then. Rather than 'defining a new product category', it is now clear that the first Newton will be an electronic alternative to the pocket diary or personal organiser that many busy business people use. As such it must compete with established products such as Hewlett-Packard's 95LX hand-held computer. This is by no means the first time that Apple has whipped up excitement by promising to 'define a new market'. Almost a decade ago Apple executives made that same claim prior to the introduction of Lisa, an innovative personal computer that incorporated one of the first 'graphical user interfaces'. Lisa was a flop - too expensive for most of the computer enthusiasts who appreciated its features and too different from the IBM personal computer that was rapidly gaining ground in the corporate PC market. Eventually, Apple's Macintosh personal computer, which owed much to the original Lisa, did redefine personal computing and secure Apple's future. Now Newton is beginning to look like a 1990s version of Lisa - a product that will be much admired by the computer cognoscenti, yet too expensive for most potential buyers. Defining new markets is a slow and expensive process. Apple, more than most companies, should know that. Newton is the first step, but it may be the first of many before Apple can achieve its dream of delivering computer power to the masses.</p>

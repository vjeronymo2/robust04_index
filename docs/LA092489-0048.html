			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLOON PAYMENT  </P> <P> I was appalled to see the photo in the (Sept. 10) Travel Section of the cruise  ship releasing a cloud of balloons over the sea. Someone in the cruise business  needs to realize that those deflated balloons look like food to sea birds and  animals and, after being swallowed, can block their stomachs. Starvation  results.  </P> <P> There have to be other ways to create a celebratory atmosphere which won't  endanger the environment in which these creatures live and whose very existence  heightens the enjoyment of the cruise goer.  </P> <P> Let's hope those in charge of celebrations on the ships will search for less  hazardous ways to send off a cruise.  </P> <P> BERNICE VAN STEENBERGEN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

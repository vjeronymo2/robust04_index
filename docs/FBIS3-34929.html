The five were on board two boats just south of the port of  Tyre when an Israeli gunboat intercepted them, a fisherman who  was in the vicinity said.    He charged that members of Israel's proxy militia manning a  position overlooking Tyre opened fire at the fishermen at the  same time but there were no casualties.    The Israeli navy patrols the waters of south Lebanon,  intercepting boats and seizing travelers or fishermen for  questioning as part of operations to check for anti-Israeli  guerrillas.</p>

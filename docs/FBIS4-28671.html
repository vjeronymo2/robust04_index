			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 12 KYODO -- Despite increasing signs of  a fledgling economic recovery as shown by government and Bank of  Japan reports, anxiety still persists among business leaders, in  particular those of basic-materials industries.    The lingering concern stems in part from low levels of  prices  for their products.    But some businesses are not worried by the recession.    "I don't feel any slump in consumption," said an official of  a Tokyo discount store near JR Kanda Station.    The area is widely known as the hub of discounters, where  foreign-made golf gear sell for 30,000 yen per set against  suggested retail prices of around 100,000 yen. Air conditioners  are priced at 80,000 yen against the makers' suggested 210,000  yen.    Those who buy goods there, by and large, are amazed by the  low prices.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata last month proposed that the  government should double real national incomes by lowering  prices of goods.    The proposal, made at an unofficial meeting of cabinet  ministers on May 24, touched off a barrage of criticisms from  the business community, however.    This is largely because business leaders fear that such a  policy, if implemented, would result in the collapse of prices,  thereby squeezing corporate sales and eventually contracting the  Japanese economy as a whole.    Said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of Orix Corp., Japan's  largest leasing firm, "a fall in prices translates into a  slowdown in business activity."    The Japanese economy faces a danger of falling into "a  deflationary spiral," he warned.    Many other corporate executives agree. The view is gaining  ground among businesses that they need to blunt the rippling  effects of lower prices.    Japanese consumers are becoming more price-conscious and  seeking lower-priced goods, prompted in part by the yen's steep  appreciation which make imports less expensive.    By contrast, corporate executives are increasingly concerned  over the risk of deflation.    Hajime Sakamoto, a director of Mitsui Petrochemical  Industries Ltd., observed that consumer preference for  lower-priced goods makes it hard to feel an economic comeback  although the economy may have hit bottom in quantitative terms.    Kagehide Kaku, head of the Bank of Japan's Research and  Statistics Department, forecast prices will remain at low levels  for a while, although an economic recovery usually gives rise to  the possibility of inflation.    The market mechanism is now in motion toward a narrowing of  price gaps between Japan and abroad, accelerating the downward  pace of domestic prices that are already lower than before due  to the protracted recession.    Mitsuo Ohashi, managing director of comprehensive chemical  maker Showa Denko K. K., said, "it's only natural that the  internationalization of the Japanese economy should lead to  higher imports."    "But, domestic prices will continue a downward spiral unless  the yen's ascent is halted, and a strong economic recovery is  not expected," he added.</p>

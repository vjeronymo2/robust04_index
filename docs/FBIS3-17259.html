			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 56 (546); </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Saidmorod Fattoyev, an aide to parliament Chairman  Emomali Rakhmonov, denied the rumors of the government dragging  its feet on the start of talks with the opposition in Moscow.    He said in an exclusive interview with Interfax that a state  commission had been set up last year under the chairmanship of  first Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Abdulmajid Dostiyev  which had initiated contacts and negotiated with all political  groups on civic accord and return of refugees. This commission,  jointly with other organizations, in particular the UN, had  succeeded in having 800,000 refugees, notably displaced persons,  returning to Tajikistan. By official accounts, he said, there  are no more than 30,000 Tajik refugees in Afghanistan and the  commission was doing its best for their return. IF Note: The  UN High Commissioner's Office on Refugees resumed repatriation  of Tajik refugees from Afghanistan via Uzbekistan Wednesday. A  large group of Tajik refugees is expected to arrive in the  southern town of Termez in the afternoon of March 23 to be moved  into Tajikistan by bus. Last year 8000 Tajik refugees had  returned via Termez from the Sakhi camp outside the Afghan town  of Mazar-e Sharif.    Fattoyev thought that the armed opposition wanted the  refugees to be kept abroad "as hostages or a card in the power  game."    He said that the overriding goals of the talks with the  opposition was securing the return of the remaining refugees, a  civic accord, cessation of armed struggle by the opposition and  easing the tension on the Tajik-Afghan border.    "Our willingness to start talks is no sign of our weakness.  The opposite is true, the government holds the situation in the  country under control but is prepared to hear its political  opponents. This is a goodwill gesture."    Fattoyev also thought that it would not be proper to say  that  the talks were put off because the date of their start had not  been negotiated. IF Note: A senior official in the Russian  Foreign Ministry told Interfax that the talks between the Tajik  government and the armed opposition were to start in Moscow but  no exact date had been specified. He thought that the date had  been changed from mid-April to some time later because "much  time is consumed in sending the invitations and other  organizational matters."    In Fattoyev's view, the talks were not the overriding issue  because the government had more urgent matters to handle. In  particular, "we have to stop the production decline at least in  the agriculture, have the sowing done, move enough foodstuffs,  diesel fuel and gasoline in and restart the basic economic  mechanisms."    Fattoyev strongly denied rumors that Dushanbe was under  significant pressure from Tashkent as far as relations with the  opposition were concerned. "Uzbekistan is our closest neighbor  which has its interests in Tajikistan but its wishes and advice  are made known in the way this is done throughout the civilized  world," Fattoyev emphasized. In his words, Tajikistan is a  sovereign state "and any pressure or dictation or interference,  in particular into relations with the opposition, is out of the  question."    He was convinced that talks with the opposition will take  place. He thought that the government had to talk with those  opposition leaders who had an influence with the armed groups.  IF Note: An informed source close to the Tajik government said  that the government did not want to talk to those who  represented only themselves. The source told Interfax that "any  field commander has greater influence in the republic than  former kazikalon (spiritual authority) Akbar Turajonzoda (now  staying in Iran) or Atakhon Latifi, chairman of the Coordinating  Center of Tajikistan's Democratic Forces. "These men act as  minor mediating figures. We should talk with those who command  armed opposition," he emphasized. This was, in his view, the  reason why the talks could not start.    Fattoyev felt that it was the opposition leaders who were  dragging their feet. He believed that "there was no consensus  in the opposition" whereas the Tajik government knew what it  could offer.    Local observers thought that the talks would hardly bear  fruit immediately and improve the situation for the sole reason  that the opposition is divided but the government would meet the  opposition halfway for the sake of accord.</p>

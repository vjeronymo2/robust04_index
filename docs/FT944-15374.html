			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / China and US to boost military ties China and the US have agreed to increase the frequency of their military consultations in a further sign of improving relations. The move follows the decision by President Bill Clinton earlier this year to sever the link between human rights issues and renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said in Beijing that the two sides would enhance their military contacts in regular high-level briefings to begin next month. The US would lead the way in providing the Chinese with the briefings. 'Dialogue is in the security interests of both countries,' Mr Perry said. Washington has been pressing the Chinese military to become less secretive. The US has also offered the Chinese data from computer simulations of its nuclear tests. The purpose has been to persuade the Chinese to stop carrying out tests. Beijing has refused to join a Washington-sponsored moratorium on testing but says it is committed to a comprehensive test ban when this comes into effect in 1996. Mr Perry called on China to exercise restraint in the transfer of nuclear technology. The US has long suspected Beijing of helping Pakistan to develop a nuclear capability.</p>

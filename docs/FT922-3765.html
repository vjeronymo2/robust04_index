			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: Why the sum is greater than the parts - BP Portrait Award The measure of any regular exhibition chosen from an open submission of work is not so much its particular qualities and differences in any given year, but the nature of the constituency it sustains in the longer term. By such a standard the Portrait Award can only be judged an remarkable success. Of course the work each year will be different, especially so, as is the case with the BP Portrait Award, when an age limitation, up to 40, takes old regulars out of contention while new faces appear. No such show can ever be better than the work submitted, yet it is curious how often the sum seems to be greater than the parts. There are large paintings and small; conversation-pieces and single figures; full, half and three-quarter lengths; heads alone. The range of practical approach is quite as wide, from the loose and indulgently expressionist to the most closely observed and clearly stated. That range is fairly reflected in the works singled out for prizes and commendation: with Alec Chanda's large, loose and ambiguous painting, of a figure in a wheel-chair, winning the Pounds 4,000 second prize and the Travel Award that now goes with it, on the one hand; and Ishbel Myerscough's half-length 'Hairy Man' on the other, a closely objective scrutiny of the figure in the manner of the 16th century German masters, that takes the third prize of Pounds 2000. One always disagrees with the judges, all the more so when the standard overall is admirably high and so many of the entries in consequence manifestly unlucky. Emily Feaver for example, with her disarmingly straight-forward full-length self-portrait, deserved at least a commendation. Of the six actually commended, with a consolation of Pounds 500 apiece, both Michael Clark, with a dense impasto grisaille head of an old woman, and Martin Churchill, with his two slaughtermen at work in the abattoir, were unlucky not to get more. The Clark especially raises certain questions, for it is quite small and deals only with the head, which is beautifully realised. Yet it is the larger work that so often wins, as though to say that size itself denotes a more serious purpose and ambition. This year both the first and second prize-paintings may be fairly described as large. The commended painting by Brendan Kelly, of a seated figure with a second, standing figure seen through the open doorway, raises a second point. The conversation-piece is a tradition in itself, and with its particular opportunities and limitations it might warrant a category, if not a competition, of it own. Which leaves Lucy Willis the winner of the Award for 1992 of Pounds 10,000, and a further commission of Pounds 2,000 to be arranged with the National Portrait Gallery. Her painting, 'Her Majesty's Pleasure', shows some ten or eleven prisoners sitting at a table, doing nothing. It is an awkward, quirky painting, arbitrary in composition, in part closely observed, in part ill-drawn and unresolved: a nervous, worried flicker of black hair and blue shirts across the yellow canvas, arms, elbows and pencils staccato across the table. It is at once visually worrying and oddly disturbing, a powerful image. With the Royal Academy and its Summer Show inevitably dominant, the work of the other exhibiting societies tends to be overshadowed. The Royal Society British Artists dates back to the 1820s and has counted such luminaries as David Roberts, Whistler, Sickert and Peter Greenham among its presidents. Its annual show is now on which, like the Royal Academy, needs no more than a willingness to search out the particular from the mass, and draw one's own conclusion. It seems less crowded than usual, perhaps for being so well hung by its current president Tom Coates. Among much else, I would recommend his work and that of Edward Bishop, Fred Cuming, Jack Millar and Hans Schwarz, and a French landscape and a bunch of geraniums by Jim Russell.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kim Ki-han, ambassador of our country, on 11 June  paid a farewell call on (Mamadou L. Besir Kolobo), general  secretary of the National Guidance Committee of the Sudanese  Union of Mali-African Democratic Alliance.    At the meeting, the ambassador conveyed greetings from the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il to General Secretary (Mamdou L. Besir Kolobo).    Expressing deep appreciation for this, the general secretary  asked the ambassador to convey his greetings and wish for long  life to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The general secretary said that today the U.S. imperialists  and imperialists in the West are running amok to crush [apsal  haryogo palgwanghago] socialist Korea.    He said: The U.S. imperialists, together with Japan and the  South Korean puppets, are raving about sanctions against  socialist Korea on the pretext of a nonexistent nuclear problem  of the DPRK. The incident of Japan's concealment of plutonium  and oppression maneuvers against the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan are acts that should absolutely not be  overlooked.    Nevertheless, the United States and the West, while  pretending that they are not aware of such acts, are acting  arbitrarily by raving only about the nuclear issue of the DPRK.  The imperialists are making miscalculation. The U.S.  imperialists cannot bring the Korean people, who firmly believe  in justness of their cause, to their knees. The Korean people  have attained firm single-hearted unity based on the chuche idea  which the great His Excellency President Kim Il-song created and  which dear His Excellency Kim Chong-il is brilliantly deepening  and developing. No strength in the world can make the Korean  people surrender.</p>

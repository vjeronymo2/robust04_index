			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS' BRASS NEEDS A NEW BATTLE PLAN  </P> <P> The way I see it, when the general isn't too smart, the army isn't going to  win.  </P> <P> John Robinson used Curt Warner for more than two quarters and thoroughly messed  up the whole Ram offense. General John should have realized that Curt no longer  had the magic touch, nor is he likely to regain it in the future. If Robinson  ever realizes that Cleveland Gary is the man of the future, then we might start  winning the war again.  </P> <P> BOB HUTTON, Burbank  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LA CANADA SETS SIGHTS ON THIRD CONSECUTIVE RIO HONDO LEAGUE TITLE  </P> <P> The La Canada High boys' basketball team, which saw one streak end last week,  is trying to keep another alive.  </P> <P> Last Friday, the Spartans fell to Pasadena in five overtimes, 82-74, a loss  that ended La Canada's 21-game home winning streak.  </P> <P> "It was the longest game I've ever seen," La Canada Coach Tom Hofman said.  "Both teams were just hanging on."  </P> <P> La Canada (6-3) held a 14-point lead in the final quarter of regulation before  Pasadena made its run that sent the contest into the first overtime.  </P> <P> La Canada will compete in the Chino tournament this week and then play  Crescenta Valley in its final nonleague game Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Spartans will begin their bid for a third consecutive Rio Hondo League  championship next Friday when they visit Monrovia for the league opener. La  Canada is 20-0 in league play over the past two seasons.  </P> <P> "We're probably playing better than I thought we would be at this time," Hofman  said. "I think we'll be ready to go when we play Monrovia."  </P> <P> Balanced attack: The Flintridge Prep girls' basketball team is trying to win  its second consecutive Prep League championship with a team that thus far has  exhibited balance.  </P> <P> The Rebels (4-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) have lost to only La Canada.  </P> <P> "There's no one who has been really outstanding in every game," Flintridge Prep  Coach John Ruch said. "It's nice that we've had different people step forward  and play good games."  </P> <P> Point guard Shawna Shearbourn has been a key player for Flintridge Prep with  her consistent improvement, but Ruch said that the biggest surprise for the  Rebels has been the play of junior Megan McCullough.  </P> <P> "She's coming off the bench and playing as well as anyone," Ruch said.  </P> <P> On the rebound: Pater Noster's record tumbled to 2-9 last Monday when it lost  to LaSalle, 72-68.  </P> <P> The defeat, however, exemplified Pater Noster's improvement this season under  second-year Coach Michael Smith, whose Southern Section 2-A Division team faces  a schedule full of 3-A and 4-A schools.  </P> <P> It was only two weeks ago that Pater Noster lost to LaSalle by 20 points.  </P> <P> Face the nation: Santiago Alvarez, who gained statewide attention this season  for his performance as quarterback of the Franklin High football team, gained  national recognition last week.  </P> <P> Alvarez, a senior who threw 52 touchdowns and passed for more than 4,000 yards  this season for the City Section Northern Conference-champion Panthers, was  pictured in Sports Illustrated's "Faces in the Crowd" segment.  </P> <P> On the road: The Glendale College basketball team, which has won six games in a  row, is competing in the Palomar tournament this week.  </P> <P> The eight-team, double elimination tournament also includes Citrus, Harbor,  Fullerton, Mt. San Jacinto, Bakersfield, Riverside and Palomar.  </P> <P> Glendale (10-5) is coming off a championship performance in its own tournament  -- during which the Vaqueros defeated East Los Angeles, Harbor and Cypress --  and last Friday's 78-71 victory over Antelope Valley.  </P></p>

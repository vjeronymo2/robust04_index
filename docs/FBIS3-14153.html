The Palestinian  delegation is led by Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and the Israeli delegation  is led by Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Amnon Shahaq.    In a statement to correspondents before the negotiations,  Dr.  Sha'th said: We came here to avoid another massacre in Hebron.    Uri Savir, Israeli Foreign Ministry director general and a  member of the Israeli delegation, said: The delegation held  extremely good negotiations in Tunis and we are continuing our  negotiations in Cairo.    Dr. Sha'th said that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations  will try to reach agreement on international protection for the  Palestinians living under occupation with a view to resuming the  negotiations to implement the self-rule agreement in Gaza and  Jericho first. These negotiations were suspended after the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron on 25 February. Dr.  Sha'th expected the Israeli delegation to provide answers to  proposals made the day before yesterday in Tunis during the  negotiations between the two delegations.    He added: The negotiations in Tunis made some progress and  we expect to hear what the Israeli delegation has to provide in  the way of answers.    Dr. Sha'th said: We want a speedy implementation of the UN  Security Council resolution on protecting the Palestinians.    Diplomatic sources in Cairo said that if an understanding is  reached on the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied  territory during the session of negotiations tonight, a meeting  between Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres could be held during the next 24 hours to  pave the way for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement.    There were reports that 'Arafat and Peres are expected to  meet in Paris tomorrow, Thursday.</p>

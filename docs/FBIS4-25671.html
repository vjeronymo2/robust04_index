			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (AFP) -- Australian Deputy Prime  Minister Brian Howe said here Monday he believed charges would  soon be brought against an Australian businessman, James Peng,  held in a Chinese jail since October. Howe, who arrived here  Friday for an eight-day China visit, said he had made clear in a  meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji that "an Australian  citizen being held and not charged is unacceptable."    Zhu had acknowledged it was "a poor reflection of the  (Chinese judicial) system" and pledged to do his best to resolve  the issue, but stressed that Peng's suspected involvement in  corruption was "very serious," Howe told journalists. His  understanding was that charges would be brought soon, he said.    Peng, 35, was seized by police in Macao in October and then  handed over to Chinese police. He has since been held in the  Meiling Detention Centre in the southern city of Shenzhen.  Under Chinese law, suspects may be held for no longer than five  months without charges.    Howe said he had discussed human rights more broadly during  a  meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng on Monday, but acknowledged  that the talks had not progressed beyond a "philosophical"  debate on the importance of mutual concern for problems in each  other's countries. The official said the overall development of  bilateral relations remained limited by this "inability to  communicate effectively around the issue of human rights." He  received little response when he reiterated Canberra's  long-standing invitation for a Chinese human rights delegation  to visit Australia.    On China's nuclear test last Friday, Howe said he had once  again expressed Australia's concern, telling his Chinese  interlocuters that such actions were inconsistent with Beijing's  commitment to move towards a test ban by 1996. Chinese  officials responded by reiterating that other nuclear powers had  carried out many more tests and that the ball was in their court  to reduce their stocks to achieve "a situation of parity," Howe  said, predicting that more Chinese tests may well be in the  pipeline.    During Howe's visit the two sides signed a memorandum of  understanding on the potential of cooperation in the  construction sector. How is to travel to Shanghai after  visiting Yantai in northeastern Shandong province. He is to  attend the signing in Shanghai of a joint venture agreement to  manufacture steel building rods. Howe was to leave Beijing for  Yantai Monday evening.</p>

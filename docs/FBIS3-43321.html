			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Excellency Arturo Avello Diez del Corral,  ambassador of Spain to Equatorial Guinea, returned to Malabo on  2 January from Madrid with a message from Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez to President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. The Spanish  envoy, who was called for consultations by his government, left  for Spain on 12 December following the expulsion of the Spanish  consul in Bata. The consul was declared persona non grata after  holding an eight-hour meeting on 10 December with the political  parties that did not take part in the 21 November legislative  elections. At the meeting, the Spanish consul supported [words  indistinct] of violence likely to jeopardize the order, peace,  and tranquility prevailing in the country. Despite this act,  considered as interference and a provocation, the Equatorial  Guinean Government has continued to maintain good relations with  Spain since that country decided unilaterally to (?reduce) its  cooperation with Equatorial Guinea. This decision was followed  by the departure of a large number of Spanish technical staff  from our country. The Equatorial Guinean people, who are aware  of the importance of the ties between them and Spain, hope that  the contents of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's message are  positive and promising. In fact, that is the wish of all the  sons of this country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Press Statement issued by a Foreign Ministry </F> spokesman on 25 May]    [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a  statement today regarding the fact that at the recent UN  Disarmament Commission meeting a sharp conflict of views  surfaced between the developing countries and the Western  countries as to whether emphasis should be placed on the  elimination of nuclear weapons or on the strengthening of the  nuclear nonproliferation system with regard to the question of  nuclear disarmament.    He said:    Many developing countries including our country strongly  urged that the international community should take it as their  first and foremost goal to comprehensively and totally eliminate  the existing nuclear weapons within a certain period through  universal and non- discriminatory multilateral negotiations and  treaties and that the nuclear weapon states should carry out  nuclear disarmament.    By contrast, the United States and other Western countries  persisted in their old position that emphasis should be placed  on the strengthening of the nuclear nonproliferation system in  the present stage and, to this end, the role of the UN Security  Council should be enhanced.    The guideline and recommendations on nuclear disarmament  worked out and submitted by the Western countries, focussing on  the nuclear nonproliferation issue, could not be passed due to  the opposition of the developing countries.    The process of the meeting made it all the clearer that  there  is no change in the ambition of the United States and other  Western countries to maintain their nuclear monopoly and turn  the world around its finger.    The United States and other Western countries, however,  resort to trite threats and pressure against the non-nuclear  states including the DPRK under an unreasonable pretext while  failing to do what they must do.    While raising a hue and cry over the fictitious nuclear  suspicion against the DPRK, they pretend to be ignorant of the  real threat of nuclear armament such as the recently discovered  concealment of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan.    This can be said to be the culmination of the application of  a double standard.    The problem will not be solved any time, if the United  States  and other Western countries continue to apply the double  standard in the nuclear issue, refusing to accept the just  demand of the developing countries for the total abolition of  nuclear weapons and the removal of the discriminative nature of  the NPT at a time when the extension of the validity of the NPT  is being discussed.</p>

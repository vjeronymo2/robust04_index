			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Management: When quality is a way of life - Telco has developed a peculiarly Indian blend of ideas for motivating workers India may not be the first place to conjure up images of industrial efficiency or total quality management. While decades of bureaucratic controls restrained India's industrial performance, companies all too often subscribed to the old Indian adage of chalta hai or 'it'll pass'. But if that is now all changing - not least thanks to the economic reforms of finance minister Manmohan Singh - one company stands out as a benchmark for others to follow. The truck and excavator company Telco (Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company) has developed a peculiarly Indian approach to quality and worker participation in a nation that has to contend with issues - from communal tensions to the effects of deshi or country liquor - not always on the agenda of western boardrooms. Based in Jamshedpur, Bihar, Telco is one of the flagship companies in the blue-chip Tata group. With its sister car plant in Pune, it is India's largest private-sector concern, with a turnover last year of Rs29,000m, approximately (Pounds 612m). Established in 1945, originally as a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz, it is one of the world's largest truck manufacturers, providing 75 per cent of the goods vehicles and buses on India's roads. It has exported them to 60 countries. Last year the millionth truck rolled off the assembly line and recently Telco secured its largest export order, for 2,100 truck chassis, from the Sri Lankan government. 'Quality and productivity are essential in helping us to compete worldwide,' says Sarosh Ghandy, resident director in Jamshedpur. 'We are investing in our 'software': building on the skills, commitment and involvement of our men.' A crippling 40-day strike in 1969 and a series of shop-floor battles for union control in the early 1970s, had warned management 'we were far too distant from our men to liaise with them', says Ghandy. Union officers and senior executives subsequently attended moral re-armament industrial seminars organised by a grandson of Mahatma Gandhi. Impressed by the reconciliation of two rival union leaders, the company launched its own in-house 'human relations at work' (HRW) training programme in 1982. The focus of this is a three-day course, attended so far by 18,000 of Telco's 20,000 employees. The aim is to empower the workforce to take responsibility. Shop floor workers, who have passed through the course, do the training and at one afternoon session a chargehand from the toolroom, RB Singh, conducts a programme for 20 employees. Topics for discussion are alcoholism, absenteeism, punctuality, synchronising work functions, responsibility versus blame and even blood donation schemes. Hindu swamis (priests) also give talks on aspects of human behaviour, to 'bring an Indian ethos into our environment of management', says Ghandy. There is also an emphasis on the Gandhian philosophy of the 'inner voice' - to encourage 'self-motivation', says Telco's head of management development, Nazimuddin Ahmed. 'Really motivated people are inner directed. ' They have a characteristic of their own and are not dependent on others.' The visible manifestation has been the birth of shop-floor quality circles, known in Telco as 'small group activity' (SGA). Now, nearly 1,300 voluntary groups of 10 to 12 people, involving the bulk of the workforce, meet for an hour each week to iron out production problems - and discuss how to tackle alcoholism, family debt and communal tension in their townships or 'colonies'. One group bailed out a colleague who became heavily in debt after personal problems. Another group repaired a fault on a metal press which had baffled German engineers. Each year, employees make 100,000 suggestions for improvements, saving the company nearly Pounds 2m, says Ghandy. Telco is now making 16,000 more trucks with 6,000 fewer workers and has enjoyed a strike-free industrial record over the last 21 years. Ghandy says that the productivity increase is also due to the impact of the SGAs. The SGAs also help to defuse any communal and political tensions, according to Shri Gopeshwar, General Secretary of India's National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), who is head of the Telco workers' union. When the Babri mosque at Ayodhya was demolished by Hindu militants, sparking nationwide violence, relations in the townships around Telco remained calm and the police found it unnecessary to impose a curfew. Telco, in common with many companies in the west, still faces the challenge of how to reduce the multiple layers of middle management. But other Indian companies are taking a keen interest in Telco's experience. Chandreshwar Khan, assistant manager at the Management Training Centre gives talks on HRW to conferences of the Confederation of Indian Industry. 'Improvements in the quality of our products will come from an improvement in the quality of life of our workforce,' he says. 'In our company we talk about human relations, meaning we work together. And we don't just talk about it - it has become a way of life.'</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS FOLLOW RILEY'S SAYING -- THAT'S PROBLEM  </P> <P> "Plant your feet, stand firm and make your point" is the saying The Times  quoted as Pat Riley's favorite for his team. Well, that is exactly what the  Lakers are doing on defense -- planting their feet and standing firm while  other teams out-rebound and (out)-run them. Meanwhile, the Lakers are running  the same stale offense without the luxury of a dominating Kareem.  </P> <P> JANET SANDOVAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Ominous Military Movements"] </F>   [Text] According to foreign news reports, at a time when  the focus of attention is whether the Team Spirit-94 joint  military exercise will be conducted or not, the U.S. forces in  Okinawa have started making movements. They appear to be making  those movements on the assumption that this exercise will be  conducted. The Belleau Wood attack landing ship, the (Danedo)  landing transport ship, and the (Rodney Davis) missile frigate  ship of the 7th U.S. Fleet reportedly entered or left the  (Whitebeach) military port in central Okinawa on 8 and 9  February. They were loaded with the armed troops of the Third  U.S. Marine Expeditionary Forces and combat vehicles and various  other military equipment. The 353d special operation unit of  the U.S. Air Force at the Kadena base left for South Korea  aboard MC-130, (Convert), and (Halon) special operation  aircraft. The U.S. military authorities have said that they  could not comment on these military units movements because they  were operational actions.    U.S. and South Korean media report the United States decided  to start the Team Spirit joint military exercise on 22 March and  ordered the reservists to get ready. However, THE STARS AND  STRIPES, a semiofficial paper of the U.S. Pacific Command,  reported on 9 February that no decision had been made on whether  the Team Spirit war exercise would be conducted or not and that  the reservists and some military units had been on the way to  South Korea for training purposes.    The movements of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces  based  in Okinawa are very ominous and make us more vigilant [kaksongul  nopiji]. As everybody knows, the issue of whether the Team  Spirit war exercise is conducted or not this year is a very  serious and it is directly linked to the peaceful resolution of  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, as an  imminent measure [tangmyonhan chochi] to hold a third stage of  talks and resolve the nuclear issue in a package deal, the DPRK  and the United States agreed toward the end of last year that  the United States would not conduct the Team Spirit joint  military exercise in 1994 and that we would receive a limited  scope of inspections [hanjongdoen pomwiui sacharul] necessary to  ensure the continuity of the International Atomic Energy  Agency's safeguards.    If the United States discards its agreement with us and  tries  to conduct the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, it will  be an intolerable mockery of us, a denial of dialogue, and a  criminal act that brings the situation on the Korean peninsula  to the brink of war.    In actuality, U.S. officials are saying that if the Team  Spirit joint exercise cannot be conducted, the United States  will plan to conduct other joint military exercise targeted at  our Republic. They are openly raving that if the joint military  exercise cannot be held in South Korea, it should be conducted  even in Hawaii.    In this connection, the DPRK Foreign Ministry's spokesman  issued the statement on 31 January. This nonetheless, the  Okinawa-based U.S. forces began a military movement since 8  February, which is regarded as the simulation of the conduction  of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. This is something  that cannot be overlooked.    Whenever the United States conducted the Team Spirit joint  military exercise, it, with Japan as a launching base, brought  mass- destruction weapons, including nuclear weapons and war  equipment, into South Korea and conducted war exercises against  the northern half of the Republic.    The United States shipped a landing ship, a transport ship,  frigate ship to (Whitebeach) port and brought combat vehicles  and troops into South Korea. In view of its timing and  strategy, we cannot but regard this as the reoccurrence of the  Team Spirit war exercise.    Washington-backed propaganda means reported that the United  States has decided to conduct the Team Spirit war exercise  beginning on 22 March and ordered reservists to prepare for the  Team Spirit. This is never a coincidence.    It is a gross miscalculation if the United States is  thinking  of deceiving us by employing a double-pronged strategy--paying  lip service about the peaceful solution of nuclear issue but, in  fact, running wild for the moves to bring about a new war  against our Republic.    The double-pronged strategy will further consolidate our  resolution. If the United States is to assume the position to  resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should  show this through an actual activity and should, above all, give  up the current pressure commotions against the Republic.    There is no change in our position to resolve the nuclear  issue through dialogue. We already expressed our clear position  toward the United States trying to crush us through strength.    We mean what we say, we never say an empty word. If the  United States constantly tries to crush us through military  commotions in spite of our warnings, it should be held entirely  responsible for a grave situation to be entailed therefrom.    We will carefully watch U.S. activities henceforth.</p>

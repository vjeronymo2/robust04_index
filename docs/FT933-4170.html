			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Cautious response from the French THE Bank of France responded cautiously to the German cut, reducing the rate for five to 10 day funds from 10 per cent to 7.75 per cent but leaving the more important intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. The German move gives the French authorities more room for manoeuvre in lowering borrowing costs. But the cut in short-term rates, which brings official French rates to their levels before this summer's currency crisis, was seen as a limited step. 'It was the minimum reaction they could have taken,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'Money market rates are already below 7.75 per cent and no one expects them to rise again.' He said the Bank of France would try to bring money market rates down from 7.5 per cent to about 7 per cent in coming weeks, before cutting the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates. The problem facing the French is the continued strength of the D-Mark. Despite the Bundesbank rate cuts, the French franc lost ground against the German currency yesterday, closing at FFr3.525 to the D-Mark in London, about 3 per cent below its former ERM floor. Despite the widening of the fluctuation bands, the Bank of France has sought to keep the franc relatively stable against the D-Mark. This partly reflects the central bank's need to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves after its unsuccessful defence of the franc in the recent currency crisis. Economists welcomed the German cut. 'If the Bundesbank didn't move, it would have increased pressure on the French to go it alone,' said one. They believe French interest rates will now see continued gradual reductions.</p>

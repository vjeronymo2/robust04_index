			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Welcome, Mr Yeltsin RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin, who arrives in London today for his first official visit, is the bulwark protecting Russia's young reformers. With his reformist government under siege from a coalition of conservatives similar to, but more intelligent than, the one that mounted last year's failed August coup, he deserves as much support as he can get from the west, and especially from the European Community, of which Britain is part. His welcome visit should be used as an opportunity to underline that, despite domestic distractions and recessionary trends throughout Europe, Britain and the Community understand that the fate of Europe, as well as of Russia, is linked to the success of Russia's pursuance of market reforms. The post-communist governments of central Europe have already shown that the kind of reforms attempted by the government of Mr Yegor Gaidar are able to bring tangible material and moral benefits within a reasonable period of time. Earlier this year Russia itself started to see the first signs that market reforms and a tight monetary policy could help to put goods into shops and provide the indispensable incentives for people to assume the risks of entrepreneurship. The task facing Russia, mired in a uniquely destructive economic and political system of its own creation for over seven decades, is much greater than that confronted by central European countries. The latter's cultural roots are in western Europe and they were forced to adopt a clearly alien system for 'only' four decades. Western backing Nevertheless, the way that central Europe is dealing with the problems of creating new market institutions, modernising the banks, privatising state assets and attracting foreign equity investment is relevant to the long-term solution of Russia's problems. What Mr Yeltsin needs is western backing to help tailor these reforms to Russian circumstances, supported by far greater western equity investment, as well as more governmental and institutional help. Mr Yeltsin, not an economist, must be reassured that he and his government were on the right track before the military-industrial complex, the 'red barons' of the collective farms and the old party-security bosses, aided and abetted by a compliant central bank, prised open monetary discipline in July. This sent a flood of inflationary credits surging through the unreconstructed military and heavy industries, followed in short order by a collapse of the rouble and approaching hyper-inflation. Siren calls Understandably distracted by the US elections, the debate over Maastricht, a looming EC-US trade war, and gathering recessionary clouds, the west has thus far failed to do enough to stiffen Mr Yeltsin's resolve. Mr Yeltsin needs help to stay the course and ignore the siren calls from powerful potential rivals such as Mr Arkady Volsky to prop up the old system. There must be no illusions. Dismantling the old militarised economy to free up resources for a capitalist economy attuned to supplying the pent-up needs of the Russian people will lead to unemployment and great social strain. Most of the effort will have to be made by Russians themselves. Yet the alternative, easy credit to prop up the old system, is already leading to hyper-inflation. Further down this ruinous path lie increasing authoritarianism, economic collapse and ultimately perhaps some form of military dictatorship or even civil war. The post-communist countries of central Europe see this appalling prospect with far greater clarity than those further away. It is beyond the power of Britain alone to avert such a fate. But bilateral relations are better now than they have been for decades and many Russians believe that Britain retains significant influence. Mr Yeltsin also comes to London as a new administration is being formed in the US. It is time for the US, the European Community and Japan to place the future of Russia, and the other former Soviet republics, higher up their scale of priorities. London is as good a place as any to signal a new western commitment to helping Russia help itself.</p>

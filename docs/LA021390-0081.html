			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAMES' PAY-PER-VIEW DETAILED;  </P> <P> OLYMPICS: COST TO VIEWERS WILL BE BETWEEN $100 AND $150 FOR 600 HOURS OF  COVERAGE WITHOUT COMMERCIALS IN 1992.  </P> <P> Besides the 160 hours of coverage NBC has planned for free television during  the 1992 Summer Olympics, another 600 -- without commercials -- will be  available through pay-per-view on three separate channels, it was announced  Monday.  </P> <P> Cost of the pay-per-view programming to viewers will be between $100 and $150.  NBC said more research is needed before the actual pay-per-view fee can be set.  The network is not planning to sell partial programming.  </P> <P> The pay-per-view coverage will supplement events televised by NBC, although  there will be some overlap -- but not in prime time. The pay-per-view block  will be 12 hours and run from 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the West. Then at 2 p.m., the  12-hour block will be repeated.  </P> <P> NBC's cable partner is Cablevision Systems Inc. It is half-owned by NBC and is  the parent company of SportsChannel America.  </P> <P> But that does not mean pay-per-view programming will be carried on the 10  SportsChannel regional networks.  </P> <P> "We will not become a pay-per-view channel for the Olympics," said Rockey  Flintermann, the director of programming for Sports- Channel Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "This is a deal between Cablevision and NBC. I think they will deal directly  with cable operators.  </P> <P> "We will probably play a role in the marketing and promoting of the  pay-per-view telecasts, but I believe that will be the extent of our role."  </P> <P> Essentially, the pay-per-view package will be for those who want more Olympic  coverage, or for those with a keen interest in a particular sport.  </P> <P> Marc Lustgarten, Cablevision vice chairman, said: "We think it's a win-win  situation. There has always been a flaw in network coverage of the Olympics:  they could never show it all."  </P> <P> NBC won the American television rights to the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain,  with a bid of $401 million. Pay-per-view alone could generate $375 million.  </P> <P> Tom Rogers, president of NBC's cable operations, said 25 million homes should  be ready for pay-per-view by 1992. Rogers estimates that 2.5 million households  will buy the Olympic package.  </P> <P> Rick Kulis, president of Choice Entertainment, a Southern California  pay-per-view company, said: "That 2.5 million may prove to be a pipe dream. If  it is, it will be a black eye for all of pay-per-view."  </P> <P> Said Lustgarten: "We view the pay-per-view package as better than a seat in  Barcelona. To be able to sit with your remote channel-changer and be in three  venues is better than being there."  </P> <P> Much of NBC's coverage will be taped because of the 10-hour time difference  between Spain and Los Angeles. But the pay-per-view programming will be live.  </P> <P> NBC was criticized in 1988 for what it selected to cover in Seoul, South Korea,  and ABC was criticized in 1984 for the same thing at the Games in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Lustgarten said that even three pay-per-view channels will be overloaded by  Olympic competition.  </P> <P> "We just have too many events," he said. "When you look at the schedule,  especially early on, it's possible that four channels wouldn't be enough."  </P></p>

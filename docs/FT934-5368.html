			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Merrett to scale back underwriting activities Merrett Holdings yesterday outlined plans to radically scale back its Lloyd's underwriting activities, focusing future operations on loss adjusting and other insurance services businesses. Merrett, chaired by Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, lost support from members' agents - which channel Names to its syndicates - earlier this year. Plans by Travelers' Insurance, the US company, to provide backing for the agency's biggest syndicates, 418 and 1067, collapsed earlier this month. Mr Alan Cleary, group chief executive, said yesterday it was 'virtually certain' that 418 and 1067 would not be underwriting in 1994 'as they have not attracted sufficient capacity to enable them to go forward on a viable basis.' However, the blow to Names - the individuals whose assets support the market  -and to Lloyd's itself, will be softened by a deal that Janson Green, a rival managing agency, has negotiated with Mr Barnabas Hurst-Bannister, 418's existing underwriter. Mr Hurst-Bannister and 418's existing underwriting team will insure at least some of its existing business. Mr Peter Cowell, managing director of Janson Green, expects Mr Hurst-Bannister's syndicate, which has a provisional number of 1215, to have a stamp of about Pounds 60m in 1994, against Pounds 150m traded by syndicate 418 in 1993. He said that Janson Green would endeavour to close 418's 1991, 1992 and 1993 years into the ongoing syndicate but was unable to say whether that would be feasible. Mr Cleary said Merrett had the 'expertise, systems and experience' to handle the 'open' underwriting years 'in house'. Lloyd's said it would monitor the run-off of both 418, whose 1985 and 1990 years were already 'open', and 1067. Merrett is negotiating the transfer four of its smaller syndicates - 179, 332, 1038 and 1184 - to other agencies. Mr Cleary emphasised that the problems of Merrett's underwriting activities had had no impact on other trading divisions.</p>

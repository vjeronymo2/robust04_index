			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pierre Rousselin: "France-Israel: Resumption of </F> Political and Military Dialogue"]    [Text] Jerusalem -- How can French diplomacy best play a  role in the new Near East context? One method depends on the  restoration of relations of trust with Israel in the defense and  security spheres which have been virtually frozen since 1967.    During his first visit to Israel, [French Foreign Minister]  Alain Juppe yesterday announced France's intention of "resuming  a fuller political and military dialogue, especially in the  sphere of research cooperation in the security sphere."    After the break which followed the Six Day War, and the  embargo on arms supplies to the Jewish state, this dialogue is  resuming. This is one aspect of the "new impetus, the new  course," which Alain Juppe intends to give to Franco-Israeli  relations now that the mutual disagreements have vanished,  washed away by the current peace process.    So, it is official. Defense Minister Francois Leotard will  come to Israel next month to open a new chapter in relations  which enjoyed their golden age well before the 1967 war, when  France was the main ally of the young Jewish state.    Already, Tsahal Chief of Staff General Ehud Barak has  recently made a visit to France lasting several days, the first  at this level for around 30 years. The head of the General  Directorate of Armaments (DGA) and Armed Forces Chief of Staff  Admiral Lanxade are also expected in Israel soon.    Although the resumption of high-level contacts is  spectacular, their aim is at present to explore the  opportunities for cooperation between the two countries'  military industries.  <H5>  Paris' Peace Efforts </H5>   Joint development projects could emerge. For instance, the  Israeli Aeronautical Industries, wishing to move over to  civilian activities, are seeking a partner to develop a small  satellite launcher. The French minister also announced the  signing, in the near future, of a cooperation agreement between  the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and the Israeli  Space Agency. A few weeks ago, the Americans granted the  Israelis the right to participate in joint projects in the space  sphere.    But the resumption of "political and military" dialogue with  Israel can also be explained by the new regional security  situation emerging in the framework of the peace negotiations.  France is anxious to have a presence and fears that the United  States will try to impose a "preserve" in this strategic sphere  extended to the whole of the post-Gulf War Middle East.    Participating in the "security guarantees" which should  accompany a peace agreement, safeguarding the interests of  French military industry in the region is the issue of the  current battle. It is reflected in Paris' efforts to play a  full part, not only as a member of the European Union, in the  multilateral negotiations group on disarmament and security  questions. "We see only advantages in becoming more involved in  that," Alain Juppe said in Jerusalem. According to a French  source, the obstacle no longer comes so much from Jerusalem, but  rather from Washington....    Franco-Israeli relations are undergoing a spectacular  improvement, and Alain Juppe's visit has taken place in an  atmosphere of great cordiality. A greatly appreciated gesture  further warmed the atmosphere: the lifting of the visa  requirement imposed on the Israelis and the nationals of other  countries in the region, since the violent attacks of 1986 in  Paris.    Today, the French foreign minister is starting the  Palestinian part of his visit. He is due to visit the Gaza  strip, without Israeli escort, and to have talks with the local  PLO officials.    "France wants to do all it can to ensure that autonomy  succeeds," Alain Juppe said yesterday, while stressing that it  was a "difficult challenge." For this purpose, new funds have  been announced to help the establishment of the Palestinian  administration and to train the cadres of autonomy. An  agreement on Fr60 million will be devoted to investment in the  territories in the course of this year.    Unlike his predecessors at the head of French diplomacy,  Alain Juppe has had an easy task in Jerusalem: Since the Oslo  agreement, supporting the Palestinians and strengthening ties  with Israel are no longer antinomic.</p>

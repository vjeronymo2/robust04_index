			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Mieno doubts signs of recovery in Japan MR Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, yesterday warned that the Japanese economy has yet to hit bottom, as there is no evidence of a recovery in personal consumption and corporate capital spending. His comments stimulated speculation in the country's financial markets that the official discount rate, now at 2.5 per cent, will be cut soon after the July 18 general election. Meanwhile, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the Japanese government should further stimulate internal demand to quicken the domestic recovery and assist the world economy. Referring to a Y13,200bn (Pounds 82bn) stimulatory package announced in April, Mr Bentsen said Japan had 'made a start', but must do more to encourage economic growth and reduce its still expanding current account surplus. However, Mr Mieno said Japan had 'done everything possible' to stimulate growth and the positive effects would be seen in the longer-term. He suggested that a rush to cut the external surplus could create inflation and damage the Japanese economy. Mr Mieno was speaking after a two-day meeting of the bank's regional branch managers, who complained that the benefits of the yen's recent appreciation had yet to be passed on to consumers, while export-oriented companies are under increasing pressure. The gloominess of the branch managers has tempered the bank's expectations of a recovery this year, and Mr Mieno admitted yesterday that business sentiment could be damaged by continuing political instability. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party is expected to lose its majority at the election, leading to a coalition government, which may have a limited life. There is a growing expectation that another election will be called within a year. The bank has toned down its forecasts for the strength of the expected recovery from 'modest' to 'very modest', suggesting the continuing falls in personal consumption and capital spending have come as a surprise.</p>

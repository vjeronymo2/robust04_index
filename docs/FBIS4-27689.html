			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, June 1 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Household use of  opium as a pain-killer has turned children in some parts of  Vietnam into hardcore addicts by the time they are adolescents,  according to a workshop report.    Highland families in particular not only use opium for  barter  but also as a palliative for all ailments causing addiction at a  very young age, says the report made available to BERNAMA  Wednesday.    It was the first workshop organised here last week to equip  Vietnam's communist party key cadres nation-wide with  communication skills to create public awareness of the country's  drug problem.    The report says that although Vietnam is making progress in  reducing domestic poppy cultivation, such efforts are frustrated  by increased smuggling of opium from neighbouring countries.    It says the area under poppy cultivation had been reduced to  3,000 hectares last year from 19,000 hectares in 1985 and opium  production to 10.5 tonnes from 53.9 tonnes during the same  period.    Now 87 percent or 2,630 hectares of the remaining area under  poppy is in Ky Son in Nghe An Province bordering Laos.    A good number of students in that province had been opium  addicts since their younger days, the report adds.    It also shows that there is still no other lucrative cash  crop better suited to the area's climate, terrain and soil than  poppy, it says. (poppy plants produce the base to make heroin).    Dumping of psychotropic drugs, high relapse rate (80  percent)  among treated addicts and lack of funding for sustained  campaigns are among the other problems Vietnam is facing in  fighting drug abuse, it says.</p>

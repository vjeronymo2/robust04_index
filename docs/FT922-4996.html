			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Nato chief hints at heavier intervention PEACEKEEPING FORCES in situations such as Yugoslavia may require heavier military capabilities than those deployed up until now in United Nations operations, General John Galvin, Nato's supreme commander in Europe, said yesterday. 'You may find a peacekeeping force cannot be walking around with just blue helmets and pistols,' he told an audience in a speech at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Experience so far in peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia had shown that such operations had to be carefully thought out, leaving room for flexibility and reinforcement, he said. He would not comment, however, on prospects for larger-scale military intervention. The UN peacekeeping business was 'booming', with 13 different operations launched since 1988, more than in the previous history of the organisation. However, these forces were usually deployed where there was an established peace to keep. 'I'm not sure that's always going to be true,' he said. Gen Galvin, who retires from his post later this month, expressed confidence that Nato would take on peacekeeping missions, which is a subject due for discussion by foreign ministers in Oslo this week. However, it was unlikely to undertake such a role in eastern Europe without the involvement of east European countries, he said.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Improving the North Circular Road EDMUND NUTTALL has been awarded a contract to upgrade a section of the A406 London North Circular Road by the Department of Transport. Valued at Pounds 31.7m, the works are located at Finchley, extending 2.3 kilometres along the A406 from close to its junction with the A1 Falloden Way to a point 400 metres east of its junction with the A1000 High Road Finchley. The main works comprise the upgrading of the single carriageway to dual three-lane standard, but there are several challenging structures en route. The most significant is a 125-metre top-down construction underpass tunnel which, with the western approach, involves around 575 linear metres of diaphragm wall construction. The tunnel takes the new dual three-lane carriageway under the A504 East End Road, a highly congested roundabout junction with the A406.</p>

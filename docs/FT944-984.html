			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: GenCorp in talks over disposal of aerospace unit GenCorp, a diversified US manufacturing group, said it was in talks over the sale of its aerospace and defence operations, which last year accounted for nearly half its revenues. The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber, said that it had decided that its 'first priority' was to divest the unit, after a strategic review launched earlier this year. The plan is the latest in a string of divestments by the company, which would see it reduced to two businesses: manufacturing polymer products and automotive parts. GenCorp sold its tyre business in the late 1980s to Continental, the German tyremaker, as part of a Dollars 1.6bn share buy-back and restructuring plan to ward off a hostile takeover. It shed broadcasting and bottling operations at the same time. The defence and aerospace business, Aerojet, made operating profits of Dollars 53m on sales of Dollars 872m last year, out of total group operating profits of Dollars 121m on sales of Dollars 1.9bn. The unit makes propulsion, electronic and ordnance systems. Faced with cuts in US defence spending, GenCorp has been reducing Aerojet in recent years, resulting in a cut in its revenues of 14 per cent last year. A sale of the unit would leave GenCorp with operations in polymer products, which had sales of Dollars 514m last year, and automotive parts, with sales of Dollars 519m. Mr John Yasinksy, who was recently appointed president and chief executive, said that discussions had been under way with a number of potential buyers. 'These discussions will allow us to determine whether divestiture or retention of some or all of Aerojet as part of our portfolio creates the greatest value for our shareholders,' Mr Yasinksy said.</p>

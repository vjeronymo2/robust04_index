			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BROWNS PROVIDE LESSONS IN LOYALTY;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: TEACHERS SAY STUDENTS PROFIT FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE CLEVELAND TEAM  AS IT ENDS ITS LOSING STREAK.  </P> <P> The beleaguered Cleveland Browns are providing the inspiration for young  students at a Summit County school where lessons in loyalty are being taught.  </P> <P> Teachers at Cathedral Christian School say it is important to show children  that sometimes loyalty means sticking around during a losing streak.  </P> <P> And what better example to stand beside than the Browns, who improved to 3-11  and ended an eight-game skid with Sunday's 13-10 win over Atlanta?  </P> <P> "It's part of a series of teachings about being faithful and fickle," said  Melanie Kemp, administrator of the nondenominational school. "Being faithful as  a fan is one of the little things of life. But being faithful as a fan teaches  you how you can be faithful in relationships, faithful in keeping your word and  faithful in carrying out your responsibilities."  </P> <P> Pupils at Cathedral, pre-kindergarten through the seventh grade, have been  sporting Browns duds -- hats, T-shirts and fake dog ears -- even through the  team's lopsided losses.  </P> <P> About 115 of them barked and cheered their way through a pep rally for the  Browns on Friday. The barking was higher-pitched than the woofs emanating from  the Cleveland Stadium's rowdy "Dawg Pound" bleacher section, but the little  fans' fervor was there.  </P> <P> "Our philosophy here is that a kid remembers 10% of what he hears, 50% of what  he sees and 80% of what he does," said Kemp, who also teaches history. "We  think it's very important to involve the kids and let them learn."  </P> <P> Browns prizes were awarded to pupils for creating the best posters. Caps,  sweatbands and field towels were handed out, and one student got a pair of  tickets for Sunday's game.  </P></p>

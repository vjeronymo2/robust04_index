			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Nissan to rationalise distribution in Europe NISSAN, Japan's second largest car maker, expects to make big savings on its vehicle distribution operations in Europe by scrapping national distribution centres. From next year, dealers in most continental European markets are to receive their vehicles directly from one of two much larger distribution centres, an existing facility in Amsterdam, or a new one being built in Barcelona and due to begin operations next spring. A third may be added later. Under Nissan's traditional system, vehicles have been supplied from its main import centre in Amsterdam to large compounds, some operated by independent distributors, in each country, with each country's dealer network drawing on this national 'pool'. By eliminating the compounds, Nissan expects to make big inventory savings. The new system is partly in operation in northern Europe, with dealers in Germany, northern France, Switzerland and Holland supplied from Amsterdam. Southern France will be supplied from Barcelona when the centre opens, with Portugal and Greece brought into the system later.</p>

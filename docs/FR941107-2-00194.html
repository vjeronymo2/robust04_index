			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix 1_Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priority, 14 parties submitted comments. Six of the 14 commenters generally supported the priority. The 8 remaining commenters objected to the priority for a variety of reasons. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the proposed priority follows. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Six commenters expressed concern that services would be reduced for families in general that are not located in Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities, or that poor, isolated, and underserved populations not included in these areas would receive fewer services. Most of these commenters also did not see a relationship between the purposes of IDEA programs and the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The discretionary programs funded under IDEA program are well suited to play a role in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities because of the close relationship between poverty and disabilities. Because residents of low income areas are often underserved, an important goal of the IDEA discretionary programs is to improve services for this population. Providing preferences for applications serving Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will assist in meeting this goal. While the risk factors associated with disabilities are highest in low income areas, these areas often serve the lowest numbers of children with disabilities. In addition, the coordinated and comprehensive approaches to services, such as those under the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, can be effective tools in addressing the needs of these children. The priority is expected to both target resources on areas of greatest need and to increase the effective use of resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters were concerned that the competitive preference would lead to some areas not receiving any services because they would not be able to compete effectively with applicants serving Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities. This comment was made most often with regard to the Parent Training and Information Center (PTI) program, which is intended to ensure coverage of services throughout the States to the greatest extent possible, and from small States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that it is important in some programs to serve all areas of the country. Specifically, with regard to the PTI program, section 631(e)(4)(A) of IDEA and regulations at 34 CFR 316.24 place a priority on projects that ensure widespread geographic coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  While no change is being made in this priority, a 15-point competitive preference will be given to applications under the Parent Training and Information Centers competition that would provide parent training and information in a State that would be unserved by an existing PTI center in 1995. The Secretary believes that this additional competitive preference will help ensure that all areas of the country receive services. This competitive preference is announced in the Notice inviting applications that is published separately in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter indicated that the priority would give grant applications from Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities priority for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The priority would give applications proposing to serve Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities priority for funding, not applications from the zones and communities themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters proposed replacing the competitive preference with a requirement that Parent Training and Information Center applicants be required to consult and collaborate with the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities on activities which would serve families of children with disabilities who are poor, unemployed or in general distress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Parent Training and Information Centers are already required to collaborate with other agencies that would include Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter noted that designation of the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities would not occur until later this year and the information would not be available for applicants in time for this competition. The commenter suggested postponing action until fiscal year 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  It is important to begin links between IDEA programs and Empowerment Zones and Enterprise communities as early as possible. However, the Department agrees that much of the pertinent information will not be available to applicants at the time their applications are prepared. Depending on the timing of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community designations, applicants will not know the designations for Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities at the time they prepare their proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The priority has been revised to indicate that, in order to obtain the competitive preference, applicants must propose to provide services to one or more Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities that are designated within the areas served by projects. If no zones or communities are designated within an applicant's proposed project areas, applicants would not receive the competitive preference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters indicated a concern that the competitive preference would interfere with the ability of projects to serve children with disabilities and their families in accordance with the intent of IDEA, because of conflicts with the multiple purposes of the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities that emphasize economic development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  While the scope of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative is significantly broader than that of IDEA, the Secretary does not believe that there is a fundamental conflict between the purposes or operation of IDEA programs and the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. However, it is important to clarify that project activities are limited to carrying out the purpose of IDEA and do not extend to broader purposes of the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities that extend beyond IDEA. Language in the priority states that projects must contribute to the strategic plan of the Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities and be made an integral component of the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community activities. This language might incorrectly be construed to require projects to participate in activities that are not consistent with IDEA, or that are inappropriate or infeasible within the context of a particular IDEA program. For example, an Outreach project under the Early Education for Children with Disabilities program that serves the entire Nation would find it infeasible to become an integral part of the activities of 104 Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  In order to clarify that projects activities related to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities must be appropriate within the context of IDEA while participating in broader community empowerment strategies, the words ``as appropriate'' have also been added with regard to the inclusion of the projects in the planning and activities of the Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

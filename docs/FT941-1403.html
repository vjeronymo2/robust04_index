			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Major looks to Germany for EU deal The government is looking to Germany to forge a face-saving compromise in the dispute over voting rights which risks delaying the entry of four new countries into the European Union next year. After Mr John Major dropped hints of flexibility in the UK negotiating position yesterday, senior British officials expressed hope that Germany might be able to coax EU partners into reciprocal movement at this weekend's meeting of European foreign ministers in Greece. Germany has opposed UK and Spanish demands to preserve voting rules allowing two large member states and one small country to block decisions in the Council of Ministers. The UK, however, appears to be gambling that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire to bring Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the EU may encourage new flexibility. Even if the deadlock is not broken in Greece, one wellplaced UK official said it might be possible to reach a deal before Easter. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said after a meeting with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, that any deal must not come at the price of weakened decision-making in an expanded EU. Hopes of a compromise revolve around a trade-off in which the UK and Spain concede that the 'blocking minority' must rise from 23 to 27 votes to take account of the four new members. In return they would win a legally binding protocol giving countries mustering between 23 and 27 votes an automatic right to delay decisions. Mr Major's 'bottom line' was described by senior Whitehall insiders as an agreement which in no way eroded the ability of minorities to block contentious legislation on employment and social issues. Legal experts in Brussels dismissed the notion of putting a legal ring-fence around social legislation, or creating a two-tier voting system to deal with such contentious issues. Mr Major told the Commons that an agreement would be possible 'within a matter of days' if other European governments had the political will to reach a settlement. David Gardner in Brussels adds: Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs minister, who will be chairing this weekend's meeting in Greece, last night described the British stance as 'the blackmail of a tiny minority'.

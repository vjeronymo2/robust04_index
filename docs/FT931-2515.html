			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Overseas orders boost engineering THE VALUE of international construction contracts involving British consulting engineers jumped by more than 40 per cent from Pounds 41.98bn to Pounds 60.06bn last year according to figures published yesterday. Consulting engineers are estimated to have contributed Pounds 625m to Britain's invisible earnings in 1992 - almost 39 per cent more than the Pounds 450m earned in 1991. The figures, published by the Association of Consulting Engineers, do not include any contribution from British contractors or building material producers working on international projects. The increase in international orders was in part due to several large transport and energy projects mostly in the Far East. As a result the capital value of new projects for which British consultants won contracts more than doubled to Pounds 27.75bn. More than a third of this arose from the Pounds 10bn Bangkok Elevated Transport System in which Ove Arup is involved. British consultants have also been working on a Pounds 2.7bn landfill project in Hong Kong which is part of the transport infrastructure of the new Chep Lap Kok airport. Contracts were also won last year on several large power station projects in China. Mr Povl Ahm, chairman of the association, said that the level of international construction orders from China was increasing. He was concerned that Britain should not lose a share of this work because of problems over Hong Kong. But he added that there was no sign of significant recovery in world construction orders outside the Far East. The capital value of Far Eastern projects involving British consultants rose from Pounds 11.85bn to Pounds 28.85bn last year.</p>

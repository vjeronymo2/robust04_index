These donations responded to concern over the costs to taxpayers of storing vast quantities of foods, while at the same time there were persons in need of food assistance. The Emergency Food Assistance Program was codified in Title II of Public Law 98&hyph;8, the Emergency Food Assistance Act (EFAA) of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 612c note). Surplus foods made available for distribution under the EFAA are limited to amounts determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the quantities needed to carry out other programs, including Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) sales obligations and domestic food assistance programs. The Secretary of Agriculture anticipates that 72 million pounds of surplus butter will be acquired by the CCC under its price-support activities and made available for distribution through TEFAP during Fiscal Year 1995. Although butter is the only surplus commodity expected to be available for TEFAP, the Department may offer additional commodities, or a different amount of butter, depending on agricultural production, market conditions and the distribution of donated foods to other domestic outlets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Purchased Commodities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent years, the supply of available surplus commodities has been drastically reduced. These reductions are the result of changes in the agricultural price-support programs which have brought supply and demand into better balance, and accelerated donations and sales. Congress responded to the reduced availability of surplus commodities with section 104 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;435, which added sections 213 and 214 to the EFAA. Those sections require the Secretary to annually purchase, process, and distribute commodities for household consumption in addition to those surplus commodities otherwise provided under TEFAP. In section 110 of the Hunger Prevention Act, Congress also requires the Secretary to purchase, process and distribute commodities for soup kitchens and food banks. USDA purchases commodities for these programs based in part on annual reports completed by distributing agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Fiscal Year 1995, $25 million has been appropriated for purchasing, processing and distributing additional commodities for household use. The Department anticipates purchasing for distribution to households through TEFAP during Fiscal Year 1995 peanut butter, rice, dehydrated potatoes, and the following canned foods: green beans, peaches, pears and tomatoes. The amounts of each item purchased will depend on the prices USDA must pay, as well as the quantity of each item requested by the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Fiscal Year 1995, $40 million has been appropriated to purchase, process, and distribute commodities for further distribution to soup kitchens and food banks. For such outlets, the Department anticipates the purchase of dehydrated potatoes, frozen ground beef, frozen cut-up chicken, turkey roasts, and the following canned foods: green beans, peaches, pears, tomatoes, and beef. The amounts of each item purchased will depend on the prices USDA must pay.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Amanda Manning, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26768 Filed 10&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;30&hyph;U <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

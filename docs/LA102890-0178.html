			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOPHOLE IN LAW ALLOWS CONCEALING OF ADS' BACKERS, COMMISSION RULES  </P> <P> The Fair Political Practices Commission has ruled that legislative leaders  Willie Brown and David A. Roberti and the alcohol industry can air political  ads that conceal financial backing.  </P> <P> Acting on a complaint from political watchdog groups, the commission on Friday  said it will not stop opponents of Propositions 131 and 140, the term-limit  initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot, from running a controversial ad featuring  actress Angela Lansbury even though it fails to identify its financial backers  -- political committees organized by Assembly Speaker Brown (D-San Francisco)  and Senate President Pro tem Roberti (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Gregory Baugher, the commission's executive director, said that although state  laws were intended to require the disclosure of major funding sources behind  political ads, they contain an "unintended loophole" that exempts commercials  whose content deals equally with two initiatives.  </P> <P> "The words in the (Angela Lansbury) ad appear to have been carefully chosen so  as to create the impression that the ad refers equally to both initiatives,"  Baugher said. "The producers of this ad have obviously tried to take advantage  of this loophole." He conceded that the decision had been a close call and  others "may reasonably disagree."  </P> <P> Likewise, the commission staff said a radio advertisement produced by anti-tax  groups that fails to disclose alcoholic beverage interests as their prime  financial backers seems to be in compliance with state law.  </P> <P> The staff said the commercial's content appears to be "evenly divided" between  Propositions 136 and 137. Proposition 136 rewrites tax law to mandate a  two-thirds vote by the people to raise special or single-purpose taxes and  would make it extremely difficult to hike alcohol taxes. Proposition 137  requires a public vote on any changes in laws governing initiatives.  </P> <P> The latest decision does not affect an earlier commission ruling regarding  political ads aired by alcohol interests that promote Proposition 126, a  proposal for a small increase in beer, wine and liquor taxes, and oppose  Proposition 134, an initiative providing for substantial increases in those  taxes. In that case, the commission said the industry would have to make full  disclosure because the exemption applies only to initiatives. Proposition 126  was put on the ballot by the Legislature.  </P> <P> Chairman John Larson said the commission would begin examining ways to close  the loophole at its next meeting Nov. 7.  </P> <P> The ruling coincided with the filing of financial reports that showed the  alcoholic beverage industry and tobacco interests have funneled nearly $3  million in the last month into the campaign to pass 136.  </P> <P> Lenny Goldberg, campaign director for Californians Against Initiative Fraud, a  coalition opposing the initiative, said the commission's ruling will make it  harder now for his organization to defeat the ballot measure.  </P> <P> "Disclosure that the alcohol industry is behind this would blow Proposition 136  completely out of the water," he said.  </P></p>

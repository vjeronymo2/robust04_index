			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Major bows to D-day pounding Mr John Major yesterday moved to defuse the row over this summer's D-day anniversary by bowing to the demands of veterans for a bigger say in the events marking the Normandy landings in June 1944. As ministers admitted that the government's approach had become a public relations fiasco, Mr Major sought to assure MPs that the government's planning would emphasise the commemorative rather than celebratory nature of the events. His comments followed an urgent meeting between Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, and representatives of the Normandy Veterans Association and the Royal British Legion. Mr Brooke, whose department has been employing public relations consultants Lowe Bell to co-ordinate nationwide activities to mark the invasion, assured the veterans that the government would not trivialise the anniversary. In particular, the veterans would be given an important role in the organisation of a planned jamboree in London's Hyde Park. The veterans had threatened a boycott but have now agreed to reconsider and draw up their own suggested programme for the day. After discussing the debacle at yesterday's cabinet meeting, other ministers accused Mr Brooke's department of mishandling the anniversary. They said the government should distance itself from some of the 'frivolous events' suggested by Lowe Bell. Under pressure in the Commons from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, over ignoring the sensitivities of those who took part in the landings, Mr Major said the main focus of the programme would be one of solemn commemoration. He cited an open-air ceremony of remembrance which will be conducted by the archbishop of Canterbury, religious services in the British cemetery in Normandy and a march past by veterans. But the prime minister said the government also wanted to involve the rest of the country: 'As well as commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of those who took part in the Normandy campaign, we also wish to remember the immense effort made by the whole civilian population leading up to D-day and beyond. That is why we want the commemorations to involve all generations, including our children.' Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- A Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] official said Thursday  [17 February] Japan might propose a five-year income tax cut  plan to show "our resolution" to stimulate domestic demand.    The high-ranking official, who asked not to be identified,  told reporters the planned concession is part of new proposals  to break the deadlocked Japan-U.S. framework trade talks.    President Bill Clinton reportedly expressed his  dissatisfaction with a one-year income tax reduction, which is  the pillar of Japan's largest-ever pump-priming package, during  his meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last week.    "Japan has to take the initiative by proposing some new  concessions" to get bilateral negotiations moving again, the  official said.    Earlier in the day, MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano,  speaking at a press conference, said the recent sharp yen surge  against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the  world economy and that of Japan as well.    The Japanese currency strengthened dramatically in the wake  of failure of the framework negotiations at the Japan-U.S.  summit meeting and Clinton's remarks that "objective criteria"  will include foreign exchange movements.    The dollar closed Thursday trading in Tokyo at 103.48 yen,  up  from 108.25 yen on Friday.</p>

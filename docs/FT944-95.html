			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Power generators The forthcoming sale of the government's remaining 40 per cent stake in National Power and PowerGen contains two investment banking novelties. First, the number of banks appointed to market the Pounds 4bn offer is limited to 17, compared with around 60 when the third tranche of British Telecom shares was sold last year. Second, the so-called pre-marketing exercise - the time spent canvassing potential investors ahead of the formal book-building process - has been carefully structured. With British Telecom last year, the global co-ordinator conducted the bulk of the pre-marketing on its own. This time each of the 17 banks will be given the opportunity to pitch to favoured clients. The innovations are devised by joint global co-ordinators BZW and Kleinwort Benson Securities and are modelled partly on practice in recent French privatisations. They are designed to create what bankers call 'demand tension' - the broadest and deepest possible demand for the new shares. The mechanisms should be effective doing this, thus meeting the Treasury's aim of achieving the highest price for the shares. The limited number of syndicate members, including some niche players like Argentaria and Mediobanca as well as global investment banks such as Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs, gives each institution large potential rewards and thus clear motivation to market the issue aggressively. This was not the case with the third tranche of BT shares: it is thought that more than 90 per cent of the shares were placed by fewer than 10 of the 60 syndicate members, suggesting that many did not try hard to sell shares. The formalised pre-marketing procedure will also help motivate the syndicate members. They will have to compete among themselves for the right to make presentations to given clients, but, having jumped through this hurdle, they are likely to win the lucrative buying business from those clients when the book-building gets under way.</p>

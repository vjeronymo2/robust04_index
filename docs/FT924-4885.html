			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Coal Partisan lobbying is all grist to Westminster's mill. But the efforts of the electricity generators and regional electricity companies to blame each other in the coal row may yet cause the government difficulty. If it is to make concessions on pit closures, its priority must be to get more coal burnt, and for that it will need the co-operation of both sides of the electricity industry. Giving that help could well guarantee a light touch from a grateful government. A fudge - perhaps based on Southern Electric's suggestion that the government should sell its competition soul and maintain the size of the non-competitive market till 1988 - could be agreed with a little give all round. British Coal might then sell over 50m tonnes a year and buy much needed time. Yet obvious tension between the RECs and the generators could compromise a deal. It may be rash for the RECs to press for a break-up of the generators, since by almost any measure REC returns are higher. And the suggestion by National Power that the non-competitive market should be reserved for coal largely burnt by the generators is mischievous. Shareholders must hope that neither side invites a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry by pursuing feuds which run back to the long fiat of the CEGB.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Heaven and Hell: To joke - perchance to laugh? - A deeply philosophical question ARE THERE jokes in Heaven? Difficult to imagine, isn't it? Ancient philosophers envisaged the gods happily contemplating the perfection of the universe. But show a comedian the perfect world and he will burst out laughing or, more typically, tell a joke. Jokes are incorrigibly dissident. At the lightest level, they deflate our vanity (interviewed by Dame Edna Everage on TV, best-selling novelist Jeffrey Archer once said how important it was to laugh at oneself. 'If you can't do that, Jeffrey, you've missed the biggest joke of all]' came the reply). At a deeper level, they enable us to live with highly-unpleasant truths about ourselves which often are directly contrary to our orthodox beliefs. All those jokes about mothers-in-law, sex and religion: don't they serve as safety valves for some of our most ambivalent thoughts and desires? Some of the funniest jokes about Heaven are told by churchmen; not surprising when the strongest believers are often tortured by doubt. Heaven is one thing about which we cannot be certain. As the 17th-century philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, put it: 'What kind of Felicity God hath ordained to them that devoutly honour Him, a man shall no sooner know than enjoy.' But, through jokes, people at least can accommodate completely inconsistent ideas in one release of mirth rather than suffer mental anguish. Once in Heaven, though, jokes would be ruled out of court. Everyone there would have a starred First in Perfection cum laude. If you went around intimating that anyone was a little less than perfect, you would be considered, well, a bit naff. How would some of most dissident comic writers entertain themselves? Henry Fielding for instance (he would be out of a job as a magistrate, in any case)? Or Jane Austen, whose irony - as expressed by Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice - is directed at the 'follies and inconsistencies' of the world? Queen Victoria would be there (she who never was amused); but we would seek in vain for Dr Johnson and his drinking companions, Goldsmith, Garrick and Gibbon. Heaven would not just be beyond a joke. Would it not also be, er, just a little boring? The problem is not to do with Heaven or whether we would be happy there. The hard thing is imagining happiness without jokes or fun: do these not depend on recognising human 'follies and inconsistencies.' TE Lawrence once said that 'failure was God's freedom to mankind.' He could have been describing jokes. In an important respect, man's follies are his freedoms. Jokes thrive on the quirky and unpredictable in human nature. Only in this way can they surprise us with their knowledge of ourselves. How could jokes survive in Heaven, where everything is predictable? So much human happiness depends on chance - the old English word 'hap,' meaning chance or luck, is part of the word - and jokes are no exception. Like life's best adventures, their success is in proportion to the uncertainty of their outcome. Jokes are chancy things. You need to carry them off, and you also need to carry your audience with you. Indeed, one reason jokes are risky is because they depend on other people, to hear as well to share in them. 'A jest's prosperity lies in the ear/ Of him that hears it,' as Rosaline says at the end of Love's Labour's Lost. But because Heaven admits of no chance, it cannot admit of happiness, at least not as it is understood humanly. Everyone miraculously would hear the punch-line in his head before you said it. How could you get your timing right in an environment which was timeless, changeless and co-eternal with God? Every joke would be divinely stale. Human unpredictability is not always a source of happiness. Jokes fail. They also wound, as Emma Woodhouse learns when she attempts a joke at the expense of Miss Bates in Jane Austen's Emma. But during wars, when unpredictable human folly can make it seem as if the world has gone mad, jokes can be our last line of defence. They can turn the tables on adversity. Someone who thought the follies and uncertainties of this life were heaven enough was Rupert Brooke who, in a poem, celebrated 'voices in laughter,' 'the pain, the calm, and the astonishment/Desire illimitable, and still content.' "All these,' he says, 'have been my loves,' despite the fact that 'these shall pass.' What he loves is the unpredictability of life, the unforeseen-ness of its all-too-human epiphanies, even - we could say - its capacity for jokes. The Greek poets understood this better than the philosophers. While philosophers were propounding a po-faced image of celestial happiness, their literary brethren were saying something very different about happiness. Why do so many gods of ancient legend descend to earth merely to get up to mischief? They play pranks and they love to joke; they love, also, to fall in love although they rarely hold on to the mortals they pursue. Perhaps the gods were on to something: that happiness, like a good joke, is something you need to be human to appreciate.</p>

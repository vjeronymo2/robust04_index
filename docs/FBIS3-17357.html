			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 24th -- It became known to the IBERIA news  agency that Guram Muchaidze has given a statement on behalf of  the Social Democratic Party: "The other day, Zurab Zhvania, the  general secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens, accused  the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers of corruption. Eduard  Shevardnadze, the chairman of the same union and Georgian head  of state, has presented [to the parliament] for approval the  same staff of the Cabinet of Ministers.    [No opening quotation marks as received] This arouses  astonishment and concern among us. The head of state should  either reject the statement made by the general secretary and  distance himself from it or, provided he shares the viewpoint of  the latter, withhold the list of candidates. If the head of  state prefers to keep silent we will infer that he has become a  Mafia hostage."</p>

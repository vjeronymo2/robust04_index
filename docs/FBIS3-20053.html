However,  the police have not yet sounded the all-clear.    In the afternoon, the traditional Newroz celebration of the  Kurds began -- accompanied by several hundred policemen -- in  Frankfurt/Main with much noise but peacefully. "The situation  is characterized by unpredictability, fanaticism, and controlled  leadership," a police spokesman said. The authorities are also  prepared for activities in other places. The Frankfurt Newroz  celebrations had been permitted under strict conditions.    On Sunday police expect thousands of Kurds to come to  Mannheim, to follow a call for a mourning demonstration for two  Kurdish women from Turkey. The women had burned themselves in  Mannheim in protest against the situation of their people in  Anatolia. Police consider it possible that more than 20,000  Kurds will come to the rally, which was banned by the city on  Friday. Units of the Federal Border Police (BGS) have been  ordered to Mannheim.    In Hannover about 200 people, who mainly belonged to the  autonomous scene, demonstrated on Saturday against the  oppression of Kurds in Turkey. In Cologne the Kurds have  obviously respected the ban on demonstrations issued by the  Cologne police president. Apart from a small group of Kurds  carrying banners, there were no protests. Police and BGS had  gathered more than 3,000 of their men in the city as a  precaution. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Halifax and after Lloyds Bank's approach to Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society earlier this year was widely recognised as the start of something big. Yet few foresaw that it would be the catalyst for an upheaval in the building society movement on the scale that now seems possible in the light of the proposed merger between the Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies. If the plans for marriage and subsequent conversion into a public listed company meet with the requisite approvals, nearly a third of the building society movement's Pounds 280bn assets will disappear overnight. The psychological shock to the rest of the movement will be traumatic. There is, of course, nothing completely new in finance. The original merger between the Halifax Permanent and the Halifax Equitable in 1928, from which the present Halifax was formed, will remain the biggest historic building society merger in relation to the size of the industry until the present (or some other comparable) merger is consummated. The difference here lies in the change in status, since the Halifax and the Leeds are proposing to follow Abbey National's route to the stock market. No building society can henceforth dodge the question of whether mutual ownership continues to serve a worthwhile purpose. The case for a wholly separate regulatory regime for a shrinking number of societies that are banks in all but name will also require radical rethinking in the Treasury. The wider issue is whether a retreat from mutuality is a matter for regret. Regulatory constraints A high level of home ownership, which was the chief social purpose of the societies' mutual ownership, has already been achieved. Meanwhile, mutuality within the framework of the 1986 Building Society Act imposes regulatory constraints on building societies' attempts to become fully-fledged financial services groups. By its very definition such a restricted form of ownership implies lack of access to large-scale capital and an inability to make acquisitions for paper. Nor does mutuality provide the best means for dealing with the legacy of the past. The high streets are overstocked with building society branches - a consequence of non-price competition in the days of the old building society cartel. These outlets deliver a proliferation of products that look increasingly similar. That points ultimately to declining profitability and the need for fewer branches. The experience of building society mergers so far is that mutuality does little to promote such rationalisation. Accountability to shareholders seems more likely to deliver on this score. Competition policy That is one reason to feel relatively unconcerned about the competition policy aspects of the Halifax-Leeds proposal. The two societies' joint 20 per cent share of outstanding mortgage advances may sound high. Yet no other large developed country has as many nationwide retail banks operating in such a competitive environment; and the commitment of the Halifax and Leeds to cutting branch costs hardly points to upward pressure on prices. For all that, mutuality still imposes discipline in the use of capital. The Halifax and Leeds, admittedly, are conscious of the way money burned a hole in the TSB Group's pocket after its flotation and have no wish to raise much new capital. Yet the recent history of the clearing banks contains notorious instances of rights issues being squandered - a longer term hazard. The case for such discipline is unlikely to carry weight with incumbent building society management. And in the absence of real accountability, a further contraction in the number of building societies will be driven more by the survival instincts of management than anything else. That implies, after Lloyds' initiative with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, there may well be attempts to pre-empt unwelcome takeover approaches by making a comfortable choice of partner under the accommodating regime of mutuality. It also suggests that the managers of larger building societies may seek to emulate the directors of privatised utilities in acquiring lucrative share options via stock market listings. Either way, the game has changed forever.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MULLIGAN SEES POSITIVES IN EXHIBITION DEFEAT  </P> <P> UC Irvine offered something new and something old in its exhibition basketball  game against High Five America Saturday night.  </P> <P> Gerald McDonald, a 6-foot junior point guard, jumped center against Antwahn  Nance, 6-9, and won the tip.  </P> <P> Ricky Butler showed off his new, leaner physique, leaping over the press table  to save a loose ball.  </P> <P> But it was also clear the Anteaters still haven't worked out all of the kinks  from a 5-23 1989-90 season, the worst in the school's 25-year history.  </P> <P> Twenty-nine turnovers, 53.1% free-throw shooting and 49 points by High Five's  Troy Lewis were too much for Irvine, which lost, 127-122, before 1,107 in the  Bren Center.  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan nevertheless liked what he saw.  </P> <P> "We're encouraged," he said. "We made a million mistakes, and we know that."  </P> <P> The Anteaters' run-until-you-drop offense looked as if it needed a little work,  but there is still time before they open for real against UCLA in the Great  Alaska Shootout Nov. 23.  </P> <P> Irvine's fast break and a near-total collapse by High Five, a barnstorming team  of former college stars fighting drug and alcohol abuse, nearly wiped out a  21-point deficit.  </P> <P> "That (running and gunning) is what we're going to do all year," Mulligan said.  "I'm not going to change. I don't care what anybody says."  </P> <P> Butler -- who has dropped 20 to 25 pounds since last season, according to  Mulligan -- McDonald and Dylan Rigdon led the comeback for Irvine, which  trailed, 83-62 less than four minutes in the second half.  </P> <P> Rigdon had a chance to bring Irvine even at 119-all with 1:14 left but made  only one of two free throws, and that was as close as Irvine got.  </P> <P> Lewis, who hit all manner of drives to the basket and three-point jumpers, made  a layup and went four-for-four from the line in the final minute.  </P> <P> Lewis was an All-Big Ten guard at Purdue. He was 16 for 22, including four for  six on three-pointers, and made 13 of 16 from the line.  </P> <P> Butler, who injured his left knee in a workout last Sunday and practiced only  lightly this week, had 24 points to lead Irvine despite playing just 18 minutes  because of exhaustion and foul trouble. He fouled out with 5:01 left after  making 11 of 13 shots from the field.  </P> <P> Later, Butler, a 6-7, 245-pound senior center, was asked if he felt quicker  having shed the extra weight.  </P> <P> "Didn't you see me dunking out there?" he said. "I feel good about the team. I  think we're going to be good."  </P> <P> Rigdon had 23 points, McDonald 15 and Jeff Herdman 13 for Irvine, which next  plays the Finnish National Team Nov. 12.  </P></p>

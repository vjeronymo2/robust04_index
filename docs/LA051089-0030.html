			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERATE IN LINE TO LEAD SAN DIEGO'S ROMAN CATHOLICS  </P> <P> Bishop Robert H. Brom of Minnesota, a theological moderate who says he believes  that the Catholic Church's "objective truths" must be weighed against  individuals' "subjective circumstances," on Tuesday was named coadjutor bishop  of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego and the future successor to Bishop  Leo T. Maher.  </P> <P> In a decision announced in Washington by Archbishop Pio Laghi, the apostolic  delegateto the United States, Pope John Paul II appointed Brom to be coadjutor  -- an heir apparent who will share diocesan duties with Maher until he reaches  the church's mandatory retirement age of 75 in July, 1990. At that time, the  50-year-old Brom will become the diocese's leader.  </P> <P> Brom, who has headed the Duluth, Minn., diocese -- which is about one-sixth the  size of the 462,000-member San Diego diocese -- for six years, will be  installed as coadjutor in a July 24 ceremony to be attended by Laghi, Los  Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony and Maher.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Strong But Compassionate'  </P> <P> During his first three months here, Brom, who speaks some Spanish, plans to  become fluent in the language -- a skill viewed as a virtual necessity for the  next bishop, given San Diego's proximity to the border and the large number of  Latinos in the church. The remainder of his "apprenticeship," Brom added, will  be devoted to becoming familiar with the local diocese and its needs.  </P> <P> According to associates in Minnesota, Brom is, as one priest put it, "a strong  but compassionate leader" who is able to balance his own strict adherence to  church tenets with a recognition that many believers differ with Catholic  orthodoxy on controversial issues such as birth control, divorce and the role  of women in the church. While Brom does not veer from the Vatican line on those  core issues, several priests said, neither does he harshly criticize those  Catholics who question some church positions.  </P> <P> Brom displayed that quality at a Tuesday news conference, answering questions  about how he believes priests should deal with Catholics who dissent from  church teachings on certain crucial issues.  </P> <P> "In each case, we must distinguish between acceptable pluralism and diversity  and what is unacceptable in terms of Catholic identity and membership in the  church," Brom said.  </P> <P> Explaining that he strives "never to deny the truth, but never to impose the  truth," Brom said that he could not "give a cold, hard answer" about whether he  would condemn or understand individuals' differences with church teachings  before talking with them to discern their thinking.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visit to Rome  </P> <P> Asked to categorize himself philosophically, Brom described himself as a  moderate who is "troubled with both extremes."  </P> <P> Born in Arcadia, Wis., Brom was ordained in Winona, Minn., 25 years ago -- an  event that he plans to commemorate with a two-week visit to Rome this summer.  In addition to pastoral assignments, Brom's other positions with the Winona  diocese included service as a professor and rector at Immaculate Heart of Mary  Seminary, and president of the diocese's Senate of Priests.  </P> <P> Maher, who had requested that the Vatican appoint a coadjutor to ease the  transition to a new bishop after his own 20-year tenure, said Brom's name was  among those he had submitted to apostolic delegate Laghi, also called the  pronuncio, for consideration as possible successors.  </P> <P> However, as is typical in the bishop appointment process -- an operation at  once carefully structured but also steeped in mystique and secretiveness --  Brom said he was unaware that he was even under consideration until Laghi  called him two weeks ago to inform him of his selection.  </P> <P> One of Brom's first major decisions relating to his position here was to forgo  living in a stylish half-million-dollar Kensington house -- bought by the  diocese in anticipation of a new bishop's appointment -- in favor of taking up  residence in an apartment at the diocesan seminary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Simplified Life Style'  </P> <P> That choice, Brom explained, stemmed primarily from his longtime involvement  with "the academic aspect of the church," adding that he prefers "a more  simplified life style" -- an apparent allusion to image questions raised inside  and outside local religious circles about the six-bedroom, pool-equipped  Kensington home. As a result, Maher, who will continue residing in his Mission  Hills home, said that the house will be sold by the diocese.  </P></p>

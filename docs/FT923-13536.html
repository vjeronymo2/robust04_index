			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / MMC may judge BT and Oftel price row LACK of progress in talks between British Telecommunications and Oftel, its regulator, over a tighter price-control regime means that the issue could be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. One consequence of the dispute is that BT is delaying the announcement of more than Pounds 100m in price cuts scheduled for the autumn. It is concerned not to make price changes this year that would have to be reversed next year. When Oftel unveiled its new pricing scheme last month, it gave BT until the end of the month to accept it. Not only has that deadline lapsed, but the most recent talks between the two sides last Thursday have been described as 'frosty'. Both sides, which only a week ago expected to reach an agreement, now talk privately about the possibility of referring the matter to the MMC, which has the power to impose a solution. However, given that BT and Oftel have threatened to go to the MMC several times in the past, the present dispute seems to point to the two sides' tough negotiating stances rather than a total breakdown of talks. Oftel, which is being led by Mr Bill Wigglesworth in an interim capacity following the departure of Sir Bryan Carsberg to the Office of Fair Trading last month, is sticking to the line that its new regime is not up for negotiation. Oftel has told BT to agree to cut the price of a basket of its basic services each year by inflation minus 7.5 percentage points, compared with 6.25 points at present. The company has also been told to make sure small retail customers share in the price cuts. BT, whose negotiations are led by Mr Jonathan Rickford, government relations director, seems to have accepted that Oftel will not change the main elements of the regime, but hopes that detailed matters of interpretation can be resolved in its favour. 'The devil is in the details,' a BT executive said. Oftel's new regime would require BT to cut connection charges sharply. If the company agrees to do this, it might make sense to start the process this year instead of continuing its practice of increasing connection charges. Another issue concerns special discounts for businesses and heavy residential users of the phone, which at the moment count towards the overall price cuts BT must make. They would not, under the new regime, meaning BT might have an incentive to introduce more generous discounts this year before the regime is changed.</p>

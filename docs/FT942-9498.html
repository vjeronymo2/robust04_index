			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / S Korea cools nuclear tensions: North's move seen as bluff to win concessions on inspections South Korea has voiced doubts about North Korea's claims that it is removing spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactor without the supervision of international observers, who want to test them for clues to the North's suspected nuclear weapons programme. The US has warned that North Korea's action could scuttle negotiations over international inspections of the North's nuclear sites and force the United Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions. But officials in Seoul believe Pyongyang's notification of the fuel rod replacement to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday may be part of a bluff to win new concessions on inspection procedures. North Korea may be trying to force the US to hold a new round of high-level talks before allowing the IAEA access to the fuel rods. The status of the nuclear reactor refuelling may be revealed later this week, when the IAEA is expected to resume an inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities that were blocked in March. North Korea last week agreed to accept the inspectors after the IAEA promised it would not demand immediate inspection of the fuel rods being unloaded from the 5MW reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. The IAEA wants to analyse the fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has previously diverted plutonium from the reactor to develop nuclear devices. The reactor started operation in 1986, but was shut down for three months in 1989. The IAEA suspects that North Korea could have unloaded some of the rods during that period and reprocessed the fuel for nuclear weapons. A dispute over the fuel rods has blocked progress over nuclear inspections in recent weeks. The IAEA previously asked to examine the fuel rods once they were removed from the reactor. But North Korea rejected the demand and threatened to replace the fuel rods without IAEA supervision, which would violate the international nuclear safeguards agreement. The US has expressed concern that unsupervised replacement of the fuel rods would allow North Korea to divert enough plutonium to produce four or five nuclear devices in addition to the two it is suspected of already possessing. Washington threatened to ask the UN Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea if it replaced the fuel rods without international oversight. The conditions for the IAEA's supervision and testing of the fuel rods could be the subject of a new round of high-level talks between the US and North Korea.</p>

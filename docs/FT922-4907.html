			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Warner Music cools opposition to launch of Mini Disc IN A sudden reversal of policy, Warner Music Group yesterday offered its conditional support to Sony's new Mini Disc audio technology format just one day after apparently withholding that support. Mr Robert Molgado, chairman of Warner Music, a division of US entertainment giant Time Warner, said the US label wanted to release titles on Mini Disc and participate in the product's launch later this year. That commitment, however, was conditional on Warner receiving further responses from Sony and from other equipment manufacturers that address Warner's concerns about the effect of the new audio technology on sales of compact disks. Even with the conditions, Mr Delgado's comments represent a turnround for Warner. Only a few days earlier, the US label appeared to rebuff Sony when it said the relative merits of the Mini Disc and its main rival, the digital compact cassette soon to be launched by Dutch group Philips, were still under review. Until that first announcement Sony had been confident that Warner would commit its powerful roster of stars to Mini Disc, a portable recording and playback system which the Japanese group hopes will become the main successor to the analog cassette tape. For Mini Disc players to succeed, Sony must offer a wide range of music titles to potential buyers when the product first hits the market later this year. Warner's change of heart yesterday is believed to have followed ministrations from senior Sony executives, who reportedly protested vigorously on Monday about the US label's luke-warm support for Mini Disc.</p>

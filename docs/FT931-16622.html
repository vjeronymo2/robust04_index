			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Belgium may need emergency steps to trim budget deficit BELGIUM may have to introduce new emergency measures next month to bring its large budget deficit back in line with criteria for monetary union in the Maastricht treaty. The government yesterday announced, as expected, that it had overshot its original target for the 1992 deficit by nearly BFr30bn (Pounds 608m). The deficit increased from BFr367.6bn to BFr382.5bn, compared with a forecast of BFr354.8bn, after economic conditions deteriorated. Government officials said yesterday that once Belgium's regional and community authorities had submitted their figures for 1992, the overall deficit for last year could reach 6.8 or 6.9 per cent of gross national product (GNP). Those figures, inflated by statistical adjustments, are higher than forecast and well out of line with the Maastricht target - a deficit of 3 per cent of GNP by 1996. The officials added that it was likely the government's 1993 target (a deficit of 5.2 per cent of GNP) might have to be increased. Belgium's fragile centre-left coalition has narrowly survived political and economic pressures since its formation in March last year. The government is now pinning its hopes on a cut in German interest rates, which would relieve the pressure on Belgium to introduce emergency budget measures next month. A Treasury official said yesterday: 'Given the very negative business climate, we consider we have succeeded in limiting the deterioration (of the deficit).' But Mr Peter Praet, chief economist with Generale de Banque, one of Belgium's biggest banks, warned yesterday that the government now had little room to manoeuvre. 'Because growth figures are being revised down, if rates don't come down quickly and strongly, the target of 5.2 per cent will be impossible,' he declared.</p>

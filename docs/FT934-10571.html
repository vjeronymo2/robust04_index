			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lion Nathan looks to Asia for further growth LION NATHAN is looking to Asia for growth opportunities and is not planning further acquisitions in either Australia or New Zealand, the brewer's chief executive, Mr Doug Myers, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Auckland. Mr Myers also said the group would 'comfortably achieve' a profit of more than NZDollars 200m (USDollars 110.94m) after tax and goodwill amortisation in 1993-94 against NZDollars 155.86m in the year to August. He said the Australian and New Zealand markets were mature, with little opportunity for growth, but the beer markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America were growing. Lion was looking at joint venture options in Asia and would concentrate its efforts on selling products to the other two markets rather than setting up breweries. The company is evaluating a proposition to set up a brewery in South Korea with American brewer Adolph Coors and is considering other proposals. Lion, which bought brewing and hotel assets in August from SA Brewing for ADollars 225m, said it will start selling the 105 hotels in the first quarter of 1994. Earlier yesterday the company reported a bottom line profit of NZDollars 32.1m for the year to August, up from NZDollars 20.8m.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Price wars force Courage to shed 700 jobs COURAGE, the UK's second biggest brewer, is to shed 700 jobs during the next 18 months - casualties of the price wars between national brewers and other competitive pressures on the industry. Mr Nick Bryan, managing director of Courage, which is owned by Fosters Brewing of Australia, said yesterday that the decision was 'regrettable . . . but vital if we are to secure the long-term growth required for success in the future. 'The UK brewing industry has become increasingly volatile and competitive due to the cumulative effect of falling beer consumption, increased excise duty, imports, and retailer concentration.' Beer consumption has fallen by about 4 per cent during the past year, and competition between brewers to supply the growing number of independent pubs has intensified. Courage has been one of the most aggressive contenders in a price war in which discounts of up to 50 per cent of list prices have been offered. Mr Bryan said profit margins had been squeezed so hard that insufficient resources were being generated for the investment needed in beer brands and customer service. 'We had no alternative but to cut our costs,' he added. Resources released by the job cuts would enable the group to provide stronger support for its brands, beginning with a market-ing programme next year for Foster's lager and John Smith's bitter. Courage said that its rationalisation programme would include management delayering as well as reduction of head office services. None of its five breweries - at Bristol, Reading, London, Halifax and Tadcaster, in North Yorkshire - nor any of its 30 distribution depots would be closed. The company said that compulsory redundancies could not, however, be ruled out, although it would redeploy as many as possible of those affected within the business and would provide generous severance arrangements for those who lost their jobs. The TGWU general workers' union yesterday asked for an early meeting with Courage's management, and shop stewards will meet, probably next week, to discuss their response to the job cuts. Mr Brian Revell, the union's national secretary for the drinks industry, said: 'We will support our members in their resistance to these serious job losses.' He added that the government must take part of the blame for the damage done to the industry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry and by the high levels of beer tax.</p>

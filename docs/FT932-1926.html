			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / US Supreme Court upholds policy of forcibly returning refugees to Haiti THE US Supreme Court yesterday upheld the policy of successive US administrations authorising the forcible return of would-be refugees from Haiti intercepted on the high seas. Justice John Paul Stevens, for the 8:1 court majority, said the policy did not violate US immigration policy or any international treaty. Justice Harry Blackmun, the sole dissenter, argued that the law was clear - 'vulnerable refugees shall not be returned.' The court ruling ends one phase of the controversy over Haitian refugees. President Bill Clinton came to office promising to reverse the exclusionary policies of his predecessor, but changed his mind, citing the same humanitarian reasons as had President George Bush - specifically the risk that many Haitians in unseaworthy vessels would be lost at sea. An estimated 37,000 Haitians have sought asylum in the US. However, two weeks ago, the Clinton administration softened its approach and decided not to challenge a lower federal court order that about 150 Haitians infected with the Aids virus be released from the US naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, and be allowed into the US pending processing of asylum applications. Simultaneously, the US has supported international mediation designed to restore democracy to Haiti following the military overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. Further sanctions against the military regime in Port-au-Prince, including an oil embargo, may be enacted by the UN this week. To some degree, the case of Haiti has been superseded by concerns over a new wave of illegal immigration from China. Last Friday, Mr Clinton, appointed an expert in the field, Ms Doris Meissner, commissioner of the much criticised Immigration and Naturalisation Service, and promised new initiatives to halt the smuggling into the US of illegal aliens. These will be aimed partly at the criminal syndicates apparently responsible for shipping poor Chinese to the US. They will also include speedier handling of asylum cases and possibly the detention of suspected illegal immigrants pending resolution of their cases.</p>

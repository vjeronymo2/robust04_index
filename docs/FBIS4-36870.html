			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ehud Ya'ari] </F>   [Excerpts] Before leaving Morocco this evening, PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said that he needed $120 million before  the end of the year. In addition, he needed another $30 million  per month for salaries and to cover other routine expenses.  This sum is greater than the amount officials have been  attempting to collect, and 'Arafat said that his arrival in  Jericho was tied to receiving the aforementioned funds. Our  Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari reports:    Notables in the territories are pressuring 'Arafat to hasten  his arrival after they received hints that the PLO leader may  postpone his arrival until next month. Following 'Arafat's  talks with Morocco's King Hassan II, the Moroccans also received  the impression that the PLO leader may decide to take his time.  [passage omitted]    One of the reasons for the concern in the territories over  any delay is the discernible trend toward the undeclared  establishment of a quasi-military regime in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho. 'Arafat considered declaring a state of emergency upon  his arrival but was apparently persuaded to relent.  Nevertheless, prominent officials in the territories fear a  concentration of power, including the handling of civilian  issues, in the hands of Palestinian army officers.    There is no shortage of examples: a major was appointed head  of the education bureau; a lieutenant colonel was placed in  charge of the mayor of Jericho; the commander of the Gaza Strip  ordered mayor-designate Mansur al-Shawwa to appoint technocrats  to the municipal council while ignoring political and  coalitional considerations. There was a large police presence at  the matriculation exams. Anyone stealing electricity can find  himself facing a military decree. So can squatters on state  land, corrupt land registration clerks, and owners of heavy  machinery. The notables fear that the officer cadres will seize  all the real political power and many Palestinians are  protesting this, both within the Fatah organization, which has  begun distributing membership cards to its activists in several  locations, and also among the candidates for positions in the  Palestinian Authority, which 'Arafat this evening called the  government. So far, there are only 18 such candidates after  Hanan 'Ashrawi and Sari Nusaybah eschewed their appointments.    On 'Arafat's instructions, the officers are doing their best  to allay any concern and are personally participating in rallies  in support of democracy and elections. They also promise to  double the number of government employees to 40,000. There are  complaints that the army is commandeering every vacant building,  and even appointed ministers of the Palestinian Authority cannot  find room for their offices.    As far as Israel is concerned, cooperation on security  affairs is satisfactory. There has been a drop in the number of  terrorist attacks although there have been delays in  implementing the new arrangements on the Allenby Bridge and at  the checkpoints from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    The Palestinian army has also adopted a reasonably tough  line  against Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which mocked it in  public, claiming that its soldiers were scavenging for food  instead of carrying out their duties. However, no weapons have  been confiscated so far nor has the dissemination of propaganda  in the mosques been prohibited. That is why despite the  requests by Israeli officials, many Palestinian policemen are  still walking around with loaded rifles, although they have yet  to test their prowess.</p>

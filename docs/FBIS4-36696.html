			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat continues his normal  political activities, questions continue to be asked about his  state of health, especially after the reports that he suffered  symptoms similar to myocardial infarction [al-dhabhah  al-qalbiyah] symptoms.    Sources close to the Palestinian president say that 'Arafat  was recently fitted with a medical device that puts him under 24  observation. The sources say that the device's task is to warn  early of any sudden health condition 30 minutes before it  occurs. All 'Arafat has to do then is quickly call his private  physician to supervise his condition.    The sources say that the device, which has been fitted in  the  Palestinian president's rib cage, is sensitive, effective, and  reliable.    Dr. Ashraf al-Kurdi, who has supervised 'Arafat's health  since the surgical operation he underwent in al-Husayn Medical  Center in Amman, stressed that Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] health  is excellent and that he has suffered no heart troubles at all.  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Dr. al-Kurdi said that  Abu-'Ammar's admission to the military hospital in Tunis nearly  two weeks ago was due to a high temperature, a common cold, and  a minor headache.    Dr. al-Kurdi, a prominent neurosurgeon in Jordan and the  Middle East, denied that Abu-'Ammar suffered any symptoms as a  result of the head surgery he carried out two years ago. He  said that that has finished and that that condition was a page  which has been turned forever. According to Dr. Ashraf  al-Kurdi, Abu-'Ammar's [blood] pressure is more than good for a  man in his situation and of his age. He pointed out that the  enormous pressures the Palestinian president is under and the  instability he is experiencing always expose him to exhaustion  -- which causes him to stay in bed even when suffering a common  cold.

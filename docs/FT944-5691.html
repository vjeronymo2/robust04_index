			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Parcelforce to axe 1,000 jobs after losing 8% of business The Post Office yesterday announced that 1,000 temporary jobs are to go at Parcelforce early next year after the loss of a 50-year-old major contract with Readers Digest magazine to White Arrow Express, part of the Great Universal home shopping group. The contract accounted for 8 per cent of Parcelforce's entire business operations. The Post Office also announced sweeping changes in working practices to return the Parcelforce business to profitability and improve the efficiency of its 13,000 full-time staff. Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, blamed two and a half years' uncertainty about the corporation's future for the job cuts. Parcelforce lost Pounds 19m in the last financial year, its fourth consecutive loss. He said last night: 'This has resulted in Parcelforce's inability to invest in its infrastructure at the same pace as our competitors which have been able to exploit commercial freedoms we do not have.' Mr Kevin Williams, Parcelforce managing director said the business had to 'move very quickly back on the road to profitability'. This will require a huge improvement in efficiency and productivity. Details have not yet been provided of what it will mean to the staff. Parcelforce stressed last night it would not mean compulsory redundancies among its full-time employees as long as they co-operated fully with the proposed streamlining of operations but it did not rule out voluntary reductions in the size of the workforce. Mr Williams said there were 'already some encouraging signs' with a rise in efficiency levels and contract gains worth Pounds 12.5m including the distribution of national lottery stationery. Mr Alan Johnson, UCW communications union general secretary said that the business would 'fight back and be successful'. He made clear the union would oppose compulsory redundancies in the Post Office. He said: 'The losses can be managed by reducing casual and agency staff.' The staff would 'contribute to the success' of returning Parcelforce to viability by 'continuing to provide a parcels service that delivers at a uniform rate anywhere in the UK  -a commitment no private carrier would ever be able to fulfil'. Mr Johnson said the government could help to ensure the business flourished by granting the Post Office greater commercial freedom in the public sector.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Israelis attack bases in Lebanon Israeli helicopter gunships attacked two Palestinian bases in Lebanon yesterday, while further shooting erupted in the occupied Gaza strip, writes Our Foreign Staff. Two helicopters fired missiles at bases of two radical Damascus-based Palestinian groups at a refugee camp near Sidon, wounding three people. It was the fifth Israeli air raid over south Lebanon since the Israeli-Palestinian accord was signed in September. Palestinians in Gaza said Israeli troops shot dead an activist from the PLO's Fatah faction in a gunfight. In a separate incident the Israeli army said one of its soldiers was wounded when shots were fired at an army post in Gaza City. The violence came as Israeli ministers played down talk of a crisis in talks with the PLO on the planned self-rule for Gaza and the Jericho area of the West Bank.</p>

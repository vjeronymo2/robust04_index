			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Major and Baker adopt stands in Conservative party split MR John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday again defended the Maastricht Treaty and called for a clear Yes in the French referendum, as one of his former cabinet colleagues, Mr Kenneth Baker, entered the UK Conservative party row over Europe with an endorsement of a No vote. 'I think it is in our interest that that answer is Yes. I think it is even more in our interest if it is a resounding Yes,' Mr Major said during a political visit to Wales. 'That would be the best outcome of that referendum from the point of view of Europe as a whole and from the point of view of the United Kingdom,' he told the Liverpool Daily Post. Despite his call for the French to approve Maastricht, he admitted that the treaty had defects. 'Everybody has a belief that it is the right way forward but not everybody likes every single part of the treaty.' By contrast, Mr Baker wrote in the Daily Express yesterday: 'The best message for the voters of France today is: 'Courage, mes braves, votez Non'.' He argued that a No vote would not lead to a political or economic crisis, but would give Europe longer to consider what was in the agreement. Mr Baker envisaged it would still be possible to implement those parts of the treaty with which all 12 member states agreed, giving as examples greater inter-governmental co-operation over international crime and in foreign policy. Mr Baker is not the only former senior Conservative minister to express opposition to the Maastricht agreement, but he is the only one still in the House of Commons, having left the cabinet only at the general election in April. His intervention comes just a day after Lady Thatcher renewed her criticism of Mr Major's approach to Europe.</p>

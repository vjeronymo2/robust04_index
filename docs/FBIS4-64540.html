			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 3, IRNA -- The visiting Iranian Deputy  Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi discussed Tehran-Ankara ties,  regional cooperation and international developments in his  separate meetings with Turkish officials Monday [2 May].    In a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin  Monday, the two sides reviewed developments in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Azerbaijan-Armenian dispute.    Praising Turkey for its activities in connection with the  Bosnian plight, Hashemi termed as insufficient U.N. measures in  Bosnia and called for further cooperation among members of the  Islamic Confence Organization (ICO).    Hashemi who arrived here Monday also called for  Tehran-Ankara  cooperation in Central Asia within the framework of Economic  Cooperation Organisiton (ECO).

In another meeting with Turkish Interior Minister Nahit  Mentese the same day, Hashemi stressed that presence of alien  forces in the region was detrimental to regional security and  stressed that regional security should be maintained by regional  governments.    In an interview with reporters here after the meeting,  Hashemi said that in his talks with Mentese, mutual cooperation  especially in the areas of security and border issues were  discussed.    Stressing that regional governments are duty-bound to  preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq, he said that foreign  governments by raising the Kurdish plight have managed to sow  discord in the region.    On the presence of multinational forces known as `Poised  Hammer' in Turkey, he said that Iran had declared its opposition  to the occupation of Kuwait and the presence of alien forces in  the region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    Meanwhile, Hashemi and his counterpart Ozdem Sanbarg held  the  first round of their talks Monday and discussed mutual ties as  well as regional and international developments including those  in Iraq, Republic of Azerbaijan, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

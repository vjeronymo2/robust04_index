			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Demand in developing markets assists Molins Good demand for cigarette making machinery from China and other developing markets helped Molins, the tobacco and packaging group, to increase profits for 1993. Pre-tax profits were 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 20.4m, compared with Pounds 18.3m on turnover 12 per cent higher at Pounds 203.5m (Pounds 181m). Tobacco machinery turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 127.8m (Pounds 111m) for operating profits of Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 18.6m), up 10 per cent. Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director, said the division's operating margins were down by 1 point to 16 per cent, reflecting lower demand for spares from Brazil and the US, where sales were hit by a cigarette price war. However, the volume of new machines sold and margins improved. Mr Greenwood cited the good progress of the group's Passim machinery side. The packaging machinery division, based in the US, improved turnover by 18 per cent to Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 63.8m), but operating profits were down from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.7m. Mr Greenwood said margins had been hit by heavy discounting in both the US and Europe. In addition to packaging, Molins is seeking to diversify into food processing and packaging machinery, and has won its first order, worth Pounds 5m. This was 'tangible evidence that the group is taking its knowledge and applying it to a wider customer base,' said Mr Greenwood. The group ended the year ungeared, with net cash of Pounds 3.5m, compared with gearing of 10.3 per cent and net debt of Pounds 14.7m at the end of 1992. The pre-tax profits were also helped by a Pounds 3.3m net pension credit (Pounds 3.4m) and a fall in interest payments from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2m. Earnings per share were up from 41.9p to 49.7p. A final dividend of 10.5p (9.5p) is proposed, taking the total for the year to 15.4p (14p). COMMENT Tobacco machinery remains the driving force behind Molins, which might account for the modest rating of the stock. The group is looking for sensible ways to spread its expertise in handling delicate materials at high speed. It is being very secretive about its first order for food processing machinery, but it looks like a step in the right direction. With a strong balance sheet, the group is well-placed to take advantage of any acquisition opportunities. If it grows earnings by a further 10 per cent this year, the prospective p/e is an attractive 10. But given the group's exposure to China, it is worth keeping an eye on the Hong Kong political situation.</p>

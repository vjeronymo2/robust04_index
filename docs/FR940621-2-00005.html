			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The construction and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may (1) affect soil productivity by increasing soil compaction and erosion; (2) affect geologic resources (karst areas, Peters, Lewis, Potts Mountains, Arnolds Knob) and unique geologic features like caves through blasting, earthmoving or construction machinery operations; and (3) result in unstable structural conditions due to the placement of the towers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may (1) degrade surface and ground water quality due to the application of herbicides; (2) degrade surface and ground water quality because of sedimentation resulting from soil disturbance and vegetation removal; (3) reduce the quantity of ground and spring water due to the disturbance of aquifers resulting from blasting, earthmoving or construction machinery operation; and (4) adversely affect the commercial use of ground and surface waters due to herbicide contamination and sedimentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may affect existing cultural resources, and historic structures and districts through the direct effects of the construction and maintenance activities and by changing the existing resource setting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may adversely affect human health through (1) direct and indirect exposure to herbicides and (2) exposure to electromagnetic fields in induced voltage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction of the 765kV transmission line may adversely affect the safety of those operating aircraft at low altitudes or from airports located near the transmission line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The operation of the 765kV transmission line may (1) adversely affect communication by introducing a source of interference; (2) increase noise levels for those in close proximity to the line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may (1) adversely affect trails (including the Appalachian Trail) and trail facilities by facilitating vehicle access through new road construction and the upgrading of existing roads; and (2) reduce hiker safety by facilitating vehicle access to remote trail locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may affect hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, boating and birding opportunities and experiences because (1) the setting in which these pursuits take place may be altered; and (2) the noise associated with the operation of the line may detract from the backcountry or recreation experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction and operation of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may affect local communities by (1) reducing the value of private lands adjacent to the line; (2) decreasing tax revenues due to the reductions in land value; and (3) influencing economic growth, industry siting, and employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may (1) conflict with management direction contained in resource management plans and designations; (2) affect the uses that presently occur on and adjacent to the proposed right-of-way; (3) affect the wild, scenic and/or recreational qualities of the New River; (4) affect sensitive land uses like schools, churches, and community facilities; (5) affect the cultural attachment residents feel toward Peters Mountain; and (6) affect the scenic and/or recreational qualities of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail (Appalachian Trail).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may adversely affect the visual attributes of the area because the line, the associated right-of-way, and access roads may (1) alter the existing landscape; and (2) conflict with the standards established for scenic designations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may affect wildlife, plant and aquatic populations, habitat and livestock because (1) habitat are created, changed or eliminated; (2) herbicides are used and herbicides may be toxic; (3) the transmission line presents a flight hazard to birds; (4) electromagnetic fields and induced voltage may be injurious. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following permits and/or licenses would be required to implement the proposed action: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

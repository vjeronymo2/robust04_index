			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BRODERICK JUDGE WANTS TV VIEWERS TO HEAR NO EVIL, BUT  STATIONS SEE RED  </P> <P> An unusual ruling by the judge in Betty Broderick's preliminary hearing has  left San Diego's three major television stations sputtering.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. ruled that the stations could tape the  prelim but could not broadcast the audio of any testimony without his approval.  </P> <P> Thus, when Broderick's boyfriend, Bradley T. Wright, testified that Broderick  admitted to the rage killing of her ex-husband and his new wife, television  viewers could see Wright but not hear him. Reporters had to summarize his  testimony in a "voice-over."  </P> <P> Amos explained that he wanted to avoid the kind of dramatic sound-bites that  could prejudice potential jurors in the highly publicized case.  </P> <P> "This is an emotion-packed proceeding in which statements by some witnesses  could have a substantial impact on the jury pool," Amos said.  </P> <P> Amos said his ruling did nothing to hinder media coverage, noting that he  allowed television and newspaper reporters to tape the proceedings to ensure  the accuracy of their quotes.  </P> <P> "I still think you can have a full and complete account of the court (session)  without broadcasting certain statements that could be prejudicial," he said.  </P> <P> Channel 10 anchor Michael Tuck, in a Monday night Perspective, accused Amos of  trying to "muzzle reporters and deny your right to know what was happening in  his courtroom."  </P> <P> Marilyn Huff, a San Diego attorney representing channels 8, 10 and 39, hopes to  get an order from the 4th District Court of Appeal overturning Amos.  </P> <P> The stations want to use the Broderick audio tape in continuing coverage and  also to prevent the "Amos rule" from being followed by other judges in other  cases. Huff says Amos is trying to exercise an illegal prior restraint by  requiring the stations to seek his permission before using their audio tapes.  </P> <P> Stay tuned.  </P> <P> There will be film at 11. Whether there will be sound will be decided by the  appeals court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bone to Pick With Councilwoman  </P> <P> The political whirl.  </P> <P> Encinitas Councilwoman Anne Omsted made a less-than-flattering offhand remark  about chiropractors at a recent council meeting,  </P> <P> Presto, the Sacramento-based California Chiropractic Assn. sent her a scolding  letter and a packet of information explaining that chiropractors are the  backbone of the health care system.  </P> <P> A San Diego City Council committee this morning will vote whether to recommend  a ban on the sale of cheap wine in several mid-city neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Last time, Councilman John Hartley, who has political supporters among liquor  store and grocery owners, bottled up the measure.  </P> <P> Now there are thought to be enough votes to send it to the full council for  approval.  </P> <P> The council Tuesday rejected a neighborhood appeal that would have blocked a  seven-unit low-income development in Encanto sponsored by Habitat for Humanity.  </P> <P> That's the housing project favored by former President Jimmy Carter, who will  be here in June to pound nails.  </P> <P> A number of people attending a Catholic retreat last weekend in Imperial Beach  were annoyed when Bud Brooks, a Democratic candidate in the 78th Assembly  District, used the occasion to ask for votes.  </P> <P> Brooks was one of 14 persons invited to speak to the three-day retreat that  attracted about 70 Catholics to discuss matters of faith.  </P> <P> Brooks, a county probation officer and Operation Rescue member, won't discuss  what happened, except to say, "Spirituality is a private concern."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wheeeeeeee! the People  </P> <P> Voice of the people.  </P> <P> Marines at Camp Pendleton have adopted a pup, a mix of Rottweiler and German  shepherd.  </P> <P> He's got his own camouflage fatigues and, naturally, a dog tag.  </P> <P> That 1986 black Cadillac with the Jack Drown for Sheriff bumper sticker? It  belongs to Linda Duffy, wife of Sheriff John.  </P> <P> Headline in the (Fallbrook) Enterprise: "County hears strong opposition."  </P> <P> About time.  </P></p>

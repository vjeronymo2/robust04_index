			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PITTSBURGH MAYOR VETOES BAN ON CIGARETTE MACHINES  </P> <P> Mayor Sophie Masloff, concerned about possible legal challenges, on Friday  vetoed legislation that would have banned cigarette vending machines in most  public places.  </P> <P> Instead, Masloff proposed legislation to make such machines operable only with  tokens purchased by adults.  </P> <P> "Without fairly balancing the needs of owners of publicly used commercial  establishments with the need to protect the health of our children, this bill  could only be implemented after serious delays," the mayor said in a letter to  the council urging it to sustain her veto.  </P> <P> The City Council approved the vending machine ban, 7 to 1, last week. Its  intent was to stop minors from being able to purchase cigarettes. The measure  faced almost certain legal action from tobacco lobbying groups, vending  companies and retailers.  </P> <P> Some officials said the ban would hurt smaller grocery operations and possibly  lead to an increased number of cigarette thefts from such stores.  </P> <P> Masloff's legislation calls for modification of all cigarette vending machines  to accept tokens and not currency. The only exception, as was the case in the  vetoed legislation, would be in establishments licensed by the Pennsylvania  Liquor Control Board, private clubs or work places not accessible to the  general public.  </P></p>

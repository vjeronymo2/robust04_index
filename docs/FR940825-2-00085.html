The following described lands under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management are designated as open, limited, or closed to motorized vehicle use pursuant to the provisions of 43 CFR 8342.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Affected by the designation are 146,232 acres, which includes all public lands in the Garnet Resource Area. The lands are managed under the Garnet Resource Management Plan dated January 10, 1986. They are located in Missoula, Granite, and Powell counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These designations are revisions to Federal Register notice dated Tuesday, September 23, 1986, Vol. 51, No. 189, Wednesday, October 29, 1986, Vol. 51, No. 209, and Monday, September 16, 1991, Vol. 56, No. 179.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These revisions are necessary to more efficiently manage vehicle use on public lands, to implement decisions in the Garnet Resource Management Plan and to coordinate vehicle travel management with adjoining intermingled private and public lands. Comments received during public open houses and written responses as part of the Garnet Resource Management Plan process influenced these designations. This designation order supersedes all other off-road vehicle travel designations. These designations are published as final, effective immediately, and will remain in effect until rescinded or modified by the authorized officer. Under 43 CFR 4.21, an appeal may be filed with the Interior Board of Land Appeals within 30 days of publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Limited Designation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Areas which are designated limited comprise approximately 85,775 acres. Limited designation was determined appropriate to protect the resources of the public lands, promote the safety of all users of the public lands, and to minimize conflicts among various users. The following tables identify the type of restriction on motorized vehicle travel, the specific area(s) where the restriction occurs, the affected acreage area, and a brief rationale for each affected area. The specific areas and roads on which motorized vehicles activities are limited are shown on the Garnet Resource Area Travel Plan Map. Copies of the updated Travel Plan Map will be available at the BLM offices in butte and Missoula about mid-August 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motor vehicle travel by wheeled vehicles on all other public land in the Garnet Resource Area not included in the following tables or designated as closed is limited to existing roads and trails. The acreage on which travel is permissible year-round but is limited to existing roads and trails totals about 60,457 acres. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

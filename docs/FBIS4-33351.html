			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emilio Lomas] </F>   [Text] Cuautlancingo, Puebla, 2 Jun -- President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari has said that the North American Free Trade  Agreement has clearly established the so-called "place-of-origin  regulations," and, as a result, Mexico has not become a  springboard for the reexport of goods produced by other nations.    At the inauguration of the El Vocho Industrial Park in San  Lorenzo Almecatla, the chief executive added that this agreement  will considerably decrease the outflow of workers from Mexico to  the United States and Canada. Workers will no longer have to  migrate to places that offer employment, because new  opportunities are opening up in the country, Salinas said.    On the second day of a tour focusing on the electricity  issue, the president added that foreign investment in this  industrial zone during the first four months of 1994 was higher  than in 1992 and 1993: "This means more jobs and greater  possibilities of competing in the industrial area in other  markets."    He inaugurated the San Lazaro Almecatla Power Substation and  symbolically inaugurated five other substations and five  transmission lines. The president of the Republic said that in  the past six years the electric sector increased its production  capacity by more than 35 percent.    In the company of Emilio Lozoya Thalmann, secretary of  energy, mines, and parastatal industry; Carlos Rojas, secretary  of social development; and Guillermo Guerrero Villalobos,  director of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), Salinas  added that during his administration 21 million new Mexicans  have received electric services and that 10 rural communities  are being incorporated into the system each day. He said that  without sufficient electric energy the country would not have  been able to establish such bases for additional economic growth  "as the ones that we can now expect to have in Mexico."    Eduardo Arreola Valdes, CFE deputy director for programming,  said that 5,763 km of high-tension transmission lines have been  put into service and that 53 power substation have been built  during the 1989-1994 period. This, he added, represents  increases of 20.7 and 25.9 percent, respectively, compared to  the facilities that existed at the start of this six-year term.    President Salinas also inaugurated the President Plutarco  Elias Calles thermoelectric plant in La Union, Guerrero State.  There he said that 95 percent of Mexicans have electric energy.  He pointed out that this thermoelectric plant is the largest of  its kind in Latin America.    He said that 7.5 billion new pesos were invested in this  plant, which will use fuel or coal, depending on the best  operational conditions. Salinas added that once the  construction of this plant, which was started during this  six-year term, is concluded, it will contribute to the national  electric system more than 10 percent of the country's total  capacity.    Secretary Emilio Lozoya Thalmann said during this ceremony  that production capacity increased by 8,306 megawatts during the  1989-1994 period, from 23,554 to 31,860 megawatts, that is, a 35  percent increase. In addition, works that were started during  this period will add 3,766 megawatts and will be operational  between 1995 and 1997.    Lozoya added that recent estimates indicate that about 8,000  megawatts need to be added to the current electric production  generation capacity within the next 11 years. This, he said,  requires significant financing that calls for private  involvement in the production of electric energy without  implying that the state will abandon its constitutional  responsibility for providing this public service.</p>

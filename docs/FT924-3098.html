			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (12): Protectionism rules in the provinces  -Theresa Byrne on doing business in Canada CANADIANS still talk about the incident in Aylmer, Quebec, in the mid-1980s. A long muddy trench lay beside a road where workers had installed and then demolished a new brick pavement. There was nothing wrong with the sidewalk. But in Quebec, pavement materials must be made in Quebec - and the bricks for this pavement had come from Ontario. The contractor was forced to rip up and replace the offending stones. The Aylmer story is still cited to illustrate the absurdities of doing business in Canada. At a time when barriers to international trade are being dismantled, Canadian industry continues to struggle with a plethora of inter-provincial trade barriers. Even the federal government fought unsuccessfully earlier this year to include a ban on provincial trade barriers in the constitutional reform package. 'What you're really talking about is how governments use their power,' said Mr Robert Knox, director general of policy services in the department of industry, science and technology. The provinces are barred from imposing customs tariffs under Section 121 of the Constitution Act 1867, which says: 'All articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall . . . be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.' But non-tariff barriers have proliferated over the years. In a 1991 study, the Canadian Manufacturers' Association (CMA) lists a succession of barriers which hamper the free movement of goods, services and people. For example, a manufacturer of diesel buses was awarded a contract to supply vehicles to a Quebec municipality, but only on condition that the Ontario production facilities be moved to Quebec. This duly happened, displacing several hundred Ontario workers. Other obstacles to trade among the 10 provinces and two territories include provincial marketing boards, different licensing requirements for lawyers and doctors, and subsidies to attract investment. The CMA estimated the provinces have erected about 500 such barriers at a cost to the economy of more than CDollars 6bn a year. The CMA called for a progressive elimination of the barriers by 1993, but now accepts that the process will take much longer. 'Lack of political will, based on people maintaining a very parochial and short-sighted attitude,' has hindered progress, says Mr Stephen Van Houten, the association's president. Business leaders acknowledge that liberalising trade would result in plant closures and lost jobs in the short term. But they are confident that it would have substantial long-term benefits. The issue of inter-provincial barriers has been tackled on and off since a Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations noted in 1940 that 'it is probable that there is no single province so situated as to gain on balance by the existence of local protectionism in Canada'. A more recent thrust began in 1987, with the formation of a committee of federal and provincial ministers on internal trade. It was charged with identifying barriers, and working with industry to reduce and remove them through negotiation and mediation. Initially, it set out to tackle three areas: government procurement, liquor marketing and transport regulation. A little progress has been made. In November 1991, all governments approved an agreement on government procurement which will eliminate preferential treatment on most purchases of more than CDollars 25,000. The new system, which is to be phased in by 1996, does not cover services or construction, nor does it include purchases for crown corporations, municipalities, schools and hospitals. An agreement on beer was implemented earlier this year. Under the old rules, brewers could normally sell their beer only in provinces where it was brewed. In November 1992, agriculture ministers agreed to eliminate technical rules, such as different meat and vegetable grading standards. So many regulations are involved that eliminating them could take up to five years. Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have agreed among themselves to allow companies from all four provinces to bid on most government contracts in the region. On a national level, the current priority is to bring down procurement barriers in services and construction. But the provinces are now taking a different approach. Instead of trying to eliminate one barrier at a time, they are now devising a common set of standards and principles to which all provinces would adhere. In the meantime, Mr Van Houten plans to continue lobbying against the patchwork of barriers that remain. 'Hope springs eternal,' he says.</p>

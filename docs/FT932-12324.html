			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Red carpet down under for Japan: Keating to press Asian credentials MR KIICHI Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, arrives in Canberra today certain of a warm welcome from Australia's Labor government, which is emerging as one of Tokyo's closest allies. Fresh from a lecture on trade policy in Washington, Mr Miyazawa will find Mr Paul Keating, his Australian counterpart, supportive of Japan's position and anxious to demonstrate Australia's Asian credentials. If there is a sour note, it will come from Australia's voluble armed services veterans' association, which wants Japan to apologise for its treatment of allied prisoners during the second world war. Mr Miyazawa is unlikely to oblige. But he may collect a further endorsement from Mr Keating for Japan's hesitant expansion of its international role to a level more in keeping with its economic strength. The ostensible purpose of the visit is to allow Mr Miyazawa to solicit Australian opinions on 'regional concerns' to be raised at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations in Tokyo in July. These are likely to include Cambodia, where United Nations-sponsored elections are scheduled next month, and the regional implications of North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mr Miyazawa also wants to talk about the increasing role of the UN in solving international disputes, and the need for a security structure to solve disputes in the Asia-Pacific region. Officials on both sides say that bilateral trade frictions will play little part in the talks, suggesting that Mr Keating will resist domestic pressure to call for access to Japan's rice and legal services markets. But Australia is likely to offer support for Mr Miyazawa's rejection of President Bill Clinton's demands for managed trade to reduce Japan's USDollars 70bn (Pounds 45.4bn) trade surplus with the US. How far Mr Keating is prepared to go will depend on his assessment of the likely impact on Australian relations with Washington, which are already strained by disputes over US barriers to agricultural trade. But the tone of the talks was set on Monday by Senator Peter Cook, the trade minister, who told a Kuala Lumpur audience that Australia would be 'concerned' about the use of sectoral trade targets to redress the US deficit. 'We continue to believe that the best way of resolving this bilateral trade issue is through an early and substantial outcome to the Uruguay Round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,' he said. Canberra's support for Japan is based partly on self-interest and partly on the government's desire to overcome Asian suspicions of Aust-ralia's willingness to commit itself unreservedly to the region. Australia recorded a USDollars 5bn trade surplus on its USDollars 12.3bn exports to Japan in the 12 months to the end of March, compared with sales to the US of about USDollars 4bn. Exports to other Asian countries are worth about the same as those to Japan, and Canberra is concerned that intra-Asian trade could be disrupted if Japan and other countries were forced to buy more US exports. This analysis lay behind Mr Keating's warning to Mr Clinton earlier this year that the US would accumulate 'resentment and resistance' if it attempted to use bilateral trade agreements to discriminate against Japan. In return for support against the US, Mr Keating will seek Japanese endorsement for his attempts to beef up the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) process, a grouping of 15 countries initiated by Australia in 1989. In a recent report commissioned by the government, Mr Richard Snape, professor of economics at Monash University, said there was little prospect of transforming Apec into a trade bloc, as Mr Keating has sometimes suggested. Nevertheless, Canberra sees Apec as a potentially valuable bulwark for liberal trading, and is anxious to recruit Japanese support before a ministerial meeting in the US later this year. At a more philosophical level, relations with Japan are central to Australia's emerging view of itself as an integral part of Asia, rather than an outpost of Europe. Australian recognition of the importance of its Asian backyard has been growing since the mid-1950s, when a conservative government signed the first trade agreements with Japan. But it has gathered pace since the 1970s, when the scrapping of whites-only immigration controls coincided with entry into the European Community of the UK, the former colonial power. More recently, Mr Keating's proposal to abolish the monarchy, the last constitutional link with Britain, has been presented by the government as a further demonstration of Australia's break with its European past. How seriously Tokyo takes Canberra's Asian aspirations is not clear. But Mr Kazuo Ogura, director general of the Foreign Ministry's economic affairs bureau, threw a straw into the wind recently when he noted that a 'partner is needed for regional union,' and that that partner could well be Australia. 'Japan and Australia possess common values of democracy and freedom, they both support, in general, market principles and free trade,' said Mr Ogura. 'They have a very deep relationship of economic interdependence, and they possess common interests in security and political aspects. Could not Japan and Australia go further than that?' Mr Ogura asked. Mr Miyazawa will fly from Canberra to Auckland for a short meeting with Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister of New Zealand, which also runs a healthy trade surplus with Japan. Mr Bolger is unlikely to be quite as polite as Mr Keating. He faces a difficult election this year, and is under pressure to force a quick conclusion to negotiations for access to the Japanese apple market, which has been delayed by an emotional campaign by Japanese growers.</p>

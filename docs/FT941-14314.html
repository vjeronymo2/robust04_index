			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (45): Happy times for collective funds - The return of the private investor has created a new source of demand for trust shares and has enabled the discount to narrow to a 20-year low / Investment Trusts These are happy times for investment trusts, the quoted collective funds which provide an easy way for small investors to gain access to the stock market. Falling interest rates are persuading savers to find ways of investing in equities, now that the yields on shares are closer to the returns available from cash. Not only does that help share prices (and thus the asset values of trusts), it also reduces the trust sector's long-term headache - the discount. The price of shares in an investment trust is set by supply and demand, and does not necessarily correspond with the asset value of the trust. For much of the past 20 years, the shareholder registers of many trusts have been dominated by institutional investors - many of whom have, for historic reasons, wanted to sell. Since supply of shares exceeded demand, trust shares tended to trade at a discount to the asset value (eg the share price might be 90p, while assets per share are 100p). But the return of the private investor has created a new source of demand for trust shares and has enabled the discount to narrow to a 20-year low. Existing investors in trusts have therefore made a double gain. Over the five years to January 1994, the FT Investment Trust Index rose 139 per cent, while the All-Share climbed only 116 per cent over the same period. This increased demand has also enabled the sector to expand by creating new trusts. The sector had a record year for new issues in 1993, raising Pounds 1.5bn, or Pounds 2.1bn if the new Lloyd's capital trusts are excluded. Not all of this was due to private investor enthusiasm. Institutional investors are still willing to buy investment trusts if the area being invested in is one where trust managers can add value. This particularly applies to emerging markets, where not only were new trusts launched in 1993 but existing trusts such as Templeton (23rd in the rankings) were able to raise new money. Emerging markets were very much the fashionable investment story of 1993. Managers could point to the high rates of economic growth being achieved by developing countries such as China, the financial liberalisation measures being introduced by their governments and the under-development of their stock markets. Furthermore such markets were individually so illiquid and volatile that it was easy to argue that the best investment vehicle had to be a broadly-spread collective fund. So great has been the demand for emerging markets trusts that many have traded at a premium to their asset values, indicating that demand is exceeding supply and that there is still scope for emerging markets new issues in 1994. The biggest ever investment trust issue occurred late in the year, too late to appear in these figures. But Mercury World Mining Trust, helped by the reputation of manager Julian Baring and by 1993's sudden revival of interest in gold, would leap straight into the top 10 of trusts by size. dominated by the big international generalists and in particular by Foreign &amp; Colonial, nearly 50 per cent larger than its nearest rival. F&amp;C has not only kept its reputation for good investment performance but was the first to introduce a savings scheme back in 1984, one of the measures that has helped towards the revival of private investor interest in the sector. The individual monthly sums invested via savings schemes may be small but over the years they form a constant drip-feed of demand which has helped to narrow the discount. Like some of the other international generalists, F&amp;C has not been able to gain significantly from the other substantial boost to private investor demand for trusts - the personal equity plan. Pep rules only permit a trust to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual allowance if more than 50 per cent of its portfolio is in EU equities. F&amp;C does not want its flagship trust to be hamstrung by this requirement, and so investors can only put Pounds 1,500 in Pep form into Britain's largest investment trust. (Emerging markets specialists also do not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 Pep.) F&amp;C has other trusts within its range which do qualify under the Pep rules. But some of the main beneficiaries of the Pep regime have been the UK blue chip and UK income trusts, such as TR City of London, many of which stand at asset values, or small premiums. The very recent success of investment trusts inevitably creates dangers for 1994. The sector might over-egg the pudding by making too many new issues. A sudden downturn in the stock market might cause the recent recruits among private investors to panic - and offload their holdings. Either factor would lead to a widening discount. On the other hand, the sector has cause to be optimistic. The current present low UK interest rate regime may survive for several more years, and Peps appear safe while a Conservative government is in power. If it does, we may be witnessing a historic shift of savers' incomes away from deposits and into equity funds. There could be many more years of investment trust expansion ahead.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 100 investment trusts by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Mkt Cap    Share holders   Discount/     Company                      Pounds m   funds Pounds m   premium %  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   1 Foreign &amp;

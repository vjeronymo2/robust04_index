			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Civil rights nomination places Clinton in 'lose-lose' dilemma: Lani Guinier has been left out to dry by the White House THESE cannot have been the happiest days in the life of Ms Lani Guinier. She spent most of Wednesday talking to leading newspapers and appearing on television making an articulate case for her qualifications as the new assistant attorney-general in charge of civil rights. She woke up yesterday to a united media chorus proclaiming that President Bill Clinton had concluded that her nomination would have to be withdrawn. Mr Clinton, who badly needs to win some battles, seems to have come round to the view that her nomination had put him in a 'lose-lose' position and it was merely a matter of settling on the least bad political option. Either way, his White House is again under fire for bad judgment and political mismanagement. A series of recent actions, exemplified by the recruitment to the White House of Mr David Gergen, the former adviser to Republican presidents, suggest a shift back to the political centre. But sacrificing well-known beliefs, including a very progressive record on civil rights, has an awful air of expediency about it. There is also a personal element to the controversy. Ms Guinier went to Yale Law School with the president and his wife and became quite close to Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton. They attended her small private wedding in 1986. Their general commitment to civil rights certainly matched hers, if not, as Mr Clinton insists, down to the fine print of all her writings. It is hard to argue against the proposition that Ms Guinier was left out to dry by the White House. There were plenty of early warnings in the conservative media, especially Wall Street Journal editorials, that her long academic paper trail was stirring up opposition, with accusations that she was a 'quota queen' intent on abandoning the principles of majority rule for complex proportional formulae. Comparisons were freely made between her case and that of Mr Robert Bork, the conservative academic denied a Supreme Court seat by the Senate in 1987. In both instances opponents have targeted their real or imagined radicalism and ignored their intellectual qualities. Yet the White House did not press her cause, as the Reagan administration did Mr Bork's, until the bitter end. It did not smooth her path by arranging necessary preliminary meetings with swing senators. Perhaps too conscious of the controversy surrounding the recent confirmation to the housing department of Ms Roberta Achtenberg, who is openly lesbian, it allowed Ms Guinier's critics, who scented blood, to call the tune. Mr Clinton himself came close to pulling the rug on Wednesday with the most tepid of endorsements. Yet earlier in the week, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, had typically stood solidly behind Ms Guinier as 'a superb choice'. Not for the first time, communications between the White House and Justice Department seemed lacking. Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of a finely divided judiciary committee, is known to have been worried that another black woman would be subject to the sort of public trial visited on Professor Anita Hill in the hearings on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. But Ms Guinier insisted on Wednesday that, like Mr Bork, she at least should be given the congressional forum to explain herself. She maintained, with some force, that the often dense and theoretical nature of academic writing was no foolproof guide to the practical implementation of the laws of the land, with which, as a past legal counsel to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), she also had considerable familiarity. But the painful choice for Mr Clinton has come down to this: to abandon Ms Guinier, offending his liberal political supporters and fostering the impression that he backs down in the heat of battle, but hoping that Ms Guinier, like Ms Zoe Baird, the first attorney-general nominee, is quickly forgotten; or to stick with her, as a friend whose views on civil rights are not far from his own, but thus risk a bruising public debate at precisely the time he needs to focus on winning the backing of the centre for an acceptable budget package.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): An acquisitive animal faces City unease - BTR Why have shares in BTR underperformed the market by about 20 per cent since last August? That question is likely to be exercising the executives of one of Britain's biggest and most successful international manufacturing companies as they prepare to present the group's 1993 results on Thursday. BTR unsettled the market by warning in September that the outlook remained uncertain for economic recovery in the second half. Analysts duly trimmed their forecasts and the current expectation is for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.23bn, compared with Pounds 1.06bn. But Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, will also want to dispel some of the less tangible unease that has been expressed about BTR. This has cited everything from executive departures to Mr Jackson's sale in January of half of his shares in the company. A more long-standing issue is the extent of BTR's reliance on acquisition accounting. This concern was revived recently by the analyst Mr Terry Smith whose book, Accounting for Growth, has enjoyed considerable success. BTR has used up nearly all the provisions set up when buying Hawker Siddeley, the aerospace and engineering group, for Pounds 1.5bn in 1991. Analysts will ask what provisions have been created for Rexnord, the US manufacturer bought for Dollars 820m (Pounds 560m) in December. Some who felt BTR might have overpaid for Rexnord will also be scrutinising its likely contribution to profits. The Rexnord deal pushed gearing above 90 per cent, but the debt level is being reduced by such cash-raising deals as this month's Pounds 200m flotation of Graham Group, the builders merchants. The group has hit rougher patches with the City than this. Perhaps Mr Jackson's main task is to reassure shareholders that economic upturn will benefit BTR as well as more obvious recovery stocks.</p>

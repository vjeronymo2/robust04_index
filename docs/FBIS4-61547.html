			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 7 May -- Vagan Avakyan, former first deputy  chief adviser on security issues to the Armenian president, was  arrested in Moscow's Sheremetevo airport on Friday [6 May]. He  was in Bulgaria, where he gave a number of interviews and made a  number of statements sharply criticizing the Armenian  leadership. The Armenian authorities had earlier sanctioned the  arrest of the former high-ranking official, and he was put on  the "wanted" list. According to information that is as yet  unconfirmed, Avakyan was expelled by the Bulgarian authorities  at the request of the Armenian side and was arrested on arrival  in Moscow by staff of the State National Security Directorate of  Armenia. It was announced here that he was taken to Yerevan on  Friday evening.    Avakyan is charged with attempting to take state secrets out  of Armenia. His spouse, who was taking six computer discs  containing secret information to her husband, was detained at  Yerevan airport in February. The investigation that is under  way is to determine what Avakyan's aim was in gathering,  storing, and attempting to take out secret material with the  help of his wife, and also to what country and to what services  he intended to hand the information over to and who his  accomplices are, the leadership of Armenia's security department  reported in March.    Avakyan used to be the first deputy to Ashot Manucharyan  [presidential adviser on national security], one of the members  of the Karabakh committee who was sharply critical of Levon  Ter-Petrosyan and his administration's political course when he  left the entourage of the Armenian president. In reply to this  criticism, Armenian Internal Affairs Minister Vanik Siradegyan,  another member of the Karabakh committee, publicly accused  Manucharyan of supporting criminal elements and mafia  structures. The minister named Avakyan among those who enjoyed  Manucharyan's protection. According to the internal affairs  minister, Avakyan is involved in taking abroad and spending  large sums of hard currency intended for aid to Nagornyy  Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh].</p>

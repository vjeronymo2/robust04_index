"They  come for drinks, to see the ring girls and to see two guys brawling."  </P> <P> Wednesday's five-bout card will be headed by Esias Zumudio, the North American  Boxing Federation world flyweight champion, who will face an opponent as yet  unnamed.  </P> <P> Tickets are $20 for general admission, $40 for VIP seats and $75 for ringside.

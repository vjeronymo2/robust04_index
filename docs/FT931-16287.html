			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Middle East reports cloud equities Wall Street US SHARE prices were mixed in a very large turnover yesterday as underlying optimism about the economy and equities was tempered by concern about developments in the Middle East, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.71 off at 3,305.16 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.18 firmer at 434.52. The Nasdaq composite, however, driven by strong demand for secondary stocks, registered an impressive gain of 7.51 at a record high of 681.85. Trading volume on the New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 295m shares. As happened earlier in the week, blue chips struggled to hold on to early gains while secondary issues, especially small company growth stocks, posted rises to add to Tuesday's solid advance. Investor sentiment about the economy remained broadly positive, if somewhat cautious ahead of tomorrow's important jobs data for December. A cloud was cast over the market, however, by reports that the US and its allies were ready to issue an ultimatum to Iraq to remove recently deployed surface-to-air missiles from the southern part of Iraq. In the light of yesterday's belligerent statements from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein investors were worried that a resumption of hostilities in the Middle East could undermine US consumer confidence temporarily and hinder recovery. Philip Morris continued to decline, weakening Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 71 7/8 in volume of 9.4m shares. Troubled early in the week by reports that cigarette taxes in New York state might be raised, the stock was hit yesterday by reports that recent sales of its Marlboro brand have been worse than expected, and by news that the Environmental Protection Agency was about to declare that 'passive' tobacco smoke is a human carcinogen - a finding that could lead to drastic new curbs on smoking in workplaces and public areas. The company countered yesterday by claiming that the EPA had ignored research findings showing that non-smokers had no cancer risk from passive smoke. Car issues remained in the spotlight as the motor show in Detroit entered its third day. Chrysler jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 in volume of 8.6m shares, aided by a Wall Street broker's earnings upgrade and reports that analysts are looking more positively at the company and its new vehicles. Chrysler said yesterday that it was considering launching a credit card. General Motors, which already has its own credit card, moved forward Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 34 and Ford edged Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 44 3/4 . Drug shares were generally weaker on worries about price controls being imposed by the Clinton administration, but Pfizer stood out, falling Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 after a California court upheld the earlier decision of a lower court to allow recipients of the company's Bjork-Shiley heart valve to sue Pfizer in the California courts over malfunctions of the valve. Canada TORONTO ended flat after heavy volume as lack of direction on Wall Street continued to restrain gains and the market traded sideways ahead of fourth-quarter financial earnings. The TSE 300 index eased 0.4 to 3,353.0 but rises led declines by 326 to 264 after turnover of 52.6m shares.</p>

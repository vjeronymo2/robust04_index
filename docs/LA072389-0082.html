			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NOAA VOLUNTEERS GET DATA, RAIN OR SHINE  </P> <P> Thousands of Americans stop their normal activities once a day, head outdoors  and officially record the weather in one of the nation's largest volunteer  programs.  </P> <P> Harry U. Gibson, 83, trudged out into Idaho's record low temperatures last  February, keeping up a tradition of never being late with his report in a  quarter-century as an observer.  </P> <P> To the south, in Red River, N.M., Robert W. Prunty is maintaining a 57-year  family effort in volunteer weather observing.  </P> <P> Nearly everyone can call themselves a weather observer, of course.  </P> <P> But 11,650 Americans do it in a regular, formal system organized by the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  </P> <P> These records, compiled over more than a century, constitute the formal climate  record of the United States and are used in both weather and climate  calculations.  </P> <P> The observers take readings of rainfall, temperature, river levels and other  information, some collecting data at 7 a.m. local time, others between 5 p.m.  and 6 p.m. local time.  </P> <P> Their information is compiled with readings taken at National Weather Service  offices and by observers around the world to constitute a global climate  network.  </P> <P> NOAA annually honors its volunteer observers, selecting five for the Thomas  Jefferson Award, named for the third President, who was an avid weather  observer.  </P> <P> In addition, other volunteers are honored with the John Campanius Holm Award,  named for the man who collected the first weather observations in Colonial  America, between 1644 and 1645 near Wilmington, Del.  </P> <P> The winners receive plaques citing their achievement.  </P> <P> The Jefferson Award winners this year are:  </P> <P>  -- Gibson, a retired farmer, until recently collected weather data in Boise  and Kuna, Ida., for some 25 years. Going beyond his call of duty, Gibson also  warned local farmers of sudden temperature drops that might threaten crops and  livestock.  </P> <P>  -- Prunty, a retired postmaster and assistant fire chief, has also distributed  daily weather reports at the local post office and prepares weather summaries  for the Sangre de Cristo Chronicle in Eagle Nest, N.M.  </P> <P>  -- William B. Gillespie Jr., of Effingham, N.C., succeeded his father as local  observer in 1946 to maintain a family tradition started in 1918. Gillespie has  battled floods to gather river stage data and hasn't missed a report in 41  years despite the pressure of also managing a general store.  </P> <P>  -- John O. Nellermoe, a former rancher in Trotters, N.D., has been a  cooperative observer for 39 years. Besides reporting on crucial aspects of soil  moisture and temperature, he also provides emergency assistance as a spotter of  severe storms.  </P> <P>  -- Henry Cordes, of Cordes, Ariz., has been a volunteer observed for 51 years  without missing an observation or turning in a late report.  </P> <P> In addition to the five volunteers receiving the Thomas Jefferson Awards, 24  were selected for the Holm Award.  </P></p>

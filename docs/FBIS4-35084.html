			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It was officially  announced today that Mexico has suspended its oil and oil  derivatives exports to Angola and oil refining and  transportation equipment to Libya thus abiding by two  resolutions issued by the United Nations. The agreements,  published in the Federation's official gazette, state that the  resolutions signed by the foreign and finance secretaries will  be implemented beginning tomorrow.    The first document states that the measure is in accordance  with 1993 UN Resolution No. 864, which applies sanctions against  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA.  The international organization's resolution bans the sale and  supply of weapons, material, oil, oil derivatives, vehicles, or  military equipment to UNITA, whether these products are produced  in the country or abroad. The agreement also states that the  ports of Luanda, Lobito, and Namibe and the Luanda, Katumbela,  Malongo, and Cabinda airports are exempted.    The second agreement also published in the official gazette  states that Mexico will abide by the 1993 UN Resolution No. 883,  which bans the supply of oil refining and oil transportation  equipment to Libya. On 11 November 1993, the UN Security  Council also decided to freeze all of Libya's financial assets  abroad, including investments, deeds, and dividends. In that  same document, the international forum agreed to leave out funds  derived from oil, natural gas, or basic farming products that  were exported after the resolution entered into effect.    It was expected that if by 1 December 1993 Libya did not  turn  over to the United States or Great Britain the people suspected  of placing a bomb in an airplane, which killed 270 persons, the  airline's worldwide offices would be closed.

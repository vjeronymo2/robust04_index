			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Leading light of the north: The bitter-sweet renaissance of Manchester Ensconced in the Victorian splendour of Manchester's town hall, Mr Richard Leese, deputy leader of the council, displays dour optimism about the city's future. 'There is a lot of reason to be gloomy, but a lot to be hopeful about too.' At the moment it is hope which predominates. The government yesterday gave its backing to the city's bid to stage the 2000 Olympics. The Arts Council has decided to award Manchester the title of City of Drama for 1994, an accolade which reinforces its claim to be Britain's foremost arts centre outside London. The award from the Arts Council puts Manchester centre stage in a series of artistic events being staged around Britain to celebrate the run-up to the millennium. The city has already put forward 150 ideas for the bonanza, culled from 80 organisations ranging from inner-city youth clubs to established companies such as Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre. Proposals include a spectacular celebration of the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Manchester ship canal. The 10-year-old Hacienda night club, a former yacht warehouse that has become a youth cult centre for Paris and Amsterdam as well as a wide swathe of England, will display hallucinatory 3D videos. The range of proposed events bears testimony to the diversity of culture to be found in Manchester, home of British repertory theatre. Audience surveys indicate that 300,000 of the 2.5m inhabitants of the Manchester conurbation attend a theatre performance at least twice a year. But it is not just in the cultural arena that Manchester is enjoying a revival. Since the early 1980s, it has started to throw off its image of dust and grime. In the city centre, the last decade has seen extensive refurbishment and development of offices, shopping malls and public buildings. The city is also attracting new investment in high technology industries and services which is offsetting long-term decline in its traditional manufacturing sectors. Computer and chemical businesses are thriving, replacing coal and steel. When ICI reorganised its management structure last year, it chose Manchester ahead of continental Europe and the US for the headquarters of its speciality chemicals division. For all the obvious chutzpah, however, there are plenty of bleak spots. A total of 16 per cent of the workforce is without a job, almost double the national average. Social problems such as poverty, racial tensions and drug abuse fester on the run-down housing estates - such as the notorious Moss Side - which surround the Mancunian core. Manchester's city government is addressing these problems with policies intended to invigorate the local economy. In a move away from the more confrontational and ideologically-motivated policies of earlier in the 1980s, the Labour council now takes a more pragmatic approach to fostering capitalism and local enterprise. Councillor Leese complains that Manchester's higher-income professional classes escape in the evenings in a flood of smart cars sweeping southwards to their homes. But he accepts that creating wealth must take priority over distributing it. Mr Simon Sperryn, the chief executive of the city's chamber of commerce, has been attempting to bring a Japanese trade centre to the city. He stresses the blow to Manchester's psyche caused first by its pre-war fall from world eminence in textiles, and then - in recent decades - by closures in engineering, steel and coal. But he says that industry has become more broadly based during the last 10 years. 'We now have a bit of everything.' As part of its effort to emphasise its confidence in the future, the city has launched a bid to become the site of the European central bank. 'People who come to work here will not have to think they're going to a wilderness,' stresses Mr David Baker, the ex-Bank of England official who is spearheading the campaign. The focal point of plans for new sports facilities to support the 2000 Olympics bid is eastern Manchester, scarred by the closure of factories and industrial plants since the 1970s. In the late 1980s, Manchester bid for the 1996 Olympics, with hardly any help from London. This time - from Mr John Major, the prime minister, downwards - 'the attitude from central government has been phenomenally positive,' says Mr Neil Fountain, head of the council's economic initiatives department. Among competitors for the 2000 Olympics prize, the most serious contender is probably Berlin, a city with which Manchester shares some intriguing features. There is the same vibrancy springing from past grandeur - and a certain frisson that stems from the extremes of rich and poor. Speaking from his residence in the north of the city - overlooking rolling meadows and the site of a disused colliery - the Bishop of Manchester gives a bitter-sweet summing up of the state of the city's soul: 'Manchester is a wonderfully vigorous and exciting part of the world to work in. But when you go to a drinks party and meet people responsible for the life of the city and ask them where they live, they say they come from the south - beyond the city boundary.'</p>

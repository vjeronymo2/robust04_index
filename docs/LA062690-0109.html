			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAROLCO BUYS JOE ESZTERHAS SCRIPT FOR RECORD $3 MILLION  </P> <P> Just nine months ago, some Hollywood insiders were predicting the career demise  of rogue screenwriter Joe Eszterhas. But for a few brief hours last Friday,  Eszterhas emerged as the hottest personality in town.  </P> <P> After an intense bidding war among at least 10 major and independent studios,  Eszterhas sold his latest screenplay, "Basic Instinct," to Carolco Pictures for  $3 million -- setting a record for so-called "spec" movie scripts.  </P> <P> Carolco plans to immediately start producing the steamy thriller about the  relationship between a policeman and a female writer-psychologist. While  Carolco is not discussing details about the movie, the list of stars Carolco  may seek out include Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner and Richard Gere for the lead,  and Michelle Pfeiffer, Julia Roberts and Melanie Griffith as the co-star. No  director has been set.  </P> <P> Eszterhas stirred up a storm in Hollywood last fall when he attacked Creative  Artists Agency President Michael Ovitz in a letter that later found its way  into the press. In that letter, Eszterhas accused Ovitz of issuing threats  after the writer said he was leaving CAA to rejoin his former agent Guy  McElwaine at International Creative Management. Ovitz vigorously denied  Eszterhas' charges.  </P> <P> While many in Hollywood sided with Eszterhas when the letter became public,  others called him suicidal for directly challenging Ovitz, considered to be one  of the most powerful figures in the business.  </P> <P> Reached at his home in Marin County Monday, Eszterhas declined comment on the  fallout from that incident. But it's clear from the bidding for "Basic  Instinct" -- engineered by McElwaine and ICM President Jeff Berg -- that the  writer can still command top fees.  </P> <P> The bidding also suggests that prices for spec scripts -- screenplays that are  completed and put out for bid rather than written under contract -- will  continue to climb.  </P> <P> In April, the Geffen Co. stunned its competitors by paying $1.75 million for a  screenplay by "Lethal Weapon" writer Shane Black. Other $1 million-plus sales  of screenplays are taking place with increasing regularity.  </P> <P> The $3 million for "Basic Instinct" is also a new high for Eszterhas, who  generally can command more than $1 million for a screenplay. In the past,  Eszterhas has written hits such as "Jagged Edge," but his most recent films --  "Betrayed" and "Music Box" -- did not fare well at the box office.  </P> <P> Eszterhas defended the inflation of prices for scripts. "I've always felt that  the script was at the heart of the movie," he said. "If you're going to pay  actors and directors (high salaries), there's nothing wrong with paying the  writer, too."  </P> <P> The writer added that he prefers to write on spec, rather than under a studio  contract. "I think you have more controls, and I loathe pitching (ideas to  studios)," he said. "If you really believe strongly in a story, sometimes you  have to write it yourself."  </P> <P> Carolco, which also agreed to pay $1 million to Irwin Winkler to produce "Basic  Instinct," is no stranger to high-priced movie-making. The company is often  viewed as one of the companies that helped bid up the price of actors. In 1987,  Carolco agreed to pay Sylvester Stallone $16 million to star in "Rambo: First  Blood Part 3," a fee that Stallone later gave up in favor of a percentage of  the film's profits.  </P> <P> More recently, Carolco paid Arnold Schwarzennegger an estimated $8 million to  star in "Total Recall."  </P> <P> Carolco officials declined comment on the bidding war for the Eszterhas script.  But Thomas Levine, the company's vice president for corporate development,  said, "We bought a great project."  </P></p>

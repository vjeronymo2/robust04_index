			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> ONE-STOP SHOPPING  </P> <P> IF GROCERY SHOPPING gets any easier, it might even become fun again. Bristol  Farms, Pasadena's gourmet market, has opened a cook store and a cooking school  next door -- and they house everything a kitchen whiz needs.  </P> <P> It makes for a natural progression from Bristol Farms, says executive chef  Claudia McQuillan. Cooks "can shop for groceries and wine in the market; at the  cooking school, they can learn how to prepare their purchases; then they can  buy the proper equipment to cook them in."  </P> <P> The cooking school, run by McQuillan, is state-of-the-art, employing such  equipment as a video monitor system (rather than the standard mirror system  generally associated with cooking instruction) for helpful close-up viewing,  and a pizza and bread oven with clay stones. There's ample room for  demonstration classes of 30 students and for participation classes of about 16.  McQuillan has lined up such luminaries in the field as Julia Child, Jim Dodge  and Amy Pressman as teachers.  </P> <P> Among the high-quality equipment Cook 'N' Things stocks -- which range from the  practical to the exotic -- is the new Circolo stainless-steel cookware from  West Germany and Castle Copper from Ireland. There's also a large selection of  gadgets, utensils, Century cast-iron cookware, coffee makers and other  electrical appliances, Peggy Karr's handmade glass plates and bowls and  tableware with fruit and vegetable themes. The book corner is packed with the  classics, the hard-to-find and the most recent cookbooks and cook-related  magazines.  </P> <P>  Bristol Farms Cook 'N' Things, 606 Fair Oaks Ave., South Pasadena; (818)  441-5588.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

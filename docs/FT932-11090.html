			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / US reviews drug sentencing policy MS Janet Reno, US attorney-general, has ordered a review of federal prosecution and sentencing policy for drug offences in a move which may head off a revolt by federal judges. Many senior judges are refusing to hear drug cases because of their objections to the sentencing rules. Judge Harold Greene, a prominent federal judge in Washington, last week rejected the minimum sentencing rules as unconstitutional. Both Ms Reno, who as state prosecutor in Miami introduced an innovative rehabilitation programme for first-time drug offenders, and Mr Lee Brown, the former New York City police chief appointed last week to head President Bill Clinton's drug control office, are expected to shift the focus of drug policy away from enforcement towards treatment and prevention. Tougher prison sentences have been the linchpin of US policy for drug offences over the last 10 years. Sentencing rules effective from 1987 require a sentence of at least five years for possession with intent to distribute 5 grams of crack cocaine. Anyone convicted of selling drugs within 1,000ft of a school must serve at least one year in prison without parole. Critics of the rules say they can lead to excessive sentences for the small fry in drug deals, and compel judges to order inappropriate prison sentences for non-violent drug users who deal to support a drug dependency and who might respond better to treatment. But others argue that tougher sentences are needed to clamp down on drugs, and that the mandatory rules make it harder for criminals to escape prison by plea bargaining. 'Mandatory minimums are based not on an unthinking reflex but on sound philosophy; effective deterrence depends both on severity and on certainty of punishment,' said Mr Bob Martinez, head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under former President George Bush. Some of the harshest critics of the mandatory sentencing rules, however, are the judges who have to administer them, and who complain that they simply do not work. 'It results in some tremendous inequities in the sentencing process, and judges are uncomfortable with that,' said a spokesman for the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal judicial system. The prison system, too, is coming under increasing pressure. Over the last 10 years the federal prison population has nearly tripled. This results almost entirely from drug offenders, who accounted for 58 per cent of federal prisoners at the end of 1991 against 26 per cent a decade earlier. Over the same period the average sentence for drug offenders convicted in federal courts rose from four to seven years, while the average sentence for violent crime fell from 10 1/2 years to 7 1/2 years. In the state system, the percentage of drug offenders in the prison population has tripled to 22 per cent.</p>

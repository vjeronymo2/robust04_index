			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Kameyama and Koichi Ohtomi] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  1. Foreword </H5>   With the increase in computer applications concerned with  three- dimensions, the necessity for a three-dimensional HI is  increasing more and more. For example, in many three-dimensional  CAD, though the functions of modeling and form presentation are  becoming complete, there are many commands and input items and  the operation is complicated. These problems will be resolved if  the technology to display the form as a three-dimensional image  and to operate as is thought is established. Also, the results  of three-dimensional physical simulation are visualized and the  use of three-dimensional images becomes more effective in the  case of constructing and displaying three-dimensional images for  medical use from ultrasonic diagnostic equipment and CT  (Computed Tomography) equipment as well.    In order to realize such a three-dimensional HI, a display  is  necessary which not only displays the three-dimensional data  simply, but also gives the sense as an object in the real world  to the user. Visually, the sense of an object is produced by the  user actively changing the viewpoint. For example, when we see  an actual object, we change our viewpoint and look at it from  various directions. In other words, for the perception of the  three-dimensional form accurately, the change in the way of  seeing following the change in viewpoint is used in addition to  the stereoscopic perception from both eyes.    In current virtual reality (VR), such a sense is  artificially  formed with the change in the display according to the movements  of the head. However, since there is always a time lag between  the head movements and the change in the display with this  method, the user easily gets motion sickness.[.sup]1[/] Also,  in order for the measurement of the head movements, it is  necessary to wear a device in the form of special goggles which  is inconvenient in practical application.    For the display of data as a three-dimensional object in a  more natural form, it is most simple to display it as a three-  dimensional image in real space. At Toshiba, a display for this  type of display system which uses the afterimage of the eye was  developed.[.sup]2[/] Called the volumetric scanning system,  this display has the following characteristics which are not  found in other display systems; it is thought to be appropriate  for various fields.    1. A natural three-dimensional sense is attained in order  for  the image to unite completely with real space.    2. The field of vision is very wide and the image can be  viewed by many people around the display.    3. Volume data can be directly displayed.    Below, an outline of the display and examples of its  applications are discussed from the perceptive of HI.  <H5>  2. Outline of the display </H5>   Figure 1 shows the principle for the volumetric scanning  display developed. While the panel of LED arranged in a matrix  form is moved up and down, sectional images of the object  corresponding to the position of the panel are displayed. When  the LED panel moves at high speeds, each image appears connected  with the effect of the afterimage in the eye and this is  perceived as a three-dimensional image. In other words, the  effect attained by moving the two-dimensional display surface is  the same as if picture elements were positioned in real space.  Moreover, the round trip movement of the LED panel is produced  by mechanical conversion of the rotary movement of a motor.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-13A>      Figure 1. Principle of three-dimensional array. </FIG>   The three-dimensional image is made by the display of cross  sectional images corresponding to the position of the LED panel  which is moving up and down.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1.

Also,  Figure 3 shows the hardware configuration of the display and  Table 1 shows a summary of the specifications.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-14A>      Figure 2. External view of displayFigure 3.

Specifications of three-dimensional display                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Display range                         |95x95x100mm                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Number of picture elements            |96x96x100                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Display frequency (Average)           |20 Hz                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Color tone                            |Red, one shade                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The two technical points here are as follows.    1. Display of clear image. The brightness of the image is  determined by the illumination time per unit time and the  properties of the LED. Here, as the display is made twice in one  round trip of the LED panel, the illumination time of each LED  is operated by the parallelization of the display processing.  Also, red high brightness type elements with high emission  strength and fast response are used as the LED.    2. Homogenization of image brightness. Since the speed of  the  LED panel is fast in the center of the display zone and slow at  the ends, the LED illumination density and time may be made  independent of the panel speed in order to homogenize the  brightness of the image. Here, while the initial display  position of each cross section is made at regular intervals with  the linear encoder, all the LEDs are controlled to illuminate at  a time with the standard being the maximum speed time of the  panel.    Moreover, so a moving picture can be displayed, an AS4000  series workstation is used for the computer and an S bus is used  for data transmission from the computer to the display memory.  Also, the display memory has a 2 bank configuration and isolates  and performs the writing of data from the computer and the  reading of data to the display section.    Meanwhile, in this display, since the image is expressed as  an assemblage of monochromatic bright points, the expression of  shading is not possible. Also, the processing of hidden surface  is not possible since all the cross sections are seen in  principle. Consequently, when it is displayed as a solid and its  interior is filled with bright points, the edges become  indefinite and only individual lumps of light can be seen. Also,  the image of the rear which originally could not be seen appears  transparent. Therefore, in the case of displaying a solid form,  only the surface or edge of the form becomes filled with bright  points.  <H5>  3. Applications of Display </H5> <H5>  3.1 Display of Form and Operation </H5>   The following two issues are considered in direct  three-dimensional form modeling.    1. The method to indicate points in space and link these  with  a line    2. The method according to a combination of the basic form    For the first method, an HI pointing to an image of points  and lines directly is desirable. However, in this display, since  the image is displayed in space where an LED panel is moving, it  cannot be directly pointed out. Therefore, with the prototype  system as shown in Figure 4, the image on the display is  transferred in three dimensions to another space with an optical  system using a concave mirror and the transferred image is  operated with a pointer. In this case, direct pointing is  performed easily since the transferred image is also a  three-dimensional real image.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-15A>      Figure 4. Image transfer using optical system. </FIG>   By using an optical system employing a concave mirror, the image on the  display is transferred to a space where it can be freely  operated.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Volume scanning display, 2. Image before  transfer, 3. Concave mirror, 4. Image after transfer, 5.  Three-dimensional pointer, 6. Viewpoint&lt;/graphic&gt;     On the other hand, for the second method, an HI in which the  desired form is prepared while the combination among forms is  confirmed is desirable. Therefore, it is necessary for the set  operations among the forms to be performed and displayed in real  time. Here, this HI is realized as the form is developed in the  form of volume data in the computer memory and this display is  used to display the results of the set operations. The set  operations in the memory are at a high speed for the quantity of  data to the extent of this display; moreover the volume data can  be directly displayed with this display. Consequently, while the  form is moved with a three-dimensional mouse, the state of this  combination can be seen as a three-dimensional real image in  real time. Figure 5 shows an example of a mechanical part  produced with this method. This can be precisely called the  ultimate three-dimensional CAD environment which directly  prepares a three-dimensional form in real space.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-15A>      Figure 5. Mechanical part modeled by set operations. </FIG>   An example of a three-dimensional form (mechanical part) made  directly in real space.   <H5>  3.2 Visualization of simulation results </H5>   The results of three-dimensional simulations usually are  shown as spatially distributed numerical data, in other words  volume data. In the case of visualizing this using prior CRT  (Image display equipment), it is necessary to project all data  in two dimensions in theory and the display processing is  difficult. On the other hand, with this display, processing such  as two-dimensional projection is unnecessary since the points in  three-dimensional space correspond directly to the display  memory as discussed above. The volume data can be directly  visualized. Also, since the image can really be observed from  various directions, it is easy to understand such data with a  high degree of geometrical abstraction.    Figure 6 shows air flow simulation results of an air  conditioner in a heated room. The outer frame of the diagram  shows the room, the small rectangle inside is the air  conditioner, the box on the floor is an obstruction and the  points are the tracers to express the flow. The position at each  time of each tracer is calculated from the speed vector in  advance and put in the form of volume data. As this volume data  is continuously transmitted and displayed to the display, the  simulation results can e displayed as a moving image.  Furthermore, the understanding of the phenomena is increased  since it is possible to change the display speed or stop at or  return to a point which one wants to observe.    Moreover, tracers are displayed in this example, but it  works  the same in the case of showing equivalent surfaces or boundary  surfaces.  <H5>  3.3 Display of three-dimensional images for medical use and </H5> operation    Three-dimensional images for medical use are basically made  by accumulating continuous sectional layered images from X-ray  CT equipment and ultrasonic diagnostic equipment. In other  words, this is volume data and can be directly displayed as a  three-dimensional image if this display is used in the same way  as in the previous section. Here, bones and organs are brought  out and isolated with the key of differences from previous CT  values; the system to combine them as necessary at the display  time was constructed.[.sup]3[/] Figure 7 is a display example  of a three-dimensional CT image of the head; the form and  position of the afflicted section can be clearly seen.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-15B>      Figure 6.

Three-dimensional brain image captured by X-CT. </FIG>  Bones and organs are brought out and isolated with previous CT  values; they are combined and displayed as necessary.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Moreover, support for surgical planning and surgical  simulation as in Figure 8 become possible by developing the  image on a computer and performing layering, removal, and  transfer as set operations in memory in real time. Figure 9  shows an example of layering the afflicted section and  hypothetical sphere in real time and measuring its size and  central position. The precision of actual surgery is expected to  be improved with this.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-16A> Figure 8.

Conclusion </H5>   A volumetric scanning three-dimensional display using an  LED,  the preparation and display of its form, and its application to  the visualization of flow analysis results and the display and  operation of three-dimensional images for medical use were  discussed.    In the future, we would like for it to be appropriate for  various areas when the display is made multicolored.  <H5>  Acknowledgements </H5>   We would like to thank Professor Isekiyo of the Tokyo  Women's  Medical College for providing the X-ray CT data for the  appropriate research for three-dimensional images for medical  use.

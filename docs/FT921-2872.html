			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Arts: Le Siege de Corinthe - Queen Elizabeth Hall The activities of the Rossini 200th anniversary year begin to unfold in London's theatres and concert halls. There may not not enough of them - for this is, after all, a composer of many little-known or even unknown works of superb quality and only a few popular favourites. But those that are scheduled (such as next month's Royal Opera revival of Guillaume Tell and QEH concert performance of the Neapolitan opera seria, Ermione) will surely aid in sharpening our vision of a composer of the first importance still shrouded in prejudiced misunderstanding. This is what anniversary celebrations always should have as their goal; and this was certainly the achievement of Sunday's Chelsea Opera Group concert performance of Le Siege de Corinthe (1826), first of the three grand operas Rossini wrote for Paris. It was an occasion of high excitement but with also the properly missionary purpose and revelatory impact. The convenient formula is that with this work 19th-century Grand Opera was launched; what is less well known is the fierce charge of dramatic urgency and vigour that it can still release when sympathetically delivered. Like Mose, the second of Rossini's Paris operas, Le Siege is a radical re-fashioning of an earlier work - in this case Maometto secondo (Naples, 1820). The Neapolitan expansiveness of invention and luxuriant vocal writing were drastically cut back; the siege itself was re-located from Negroponte to Corinth. The Paris premiere was given against the backdrop of the Greek War of Independence, and so the enthusiasm it inspired may have had a tinge of topicality; but the boldness of the opera, its opening-up of new paths and possibilities and its surging forcefulness of forward movement were the real roots of its success. Forward movement is the aim: this is a through-composed drama with only a single solo scena uninterrupted by the addition of other solo or choral voices. Not until Il trovatore would opera re-discover such rugged vitality in martial rhythms; the grandeur of Rossini's Gluckian and Beethovenian veins and, in the Act 2 choral prayer, his pre-Schumann richness of Romantic harmony are kept trimly directed toward the driving oppositions - Greek versus Turk  - of the drama, also achieved in the wonderfully apt and detailed scoring. Character is subsumed in the love-versus-duty plot; this is perhaps the backward-looking aspect of the opera, which makes it less easy to revive than Tell. My single encounter with Le Siege in the theatre - the 1982 Florence staging, a tepid, going-through-the-motions affair - underlined the point. But though the Chelsea Opera Group orchestra and chorus are peopled with amateurs, their commitment to the work proved on Sunday so infectious, and the skill of the conductor, Howard Williams, so great in reconciling formal grandeur and dramatic dynamism, that for me the experience was transformed beyond recognition. A crucial element was still lacking: the focus of solo singing both pure and powerful in tone and style. Only the tenor Justin Lavender, whose easy command of Neocles's high tessitura won him an ovation in the Act 3 scena, could really be deemed a 'possible' in his role. (If Mr Lavender could groom his tone and line still further he could become this country's much-needed Ottocento tenor.) The impassioned leading female role was confided to Eileen Hulse, a delicately musical soprano on far too small a scale. But there was a quality of no-frills honesty in the singing of Geoffrey Shovelton's Greek leader and Neil Howlett's Turk, and useful support from Louise Crane and Lawrence Richard. And as ever in Chelsea Opera Group's most notable successes, the plusses triumphantly outnumbered the minuses.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (20): The ugly bride with the big dowry - Investing in Ireland There is no escaping it. Whatever the commercial and strategic attractions of setting up shop in Northern Ireland, the many positive aspects to life in the province remain overshadowed by deeply-ingrained images of a hopelessly divided, dangerous society. Sir Patrick Mayhew, in a recent speech to businessmen, did his best to place Ulster's troubles in their correct perspective, stressing that the province was 'not running a Clint Eastwood scenario 24 hours a day'. Given recent successes in attracting new corporate investment, the message has not been falling on deaf ears. Northern Ireland inevitably has a hard job in selling itself as a business location to companies looking to move existing operations or to establish new ones; why should anyone opt for west Belfast, with its random, sectarian murders and brick and iron barriers intended to separate alien communities? Surely, life in Telford would be much easier? The media agenda dictates that Ulster usually means bad news, with the result that its problems can be distorted and exaggerated. But problems there are and they cannot, sensibly, be minimised by those seeking to attract new investment from within the UK or beyond. Business assets in the province are regularly the victims of paramilitary activity and employees are regularly subjected to intimidation; security costs can be punitive and employers face a daunting catalogue of obligations under a tough set of fair employment laws designed to eradicate discrimination in the workplace. But for most people and most sections of the business community, Ulster's tragedy rarely intrudes directly into their daily lives. The province's economy has, despite the recession, remained relatively buoyant and performed better than in the UK as a whole. Last year, for example, manufacturing output grew by double the UK average. Equally to the point, the province can provide a business base which offers newcomers, by virtue of its extraordinary difficulties, extensive financial incentives to help overcome reservations about moving into what many see as nothing less than a 'war zone'. Ulster, because of its higher-than-average UK unemployment and its 'category one' status within the EU aid hierarchy, can offer cash help that is unrivalled anywhere in Europe. No matter that one development official remarks: 'The bigger the dowry, the uglier the bride'. Cash help may not, alone, be sufficient to give Ulster the edge over alternative locations but in the final analysis, it can tip the balance. Financial aid played a big role, for example, in the recent decision of Transtec, a Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, to set up a Pounds 16m plant in Londonderry to manufacture aluminium castings for the automotive sector. The company will join a growing list of automotive suppliers who have now established operations in the province, including companies from Japan, France, the US and Germany. The new plant will, in the first instance, supply cylinder heads for shipment to Ford of Germany. Transtec already employs more than 2,000 people in 12 wholly-owned subsidiary operations, most of them in the West Midlands. According to Mr Peter Munday, chairman of the company's automotive division, the business had decided on strategic grounds to look beyond its existing casting facility in England for the new plant and had considered a number of European locations before opting for Ulster. The reasons for deciding on Londonderry, already the recipient of a significant inward flow of overseas investment, include good infrastructure, the potential for recruiting quality labour and the all-important assistance of the local industrial development board. Mr Munday added: 'The package of assistance also had to be sufficient to counter offers being made to us by other European locations. Aluminium casting is a very competitive, price-conscious business and we needed to ensure we kept our costs as low as possible. 'We could only do this by examining development areas with the highest incentives for inward investors. Although this was the major priority, it needed also to be coupled with the other plus factors which can be delivered in Northern Ireland, such as good transportation links and a factory which could be built quickly to our specifications.' The Industrial Development Board is not always too keen to discuss the details of financial assistance for specific projects but Mr John McGuckian, its chairman, disclosed that the total government aid package made available to Transtec will be about Pounds 4m. Few locations in Europe will prove as generous in offering cash help accounting for one-quarter of total start-up costs. Operational costs, once established, are also significantly lower than in Britain or in mainland Europe, a point forcefully underlined by Sir Patrick Mayhew in a recent ministerial check-list of Ulster plus-points. He claimed, however, the beneficial picture was 'not the result of sweated labour but in part from a generally lower overall cost of living in Northern Ireland'. For overseas investors, access to the markets of the European Union offers another important bonus and has been the driving factor behind location decisions taken by companies from the US and south-east Asian countries. IDB estimates suggest that around 55,000 people in Ulster are now employed by foreign owners. The total is rising steadily in the wake of a particularly successful period of IDB activity and is shortly expected to be given a huge boost with the decision by Hualon, a Taiwanese textile group, to commence the biggest inward investment project since the ill-fated De Lorean car plant. The European Commission has given clearance to a synthetic fibre project which will bring 2,000 jobs to Glengormley, close to the Belfast. At one stage, the project was thrown into doubt when European textile companies complained that it would create unfair competition, but the overriding need for jobs in the province finally won the day. The new plant is expected to cost nearly Pounds 157m and the UK government, via the IDB, will put around Pounds 60m into the kitty. With financial support on such a scale, fears about the likely impact on business of limited, civil strife quickly recede. The Hualon decision was welcomed by Mr Roy Baillie, vice-chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Ulster, not just for the badly-needed jobs it would bring but also for the strong signal it would send to other international companies looking for a route into Europe. The hope is that such decisions will not be seen merely as a positive move in the face of Ulster's problems but that, in bringing new prosperity to be shared by all parts of the community, they will help end the province's troubles.</p>

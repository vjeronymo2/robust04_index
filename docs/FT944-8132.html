			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / France proposes 'stability' fund France will use the forthcoming European Union summit at Essen to propose creation of a special fund to finance measures promoting 'good neighbourliness and stability' in eastern Europe, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said yesterday. He made the proposal in a speech opening a seminar in Paris on his plan for 'a European stability pact'. This is his main initiative in foreign policy and one which he hopes will conclude with a ministerial conference next March, in the middle of France's chairmanship of the EU and its presidential election campaign. As part of the conference on European stability which opened last May, regional discussions have been held on political tensions in the Baltics and central Europe. The aim is that countries such as Hungary and Romania should to settle their minority disputes before joining the EU, and Mr Balladur's new fund plan is to help, for instance, improve education facilities for the large Hungarian minority in Romania's Transylvania province.</p>

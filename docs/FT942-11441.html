			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (5): Playing host to foreign issuers - There has been a move to come direct to the US for capital The US capital markets have been playing host to a steadily growing number of foreign issuers. While US investment has fuelled the growth in many of the world's stock and bond markets since 1992, with pension and mutual funds in the vanguard, there has been a less noticed move by many foreign companies and governments to come direct to the US for capital. The pick-up is notable from all the barometers of market activity. The supply of new Yankee bonds, for instance - bonds sold in the US market by non-US issuers - jumped to nearly Dollars 42bn in 1993, according to figures from Securities Data. The previous record, reached the year before, had been just Dollars 27bn, and the rate of capital raising was running at an even higher rate in the first quarter of this year. Foreign companies also sold Dollars 9bn of common stock in the US last year, well above the previous high point of around Dollars 5bn, reached in 1992 and 1987. Private placements, meanwhile - which under Rule 144a are exempted from many normal disclosure requirements - jumped to Dollars 24bn, from Dollars 11bn in 1992. Each of these market indicators suggests that a growing list of issuers believes it is worth coming direct to the US for capital, rather than waiting for US capital to seek them out in other financial markets. The Yankee bond market has attracted sovereign borrowers such as Thailand, Korea, Hungary and Indonesia, each of which chose to make their first steps abroad in the US arena, rather than in the international (or 'eurobond') market more often used for such borrowing. 'US investors have been particularly open to look at new borrowers and new credits,' says Charles Berman, of Salomon Brothers in London. The US private placement market, meanwhile, has long provided a source of long-term, fixed-rate funding which many foreign companies cannot get anywhere else. Usually, foreign companies raise such capital to match dollar liabilities. Wertheim Schroder, which has handled many of the private placements in the US by European companies, says that the market is also being used increasingly to raise money which is then swapped into another currency - a clear sign that demand in the US for some securities has reached a level at which more foreign issuers are likely to be tempted out of their domestic markets. For all the activity, though, there has been a notable lack of high-profile foreign listings in the US. A year ago, the debut of Daimler Benz on the New York Stock Exchange seemed to herald a new era for the US's biggest stock market. Having overcome German reluctance to disclose the sort of financial information demanded by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it seemed that the US exchange had at last found a way of establishing itself on the map as a serious international market place. But few other companies have shared the view that the attractions of a US listing are alluring enough to overcome the burdens of meeting US regulatory rules. What demand there has been from foreign issuers has come mainly from Latin America. Led by the Dollars 2bn depository receipt issue by the Argentine company YPF - the largest deal of its kind ever in the US - Latin American borrowers raised Dollars 5.5bn last year, compared with the Dollars 4.3bn raised by European issuers, according to figures from Citibank. The SEC, while not budging from its position that protecting US investors remains its overriding goal, has been trying to smooth the way for foreign issuers. In April, it relaxed many of its regulations for foreign companies, for instance by allowing them to use a short-form registration document and permitting cashflow statements which comply with international accounting standards (the first time the US regulators have countenanced anything that does not meet the US's own accounting regime). 'As our experience with foreign issuers grows, (we) will continue to discover ways to assist them with the transition to our disclosure system, and therefore to our markets,' said Mr Arthur Levitt, the commission's chairman.</p>

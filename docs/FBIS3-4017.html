Cheng Kejie, NPC  deputy and regional chairman, Lei Yu, vice regional chairman,  (Hong Huzhou), director of the regional Planning Commission, and  (Shuai Liguo), mayor of Beihai City, answered questions from  Chinese and foreign reporters.    [China Huayi Broadcast Company reporter] Guangxi provides  the most direct passageway to Southeast Asia. In 1992, the  central authorities stressed that it was necessary to give full  play to Guangxi's role as a sea passageway in the southwestern  region. Over the past few years, with this objective in mind,  Guangxi has strengthened infrastructure construction projects  and basic industrial projects. Could you tell me the progress  of these projects?    [Cheng Kejie] In 1992, the central authorities decided to  build Guangxi into a sea passageway in the vast southwestern  region. Over the past two years, with the help of the central  authorities, we have done a lot of work. First, we have grasped  infrastructure projects well, including transportation, energy,  telecommunications, and so on. We have built or expanded five  airports. The Guilin Airport project started last year and is  expected to be completed in October 1995. We are currently  building Liuzhou and Wuzhou Airports and these two projects will  be completed this year. In addition, we have expanded Beihai  and Nanning Airports. We are currently building five railroads:  The Nanning-Kunming Railroad, Yulin-Wuzhou railway,  Lihang-Zhangjiang Railroad, Qinzhou-Qinzhou Port Railway, and  the Qinzhou-Beihai Railroad. The Nanning-Kunming Railroad is  expected to be completed in 1997. In addition to this, we are  building two super expressways: The Liuzhou-Guilin totally  enclosed four-lane expressway and the  Nanning-Qinzhou-Huangcheng-Beihai six-lane expressway. Power  supply in Guangxi has been insufficient but efforts are being  made to speed up hydropower and thermal power plant projects.    [China Central Television reporter] Over the past two years,  Guangxi has imported foreign capital and run foreign-funded  enterprises. The number of such enterprises has increased.  Where did the money come from? What are the prospects for the  future?    [Lei Yu] With regard to efforts to promote exports to earn  more foreign exchange, in 1992, Guangxi's total export volume  reached $1.108 billion, an increase of 33 percent over 1992. In  1993, total export volume increased to $1.325 billion, up 19.6  percent. As far as using foreign capital is concerned, at the  end of 1991 there were 559 foreign-funded enterprises in Guangxi  and a total of $63 million in foreign capital was actually used.  At the end of 1992, there were 1,870 foreign-funded enterprises  in Guangxi and $246 million worth of capital was actually used,  an increase of 272 percent. At the end of 1993, there were  4,368 foreign-funded enterprises and $1 billion worth of foreign  capital was used in that year, an increase of 305 percent. The  use of foreign capital has been characterized by great increases  in recent years. In addition, there are four other  characteristics: First, investment fields have been expanded;  second, investment areas have been widened; third, the number of  investor countries and regions has increased; and fourth, there  are more big financial groups and large projects.    [VNA reporter] Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese  relations, how have relations between Guangxi and Vietnam been?  What reasons does Guangxi have to conduct further consultations  with Vietnam? [Cheng Kejie] Since the normalization of  Sino-Vietnamese relations in 1991, the development of friendly  economic contacts between the two countries has been healthy and  this has benefited the peoples of the two countries. We can  have better cooperation with Vietnam in many fields, such as  trade and negotiations on economic projects. Both sides can  promote their cooperation on the basis of mutual benefits and  concessions.    [Lei Yu] With the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese  relations, economic cooperation has developed considerably. I  believed that, encouraged by the two governments, economic  cooperation between Guangxi and Vietnam will be strengthened.    [XINHUA reporter] Not long ago, many experts predicted that  from the end of this century to early next century,  international cities will rise in the area of the Gulf of  Tonkin. It was reported that Beihai City has made some plans  and studies in this regard. I would like Mayor Suai to tell us  something about this.    [Suai Liguo] Beihai is a sea passageway in the vast  southwestern region. The city has eight strong points with  regard to its natural resources, in particular, tourism and  ports. Beihai City has invested a large sum of money in  infrastructure and energy projects. We have built Tieshangang  Highway and more than 10 city highways. We have also  constructed an airport. We are creating the best investment  environment to attract investors to come to Beihai to join local  construction or make investments. We are making efforts to  build Beihai into an influential and new city.    Cheng Kejie, Lei Yu, Shuai Liguo, and Hong Huzhou also  answered the following questions raised by reporters: How would  Guangxi strengthen its economic cooperation with the United  States? How would Guangxi deal blows at activities of illegally  selling guns? How would Guangxi support the impoverished? How  would Guangxi develop its electronics and automobile industry?  What are Lee Kuan Yew's investment intentions in Guangxi?</p>

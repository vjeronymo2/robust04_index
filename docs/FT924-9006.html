			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mandatory repairs MY AUNT owns a property, part of which is rented under a controlled rent. The rest is vacant. The council has served a repair notice on the property, and has offered a mandatory grant towards the repairs, provided she keeps the property for five years. 1) If the property is sold after five years, could she claim the cost of all the repairs against CGT, or only the net cost taking account of the grant? 2) Does it make any difference whether she pays for all the repairs herself and separately receives the grant, or whether the council and she each pay their share to the builder? 3) Can all the repair cost be deducted against income tax or only the net cost? 1) On the bare facts outlined, none of the expenditure will be deducted in calculating the chargeable gain. Ask your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet to CGT - CGT14. 2) No. 3) Only the net cost. The extent to which the net cost of repairs to the vacant part will qualify for income tax relief depends upon facts you have not supplied. Relief should be available if the vacancy is merely an interval between lettings. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: US drugs groups show strong gains despite pricing pressure Pfizer and Schering-Plough, two of the fastest-growing drugs groups in the US, shook off the pressure on pricing in their home market with strong volume gains during the third quarter. Bristol-Myers Squibb, meanwhile, reported a year-on-year sales increase of only 2 per cent. It also warned that it may take an additional 'material' charge against earnings to cover the cost of settling product liability claims relating to breast implants it manufacturered. Schering-Plough reported a 19 per cent jump in US prescription drug sales compared with a year before, driven by Claritin, an antihistamine, which achieved sales of Dollars 85m, and Proventil, an asthma therapy. Pfizer's US sales were up 15 per cent. However, the two companies' experience overseas differed markedly. Schering-Plough's non-US sales rose 1 per cent, but would have fallen 2 per cent had it not been for foreign exchange differences. Pfizer said its overseas sales grew 14 per cent. Its fastest growing product overall was Norvasc, a cardiovascular drug, whose sales jumped 94 per cent to Dollars 210m. Pfizer reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 336.5m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, on sales up 11 per cent overall at Dollars 2.1bn. This represented an 8 per cent increase on net earnings of a year ago, before one-off charges. Shering-Plough's net income rose 12 per cent, to Dollars 224m, on sales up 6 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn. Earnings per share in the latest period were Dollars 1.17. Bristol-Myers Squibb's net income rose 2 per cent to Dollars 621m, on sales up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.9bn, while earnings per share were Dollars 1.22. Pre-tax profits in the period were 6 per cent higher, but the after-tax result was held back by a higher tax charge resulting from the phasing out of US tax relief for Puerto Rico manufacturing operations.</p>

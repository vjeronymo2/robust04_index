			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] France has threatened to withdraw its electoral  assistance to Togo if conditions are not met for the holding of  a fair legislative election on 23 January and 6 February. This  was stated by Richard Duque, spokesman of the French Foreign  Affairs Ministry. In a statement published yesterday, Richard  Duque pointed out that right now, material conditions for a fair  and democratic election have not been met, adding that the  review of voters register and the distribution of the voting  cards have encountered a preoccupying delay.    He added that France has decided, in conformity with the 11  July Ouagadougou Accords, to send security and military  observers to Togo in the coming days to join the Burkinabe  military observers. French experts who are assisting in the  electoral preparations have already started their work together  with experts from other countries. However, Richard Duque said,  France has stated that it will have to withdraw all of its  observer team staff and its electoral assistance if conditions  for a fair, democratic, and multiparty election are not met when  the electoral campaign opens.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Analyst denies insider dealing AN EDINBURGH investment analyst alleged to have passed on advance notice of a company's forthcoming profits warning to share salesmen in his stockbroking firm, and to have 'counselled and procured' them to deal in the shares, went on trial at the Edinburgh Court of Session yesterday. Mr Thorold Mackie of Bell Lawrie White, an offshoot of TSB Group, denies a charge of obtaining and misusing price sensitive information under the 1985 Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. The indictment against him states that he was informed by Mr Peter Runciman, who was then chairman of the waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan, of a forthcoming profits warning in early September 1991. It alleges that between September 6 and 12 he 'counselled and procured' Mr Allan Gilmour Thom and Mr Colin McLeod Telfer of Bell Lawrie to deal in the shares of Shanks &amp; McEwan. The two salesmen sold 1.9m shares on behalf of clients of Bell Lawrie White at prices of between Pounds 3.04 and Pounds 3.18. They thus avoided the fall in the price of the shares from Pounds 2.70 to Pounds 2.28 which occurred after the profits warning was issued on September 19. The indictment states that they realised Pounds 1.39m more than they would have obtained had they sold the shares after the profits warning. Yesterday Mr Runciman, giving evidence for the prosecution, said that in July 1991 he indicated to analysts that growth in Shanks &amp; McEwan's earnings per share, previously 20 per cent a year, would fall to 15 per cent in the year to March 31 1992. In August the company's internal estimate was revised to 10 per cent, and then in early September to a fall of 1.6 per cent, after a significant contract did not materialise. With the share price still rising because of brokers' forecasts, and recognising that there had been a material change in the company's fortunes, he decided to issue a profits warning. 'We realised it would come as a bombshell and would cause a general loss of confidence in the company,' Mr Runciman said. The case continues today.</p>

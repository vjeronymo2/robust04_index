			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gains in New York help Nikkei rise for third day HOPES of an early US economic recovery, a rise on Wall Street, and the expected passage of the supplementary budget pushed the Nikkei average up in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average rose 95.08 to 17,501.30, extending its winning streak to the third consecutive day. The index opened at the day's low of 17,466.80 and rose to a high of 17,704.71 in the afternoon on buying by public funds and foreign investors, and on short-covering. Towards the end of the session, however, future-related selling cut some of the earlier gains. Volume rose to 370m shares from 240m, the highest since October 9 when 484m shares changed hands. Advances led declines by 781 to 238 with 122 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 15.91 to 1,328.83 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 7.99 to 1,080.13. Expectations that share prices will gain ground on today's fixing of the 'special quotation' or settlement price for futures and options prompted buying by investors and short-covering by dealers. Market participants hope the index will break through the 200-day moving average of 17,563, an important resistance level. The Nikkei has not closed above the 200-day average for 13 months. Speculation that Mr Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council, may become the next finance minister after the cabinet reshuffle, expected today, added to positive sentiment. Traders said that since Mr Mori is seen as a leading figure in pushing the government to adopt last August's emergency economic package, he might implement new measures to help the market. Active short-covering helped financial issues, with Industrial Bank of Japan up Y100 to Y2,570, Sumitomo Bank gaining Y50 to Y1,830 and Nomura Securities Y50 to Y1,520. Profit-taking depressed some large-capital blue chips. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, fell Y3 to Y295. High-technology blue chips gained ground on hopes of firm semiconductor demand in the US. Toshiba gained Y10 to Y633 and Fujitsu rose Y22 to Y578. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 261.82 to 19,116.33 in volume of 36.2m shares. The index rose above the 19,000 level for the first time since October 16. Roundup HONG KONG lost some of the gains it had made earlier in the week while Australia closed at a three-month high. Bombay, which opened for one hour's trading, fell 4 per cent. HONG KONG fell back in late trading after the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group failed to produce a communique at the end of its meeting. The Hang Seng index lost 65.46 or 1.2 per cent to 5,273.79 in thin turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn. Commentators noted that it was the first time in 25 meetings that the group had not issued a statement and this added to fears of a breakdown in co-operation between the two sides. Property stocks were among the day's biggest losers with Cheung Kong down 20 cents to HKDollars 18.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties shedding 60 cents to HKDollars 26.30. AUSTRALIA ignored bad unemployment data and was lifted by strong overseas buying and continued interest in BHP, which rose 20 cents to ADollars 12.62. The All Ordinaries index rose 19.1 to 1,501.3 in turnover of ADollars 352.7m. Banks were positive, with Westpac adding 2 cents to ADollars 3.07 and National Australia up 8 cents at ADollars 7.64. BOMBAY, closed for three days following the violence throughout the country, saw the BSE index fall 107.79 to 2,589.11 in thin turnover. SINGAPORE eased with the Straits Times industrial index falling 4.36 to 1,442.38. Among actives, Inchcape fell 30 cents to SDollars 6.20. SEOUL was encouraged by rumours of a cut in interest rates and the composite index rose 21.29 to 642.03 in turnover of Won383.25bn. TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish lower on profit-taking. The weighted index finished 29.80 lower at 3,746.75 in turnover of TDollars 10bn. MANILA fell for the second day as foreign investors unloaded their positions in Philippine National Bank. The composite index lost 16.99 to 1,248.84 in turnover of 244m pesos. PNB lost 12 pesos to 199 pesos.</p>

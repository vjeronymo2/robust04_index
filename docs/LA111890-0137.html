			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL SPENDING  </P> <P> It is absurd that California provides schools $2,000 to $3,000 per student less  than states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. All our schools are  under-funded, which gives us our high class sizes.  </P> <P> It is even more absurd to compare La Jolla and Lincoln high schools in terms of  allocated funding ("School-by-School Spending Figures Cause Consternation,"  Nov. 11). Neighborhood resources, level of parent education and home support  systems do not compare.  </P> <P> All San Diego schools need the smaller class sizes and support programs which  greater funding provides, but minority isolated schools especially do. Of 141  incoming Lincoln ninth-graders who were tested for reading, 113 (80.1%) were  below grade level and 58 (41.1%) were at or below sixth-grade level.  </P> <P> La Jolla High School has the same acknowledged problems as Lincoln High School,  but there it is primarily limited to the African-Americans and Latinos who  voluntarily take the bus to other schools. Shame on Principal J.M. Tarvin for  his divisive, self-serving remarks.  </P> <P> Having taught at Lincoln and "north of I-8," I know that there is no more  dedicated staff of teaching professionals anywhere than at Lincoln. While site  control over the school budget may happen, and we may be able to use it more  wisely, any progress will still come in incremental steps. That progress will  come despite the political rhetoric.  </P> <P> DON CRAWFORD  </P> <P> Social Studies Department Chairperson  </P> <P> Lincoln High School  </P></p>

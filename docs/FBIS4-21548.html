			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- "If war breaks out,  Seoul will turn into a sea of fire!"    These vicious words spat out by the chief North Korean  delegate to the inter-Korean working-level contact last Saturday  stunned even those South Koreans who have become inured to  violent language from the North.    As the full weight of North Korea's statement and other  harsh  remarks sank in, Seoul government officials and politicians  scurried in search of countermeasures.    Both the ruling and opposition parties held official  meetings  Monday to condemn North Korea's statement and urge Pyongyang  once again to continue inter-Korean dialogue.    At a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party postholders, almost  everybody took up the "sea-of-fire" remark and pressed the  government to map out and pursue a consistent North Korea policy.    DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil said, "The North Korean nuclear  problem is indeed very serious, but it appeaars many South  Koreans appear to be little concerned."    "There are still people in the South who insist on holding  behind-the-scenes talks with the North," Kim Chong-pil said.  "However, we will have to wake up from such illusion and prepare  to meet the situation quietly but strongly with firm resolution."    Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, noted  past criticism that the Seoul government has been too optimistic  about the North Korean nuclear issue and too dependent on the  United States.    "There has also been criticism that the government lacks a  consistent North Korea policy," Yi said.    The ruling party, he added, has been reviewing the  government  policy on North Korea and urging President Kim Yong-sam's  administration to deal squarely with the latest developments.    Rep. Yi Han-tong, DLP floor leader at the National Assembly,  said he plans to confer with the party leadership on a move to  convene the foreign affairs and national unification committee  to work out measures on the parliamentary level.    Rep. So Su-chong called on the military to take urgent steps  in order to dispel the anxiety felt by ordinary citizens.    DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said in a statement that the  remark  about "the sea of fire, which is practically a declaration of  war, debased the dignity of South Koreans."    "We condemn North Korea for making such violent remarks,  threatening war and inciting riots in South Korea," ha said.  "The North Korean remarks are anti-Korean people and an  anti-unification action."    Seoul should keep open a dialogue channel with Pyongyang,  but  it will have to maintain a firm and resolute position in its  negotiations with the North, Ha said.    The main opposition Democratic Party reacted strongly to the  North Korean threat, while at the same time urging the Seoul and  Washington governments to continue serious efforts to engage in  dialogue.    The DP held a supreme council meeting Monday morning and  decided to demand an emergency meeting of the foreign affairs  and national unification committee to hear a government report  on the issue.    In a special statement, adopted at Monday's meeting, the  party declared that "there should be no war under any  circumstances." It expressed regret over the North Korean threat  of warfare which, it said, had shocked peace-loving South  Koreans as well as all other people in the world.    "North Korea has to accept IAEA inspections of its nuclear  facilities," the statement said.    "It also is not proper for the United States to make a hasty  decision on the resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise  and a possible deployment of Patriot anti-missile missiles," the  DP statement said.    It asserted that the oppostion party opposes any  confrontation or heightening of tension on the Korean peninsula.  Instead, South and North Korea and the United States must  continue to talk in order to break the nuclear impasse.    The minor opposition United People's Party said it strongly  condemns North Korea for rupturing inter-Korean dialogue and  threatening to turn Seoul into a sea of fire.    In a statement read by spokesman Kim Su-il, the party called  on North Korea to go with the changing current in the world.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (4): Making sure the word gets out - Italy's minister for foreign trade is keen not only to let the world know about the country's high quality consumer goods, but also to promote its reservoir of technical and managerial skills / Italy, A flexible response 'Don't be surprised to find special promotions of Italian goods in stores like Harrods,' says Paolo Baratta, minister for foreign trade in Carlo Ciampi's outgoing government. With high quality consumer goods a high priority in the trade promotion policy developed by Mr Baratta's ministry, the red, white and green flag will increasingly be decorating the cheese counters and wine bins of food halls and the clothes and shoe racks of fashion departments of shops in big foreign cities. While food and agriculture are priorities, Mr Baratta emphasises the need to avoid a broad brush in promoting them. The Italian authorities are encouraging the creation of quality marks, such as those that give premium status to Parma ham and Grano Padana hard cheese and distinguish them from lesser products. But Mr Baratta approach is wide. He believes promotion of the 'Made in Italy' label should evolve into support for the 'Italy System'. 'Italian fashion is much more than Valentino and other big-name designers. Textiles, textile machinery and supporting activities all contribute to a very strong situation in inter-related sectors,' he says. 'Our machine tools makers are very successful abroad, and we should also promote the electronics industry that contributes much to their achievements. 'And more effort should be dedicated to promoting the country's capabilities in areas like urban planning, urban renewal and restoration, as well as infrastructure design, construction and operation.' Mr Baratta even sees an export role for the state electricity corporation. 'Enel has a great reservoir of technical and managerial skills in the design, building and management of power plants, electricity grids and distribution systems. These assets should be exploited. Enel could follow the example of the state hydrocarbons holding, Eni, which is very active abroad.' Partly to to help Italy's exporters, Mr Baratta has reorganised the ministry into two divisions. One covers international relations and trade negotiations. The other is responsible for trade promotion and inward investment, and it directs the activities of ICE, the foreign trade institute - the body responsible for implementing Italian trade promotion policy. Current policy recognises ICE's value but, says Mr Baratta, it must tackle four main tasks. First, it must exploit its foreign network more efficiently. Second, it must improve the sales of its services to Italian exporters. Third, it must develop a fuller range of information services and assistance. Finally, it must reshape its Italian network, by scaling down its Rome head office and strengthening the provincial structure. ICE organises promotional activities such as participation in trade fairs, outward and inward missions, seminars and shows. It also offers Italian business a range of information services, for which charges are made. Mr Baratta says that ICE must respond to what business wants, and provide flexibility and quality in response to demand from users of its services. February's appointment of ICE's new chairman demonstrates the government's commitment to this objective. Flavio Radice goes to ICE from managing directorships at two medium sized machine tool companies, Carnaghi and Ispa. He has been a member of the board of the industrialists' confederation Confindustria since last May. 'Who better to have his finger on the pulse than someone who has frontline experience in the size of company and in a sector that has been prominent in Italian export success?' asks Mr Baratta. Mr Radice has to fight a two-sided battle. On one side, he needs to introduce important changes at ICE, about whose structure and the possibility of effecting the necessary changes quickly Confindustria has reservations. On the other, he must convince industry that ICE offers good services and that users should be charged for them. The industrialists' confederation says that there is resistance to paying for services that were previously free. However, Confindustria has few doubts about the programme of fairs that ICE supports. This is probably because exporters are themselves involved with ICE in deciding which markets should be targeted and which initiatives supported. This autumn, shoppers in Inno stores in Brussels, Antwerp and Liege will see Italian goods under the spotlight. At the same time food and drink, and textiles will be promoted in France and machine tools and motorcycles in Germany. In October, Italy will host inward missions of US businessmen from the electronics industry as well as US motorcycle journalists. And while these are under way, Japanese footwear buyers will be able to visit a show of Italian shoes in Tokyo. ICE has a full calendar with a lengthy and wide ranging promotional programme. Assigned 25 per cent of 1994's total budget, mechanical engineering machinery has the largest slice. Fashion and similar goods follow, taking 20 per cent. ICE's funding for promotion is L100bn (Pounds 41.64m) this year, in addition to which it has L190bn to cover operating costs. Just over 45 per cent of promotional expenditure is budgeted for efforts at home, on activities such as bringing Japanese journalists and businessmen to visit the jewellery and leather goods industries in Italy, and Argentinians to the EIMA farm machinery show in Bologna. Nearly 20 per cent of ICE's budget for trade promotion activity is spent elsewhere in the EU. The other two main regions where efforts are concentrated are the Pacific basin and North America. But while Confindustria believes the funds for promotion are insufficient and Italy's industrialists say purse strings should be loosened, Italian trade promotion activity has been hit by government efforts to improve the gruesome state of public sector finances. 'There has been a significant erosion of the real value of funding, and we ought to aim to return to previous levels,' said Mr Baratta. The promotion budget was L130bn last year, plus L200bn to cover operational costs. On these two items alone it therefore has L40bn less to spend than in the previous year, and there has been no increase in money terms compared with funding in 1991. But while Mr Baratta advocates increased spending he says: 'An increase should be accompanied by careful monitoring of how funds are spent. We need to be able to put a value on what is achieved. An unconditional increase in funding is certainly not wanted. Spending on trade promotion must be sharply focused.'</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood flotation price set at 285p KENWOOD APPLIANCES, the kitchen equipment maker, will go on sale to the public at 285p a share next week, valuing the management buy-out from Thorn EMI at Pounds 104.5m. Half the 23.2m shares for sale were placed yesterday with a range of institutions. The price puts a 15.1 multiple on historical earnings on a pro-forma basis - that is adjusting for what Kenwood would have made in the year to March 1992 had it enjoyed the proceeds of the share sales throughout the year. The notional net dividend yield is 3.5 per cent. Kenwood will raise about Pounds 39.5m after offering for sale a higher-than-expected 63.3 per cent of the enlarged capi-tal. Thorn-EMI, which sold Kenwood to a management buy-out in 1989, will retain a 3 per cent stake which it cannot sell in 1992 while the MBO team is prevented from selling within the next year. Candover Investments, the venture capital supplier, will retain an 18 per cent stake. Mr Timothy Parker, chief executive, said Kenwood would continue to grow through introduction of new products but that last year's 40 per cent growth in operating profit would not be repeated. In addition to repaying all Pounds 33.4m of bank debt, the listing would allow Kenwood greater flexibility to expand either through acquisition or capital investment and would reduce the likelihood of constraints on future product development. Brokers to the offers are Rowe &amp; Pitman while the flotation has been sponsored by Schroders. COMMENT It was perhaps unfortunate that Kenwood should price its flotation just as Philips warned that profits would be hit by poor consumer spending. A 285p flotation price is also somewhat expensive, putting the company's prospective earnings on a premium to the market as a whole. Kenwood does, however, have a lot going for it and should continue to attract institutional interest after the placing. Operating profits, despite the recession hitting Philips and others, have grown rapidly through introduction of new products and it has strong non-UK sales, unlike Pifco, another kitchen product competitor. But according to brokers James Capel, its strongest asset is the Kenwood brand, a name that was selling food mixers when most of the subscribing public were not even born. Another factor supporting yesterday's pricing is the 18 per cent stake that Candover Investments retains in the company. The venture capital group will be slowly reducing that stake and will have been keen to see an orderly and upward price movement in the after market. While Kenwood is a growth company, it is by no means hi-tech and will not maintain last year's phenomenal growth. But for longer term investors, or those simply attracted by owning a name on their kitchen counters, the pricing is attractive.</p>

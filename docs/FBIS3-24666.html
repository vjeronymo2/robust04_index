			<p>This     press review series focuses on economic, social, and  demographic issues in Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia.     MOROCCO     Moroccans Among Islamic Guerillas Killed in Eritrea     Algerian daily LIBERTE reported on 3 January that, according to  Eritrean President Issaias Afewerki, two of the 20 Islamic  guerrillas killed in a recent skirmish with Eritrean forces were  Moroccans.  Afewerki claimed that the 20 guerrillas were Islamic  fundamentalists of various nationalities who had crossed into  Eritrea from Sudan and, in the manner of Afghani jihad movements,  were conducting operations to "liberate the entire region. "  Afewerki also claimed that guerrillas included "foreigners from ...  Tunis, Afghanistan, or Pakistan."  He further stated: "The source of  the problem is found in Sudan; we are trying therefore to resolve  the problem through collaboration with the Sudanese government and  the other forces in Sudan.  We do not wish that this war against  Eritrea remain a secret; thus, we are making it public knowledge."  (Algiers LIBERTE 3 Jan 94)     UMA To Study Creation of a Maghreb Free Trade Zone     The Ministerial Commission of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA)  dealing with economy and finances recently adopted at its seventh  session in Tunis a project to eventually declare the creation of a  Maghreb free-trade zone.  In a commentary on this "major event in  the process of edifying the UMA," ALMAGHRIB declared this to be "an  excellent opportunity for the industries of these countries to be  assured that their products would flow into a market which, although  not gigantic or possessing great purchasing power, is still capable  of sustaining and absorbing a good portion of these locally made  products."  The creation of a UMA free-trade zone would, the paper  claimed, "represent the dream of entrepreneurs in the region who  would thereby be able to jointly face the challenge of globalization  of markets and competition among regional economic blocks."  Among  the regional entrepreneurs working to achieve this are members of  the Maghreb Union of Textile and Leather Industries (UMATEC) who, at  a convention in Tunis 29-30 November 1993, articulated a program  which included the intention "to see to it that the textile sector  represent the first building block in the construction of the Grand  Arab Maghreb market, after the fashion of the coal and steel sectors  in the European market."  (Rabat ALMAGHRIB 18 Jan 94; Casablanca LA  VIE ECONOMIQUE 14 Jan 94)     Moroccan Central Bank Governor Heads Investments Oversight  Committee     King Hassan II has instructed the Central Bank (Bank Al-Maghrib)  governor to form a committee for encouraging and completing foreign  and domestic investment projects.  The committee includes the  directors of the kingdom's seven principal banking establishments:  Abdelaziz Alami, M'Hamed Bargach, Jawad Benbrahim, Abdelhaq Bennani,  Mustapha Faris, Abdellatif Jouahri, and Abdellatif Laraki.  The  committee is to meet regularly and as often as necessary to assist  investors with any measures needed to bring their projects to a  successful conclusion with the shortest possible delays.  The  committee will report to the King any difficulties it may encounter  in exercising its mandate.  (Casablanca MAROC SOIR 12 Jan 94)     November Cost of Living Indicators     In November 1993, the cost of living index, based on the 1989  price of 385 articles, dropped to 130.3 from 131.4 in October, a 0.9  percent decline.  Food items saw the greatest decrease, dropping 2  percent, due in large measure to seasonal variations in fresh fruits  and vegetables.  Wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in November to an  index level of 320.7 from 318.7 in October, principally due to  increases in clothing and textiles (3.6 percent), textile products  and haberdashery (6.8 percent), metallurgic industries (0.8  percent), transportation materials (1.4 percent), vegetable oils  (6.9 percent), and dried vegetables (3.1 percent).  This rise in  wholesale prices represents a 4.2 percent increase over their  November 1992 level.

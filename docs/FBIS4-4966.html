			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Mean Solicitation Diplomacy To Stifle Fellow Countrymen"-- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet  foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, flew to the United States  recently and discussed "additional inspection" and "sanctions"  against the North with U.S. high-placed officials. On April 3  during his stay in Japan, he requested Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to "take  phased economic sanctions".    This solicitation diplomacy is a dastardly act of the  special-class flunkeyist traitor who does not have an iota of  the spirit of national independence and is hell bent on harming  fellow countrymen by clinging to the coattails of the U.S. and  Japanese masters.    "Additional inspection" claimed by Han Sung-chu during his  tour of the United States and Japan is a nonsense which cannot  work with anyone.    The DPRK which is in a special position after temporarily  suspending the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is not obliged to undergo the  agency's full inspection pursuant to the safeguards agreement  and it has never agreed on this with the United States and the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    Han Sung-chu's vociferation about "additional inspection"  cannot be contrued otherwise than a deliberate act motivated by  a sinister purpose to expand the scope of partiality of the  agency and thus render the situation more complicated.    The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion,  clearly knowing that their criminal attempt to isolate and  stifle the DPRK will eventually lead them to destruction.</p>

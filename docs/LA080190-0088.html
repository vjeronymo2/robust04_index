			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY THEATERS ON THE WAY  </P> <P> The Murder Mystery Theatre -- a Los Angeles-based organization that has been in  San Diego for one year -- will begin a weekly interactive murder mystery dinner  series on Friday nights at the Horton Grand Hotel beginning Aug. 10. It plans  to rotate scripts monthly.  </P> <P> The group will continue what to now has been a monthly staging of murder  mysteries on trains and cruises in San Diego, in which the patrons play a  larger part in the action. The actors are trained to blend in with the guests.  A patron doesn't know if the stranger he struck up a conversation with between  the courses is another guest or a potential murder victim or suspect. The  action has the effect of exploding around you.  </P> <P> People may even look at you suspiciously, trying to gauge whether you are one  of the planted actors.  </P> <P> The shows will start with cocktails at 7 p.m. and continue through dinner for  up to 110 patrons a night.  </P> <P> Opening in September will be "The KPUG Talk Radio Murder Mystery" at the Town  and Country Hotel in Mission Valley. The hotel is converting its Abilene saloon  into a 170-seat theater for an open-ended run of the show.  </P> <P> Written by San Diegans Bill McGaw, Hall Sprague and Garry Shirts, the show was  a hit when it premiered at the Coronado Playhouse in January. Audiences are  ushered into a simulated remote broadcast of a radio station and are given a  chance to perform, be interviewed and help solve a crime. There are five  endings, depending on the audience.  </P> <P> The show will run Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 p.m. It is not  a dinner show, but the seating is cabaret style, and waitresses and waiters  serve drinks throughout the evening.  </P></p>

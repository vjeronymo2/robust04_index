			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: AGENT SHOULD WRITE PURCHASE OFFER ACCORDING TO BUYER'S  SPECIFICATIONS  </P> <P> QUESTION: My husband and I are house hunting. I've kept count, and we have  inspected 16 houses so far. Last weekend we found one we wanted to buy.  </P> <P> However, the realty agent was more of an obstacle than a help. She thought our  offer price was too low, but we pointed out several neighborhood sales at about  that price, so she finally agreed to our price. We also insisted on a termite  inspection and a professional inspection to which she reluctantly agreed.  </P> <P> Then, we insisted that our offer be contingent on our obtaining a fixed-rate  mortgage on specific terms. We have already prequalified and showed her our  certificate, but she said then we didn't need a finance contingency clause.  When I insisted on it, she got angry. Finally, my husband lost his cool and we  both walked out. However, we still want to buy that house. What should we do?  </P> <P> ANSWER: There are a zillion real estate agents who would love to write up your  purchase offer. You were absolutely correct to insist on your offer price, the  inspections and the specific mortgage finance contingency clause. Knowing how  emotional a home purchase can be, I admire your courage to walk out on that  obnoxious real estate agent.  </P> <P> A few bad apples like that give all the other excellent real estate agents a  tarnished image. You are absolutely correct, she was an obstacle to the home  sale rather than a help. Unfortunately, the home seller probably doesn't know  that agent is an important reason the home hasn't sold.  </P> <P> I suggest you find another agent to prepare your purchase offer. If necessary,  go to the manager of the listing agent's office. He or she will solve your  problem. Realty agents are supposed to promote property sales, not prevent  them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defer Tax on Home for Apartment Trade  </P> <P> Q: We have owned our home many years. If we sell it, our profit will be about  $200,000, so that "over-55 rule" $125,000 home sale tax exemption won't help  much. Our idea is to somehow sell our home and buy an apartment building where  my husband and I will manage the building.  </P> <P> He is very handy and can handle the repairs, whereas I will enjoy managing the  building by renting the apartments and doing the bookkeeping. Is there any way  we can pull this off without paying tax on our home sale?  </P> <P> A: Yes. But first I must explain an Internal Revenue Code 1031 tax-deferred  exchange only applies to "like kind" real estate held for investment or use in  a trade or business.  </P> <P> That means your personal residence cannot qualify. But you can first move out  and rent it to tenants, thus converting it to like kind property. Then you can  trade it for apartments or any other like kind property such as offices,  warehouses, shopping centers, or even vacant land.  </P> <P> However, nobody knows the answer to your next question which is how long must  the house be rented before it can be traded for apartments? Most tax advisers  suggest renting it at least six to 12 months before exchanging. Please consult  your tax adviser for further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Buyer's Bounced Check Not a Good Sign  </P> <P> Q: Since homes have been selling slowly in our city we were overjoyed when our  realty agent finally brought us an acceptable purchase offer. We also were  pleased with the $5,000 earnest money deposit check.  </P> <P> However, a few days later the agent phoned to say the buyer's out-of-town check  bounced. When the agent phoned the out-of-town buyer the phone number turned  out to be a wrong number. The realty agent calls the buyer's bank every day,  but is told the buyer's account has insufficient funds to cover the $5,000  check. This has been going on over two weeks. Do you think we should give up  and put the house back on the market for sale?  </P> <P> A: Yes. The buyer is in breach of contract and would have a very difficult time  enforcing the purchase contract if he reappears. But shame on the real estate  agent for not checking out the buyer and getting the buyer's out-of-town  address, so inquiry could be made there as to the buyer's whereabouts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Home Buyer Sell or Keep Old House?  </P> <P> Q: We have contracted to buy a new house under construction nearby. It will be  finished in two months. We can either sell our old home to raise the down  payment or keep the house, add a second mortgage for the down payment and rent  it to tenants. If we keep the old house we will have a negative cash flow of  about $150 per month. It is in a good location and we think it will continue to  appreciate in market value. Should we sell or keep our old home?  </P> <P> A: You can never own too much real estate, especially if it is well-located and  appreciating in market value. Since your current home is near your new home,  you can easily supervise the tenants. If you can handle that negative cash flow  I recommend holding on to your old home instead of selling it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreclosure Can Pay for Owner-Lender  </P> <P> Q: To get our home sold, we had to carry back a $24,000, 10-year second  mortgage for our buyer. As we are moving from the area, I am concerned the  buyer might not make her monthly payments and we might have to foreclose. If  that happens, what should we do?  </P> <P> A: Foreclose is the best thing that can happen to a second mortgage lender. If  your buyer defaults, after about 30 days you should contact the realty agent  who handled your home sale. He or she can recommend a local attorney or other  qualified person to handle the foreclosure for you.  </P> <P> If there are no bidders to pay off your loan at the foreclosure sale, then you  get the home back to sell for a second profit. Instead of fearing foreclosure,  you should consider it an added benefit of selling your home. But please don't  get your hopes up because less than 1% of home loans go to foreclosure sale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Borrower Should Get a Copy of Appraisal  </P> <P> Q: My husband and I are refinancing our home loan to switch to a fixed-rate  loan and take out some tax-free equity cash. Our current lender offered us a  good loan, but wanted us to pay a $250 appraisal fee which we stupidly paid.  </P> <P> However, the appraisal came in about $15,000 below what a similar home sold for  last month just a few blocks from our house. To make matters worse, the lender  wouldn't let us see the appraisal for which we paid. Thankfully, we found a  better loan with another lender who didn't even charge us an appraisal fee. I  feel we got ripped off for $250, don't you?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Any borrower who is asked to pay an appraisal fee should pay the fee  only with the understanding that the borrower will be given a copy of the  appraisal. There is no valid reason for a lender not giving the borrower a  copy, except to conceal a faulty appraisal. If I were in your situation I would  sue the lender for the $250 in small claims court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mortgage Broker Breaks Loan Promise  </P> <P> Q: I should have taken your advice to another reader several months ago. You  warned her to be very wary of mortgage brokers who often promise loan terms  that later prove to be unavailable.  </P> <P> I stupidly listened to the saleswoman who sold me my condo. She recommended a  local mortgage broker who, she said, was wonderful. But about a week before the  scheduled closing, the mortgage broker told me the lender refuses to make a  loan on the condo complex because it was not "pre-approved," whatever that  means.  </P> <P> She said she was unable to obtain another lender who will loan on the condo I  wanted to buy. Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to walk about three  blocks to an S&amp;L branch where the manager said her S&amp;L would be glad to  make the loan to me.  </P> <P> Although the closing had to be delayed about a week, I got my mortgage and am  happily moved in my condo.  </P> <P> A: Thank you for sharing your experience which, unfortunately, is too typical  of some mortgage brokers who promise more than they can deliver.  </P> <P> I realize they are middlemen caught between the lender and the borrower. Often  the mortgage broker has no control over the lender's decision to change loan  terms or refuse to make a loan. But mortgage brokers shouldn't mislead  borrowers into thinking their loan is a firm commitment if it isn't.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Buyer Benefits by Dealing With Agent  </P> <P> Q: Our town seems to have an oversupply of homes for sale. My husband and I are  looking for a home to buy for our growing family. If we limit our search to  homes being sold directly by their owners, do you think we can get the seller  to reduce the price by the amount of the sales commission that doesn't have to  be paid?  </P> <P> A: No. The value of a home is determined by the marketplace, not by real estate  agents. A few home sellers try to sell their homes without a real estate agent  because they think they are saving the sales commission.  </P> <P> But the truth is they are working very, very hard to get their homes sold. Do  you think they will pass that sales commission savings on to the buyer? Very  unlikely.  </P> <P> Realty agents perform valuable services to both buyers and sellers. If they  didn't, sellers wouldn't hire them. As a home buyer, it costs you no more to  buy a home through a real estate agent than directly from the seller. A realty  agent has hundreds of homes to show you, but a do-it-yourself seller has only  one.  </P> <P> After you find the right home, the realty agent will help negotiate the sales  price and terms. Then the agent will recommend mortgage lenders and help obtain  the loan you need. Finally, the agent arranges the 1,001 details of the sale  closing.  </P> <P> All this service costs you nothing extra, but it can save you many headaches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Determine Fair Market Rent for Home  </P> <P> Q: My wife has a great job opportunity in London. Since I am a writer and can  work anyplace, I have agreed to the move which should last about two years. We  have decided to keep our home and rent it to tenants while we are gone. How can  we determine the fair market rent?  </P> <P> A: Local rental market conditions determine the rent you can obtain for your  home. The quickest way to determine rents of nearby homes is to read the  classified ads under "Homes for Rent." Phone a few owners to learn if their  homes are truly comparable to yours. You will rapidly determine the fair market  rent for your home.  </P> <P> Your next step is to begin interviewing prospective tenants. One way is to  phone a local realtor who specializes in rentals and list your home for rent.  However, you may prefer to rent the house yourself by advertising it in the  local newspaper.  </P> <P> I have been very fortunate using both methods. But I do enjoy the special  service the best rental agents give, such as screening applicants, eliminating  the unqualified prospects, checking their credit and income, and making the  rental task easy. Of course, rental agents do this in return for a handsome  fee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sell or Remodel Home, Which Is Better?  </P> <P> Q: We own a small home in a nice neighborhood. But it has only two bedrooms and  we need four. My husband thinks we should remodel and add two bedrooms. He  obtained estimates and we can swing the cost with the help of an equity  credit-line loan.  </P> <P> But we realize it will involve about six months of mess. Our other alternative  is to buy a larger home. However, the only ones we can afford are way out in  the boondocks and the schools there are not the best. What do you advise?  </P> <P> A: I recommend that you remodel your current home. This is usually the least  expensive and most profitable choice. Since you like your current neighborhood,  that is a major advantage as compared to moving to an untried area. Perhaps you  have noticed the remodeling boom. This shows other people have faced the same  choice you did and they elected to stay and remodel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Worry If Price Appreciates Slowly  </P> <P> Q: My parents, in their early 70s and retired, live in a small town. Last week  mom sent me a clipping from the local newspaper which said homes prices there  have only gone up 3.5% in the last year. They are debating whether to sell and  move to a warmer climate or stay where they are.  </P> <P> The town is neither growing nor declining. It is a very nice place and I  enjoyed growing up there. I would hate to see my parents move away from their  friends, but they are concerned about their home value because it is their  major asset. What do you advise?  </P> <P> A: When I started investing in real estate, in the 1960s, I recall a real  estate agent told me homes in the area where I bought my first property  appreciated 3% annually. We thought that was terrific. There is nothing wrong  with a modest appreciation rate. Of course, a higher rate would be better.  </P> <P> I suggest that you and your parents watch the economic climate in their small  town very carefully. If it starts to decline, that is the time to sell. Since  they are happy there, I suggest they stay unless some unfavorable factor  indicates they should sell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Deduction for Lost Money Deposit  </P> <P> Q: We offered to buy a 12-unit apartment building. With our purchase bid we  made a $5,000 earnest money deposit. However, we learned more about the  building and decided not to buy, as we decided apartments are not the right  investment for us.  </P> <P> The seller and realtor refuse to refund our $5,000 because we breached the  contract. We understand that. But can we deduct our $5,000 loss on our income  tax returns?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Since this was to be a business or investment property, your lost  earnest money deposit qualifies as a deductible business expense. However, if  you had lost the deposit on the purchase of a personal residence then it would  not be deductible. Please consult your tax adviser for further details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Make Offer Acceptance Only for Short Time  </P> <P> Q: We offered to buy a home. The realtor wrote on the offer bid that our offer  was to be good for seven days. Frankly, I didn't read that part very carefully.  After a few days I called the realtor and she said the seller was considering  our offer.  </P> <P> When a week had gone by I called the realtor, since she had not called us. She  reported there was another slightly better offer coming in from another buyer  and she wondered if we could raise our bid by $4,500. I was so angry I told her  to forget it. Now I realize our agent was trying to get us to offer more for  the house. Next time, what should we do differently?  </P> <P> A: Don't make your purchase offer valid for such a long time. Unless the seller  is out of town, an offer bid valid for one day is usually sufficient. A short  time for purchase offer acceptance puts pressure on the seller to either accept  or counteroffer your bid. The one-week acceptance time in your purchase offer  was an invitation for "offer shopping" which is what the seller did.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Get Action on Slow-Selling House  </P> <P> Q: I own a house that I have had listed for sale over three months. The asking  price is reasonable, based on comparable sales, but I haven't had any good  purchase offers yet. There is no mortgage on the house, so I can be very  flexible. Some time ago I recall you said a lease-option can get action on any  house. How should I advertise my house on a lease-option to get some action?  </P> <P> A: Just run my famous classified ad under both "houses for rent" and "houses  for sale" in the newspaper want ads. Pay extra to have the first line in big  bold type such as: "$5,000 Moves You In! Lease with option to buy. Half your  rent applies to down payment. Beautiful 3 BR, 2 BA home, family room. Great  neighborhood. $1,500 per month. Call Mark at 999-9999."  </P> <P> Then stay home and get ready for your phone to ring. Or do as I do and don't  list your phone number, but just say in the ad "Open Sunday 1-3 p.m." and  include the address.  </P> <P> Unless you get greedy and charge too much for the non-refundable option money  or the rent, you will have lots of action on your house.  </P></p>

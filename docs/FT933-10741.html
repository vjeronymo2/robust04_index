			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Investors look to test limits of franc and krone THE French franc and the Danish krone came under strong selling pressure yesterday, casting doubt about how quickly the relaxation of the European exchange rate mechanism would allow these countries to reduce interest rates. The stretching of both currencies' lower limits in the ERM encouraged investors to test how far they could push down the value of these currencies against the D-Mark. At one stage yesterday, the franc was being sold 3.4 per cent below its former ERM floor against the D-Mark, while the krone initially fell more than 6 per cent. Both currencies later recovered some of the lost ground, but dealers said this had only occurred because Denmark had raised a key borrowing rate to 25 per cent while France left its official interest rates unchanged. In further developments arising from the decision early yesterday to make the ERM more flexible by widening its fluctuation bands, Portugal, Denmark, and Belgium all indicated their reservations about giving all currencies except the Dutch guilder a 15 per cent margin of movement around the D-Mark. This replaced existing bands of 6 per cent or 2.25 per cent. As the Belgian franc, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo also lost ground against the D-Mark, the German currency and the Bundesbank emerged as the main beneficiaries of the agreement hammered out in Brussels to revamp the ERM to increase confidence in it by international investors. The accord reduces the obligations on the Bundesbank to buy weak currencies in costly intervention operations. The central bank has also been spared having to compromise its record on monetary management by promising interest-rate reductions. The introduction of extremely wide currency bands has been interpreted as essentially allowing the system's currencies to float while preserving the appearance of a managed exchange-rate system. Foreign exchange trading was uneven as investors weighed up the implications of the new-look ERM, devised in nearly 12 hours of crisis talks by European Community finance ministers after the substantial selling at the end of last week of the fragile ERM currencies. The D-Mark appreciated more than 3 pfennigs against the dollar to stand at DM 1.709 in late New York trading as dealers took the view that Germany was unlikely to cut interest rates in the near future. The weaker dollar was also trading early in the US at a post-war low against the yen of Y104.05, but recovered slightly late in the day. Sterling, which had risen against many other currencies strongly in recent weeks, fell 3 pfennigs on the day to close in London at DM2.555. It gained only slightly in New York, as dealers speculated that the UK could cut base rates from 6 per cent. At the start of European trading, the French franc came under strong selling pressure. It fell as low as FFr3.55 against the D-Mark, well below its old floor of FFr3.4305, but recovered to close in London at FFr3.505, some 8 1/2 centimes down on the day, with little change in New York or in early Far East trading. The Danish krone suffered a more substantial fall, dropping by about 6 per cent against the German currency at one stage, and forcing the Danish authorities to raise their one-month interest rates to 25 per cent. The currency later appreciated to a London close of DKr4.0367. Dealers sold the currency amid fears that the unravelling of the ERM would place the krone in the same category as currencies such as the Swedish krona and Finnish markka, both of which have suffered substantial devaluations in the last year. The Belgian franc also came under pressure, dropping well below its former floor against the D-Mark of BFr21.09 and bottoming out at BFr21.55. Both the peseta and escudo were also sold, the latter falling below its former ERM floor against the D-Mark of Es105.04 for the first time. Expressions of dissatisfaction with the patched-up ERM were led by Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of Portugal's central bank, who said the escudo's fluctuation band did not need widening, but accepted this solution as the least of many evils. Criticism also came from Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, Danish central bank governor, who said: 'Denmark is not a supporter of the new system. We are disappointed.'</p>

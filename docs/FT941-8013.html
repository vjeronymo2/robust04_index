			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Rule change may push up funeral costs: Pollution law could cost Pounds 100m Funeral costs may rise sharply as owners of crematoria are faced with spending up to Pounds 100m in the next few years to meet new environmental rules, managers said yesterday. Britain's 200 or more crematoria need to install new incinerators quickly to meet the standards specified in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. They will also need to burn four to five times as much gas to reach the temperatures specified by the new rules. 'That hardly makes sense if we're all trying to stop global warming,' said Mr Mike Stride, general secretary of the Institute of Burial and Cremation Administration, which represents managers of crematoria. Crematoria, which are currently covered by the Clean Air Act, must comply with the new rules by 1998. The rules are intended to eliminate emissions of dioxins, hydrogen chloride and heavy metals, but managers of crematoria said yesterday that the risk of such emissions was tiny. 'There are more pollutants from cars that come to the funeral than from the crematorium,' said Mr Graeme Sloan, manager of the Lewisham Crematorium in south London. The complaints come against a background of criticism from many sectors of industry that the act is too bureaucratic and adds to industrial costs without achieving adequate environmental improvement. Mr Tim Wood, superintendent and registrar of the West Hertfordshire Crematorium near Watford, said: 'Under the new rules, I will have to completely rebuild the crematoria, replace the four cremators with larger ones, and add 10 feet to its 30-foot chimney'. He said that improvements under the EPA - which he expects to cost Pounds 1.2m - are the main reason for the steep rise in fees for a cremation to Pounds 165, up from Pounds 98 in 1991. Mr Stride said: 'Most places are looking at spending half a million pounds - this will probably cost the industry Pounds 100m, and that's before the extra gas costs'. A typical crematorium might see its gas bill rise from Pounds 4,000 a year to Pounds 20,000. Mr Wood said that following the announcement of the de-regulation of gas supplies, West Hertfordshire, which buys from British Gas, is 'trying to find a gas company to supply us with a cheaper tariff'. Some local authorities which cannot afford the investment 'are thinking of selling up crematoria to the private sector or leasing them', said Mr Stride.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fung Wai-kong] </F>   [Text] The territory's pro-Beijing forces split further  yesterday, the day after the liberals formed a new alliance. A  new pro-China party, the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, to be  officially launched today, has more than 50 members, most of  whom have close contacts with the Chinese Government. Its core  members include Ambrose Lau Hon-chuen, a Hong Kong affairs  adviser and Central and Western District Board chairman Yu  Sun-say, a delegate to the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Committee; Yu Kwok-chun, an affairs adviser and  owner of the Yue Hwa Chinese Products Department Store.    Mr Lau said members did not share the political beliefs of  the pro-China flagship, the Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), and felt they needed their own  party. "There's no reason why we should join DAB and not form  our own party?" Mr Lau said. He said it was unfair to label the  party as pro-China but emphasised that their strong links with  China would enable better communication. Members have informed  XINHUA (the New China News Agency) of their intention to form  the party.    The party will field candidates for September's District  Board election.</p>

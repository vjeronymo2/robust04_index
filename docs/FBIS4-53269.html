			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting  nations will this week consider whether to continue as an  informal group or to establish a secretariat.    The group was set up in 1986 to lobby for farm trade  liberalisation in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.    Cairns Group ministers agreed at the round's concluding  meeting in Morocco last month that the group should remain in  existence to monitor the implementation of the round's  agreements on agriculture and to lobby for further  liberalisation.    The discussions on the group's future structure will take  place at the group's 14th ministerial meeting in Montevideo,  Uruguay on May 19-20.    Thailand, which played a key role in setting up the group,  still needs the group to push for more agricultural trade  liberalisation under the new World Trade Organisation (WTO)  scheduled to be established next year, Business Economics  Department Director-General Kroekkrai Chiraphaet said on Friday.    He said the meeting would discuss its role and internal  cooperation, especially on the task of monitoring whether  signatories of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which  would become members of the WTO, followed their commitment to  open markets to farm products and reduce domestic and exports  subsidies.    Thailand, as an active member of the Cairns Group, believed  that even through the Uruguay Round included clauses on  agricultural trade, more free trade was needed, he said.    Mr Kroekkrai said the group had to consider whether to opt  for informal cooperation as existed or a formal office with a  permanent secretariat.    The group also needed to talk about nominating a  representative to chair the WTO's agriculture committee to be  set up to supervise world farm trade.    In Marrakech last month, Australian Trade Minister Bob  McMullan proposed that the group should try to have one of its  members elected chairman of the agricultural committee. Thai  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said he thought  Thailand could play that role.    Dr Suphachai will head the Thai delegation at this week's  meeting in Uruguay. Mr Kroekkrai will be the leader at official  level.    The Thai delegation will visit Washington before going to  Uruguay.    Dr Suphachai will meet United States Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor to discuss Thailand's position on Washington's  "Priority Watch List" of countries accused of failing to provide  adequate protection for US intellectual property.    Dr Suphachai said even the US had recognised that Thailand  had made progress in dealing with protection of intellectual  property rights but Thailand wanted to explain to the US that  the amendment of the Copyright Law depended on Parliament.    Both sides will discuss the agenda for their talks expected  to be held in Washington next month. Thailand wants to talk  about cooperation on economic issues, particularly joint  investments in Thailand the third countries.</p>

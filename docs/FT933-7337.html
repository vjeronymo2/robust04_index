			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: Bjork's 'Debut' - live BJORK'S idiosyncratic vocal style was one of the main reasons why Iceland's contribution to rock music, the Sugarcubes, always remained something of an acquired taste. Yet her first solo record, Debut, has proved a surprising success. Its occasional jazzy tinge and off-centred lyrics about pained love, together with the huge sales and Bjork's wonderful cheekbones, have even drawn comparisons with Sade, even though their musical styles are utterly different. Bjork is in grave danger of becoming the next thinking man's rock crumpet; a fate she does not deserve. Bjork's voice dominates Debut. She wrote all the songs and undoubtedly the eclectic mixture of styles - techno, bebop, jazz ballad, reggae and Asian - reflects her tastes. Even so, it is very much a producer's album, the styles blended into a distinctive but consistent whole in the studio by Nellee Hooper who previously produced Soul to Soul. Now here was Bjork onstage at the Forum on Thursday night for the inevitable showcase concert with a six piece band, most of whom had not played on the album and whose surnames, she said afterwards, she did not know. As a live show, the evening lacked shape or a sense of the dramatic. Bjork ran through the songs from her album and, once she had played them, returned only for the briefest encore. But as a display for those songs it was a success. The inability of a live band, even one with so much technology, to duplicate a sophisticated studio sound helped pick out the different influences, highlight the contrasts between songs and emphasise the muscularity of Bjork's more dance-influenced tunes. 'Human Behaviour' - the hit, the first track on Debut and the first song in the show - was propelled by a slinky, club beat. 'Venus as a Boy' combined a reggae bass line with flute and the Asian-textured violin of Nawaz Ali Khan. On 'The Anchor Song' Bjork sings simply over jazz saxophone tootlings. Hippyish curls and wisps of violin and flute or jazzy honks from saxophone and clarinet gave a lighter texture to the powerful background of drums, percussion, bass and keyboards. Whatever the arrangements and however good the material, she lives by her voice. It is certainly distinctive. At times it is almost gruff, at others it floats up, sharp and penetrating. It is always fragile but has surprising power, although there were times when the band threatened to crush it. Yet Bjork's singing also has its weaknesses. 'Like Someone In Love' is constructed and presented like a jazz ballad, sung over keyboards twiddled to imitate jazz guitar. But her phrasing is strangely random, her grip on the melody slippery at best; she does not seem to care, beating the song breathlessly to a paste, with immense charm and personality. The crowd received it with rapture. Bjork's strengths were clear in the last song of the set 'Big Time Sensuality', a knowing piece of faux soul, electro meets Stax. Bjork barked, swooped and shouted over a braying saxophone and relentless rhythm; a wonderful dance song, a climax to any live show. In front of her, the great mass of the audience stood as if their feet had been superglued to the dance floor, happily lost in Bjork's strange territory, drawn to this latest dreamy, sub-poetic woman singer-song-writer. At the Forum Kentish Town. Bjork supports U2 at Wembley today and plays at Wolverhampton Civic Hall on September 13 and the Manchester Academy on September 14.</p>

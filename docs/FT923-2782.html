			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Retail sales fall a blow to Bush: White House fears US economy will be stagnant in run-up to election US RETAIL sales fell far more steeply than expected by the financial markets yesterday, reinforcing the Bush administration's fears that the economy will be stagnant in the final stages of the presidential race. The Commerce Department announced that retail sales had fallen 0.5 per cent in August, the largest drop for five months. 'The economy is dead in the water,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, the New York financial services group. The recovery's failure to gather momentum showed that structural weaknesses, such as the debt build-up of the 1980s, were more profound than had been suspected, he said. Preliminary figures for car sales in the first 10 days of September were also disappointing. Results from General Motors and Ford indicated sales of domestically-built vehicles were running at an annual rate of only 5.7m units, against the already depressed level of 6m at the end of last month. The economy had 'no real engine' for recovery, Ms Susan Phillips, a governor of the Federal Reserve, said. Consumers were hesitant because of fears about job security. 'Everybody has a brother-in-law or sister-in-law or knows some-body' who has lost a job, she said. The weakness in retail sales was concentrated in durable goods, especially cars, building materials and furniture, which all fell by more than 1 per cent relative to July. The impact of last month's figures, however, was reduced by an upward revision for July to show an increase in retail sales of 1 per cent rather than 0.5 per cent. Overall sales for July and August were slightly ahead of the second quarter level. Most forecasters believe the economy is still growing sluggishly at about the 1.4 per cent annual rate registered in the second quarter. But this is well below earlier expectations and insufficient for President George Bush to claim a convincing recovery ahead of the November election. Slow growth, however, is putting downward pressure on inflation. The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent last month, with much of the rise reflecting a sharp increase in volatile food prices, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 3.1 per cent compared with 3.2 per cent in July. Wall Street, Page 37</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Downing Street moves to quell Tory anxieties Downing Street moved last night to counter suggestions that Britain had capitulated in the row over EU voting rights by cautioning that the government would not automatically accept the proposed deal. Signalling the start of a concerted two-day push to swing the main body of the Conservative party behind the proposed compromise, it said no decision would be taken until after a full meeting of the cabinet tomorrow. This would examine in detail whether or not the proposals met the concerns of Mr John Major, the prime minister. According to one senior official: 'There is still a fair bit of work to be done.' With Tory business managers due to meet this morning, a crucial consideration will be how the proposals are received not by the Eurosceptic hardcore - who would oppose almost any compromise - but by the broad mass of Tory backbenchers. The support of all but the hardcore is essential for Mr Major, who is anxious not to widen the rift in the party over Europe in the run-up to local government and European elections which could have an important bearing on his future as leader. Interviewed yesterday on BBC Radio 4 after the compromise was put forward, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said he had 'agreed to nothing' while emphasising that the other countries had made a 'serious move' in Britain's direction. 'You are never going to get 100 per cent of what you want, the question is whether we can achieve the enlargement of the Community and provide sufficient protection of our interests. We have to decide how our interests and those of the minority can be protected,' he said. Noting some countries were worried the proposals went too far in Britain's direction, Mr Hurd said ministers would have to consider 'very soberly' whether they went far enough. Leading Eurosceptics yesterday joined Labour in criticising the government's handling of the negotiations. Mr Bill Cash, the MP for Stafford, said he was 'deeply disturbed by the trend'. Labour said Mr Hurd's 'climbdown' was 'humiliating but predictable'.</p>

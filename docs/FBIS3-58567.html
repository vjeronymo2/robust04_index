			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greece is the firm guarantor of peace, security, and  stability in the Balkans, since it has all the political and  [word indistinct] advantages. Government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos made this statement in response to a question on the  issue of Skopje following the meeting Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg had yesterday with Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias, who is presiding over the European Union.    The spokesman stated that there are no secret talks on this  issue. He reiterated that Greece's positions are well known,  adding that Foreign Minister Papoulias will go to the United  States, where he will outline Greek positions to international  mediator Cyrus Vance, who has already been briefed by Andonios  Exarkhos, Greece's permanent representative at the United  Nations.    The government spokesman also repeated that any development  on the Skopje issue depends on practical signs of goodwill by  Skopje since, as he stressed, [Macedonian President] Kiro  Gligorov appears to recognize the importance of good relations  with Greece. These positions, Venizelos added, are not the  positions of the government, but those of the Greek Republic,  which Prime Minister Papandreou outlined in Brussels last week  at the highest and most critical level, the NATO Summit. As is  known, U.S. President Bill Clinton, European Union Commission  President Jacques Delors, and the Greek prime minister, who is  presiding over the European Union, participated in this summit.    The government spokesman was also asked to comment on the  personal statement of Public Order Minister Stilianos  Papathemelis, who advocated an offensive if Skopje insists on  the name Macedonia. The spokesman stressed that the government  positions are only expressed by the prime minister. He said the  minister has made it clear that his remarks were personal views.</p>

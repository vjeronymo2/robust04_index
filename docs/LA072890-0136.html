			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY AGENCIES SUE SOCIAL SECURITY OVER AID FOR MENTALLY ILL  </P> <P> Several Orange County agencies that aid the poor filed suit Friday in federal  court against the Social Security Administration, contending that the agency  gives insufficient help to poor people with mental disabilities.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed on behalf of all people in Orange County who might qualify  for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, demands that Social Security mount a  massive outreach program to identify potential SSI beneficiaries and help them  get through the complicated application process.  </P> <P> Although the complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,  attorneys said it was assigned to U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler,  who sits in Santa Ana. Lawyers in the case are not seeking any immediate court  orders to change Social Security's practices, but they expect that a full trial  on the issues will be held before Judge Stotler.  </P> <P> A Social Security spokesman said the agency is trying to improve its outreach  programs for potential SSI beneficiaries.  </P> <P> "Until we feel that everyone out there knows and has the chance to apply, we're  not going to be satisfied," said Eddie Cooksey, Social Security's deputy  regional public affairs officer in San Francisco.  </P> <P> He said the agency is considering using $3 million recently allocated by  Congress to pay local mental health agencies to get the word out to the  mentally ill that they might qualify for benefits.  </P> <P> Cooksey said there are claims representatives in each Social Security office  who can help people complete the forms.  </P> <P> Applicants must complete a three-page form. Then, if they appear to qualify for  benefits, they must return and finish a 10-page form, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK brewing The Monopolies and Mergers Commission's intervention in the brewing industry may turn out not to have been quite so counter-productive after all. There are a number of factors behind the outbreak of hostilities in brewing. Recession and an ageing population have reduced demand for beer. Courage appears to have lost its touch after the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's brands. But the most significant factor is a shift in the balance of power towards the retail end of the beer industry. The obligation on brewers to free pubs from the tie has facilitated the development of independent pub chains with the clout to demand large discounts from their suppliers. Consumers may not have felt much benefit yet, though they will surely demand lower prices as time goes by. For now, the benefits accrue to companies such as Boddington, which has left brewing already, First Leisure which was never in it and JD Wetherspoon, one of the nimbler new multiples whose shares have risen by 80 per cent since last October's flotation. The safe haven of pub retailing also offers diversification into food which enhances gearing to economic recovery. As for the large brewers, the assumption is that the confrontation will continue until one blinks and cuts capacity. But the problem is also one of excessive proliferation of brands and cannot be dealt with simply by closing down plant. That adds to the risks facing the big brewers. The real damage will occur when discounting spreads to brands that at present command a premium. Once that happens, lost ground may never be recovered.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS WILL ALSO DECIDE AIRPORT ISSUE  </P> <P> Although most attention in Tuesday's Torrance election has focused elsewhere,  voters will also decide on Measure C. The proposal would change city accounting  procedures for money earned from the Torrance Municipal Airport and its  adjacent commercial properties.  </P> <P> If passed, the measure would repeal a portion of the City Charter that requires  the money to be kept in a separate airport fund used to pay airport bonds and  other expenses. The fund was approved by voters in 1957. It kept the city from  financial responsibility for the bonds, making only the airport and revenue it  produced liable for the borrowed funds.  </P> <P> The bonds will be paid off in March, and city officials say the protection of  the charter provision is now unnecessary. They have called the ballot measure a  "housekeeping" move, which would simply place airport funds under the same  accounting practices used for other revenues produced by the agencies in the  city's Transportation Department.  </P> <P> Currently, airport operating revenues are spent on the airport, though much of  the additional revenue from the businesses -- car dealerships and shopping  centers -- on airport property are spent on other city obligations. The airport  runs at a surplus when revenues from these businesses that are not related to  aviation are included in its balance sheet.  </P> <P> Under state law, airport monies would still have to be placed in a separate  account, city officials have said, though the City Council would have greater  discretion in spending them.  </P> <P> But some pilots, who have clashed with City Council members in recent months  over airport operations, say it is the first step by the city in a possible  campaign to close the airport.  </P> <P> In the ballot argument against the measure, Barry Jay of the Torrance Airport  Boosters Assn. says changing the charter will make city residents liable for  the cost of operating the airport.  </P></p>

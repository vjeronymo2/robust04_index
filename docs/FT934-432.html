			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Ballet among the bombs with a bun - Dance My baptism in ballet had the effect, as Frederick Ashton said about his first view of Anna Pavlova, of 'injecting the poison into my veins'. I was a young schoolboy; it was 1943; we lived in Surrey and I had nagged my parents, for reasons I now forget, to take me to the ballet. Tickets were booked for a matinee by the Anglo-Polish Ballet. On the morning of the performance I rose, feverish with excitement. Rather too feverish, as it turned out, since I had a tendency to keel over and was lightly covered with blisters. Chickenpox, of course. Adieu ballet. Persistent, I nagged again, and was rewarded with a matinee in London to see the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Bliss was there. How blue the lighting for the second act of Swan Lake, and how beautiful Fonteyn. How fascinating the designs in Comus, with the blaze of Helpmann's temperament commanding the rout. And then, how people laughed (at the ballet]]) at Helpmann in Facade. He wore a natty pin-striped suit, red lined, was wildly be-ringed and even more wildly funny in the Noche Espanol (a number alas now dropped from the ballet). And Fonteyn, in a red sack dress, was turned upside-down without losing her sweetly uncomprehending smile. I was hooked. I didn't care that there was a notice in the programme telling us where the nearest air-raid shelter was, and that in the event of a raid we could (but, inferentially, shouldn't) leave the theatre - though please do not disturb the rest of the audience. No-one ever did leave, and there was no suggestion that the dancers would rush for cover. They stayed. We stayed. Thereafter my pocket-money could pay for a rail ticket to London on Saturday afternoons, a glass of milk and a bun for lunch, and a seat in the pit for matinees at the New and Prince's Theatres. In a world not without its tensions even for a schoolboy, ballet - and the zest of the then Sadler's Wells troupe - was an abiding joy. The red and gold disease, the mania - it was in the Russian Imperial Theatres that the word 'balletomane' was coined  -took hold. I started to learn not only about dancing but about painting - the company was in its golden age of stage decoration, with design by Edward Burra, Oliver Messel, Leslie Hurry as the norm - and to enjoy unfamiliar music. Constant Lambert, as musical director, regularly included orchestral entr'actes in the programmes: even now I cannot hear 'La Calinda' from Delius' Koanga or Lambert's Aubade heroique without being taken back to war-time London. Osbert Sitwell once declared that he was educated in the holidays from Eton. The best part of my schooling was owed to those early matinees.</p>

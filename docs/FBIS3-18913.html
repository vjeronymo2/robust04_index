That is not incomprehensible:  On Capitol Hill the Republican opposition is shouting as loud  as possible that this scandal is "a new Watergate" that could  cost President Clinton his head.    This conclusion is premature and completely wrong, but  politically the Republicans are absolutely in the right. They  are using "Whitewater-gate" to reduce Clinton's political clout  and block reforms like those in health care. They also are  hoping to win seats in November's congressional elections.    Will Whitewater be the proverbial banana skin on which  Clinton slips? Is it certain that the President and his wife  were involved in a financial scandal in the period when Clinton  was governor in Arkansas? It is unclear how deeply the couple  have gotten themselves in a jam. Moreover it is doubtful  whether the investigation by the independent prosecutor will  yield criminal evidence.    All the same Clinton and his staff have operated in an  exceptionally clumsy way. The fact that people are talking  about Whitewater-gate is the result of the Clintons' failing  personnel policy. They surround themselves with friends whose  quality is open to discussion. Bernard Nussbaum, the dismissed  financial advisor, is just such a good friend, but a bungling  lawyer.    Peace will only return to the White House when the Clintons  replace their pals, like the weak chief of staff Thomas McLarty,  with political professionals. Keeping a tidy ship means not  only being open in the Whitewater investigations, but also doing  away with amateurism.</p>

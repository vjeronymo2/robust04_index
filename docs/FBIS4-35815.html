			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 6 Jun (MENA) -- Last night Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa received Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, PLO  Executive Committee member; and Ahmad Quray', minister of  economy and trade for the Palestinian National Authority. They  reviewed the Palestinian-Israeli peace process and the steps  taken so far by the PLO to implement the Palestinian self-rule  agreement in Gaza and Jericho signed in Cairo on 4 May.    Musa and the Palestinian officials also discussed the  difficulties and obstacles facing the completion of the  implementation of the agreement and the return of PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat and the members of the Palestinian leadership to  Jericho and Gaza. The difficulties and obstacles are  represented by the lack of necessary funds for the Palestinian  National Authority. So far the Authority has not received the  funds promised by donor countries.</p>

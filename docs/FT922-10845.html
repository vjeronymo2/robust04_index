			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Hoechst declines 26% to DM605m in first quarter HOECHST yesterday continued the tale of woe from the German chemical companies with the announcement of a 26 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to DM605m (Dollars 367m) in the first quarter of 1992. Nor did the company hold out much hope of an early improvement. Hoechst said it hoped for a more favourable trend in operating profits in the course of this year although no significant revival in business had been seen so far in the second quarter. The first-quarter profit represented a decreased yield on turnover of 5.3 per cent against 7.3 per cent in the same period of last year. In the whole of 1991, pre-tax profits dropped by 20 per cent to DM2.6bn, with turnover 5 per cent higher at DM47bn. The company cut its dividend by DM1 to DM12. Hoechst said that demand had picked up considerably in the first three months compared with last year's fourth quarter, but was still weaker than the normal seasonal level. There were few signs of any economic upturn either in western Europe or the US, with growth slowing down in Germany and Japan. Group turnover in the quarter was 2 per cent higher at DM11.5bn. Volume sales were 2 per cent higher, but prices fell at the same rate under the weight of heavy competition. The higher value of the dollar and yen against the D-Mark accounted for the slight turnover advance. In Germany, turnover was up by 2 per cent; business in industrial chemicals was weak, with the increase coming from higher sales of pharmaceutical products. Hoechst's comments about the slackness of foreign markets were in line with those of Siemens, the German electrical and electronics group, which this week reported an 8 per cent rise in first-half net profits, mainly due to domestic growth. Siemens reported flat foreign business and benefited from orders linked to economic reconstruction in east Germany. Chemical companies have little involvement with east Germany's infrastructural rebuilding. Hoechst said that its exports were weaker, although sales of dyes to the US and pharmaceuticals to Asia were higher. EC business was stagnant. The 12 per cent turnover rise in the US was due to the first-time inclusion of Great Lakes Carbon, the US graphite subsidiary, and the firmer dollar. Business in South America was favourable, except for Brazil.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (10): Uncertainties over EC directive - European rules raise complex questions CONFUSION over the role of the European Community's Acquired Rights Directive in the contracting out of services has spawned a cottage industry of conferences and legal advice. The directive is better known in Britain by the acronym Tupe, after the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations which implemented it in the UK. The directive protects the jobs and conditions of employees when their jobs are transferred from one employer to another. Although the directive has been part of British law since 1981, it was only at the end of last year that it became clear that the protection extended to some cases of contracting out from the public to the private sector. Given that the profit margins of private contractors have often been dependent on cutting the employment and pay of those transferred, this realisation has cast a long shadow over the whole contracting-out process. Nearly one year on, the confusion has not been cleared up, thanks in part to genuine legal uncertainty and in part to the British government's cryptic and defensive attitude towards Tupe. There are two important questions about Tupe: what exactly do the regulations require and where do they apply? Both questions are difficult to answer definitively, but some facts seem clear enough. Tupe requires that staff cannot be dismissed as the result of the transfer of an undertaking, although it may be possible to dismiss people soon after for other reasons. The regulations also insist that terms and conditions of employment cannot be changed without consent and that union recognition must be carried over, too. THERE is less clarity about whether pensions are covered. It had been assumed that they were not covered, but a leaked government letter recently indicated that they might be. Industrial tribunal cases on this point are pending but they may not be sufficient to clear up the confusion. Pensions are important because they are invariably much more generous in the public sector. Exactly where the regulations apply depends on the definition of a 'transfer' and an 'undertaking.' Recent judgements of the European Court of Justice suggest EC judges favour a broad definition of both a transfer and an undertaking which would capture a broad range of the services which are contracted out. It is even possible to be caught when an organisation terminates its existing service and buys in a new service provided by new employees, as the High Court judgement in Kenny v South Manchester College underlined. The government's guidance on Tupe stressed that it is most likely to apply where the new employer employs substantially the same staff to do the same work as before, using the same premises and the same equipment. But that now appears too narrow a definition and, in practice, the government has gradually accepted that Tupe covers a significant proportion of contracting-out cases. Many trade unionists and lawyers would go further - 'the transfers under compulsory competitive tendering which are or will be excluded from Tupe are likely to be the exception rather than the rule,' says Mr Raymond Jeffers of Linklaters &amp; Paines. Important judgements due soon include that on the contracting out of Eastbourne's refuse collection. More industrial tribunal cases are also likely to start coming through in the next few months. But the courts will not provide a single, definitive, judgement. Tupe does not mean the end of contracting out but it does complicate matters. Some contractors have made it clear that if they are unable to substantially reduce staff and cut wages and pensions they will not be able to bid for public sector contracts. Others, especially in higher value-added fields like information technology, have fewer problems and often say they plan to improve pay and conditions. WHAT seems to be happening in practice is that where Tupe applies in central government and the National Health Service, the government is cutting staff numbers through voluntary redundancy before contracting out, thereby reducing the liability of private contractors. Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CDC Research and a lobbyist for private contractors, says that is a key advantage for contractors - 'if redundancy can be solved, then the rest is manageable,' he says. In local government it is more complex. Many Labour-controlled authorities have seen Tupe as a way of fending off government regulations on CCT that they do not like. All authorities have now been warned by the government that they cannot specify whether Tupe applies or not in bidding documents. The government says it is up to contractors to decide whether Tupe applies or not. The difficulty is that if a contractor decides that it does not apply, but a court subsequently decides that it does, it is not clear whether the contractor or the local authority must carry the cost. Local authorities fear that they will be left with large Tupe-related liabilities (still virtually impossible to insure against) that they cannot afford. Mr Christopher Chope, the former Local Government Minister and a pioneer of contracting out in Wandsworth, believes the government's failure to 'take a clear line' on Tupe has made it harder for all concerned. 'They should adapt to the reality of Tupe and make the best of it. The cost-savings may not be so dramatic but the private sector will still be able to improve performance through better management,' he says. To compensate for the lower returns the contractors should be given longer contract periods, he says. He also suggests that as Tupe protects jobs and pay there is no need for in-house bids. The government currently encourages such bids but many observers believe that as they are not covered by Tupe they have an unfair advantage over external bids that are. Despite the change of government in France it seems highly unlikely that the government will succeed in getting a Tupe 'opt-out' for contracting out at the EC level. And to make matters worse, it may also face retrospective claims from the tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs or suffered a deterioration in pay and conditions as a result of contracting-out over the past decade. However, such claims are unlikely to succeed, as even some union officials admit, and the government will certainly tough it out.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party  [of Japan, SDPJ] members of the cabinet Friday [10 March]  criticized the government's farm policy, blaming it for the  current panic in the rice market, officials said.    SDP members voiced concerns about the confusion and  expressed  their skepticism over the rice policy during informal talks  following the day's cabinet meeting, they said.    Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Eiijiro Hata,  who tried to reassure his colleagues about the rice supply, bore  the brunt of the criticism.    Hata, stressing that the government has secured supplies to  the end of August, said the problem is the consumers' rush to  hoard domestic rice.    "We will try to halt such rush purchase through the blend  sales," ordered by the government, he said.    The Food Agency recently ordered rice retailers to sell  domestic rice blended with imports to stop the rush to the  homegrown crop, triggered by the short supply due to a poor  harvest last year.    Prices of domestically-produced rice have soared since  consumers who have found imported rice not as palatable as they  want are trying to stock up domestic rice, while some  wholesalers are reportedly restricting their sales to boost  prices.    Kosuke Uehara, director general of the National Land Agency,  said during the informal cabinet talks that the confusion might  be a product of sloppy management and mishandling on the part of  the government.    Uehara reportedly said "serious consideration" should be  given to securing a self-sufficient supply of food.    Kanju Sato, minister of home affairs, said, "the people have  lots of anxiety about the blend sales of rice" mandated by the  government. He asked whether such a step violates the  Antimonopoly Law.    Sato also pointed to the absurdity of the government's  long-standing policy of reducing rice cultivation in the face of  a declining rice harvest, according to the officials.    The SDP opposed opening the rice market up until the last  minute before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided last year  to lift the long-standing ban on rice imports in the course of  the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, at a news  conference following the cabinet meeting, admitted that the  government, which is responsible for rice supply, cannot be  fully immune to the blame for the rice market turmoil.    Takemura pledged to consider a cabinet member meeting over  the problems as early as next week.    At the Diet, Hirofumi Ueno, Food Agency director general,  said there is no effective way to stop rising rice prices on the  black market.    He told a House of Representatives committee that the most  important task is to promote smooth distribution of rice through  government-controlled channels.    He said an estimated 38 million tons out of the 1993 crop  are  either consumed by growers or sold in the black market.</p>

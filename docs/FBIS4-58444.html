			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arye Gus and Shlomo Raz in Cairo -- live] </F>   [Excerpts] [Gus] Prime Minister Rabin, 'Arafat, President  Mubarak, Foreign Minister Musa, Secretary of State Christopher,  and the heads of the delegations to the autonomy talks sat for  eight hours last night until they settled all the disputed  issues and announced that the agreement would be signed today at  1100.    Last night's session was very contentious. It was fraught  with mutual accusations about reneging on decisions and earlier  positions, and with demands to reopen issues which had already  been finalized. At times, the atmosphere was one of  near-crisis. Occasionally, there were loud verbal exchanges, and  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher had to intervene to calm  'Arafat down.    At 0215 [2315 GMT], Nabil Sha'th and 'Amr Musa came out of  the room to face the press, and Musa announced: There is an  agreement. The sides held discussions and finalized all the  details of the agreement.    Following are the outstanding issues the draft committees  left to Rabin and 'Arafat to finalize:    Jericho's autonomous area: The area from which Israel will  withdraw has been expanded to 62 km, far less than what the  Palestinians demanded. However, the size and fate of this area  may be brought up for further discussion at a later stage. In  other words, this issue remains open.    Positioning a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge:  Israel refused to accept this demand, and a policeman will not  be positioned on the bridge. This issue may also be brought up  for further discussion at a later stage.    Releasing prisoners: This was one of the toughest problems.  Israel refused to release more than the 5,000 prisoners that had  been agreed earlier. As may be recalled, the Palestinians had  demanded the release of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and  Islamic Jihad members who would in exchange undertake a  commitment to stop engaging in terror and to support the  Declaration of Principles. These terrorists will not be  released at this point, but their case may be brought up for  further discussion by the security liaison committee to be  established at a later stage.    Territorial waters: The area to be given to the Palestinians  has been expanded from 3 to 6 miles. They will also be given  fishing rights in another 6 miles further out to sea.    Security activities: This is a very important issue which  could cause problems and disputes in the future. The area of  activity has been increased to 75 meters on each side of the  east-west roads. In any event, the Palestinians will not have  the right to detain or imprison Israelis, and they will have to  summon a joint patrol. The Palestinian police force will not be  allowed to detain uniformed Israeli security troops and  vehicles. Israel will have the right and prerogative to any  immediate reaction -- or engagement [last word in English], as  this is defined in the agreement -- to any operation or incident  which might endanger lives or property. However, the aim will be  to end the incident and to defer its handling to the Palestinian  police force as soon as possible. [passage omitted]    [Raz] Another decision made last night was to append several  letters to the agreement. One letter deals with an issue which  had been finalized, but the Israeli delegation nevertheless  pressed to put it in writing: Yasir 'Arafat will not be able to  enter the area bearing the title of president, but that of  chairman of the PLO.    Another issue spelled out in a letter has to do with the  talks about the early transfer of power in other areas of the  West Bank other than Jericho, which will begin at once. This  issue had been in dispute for many months and was raised in  Washington more than once. [passage omitted]</p>

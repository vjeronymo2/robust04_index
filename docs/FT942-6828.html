			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / US sends famine mission to E Africa President Bill Clinton said yesterday he was sending a special delegation to examine conditions in East Africa, where a possible famine could threaten the lives of nearly 20m people, Reuter reports from Washington. A White House statement said Mr Clinton had asked Mr Brian Atwood, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, to head the bipartisan delegation including members of Congress and private organisations. The group would try to prevent mass starvation in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya by investigating and then raising and co-ordinating more help from global organisations. 'The crisis in the east Africa region threatens every nation in the region and is caused by drought conditions and civil conflicts,' the White House statement said. 'At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid widespread famine, but an estimated 20m people are currently at risk and may have to leave their homes to search for food.' It said concerted regional and international action two years ago prevented a similar drought in southern Africa from becoming a severe famine. 'Our effort to head off the incipient famine will be both short- and long-term and will help the nations of the region address what have become chronic food shortages.' The delegation is to examine programmes sponsored by the US government and other donors in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya, and meet heads of state and government representatives. The current delegation will travel to Rome, Geneva, and Brussels to seek increased aid for east Africa. The White House said it would meet officials of the World Food programme, the Food for Agriculture Organisation, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and leaders of the European Union.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ST. AUGUSTINE FORFEITS 12 FOR USE OF INELIGIBLE PLAYER  </P> <P> The St. Augustine High School boys' basketball team must forfeit 12 games,  including two in the City Harbor League, for using an ineligible player, school  officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> St. Augustine had been tied for first in the league with Coronado and Christian  (3-1), but the forfeits -- including league losses to Coronado and Marian  Catholic -- leave the Saints at 2-19 and 1-3.  </P> <P> Coronado is first alone at 4-0.  </P> <P> "It was an oversight that has since been cleared up," said Marty Martin, St.  Augustine athletic director. "The public-to-private transfer waiver form was  never signed by the player."  </P> <P> Martin said the oversight was discovered after an athlete from another sport  had a routine interview with Principal John Sanders. It was discovered that the  athlete hadn't signed the waiver form, leading Sanders to ask Martin about the  basketball player. When the mistake was discovered, St. Augustine immediately  notified the San Diego Section office, and the form was signed.  </P> <P> The player missed St. Augustine's 79-76 victory over Clairemont but was back  for the Saints' 92-88 overtime victory over University City Friday.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Clinton balks at ultimatum to Haitian regime PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday told Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, exiled Haitian president, that he would not now issue a formal ultimatum to the military regime demanding that the country's legitimate government be restored by a given date, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. But he is sending a special envoy to Port-au-Prince to tell the coup leaders that US patience is wearing thin. The administration is furious with the human rights abuses of the Haitian regime, but it also has misgivings about Fr Aristide's democratic credentials.</p>

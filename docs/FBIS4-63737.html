			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Pavlov report under the "Veterans" rubric: </F> "`Democratic Russia' Wants to Be a Party Again. Mr. Yakunin  and Mr. Ponomarev Still Have a Grudge Against Mr. Yeltsin and  Mr. Gaydar"]    [Text] A meeting of the heads of regional branches of the  "Democratic Russia" movement was held on 21 and 22 May. Taking  part in it were 100 delegates representing 40 regional  "Democratic Russia" organization. Leaders of the "Democratic  Russia" regional branches who voiced the intention to join  "Russia's Choice" were not invited to the meeting.    Those present held a discussion on the political situation  in  Russia and the situation in the democratic movement. They also  discussed questions pertaining to forming, on the basis of the  "Democratic Russia" movement, a party of the same name. After  long debates, some 30 heads of regional branches thought it  necessary to sign a manifesto, "Our Principles," thus  automatically becoming members of the organizing committee of a  Federal Party of "Democratic Russia" (FPDR). Its founding  conference is not scheduled until this fall.    "Democratic Russia" leader Lev Ponomarev, who became  chairman  of the new party's organizing committee, thought it necessary to  point out that the democratic movement is going through a  crisis, while "the reforms have backfired, the president's will  is absent, the president has become fenced off from democratic  structures." In Mr. Ponomarev's opinion, the current problems  experienced by the democratic movement have been caused by  actions of the organizing committee of the emerging "Russia's  Choice" party, in Lev Ponomarev's phrase, on the bones of the  eponymous election bloc.    Gleb Yakunin, Mr. Ponomarev's colleague and long-standing  comrade-in-arms, accused the "Russia's Choice" leaders of having  dealt a formidable blow at Russia's democratic movement. At the  same time Mr. Yakunin predicted a swift downfall for "Gaydar's  party," pointing to the fact that regional branches are leaving  "Russia's Choice" while many leaders of the parliamentary  faction are displeased with Yegor Gaydar's actions and "are  contemplating possibly leaving the bloc."    Besides, the cochairman of "Democratic Russia" leveled sharp  criticism at President Yeltsin. "Shame on Boris Nikolayevich  that he did not even give `Democratic Russia' any premises  through these years, as neither did Sergey Filatov. This is the  style of ingratitude," Mr. Yakunin complained. However, Mr.  Ponomarev pointed out that he still continues to pin hopes on  Boris Yeltsin alone. At the same time, yet another "Democratic  Russia" chairman, Galina Starovoytova, who also spoke at the  conference, thought it necessary to state: "With all respect  for Boris Yeltsin, and despite his tremendous merits and a great  historic contribution to the cause of the country's democratic  development, is still politically on the way out."</p>

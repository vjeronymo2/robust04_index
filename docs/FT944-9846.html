			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: The code few people can crack - An airline practice that is worrying some passengers It was not so long ago that the phrase 'airline code-share' crept into use. A consumer-oriented magazine uncovered the practice and suggested it was misleading; airlines went on the defensive; industry trade bodies applied pressure; and the victims - air travellers - grappled with the new concept. Airline code-sharing is a simple process. It is when two airlines use a single flight designator - or flight number - to market a through service. It can mean that while you are booked on one airline you can unexpectedly end up making part of your journey on another airline. Travel agents have difficulty discovering whether a flight is code-shared or not. Not all airline computer reservation systems highlight the practice early enough in their listings. As a result, booking agents, always under pressure to get the job done, often do not warn passengers of what is in store for them. The oft-used example was the code-sharing arrangement between Emirates and Cyprus Airways. If you booked Emirates' flight EK 407 from Dubai to Larnaca you did not fly with Emirates. Rather, you flew Cyprus Airways, whose European-style business class does not match the long-haul comforts offered by Emirates' business class. However, this particular arrangement was ended last week. There is less controversy among industry pressure groups if the two airlines that are code-sharing offer travellers comparable standards. But if they clearly offer different quality and safety standards, passengers are being deceived. If Joe Public books with Airline A in a modern aircraft type, but flies on part of the route with inferior-standard Airline B on an older, less well-cared-for aircraft, there are obviously grounds for complaint. Code-sharing is a worrying trend because its use has spread throughout the airline industry and to all big carriers. Even British Airways code-shares with its US partner, USAir. If you book a BA transatlantic ticket and an onward domestic US leg, you will cross the Atlantic on BA but the US leg will be on USAir. The advantage to airlines is being able to expand route networks with minimal outlay. Instead of competing against one another on the same route, two airlines operate the route jointly. It's not all negative for travellers. There are some advantages. Your baggage is booked through to your final destination; you need only one ticket; and, because of the linking of frequent-flyer programmes, you may want to choose a code-share flight to maximise rewards. As airlines increasingly link with partner airlines to increase their muscle in the marketplace, the code-share trend is set to continue. Business Traveller magazine exposed the practice last March. The Air Transport Users Council (AUC) was on the case, too, and now, belatedly, bodies such as the Guild of Business Travel Agents (GBTA) are jumping on board to express discontent. Passengers' rights are being defended. 'Things are looking up,' says Tony Hockley of the AUC. 'Airlines are making sure it doesn't backfire on them and that their passengers' goodwill isn't lost. I can't believe that any airline would willingly deceive its customers. You can only deceive them once, and they certainly don't want disgruntled passengers.' British Airways now prints on its tickets the name of the airline operating its services, while KLM and Lufthansa also tell their passengers that they are travelling on a code-share flight. United has always placed an itinerary card on the front of all its tickets listing the carriers operating its flights. American Airlines was the first carrier to come out publicly against code-sharing, calling it 'basically deceptive'. But American continues to code-share as it feels obliged to match competitors' tactics. At a conference last month, Hans Mirka, a senior American Airlines vice-president, listed several reasons for opposing code-sharing. Among them: it deceives customers, who are promised one thing and given another; it is 'profoundly anti-competitive', since it creates combinations between former competitors which diminish meaningful price and product competition; and it will 'certainly discourage independent carriers'. The US Department of Transportation is proposing a piece of legislation to clear up the lack of disclosure. Current rules stipulate that a travel agent selling a ticket should tell the customer about code-sharing. But a survey revealed that only 30 per cent of passengers were being informed that they were booked on a code-share flight. In Europe, the EU is considering the issue. The onus is now on travel agents to inform passengers and to take more time to establish whether flights are code-shared or not. Computer reservation systems such as Sabre, Gallileo and Apollo do have the correct information, but it often surfaces on screen only after many promptings. The GBTA set up a lobbying group some weeks ago. What it wants is complete transparency on code-sharing. 'The industry is at fault,' says GBTA chairman David Reynolds. 'You can't pin it (solely) on the computer reservation systems or the airlines. They're both at fault.'</p>

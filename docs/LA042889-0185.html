Final  </P> <P> WILANDER, BECKER WIN AT MONTE CARLO OPEN  </P> <P> Mats Wilander of Sweden and Boris Becker of West Germany, the top two seeds,  continued on a collision course today as they won their quarterfinals at the  $607,500 Monte Carlo Open tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Wilander, top-seeded and ranked No. 2 in the world, topped Ronald Agenor of  Haiti, the No. 10 seed, 6-3, 7-6, 8-6.  </P> <P> "It's the longest I've gone in a tournament since the U.S. Open," Wilander  said.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> At least one commenter misunderstood the statement that: ``The Department also anticipates that stores will utilize point-of-purchase materials that will minimize any labor costs.'' The commenter stated that the assertion was inaccurate because the proposed rule does not allow for point-of-purchase information except as a supplement to the label on each package. This statement was referring to the period after the effective date and before April 15, 1994. Under the proposal, before April 15, 1994, official establishments and retailers would be allowed alternative approaches, such as point-of-purchase materials, for affected products other than comminuted products. The Agency included the above statement to acknowledge that there would be some labor costs associated with point-of-purchase materials, but that such costs could easily minimized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter pointed out that many stores, especially smaller ones, do not have label application guns and questioned basing the estimate for labor costs on the use of label application guns. The Agency was not implying that it believes that most retail stores currently have label guns. However, since hand-held label application guns are low cost option for applying safe handling instructions, the Department would expect to see widespread use of such equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that USDA has dismissed, based upon non-public information, the cost estimates provided by the regulated industry regarding label costs. The reference to non-public information is related to the statement in the proposal that ``Discussions with label manufacturers indicate that the lower prices are available for even small quantities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal points out that the preliminary analysis (published with the interim rule) estimated that the cost of an additional pressure-sensitive label would range from $.01 to $.025. That estimate was based on discussions with label manufacturers and/or wholesale distributors. Most of the comments on the interim rule suggest that the preliminary estimate was accurate. In fact, the most frequent response was that the labels would cost $.01 each. The proposal acknowledged that some comments including one from the U.S. Small Business Administration suggested that some retail firms were paying more. Because the comments on the interim rule are more compelling evidence than provided by the earlier discussions with label manufacturers, the quoted sentence would have been better stated as ``Comments on the interim rule support the preliminary estimate that the lower prices are available for even small quantities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the comment on non-public information, the process of conducting a preliminary regulatory cost analysis involves a wide mix of formal surveys and informal information gathering. In this case the preliminary estimate was based on informal discussions with 4 or 5 manufacturers and/or wholesale distributors of pressure-sensitive labels and the fact that pressure-sensitive address labels are widely advertised at costs ranging from $.01 to $.025. Because the details of the specific label were not available the discussions were limited to general questions concerning the range of costs and the relationship between label size and cost. The information collected was not recorded by name of firm. Individual firm confidentiality is also a standard practice for more formal cost surveys. For example, in conducting the regulatory impact analysis for the nutrition labeling rule, a survey was mailed to 650 meat and poultry firms. Confidentiality of individual responses was assured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comment from a meat industry trade association noted the lack of ``hard numbers'' used in the cost-vs-benefit section. This commenter specifically questioned why the Department estimated that annual deaths attributable to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Escherichia coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 could range from 146 to 389. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimate referred to was published in Agricultural Outlook, Economic Research Service, USDA, AO&hyph;197, June 1993. The discussion in the preamble stated that ``the estimates in Table 1 were developed after the epidemic outbreak of foodborne illness attributed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7 in undercooked hamburgers from a fast-food chain in 1993. Although the States have voted to make foodborne illness from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  0157:H7, a disease that must be reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), such reporting will not be effective for some time. Thus, cost estimates for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be reviewed as preliminary.'' Table 1 from the proposal is repeated here also as Table 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: 'Guaranteed' means one thing and one thing only Sir, In her article 'Guarantees: are they worthless?' (Finance and the Family, April 3), Scheherazade Daneshkhu looked at building society 'promises' and concluded that many were either worthless or meaningless. The loose manner in which 'guaranteed' has been scattered about financial advertising has also given us some concern here at National Savings. We pride ourselves that we pioneered non-risk, guaranteed rate products when we introduced National Savings certificates as far back as 1916. Ever since then we have used the word 'guaranteed' to mean one thing and one thing only  -interest rates fixed and unchangeable for a specified period of time. This is how we apply it in relation not only to savings certificates, but also capital bonds, children's bonus bonds, yearly plan and the recently revived first option bond. The use of the term to mean a rate differential above another variable rate account (usually paying very low interest) is, in our view, a debasement of the language of finance. Its use in relation to products where the interest rate is fixed but the capital is not guaranteed is also disturbing. The various different meanings assigned to the term can only serve to confuse and may actually mislead savers, who may be bewildered enough already as the institutions play musical chairs with their products. National Savings will continue to use the term 'guaranteed' in the single sense of rates which are fixed for at least a year. We believe that other institutions would be doing a service to the public if they were to standardise their own usage to mean fixed rates offered on capitally secure products for a set period of time.

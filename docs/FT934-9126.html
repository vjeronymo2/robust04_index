			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Klockner-Werke sale angers German steelmakers German private steelmakers expressed outrage yesterday at the decision by Klockner-Werke, the diversified steel group, to sell 75 per cent of its steel mill for DM4 to a consortium led by the city state of Bremen, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Officials at Thyssen, the largest steel group in Germany, said the decision was purely political and would run against the European Union's efforts to reduce overcapacity in the European steel industry.</p>

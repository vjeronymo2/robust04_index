Do not go back to sleep. . .  ."  </P> <P> While operating a law office in Victorville, Campbell also served from 1962 to  1972 as a Victorville city councilman and was chosen by the council to be mayor  for three terms.  </P> <P> Campbell is survived by his wife, Donna, three sons, four grandchildren, a  sister and a niece.  </P> <P> Services are scheduled for 10 a.m. today at Kemper Campbell Ranch in  Victorville, with interment in Victor Valley Memorial Park.  </P> <P> The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the Oro Grande  Foundation, St. Mary's Desert Hospital or Desert Hospice in Victorville.  </P></p>

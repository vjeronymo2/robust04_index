			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Kremlinologists will doubtless comb through Professor Stephen Littlechild's report into the electricity supply business. While supply to customers accounts for only 6 per cent of the cost of electricity to domestic customers, the regulator's attitude to the more significant electricity distribution business might shine between the lines of the report. At first sight, the supply review suggests an easy ride for the regional electricity companies. Not only was the RPI-X price cap tightened less than expected, but the RECs have been granted a 20 per cent increase in their allowable costs. Yet there were hints that next year's distribution review would be tougher. Companies such as Eastern, which have got on with cost cutting, are likely to find more favour than those which are dragging their feet. More of the market has been opened to competition, and in this area Offer has decided to eliminate price controls immediately. This shows confidence that competition will develop and will give valuable experience of how newly-competitive markets behave ahead of the deregulation of the domestic market in 1998. The regulator is also developing a yardstick to monitor REC costs which, while not yet a formal benchmark, may become so if price regulation is still needed after the market is fully opened up. However, while life will doubtless become tougher for the RECs as competition increases and regulation tightens, their financial position means that they will still be able to generate strong dividend increases for the foreseeable future.</p>

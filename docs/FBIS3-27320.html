Though there were at one time difficulties and setbacks in  Sino-French ties, the two countries have, on the whole,  conducted fruitful cooperation in politics, economy and trade,  science and technology, culture and other fields, Li noted.    The Chinese premier made the statement when he met with  French Senate President Rene Monory at the Diaoyutai State  Guesthouse here this evening.    Li said that through joint efforts, Sino-French relations  have been improved and brought back onto the normal track.    Not long ago, the two sides celebrated the 30th anniversary  of their diplomatic relations, Li recalled.    He expressed the belief that Monory's current visit and the  forthcoming visit to China by French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur will help improve and enhance the development of the  bilateral ties.    Li also briefed the guest on China's economic, scientific  and  educational situation as well as the pricing reform China is  undertaking.    Monory conveyed to Li the best regards from Prime Minister  Balladur.    In return, Li asked Monory to relay his best wishes to the  French prime minister when he is back in France.    He expressed the hope that Balladur's visit would be a  complete success.    With the improvement of Franco-Chinese ties, the exchanges  and cooperation between the two parliaments and educational  circles would further develop, Monory said, adding that he would  do his utmost toward this direction.    After the meeting, Li and his wife Zhu Lin hosted a banquet  in honor of Mr. Monory and his wife.    Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the  Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), was among present [as  received] at the meeting and banquet.

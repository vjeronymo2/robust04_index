			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Observer: Ken Clarke - supervatman? Kenneth Clarke is but a few days away from his big test, his first Budget as chancellor. Within that is contained yet another struggle: dare he risk the wrath of Britain's newspaper barons by imposing value added tax on papers and magazines? Of course, no threats are openly heard. But Observer understands that the chancellor has been receiving plenty of unsolicited advice. Viscount Rothermere, whose Daily Mail is one of the government's staunchest supporters, has had a two-hour private meeting with Clarke's boss; he can be trusted to have put a persuasive case. Meanwhile, The Spectator magazine, part of Conrad Black's empire, has tried to get into Clarke's good books by letting him win one of its annual parliamentary Oscars yesterday, its debater of the year prize. However, if Clarke has read the memoirs of Lord Lawson, a former chancellor, he will know that one of Lawson's biggest regrets was letting himself be talked out of imposing VAT on newspapers in his 1984 Budget by Mrs Thatcher. 'Look Nigel,' she told Lawson, 'this is a wonderful Budget and you should get a wonderful reception. You don't want to spoil that by putting VAT on newspapers.' Lawson's advice is simple. A new chancellor has only one real chance of slapping VAT on newspapers - in his first Budget.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Britannia ends share deal service Britannia Building Society is stopping its share dealing service with effect from May 31. The society says it has seen a significant drop in turnover and feels that there is a lack of consumer demand for the service, which was introduced at the time of the privatisations. No new transactions will be accepted from May 18 and the society is rebating customers the initial administration fee they paid to open a sharedeal account.</p>

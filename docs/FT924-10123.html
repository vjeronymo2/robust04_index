			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Observer: Stone-thrown As perhaps befits a trustee of the Thatcher foundation, media don Norman Stone was in robust form during his London lecture on the Balkan crisis and the protection of minorities. Arriving 40 minutes late, the Oxford professor of modern history began by explaining he did not believe in minority rights. As a Scot, he had prospered in England with 'no rights whatsoever'. He then proceeded to advocate 'the Balkanisation of everybody', suggesting en passant that Serbo-Croat was 'an invented language, slightly less authentic than Hebrew'. The Serbian problem, he went on, could be quickly solved 'if we recognised evil when we saw it and dropped a bomb on it'. He concluded that Germany should be urged to undertake this task since no other power was sufficiently interested. All of which somewhat threw his audience at the Institute of Jewish Affairs, which had arranged the event. 'I feel sorry for his students, they must be so confused,' was the kindest comment overheard as the listeners, many of them old enough to remember the second world war, went incredulously away.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / As They Say in Europe: A very French view of the world A FEW weeks ago, I wrote unsystematically of the vices and virtues of some European papers and made the mistake, judging by the reaction, of not mentioning Le Monde. It has a charisma that no other continental paper can rival. I remember how, as a student, I would pretentiously be seen with it and later how, from Saigon to Montreal, from Abidjan to Algiers, it was (and probably still is) plucked from the news-stands the moment it arrived. This is not due to the faintly dishonest dating system: Le Monde is published in the afternoon but carries the following day's date, so giving it the air of being what it would not deign to be - the first with the news. It appears in time for the Paris evening rush hour and offers a lot at a time when the average reader has time to take it in. Le Monde does not seem to compete, even though much of the ground it occupies has been under attack, sometimes successfully, by Liberation That ground is the educated centre-left; Le Monde is its ultimate quality daily. As a result, it is often boring and occasionally written slackly. I read some paragraphs, scratch my head and ask French colleagues what it all means. They say: 'Well, you know, it is about, how does one put it? The idea is that one might question certain assumptions, if you see what I mean.' Shoulders are shrugged, hands raised. The paper is run as a kind of co-operative which, presumably, accounts for what Anglo-Saxon readers might regard as its apparent self-indulgence. Writers enjoy themselves on subjects they like. Page two often is given over to accounts of incidents of varying importance which happened on that day 100 or 75 years ago. Those incidents can be minor or world-shaking; it hardly matters. All this pleases the French. Journalists are expected to provoke, not just by being controversial but through jeux d'esprits and being what the English would call too clever by half. The great pillar of this approach is twice as clever as that: Paul Fabra, the paper's chief economic commentator, a man who makes Sir Alan Walters seem non-committal. He also writes tomes about the triumph of Ricardian economics. The didactic approach can be seen even in 'soft' stories. Le Monde's choice might be the same as that of The Times but the approach is different. The other day, a correspondent filed the following item: 'The issue, by the Bank of Mauritius, of a 20-rupee banknote carrying the effigy of the wife of the prime minister, Mr Aneerood Jungnauth, has provoked a lively argument. On the day of the issue, the government was celebrating the birthday of Mrs Jungnauth in the presence of the diplomatic corps. According to the Mauritian press and the opposition, led by Mr Navin Ramgoolam (son of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the 'father of independence'), the coincidence of the two events has sown trouble in the heart of the diplomatic corps and brought discredit on the country . . . the argument has weakened the government coalition, ministers belonging to the Mauritian Militant Movement having not concealed their irritation with the 'clumsiness' of Mr Jungnauth of the Mauritian Socialist Movement. The latter, observers say, listened to the sirens among his 'courtiers' and gradually lost contact with the real country.' Le Monde overlooked the ludicrous aspects of this story and used it to instruct readers in the wider background of contemporary Mauritian politics. The island is French-speaking (although a former British colony) and, therefore, the kind of place to keep before the mind of France. The only trouble is that the reader is left with little idea of what the fuss was about, or why the story appeared at all. Le Monde has its detractors, who complain it is not what it was. Certainly, circulation has fallen from its peak; the paper's correspondents no longer appear in the ambassadorial role they once adopted. This could be because of an incident that friend and foe recall from April 1975. In one of the few despatches to emerge from Phnom Penh the day the Khmers Rouges seized power in Cambodia, the Monde correspondent wrote of the 'glorious liberation' of the capital by the guerrillas and celebrated the victory in terms that, even at that time, seemed excessive. The trouble with the newspaper business is that skeletons rattle around outside the cupboards for years and years. This is hard luck on Le Monde, because it is one of the great institutions of France and one of the world's great newspapers. In recent years, it has gained a new reputation for bravery in exposing sin and stupidity. The paper revealed the corruption at the heart of the socialist establishment; it sorts out the Catholic church in no uncertain terms; it has no fear of Jean-Marie Le Pen's new barbarians; and has the finest political cartoonist in the world. It is still the paper that the would-be intellectual would choose to carry, and the one that could most easily turn him, or her, into one.

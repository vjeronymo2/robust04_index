			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksey Berezhkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- "We are against entering into  polemic in public about vaguenesses which can naturally arise  during the exchange of chemical arms data between Russia and the  United States," a high-ranking spokesman for the Russian Foreign  Ministry told ITAR-TASS on Friday in response to a request to  comment on remarks by CIA Director James Woolsey, who told U.S.  congressional hearings about the U.S. Administration's "serious  concern" at Russia-provided data on her chemical weapons.    "We also have serious questions as regards data provided by  the Americans. We hope to clear the matters up with the U.S.  side during subsequent contacts," emphasised the spokesman who  requested anonymity.    Russia and the United States have created a  confidence-building mechanism as regards chemical arms on a  bilateral basis. The mechanism is in operation and provides for  exchanges of data on the military-chemical capabilities of the  sides and for consultations should questions arise, the Russian  Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

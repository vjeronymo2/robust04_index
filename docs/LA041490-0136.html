			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> DOCTOR LOSES BID TO REGAIN HIS LICENSE  </P> <P> A judge refused Friday to reinstate a doctor's medical license that had been  revoked by state officials after he treated up to 6,000 allergy patients,  including those at an Anaheim clinic, by injecting them with their own urine.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski denied an appeal by Dr.  George R. Borrell to overturn a Dec. 4 cancellation of his license by the  Medical Board of California.  </P> <P> Borrell, 69, operates clinics in Canoga Park and Anaheim under the name Allergy  Control Medical Group.  </P> <P> State medical authorities said Borrell's urine injections constituted an  "extreme departure" from proper medical care. They said Borrell, who attended a  military medical school in Mexico but was described as a "self-taught"  allergist, also exhibited a "shocking and extreme" lack of medical knowledge.  </P> <P> Borrell could not be reached for comment Friday. But in previous interviews, he  has defended his urine injections as a safe and effective "folk remedy" that  has been practiced for more than a century.  </P> <P> While urine treatment sounds "kind of preposterous or ugly or dirty," it had  helped numerous allergy sufferers, Borrell said.  </P> <P> But state medical officials labeled urine injections as quackery, and said they  can lead to infection, kidney failure, breathing difficulties and death.  </P> <P> Zebrowski said his decision was based not on "either tolerance or repugnance  for the concept of urine injections" but on a lack of legal evidence that  Borrell's license was improperly revoked.  </P> <P> Borrell's lawyer, Herbert Selwyn, said Zebrowski and state medical officials  had "already made their minds up" about taking away Borrell's license after  first hearing of his treatments.  </P> <P> State Deputy Atty. Gen. Earl Plowman said the license revocation means Borrell  will have to either sell or close his two clinics.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times last December, Borrell said he injected 5,000 to  6,000 allergy patients with their own urine over a 12-year period. He said only  two or three of them developed infections from the therapy.  </P> <P> State officials acknowledged they knew of no patients who died or required  hospitalization as a result of urine therapy and that they received only one  complaint about Borrell.  </P> <P> But they said many of Borrell's patients were chronic sufferers desperate to  believe that his unusual therapy was helping them.  </P> <P> "This is something we've seen again and again and again in quack cases,"  Plowman said. "There's a lot of people out there who are deathly afraid of  institutionalized medicine, who are looking for quick cures." JACK CHEEVERS  </P></p>

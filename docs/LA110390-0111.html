			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES FOR OTT  </P> <P> The encaustic rose paintings of Sabina Ott exude a heavy, melancholic air.  Their thick, waxy surfaces equate easily to time and seem to embalm each  painting in dark musings about presence, absence or life and death. Ott's roses  are the stuff of memories and old Victorian cards, swollen and fully open. One  rose is much like another, a fact Ott uses masterfully in "Disappearance and  Return No. 19," where she weaves a claustrophobic white web of pattern across  the huge painting's surface. Part bridal gown, part flocked wall paper, the  massed roses vie for breathing room seeming to drown and surface repeatedly  amid milky flotsam. In other paintings the flower's obliteration is more  heavy-handed as the artist washes over portions of imagery with runny veils of  colored encaustic. In a corner of a four-panel painting a single small red rose  evokes a vivid sense of violence. The impact is chilling.  </P> <P> Creighton Michael's driftwood wall sculptures read like Modernist tribal art.  The elegance of his simplified forms recall Louise Bourgeois' sculptures of the  late '40s but Michael's abstraction is more animalistic than figurative. Pieces  suggest fetishistic shields, or abstract animal totems which are delightfully  spry yet surprisingly earnest in their dignity. Perhaps it is the cocky  spontaneity of sanded limbs covered with penciled lines gesturing broadly in  refined courtship rituals that lifts this art out of the reverential doldrums  that affects most fetishistic work. The nobility is there but thankfully it's  got a sense of humor.  </P> <P> Pence Gallery, 908 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, to Nov. 24.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perfectly Crafted Plywood: Erik Levine's three huge plywood forms are tidy  pieces of self-containment. They look exactly like what they are, pieces of raw  plywood perfectly crafted into rounded, vaguely mechanical forms of precise  geometry and resolute functionlessness. Just looking at the unfinished surface  dotted with staples, divided by pencil lines and liberally dusted with finely  sanded wood putty, we know they have everything to do with construction. They  bring out the craftsman in all of us. You want to run your hands over the  surface because that's how you will really know the perfection of the shape and  its fine smoothness.  </P> <P> If this is Minimalism's "what you see is all you get" basics, then Levine's  sculptures have found a constructivist trap door to allow for allusions to  machines and containers of empty space. These Gargantuan models for orange  squeezers, tops or drain plugs reek of industrial ramifications but refuse to  get specific. Instead they bring up formal considerations about sculptural  weight, interior vs. exterior volumes and implied movement retained by static  form. Isn't it fun when something that looks that good before it gets  "finished" can still carry on an intelligent conversation?  </P> <P> Meyers/Bloom, 2112 Broadway, Santa Monica, to Nov. 27.  </P> <P> Occidental Exhibits: Of the four exhibitions going on simultaneously around the  Occidental College campus, the most noteworthy is Michael McMillen's  installation "Atlas Worked." Not as much a full-scale environment as earlier  pieces such as his "The Pavilion of Rain," "Atlas" has more in common with the  running musings of "Train of Thought" seen earlier this year.  </P> <P> United simply by the question "What Shaped Burbank?," the small gallery space  is broken up by three sculptural "points" and a single painting. Most  intriguing is a rusted, padlocked locker which has a bubbling fountain flowing  loudly inside. The sound of liquid splashes coming from the sealed locker  animate and inform the rest of the room with a hidden presence of life. This is  in sharp contrast to the entropy projected by the rest of the works: a slowly  rusting conical mountain of steel junk and a dirt-encrusted old drill press  (the Atlas trade name of the title). On the wall is a painting titled "A Home  in America" that focuses on a junk-laden backyard which backs up to a  construction site where huge grubs are busy moving earth.  </P> <P> Though it's quite spare, there is much to be said for the intelligence of this  piece and the way McMillen allows the viewer to come to interpretations based  on changing physical interaction with the sculpture. It's an experiential  premise that's at the heart of some of the most interesting installation work  being done today by artists like Ann Hamilton and Connie Zehr. In a sense, the  art really only finds meaning through the observer. It's an interesting way for  an object maker like McMillen to get the audience involved in the process of  making the art.  </P> <P> In the next gallery, two painters take off on their own ideas of water in  "Waterfall as Image." For such a hackneyed subject, both artists offer some  nicely arresting abstract landscapes bordering on the figurative. Jean  Towgood's writhing, Expressionist "Fire Falls" are the raw force of nature with  an apocalyptic edge. Her energetic mark on naked canvas and inflamed color are  the exact opposite of Gillian Theobald's icy cold rivers of self-illuminating  swiftness which flow in bleached white blues against solid black rocks. The  polarities form a refreshing juxtaposition.  </P> <P> Painter Jesus Perez makes points with his great sense of humor about death and  pollution in "Dead Issues." Any artist who admits doing research for a Day of  the Dead show by investigating folk tradition and then going to the butcher  shop is in touch with an appealing sense of the absurd. While his paintings try  too hard to be symbolic high art, the drawings are wonderfully inventive and  playful. They are firmly entrenched in the Mexican idea that death and life  have everything in common and are a delightful celebration of that unity. This  is not gallows humor but something more lively.  </P> <P> On view in a different building are the somber, shifting-space interiors of  painter Linda Kallan and the oddly diminutive sculptures of Pamela Burgess. The  space is problematic for the work of both artists but Burgess suffers most with  stone and metal pieces that have great difficulty with their scale.  </P> <P>  Occidental College, 1600 Campus Road, to Nov. 29.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shegelman's Transformation: Russian painter Simon Shegelman's images have  undergone a startling transformation since he left the Soviet Union in 1975.  The linocut and silk-screen prints he made in Latvia, before his immigration to  France and America, were dark, powerfully claustrophobic figurative works  dealing with the emotional pain of regimented oppression. Little wonder that  officials would close the exhibit for "political and ideological reasons."  </P> <P> Since Shegelman immigrated, his work has exploded in a maelstrom of brightly  fashionable colors. He is attracted to the flash and dazzle of the nightclubs  and glittery trappings of "the good life." His paintings are a strange  combination of Chagall and kitschy Leroy Nieman illustration montage. It's  distressing to think that Shegelman could sound the depths of one political  reality so clearly in his early silk-screens yet be so completely bedazzled by  the materialism of another. But perhaps both systems are extremes and that's  the simplification the artist is communicating.  </P> <P> Sherberg Gallery, 665 N. La Cienega Blvd., to Nov. 15.  </P></p>

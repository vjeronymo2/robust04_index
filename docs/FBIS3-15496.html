Motivating its  position exclusively by "goodwill," Tallinn invited Moscow to  conduct consultations "at a high political level" (at foreign  minister level, as Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik  explained). Having assessed the Estonians' decision as  "reasonable," Aleksandr Udaltsov, deputy chief of the Second  European Department at the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry (he  is in charge of the Baltics), in a conversation with  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent noted that Moscow in fact  planned to halt the negotiating process. Yet the Estonians are  to back up their "goodwill" by no less good deeds, and for the  time being the date for a final withdrawal of Russian troops  from Estonia remains open.    Moscow's position is based on three fundamental principles:  the provision of social guarantees to the Russian military  pensioners living in Estonia (10,500 people), the dropping of  claims for compensation for "ecological damage from the troop  presence" in exchange for the real estate left over by them  ("zero option"), and the granting by the Estonians of $23  million to build housing for the withdrawing troops. According  to Mr. Udaltsov, last November the Estonians themselves proposed  the above sum together with the "zero option," at the same time  offering concessions on the issue of military pensioners. Given  this, Moscow promised at the time to move the pullout date to  August 1994. Yet signs are that the Estonians' promises were  just a tactical ploy aimed apparently at the Western public,  which is sensitive to Baltic issues.    In December, it became clear that the pensioners agreement  can hardly be reached: Estonia adopted a law whereby being  "potential enemies of the Estonian people and statehood," they  cannot count on getting citizenship in the republic or any other  political and property rights. Soon Tallinn's position on the  payment of the $23 million also changed. The Estonians stated  that Moscow simply misunderstood them: apparently they meant...  "the Vancouver package," more specifically the $160 million  allocated by the United States within its framework to provide  for the retirees. True, in a hurry to share these outside  funds, Estonia failed to notice that those monies were not meant  for active duty officers.    According to Mr. Udaltsov, in spite of Russia's interest in  getting the troops out of Estonia as soon as possible ("there is  no point in their further presence there"), it cannot be  entirely ruled out that the last Russian soldier may not leave  the republic by 31 August. Moscow will not allow a repetition  of the "Lithuanian precedent" and will not withdraw the troops  until corresponding agreements have been reached. Mr. Udaltsov  is sure that the Estonians will not succeed in appealing to the  United Nations or the CSCE because their resolutions say that  the pullout of troops should proceed on the basis of such  agreements. One is only left to hope that Mr. Udaltsov's  certainty will meet with understanding in international  organizations and that they will not violate their own decisions.</p>

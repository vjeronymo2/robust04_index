			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: First falls at the first hurdle - Serious Money WHERE does National Savings go now that FIRST's interest rate is back among equals? NS is not used to the harsh glare of political examination and it is plain that its role needs to be reassessed. Opinions vary on the reasons for this week's dramatic cut in the rate on offer on the new FIRST Option bond from 7.75 per cent to 7.25 per cent net. These can be divided into two camps - 'conspiracy' theorists and 'cock-up' theorists. Both are partly right. The former would claim that the building societies conspired to blackmail the government with their threats of raising mortgages. They had complained loudly in advance. This might have been more from a wish to maintain profit margins rather than the fear of outright losses. Against this, the very large demand for the FIRST bond must have taken a significant chunk out of the building societies' accounts. Those who believe it was only a 'cock-up' by National Savings also have plenty of ammunition. The official comment made at the FIRST launch that its rate was competitive but 'not the best' proved to be wrong - no building society product could match it, fixed over one year, for such a small minimum investment. And then there is the appalling way in which the interest rate was cut. National Savings was within its rights to cut its rates with almost immediate effect. But to do so with such unseemly haste on a Monday night, while advertisements glowingly promoting the bond were only just off the weekend presses, was an insult to investors. Applicants whose forms were posted on Monday, but which did not arrive before midday on Tuesday, must feel betrayed - even though they are not obliged to take the lower rate now on offer, their hopes had been raised cruelly. Regular readers of these pages will know that National Savings has been offering excellent products for some years. From the consumer's point of view, it is impossible to object to this. National Savings must continue to offer competitive rates of interest as the least risky investment for the small saver. But the government's savings department must show itself to be better organised than it was this week if it is to avoid losing the confidence of investors. And, following the cut in FIRST's interest rate, it also must find another way of attracting funds. To do this, it could overhaul another outpost of the National Savings empire  -premium bonds. Established by Harold MacMillan in 1957, this odd lottery, in which 6.5 per cent tax-free interest is distributed randomly, is now creaking with age. Ernie - the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment which picks the winning bond numbers - seems accident-prone. Last month, we printed in the Briefcase column a letter from a reader who had held the maximum Pounds 10,000 worth of bonds for two years - and had not won a single prize. We also printed National Savings' response: that he had been incredibly unlucky, as he had 10 chances in 11 of winning a prize of some size each month. NS went on to say that Ernie was still random. This provoked a flood of letters from fellow disappointed bondholders, and from statisticians explaining why this result proved either that Ernie was not random or that there had been a human error within National Savings. One reader said: 'Imagine the entire surface of the earth, including the oceans, covered in sand to a depth of three inches. Every grain will win you a prize, except one solitary grain. Your unfortunate correspondent seems to have picked this one up.' The case for replacing Ernie with a more up-to-date computer system is strong. The system for distributing prizes creaks similarly. At present, Pounds 9.5m in premium bond prizes remain unclaimed. Admittedly this figure covers the entire period of premium bonds' existence, which spreads back to 1957, but it does not reflect well either on public enthusiasm for premium bonds or on the effectiveness of those who run Ernie in getting prizes to their winners. Plenty of premium bonds now lie mouldering under beds. Ernie might need to retire - particularly as he will by 1994 face competition from the national lottery, which could be a formidable rival. More attractively, he could undergo a total facelift. At the moment, premium bonds offer the chance of small prizes which barely set the heart alight. Even the biggest prizes, one of Pounds 250,000 each month and four of Pounds 100,000 weekly, barely compete with the football pools. It might be better to continue to offer relatively poor interest rates, (compared with the rest of the NS range), but make the system more of a gamble by offering bigger single prizes. There are strong arguments why premium bonds should offer more of a gamble as they do not compete as investments. Children would be better off with children's bonus bonds, while both the index-linked and fixed-interest five-year issues offer far more security. Premium bonds can play a part in the National Savings range only by offering the (slim) chance of winning millions. People who did not win a prize would have far less reason to feel aggrieved than the people who posted their FIRST applications on Monday night.</p>

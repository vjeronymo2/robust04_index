Maj. Gen. Abubakar,  who was represented by the director of administration at the  Defence Headquarters (DHQ), Maj. Gen. Adamu Dyeri at this year's  enlightenment campaign for soldiers, noted that AIDS was a  threat to the security of any nation. He noted that about 80  percent of AIDS cases spread through sexual intercourse and  urged organisers of the campaign to intensify efforts at  educating soldiers. The director- general of the Ministry of  Defence, retired Maj. Gen. Olu Bajowa who was the chairman on  the occasion, said that most AIDS cases fell within the age  range of 20 to 49 years while most service personnel fell within  that age bracket. He noted that the "high morbidity and  itinerant nature of military duties" increased the potential  risk of contracting the deadly disease by service personnel.  Maj. Gen. Bajowa urged the Armed Forces to "establish  well-defined programme and policies for controlling the spread  of HIV infection in the military and for caring for those who  will be affected." Highlights of the event included video shows  on AIDS and distribution of condoms to all the officers and  soldiers. The Armed Forces AIDS campaign was launched in 1991.</p>

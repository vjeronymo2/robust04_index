			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Brown renews attack over boardroom pay BOARDROOM PAY rises were highlighted by Labour yesterday, as the party launched a new attack on the Tories with accusations of 'double standards' in ministers' approach to wage restraint. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, focused on salary rises for directors in companies where former Tory cabinet ministers are board members. Among the examples he cited was BET, the contract staff supplier, where Lord Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, is a director and where, Mr Brown said, the highest-paid director was awarded an increase of 69 per cent. Mr Brown said Sir John Nott, a former defence secretary, was a director of Hillsdown Holdings where, he said, a rise of more than 200 per cent was awarded to the highest-paid director. Last week Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, signalled a renewed crackdown on wages as he argued that sustaining Britain's competitive advantage would depend on controlling wage costs in particular, and that wage restraint would assist in job creation. Labour's offensive comes against a background of a 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector wage rises in the current year, and the prospect of further public-sector pay restraint in the next year as part of the government's determination to keep to its spending targets. Mr Brown, accusing ministers of 'double standards', urged the government to give a lead in condemning 'this recession irresponsibility'. He told a rally in Burnley there was a need for a change in practice from the 'establishment elite' who received big pay rises while calling for restraint among their staff. Labour aims to press the government by putting down amendments for discussion in the committee stage of the Finance Bill, which starts later this month.</p>

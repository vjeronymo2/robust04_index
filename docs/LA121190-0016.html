			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSEHOLD TOXIC WASTE REPORT IS ORDERED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council panel Monday ordered city officials to return next  week with a report on funding a program to collect household hazardous wastes  from homeowners before the items end up in the regular trash.  </P> <P> The council's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee also sided  with residents who live near Lopez Canyon, the city-owned landfill in the  northeast San Fernando Valley, in expressing unhappiness that the city's  fledgling household hazardous waste pickup program has been stalled.  </P> <P> The city has $957,000 in its budget for such a clean-up plan, but it will  require a City Council vote to free the funds for expenditure. Presently,  release of the funds depends on completion of a report on ways to handle the  expensive job of collecting and disposing of such wastes.  </P></p>

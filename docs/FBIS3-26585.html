			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Jiadong (3769 0857 2767) and Han Ying </F> (7281 5391): "Yunnan Party Secretary Pu Chaozhu on Development  of Relatively Comfortable Villages"]    [Text] Yesterday, at a forum on the development of  relatively comfortable villages in Kunming, provincial party  Secretary Pu Chaozhu stressed: "We must have a clear  understanding of the situation, seize the opportunity, select  the right path, rely on large state-owned enterprises, have wide  connections with scientific research and technological units,  orient towards the two large markets at home and abroad, and  vigorously develop township and town enterprises."    On 24 January the forum on the development of relatively  comfortable villages was jointly held by Kunming party committee  and the city government in Guandu District. Every comrade  attending the forum tried to get the floor and the atmosphere  was lively. Representatives of 19 townships and towns, with a  gross income exceeding 100 million yuan, and of six offices  throughout the city attended the forum. Sun Gan, secretary of  the city party committee, Vice Mayor Xu Zhixin, Ba Weiguo,  director of the provincial administration of township and town  enterprises, and Li Yuanshu, deputy director of the Provincial  Administration of Township and Town Enterprises, and leading  cadres of concerned counties and prefectures attended the forum.    Guandu District Party Secretary Zhao Jian briefed attendants  on the experience of planning rural work as a whole and bringing  about all-round development of the rural economy by moving  towards a relatively comfortable life. Lianmeng is known as the  "most outstanding township in Yunnan," and what Jin Wenming,  secretary of Lianmeng party committee, said made the argument of  "relying on old townships to march towards a relatively  comfortable life" more convincing. In 1993, the gross income of  township and town enterprises in Lianmeng reached 583 million  yuan, which accounted for 99.8 percent of the gross income of  the whole town. People earned more due to the development of  township and town enterprises, and per capita net income  increased over 1,500 yuan a year, thus leading to a relatively  comfortable life. Representatives of the offices of townships  and towns, such as Majie, separately briefed attendants on the  experience of linking up with large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises and with scientific research units, introducing  foreign capital to develop foreign-invested enterprises, and  setting up joint-stock cooperative enterprises.    Pu Chaozhu attended the forum from beginning to end. He  conscientiously listened to the speeches, frequently raised  questions and exchanged views with others, and made systematic  remarks on the question of developing township and town  enterprises.    When talking about the points of fully affirming the results  and conscientiously summing up the experience of developing  township and town enterprises, Pu Chaozhu said that township and  town enterprises in Kunming made a breakthrough and developed by  leaps and bounds in 1993. The gross income of township and town  enterprises throughout the whole city increased by 95 percent  and reached 12 billion yuan. The pace of development of Guandu  District, which had a large base, was startling since it  achieved 129 percent of economic growth and, as a result, the  gross income of township and town enterprise throughout the  district reached 3.738 billion yuan. More gratifying is that  township and town enterprises, whether in Kunming or in Guandu  District, were able to achieve growth in output value as well as  in revenues and tax, and the increase in revenues and tax last  year was over 90 percent. There was huge growth of township and  town enterprises which are joint ventures in nature. This  development trend of township and town enterprises is not  achieved by chance and many practices and experiences can be  summed up because they are not general experiences which are  universally applicable. Rather, we must proceed from local  conditions to sum up unique, rational, and regularized  experience so as to guide future work and practices. This helps  some cadres and people overcome the thinking of "being content  with small improvements" and "being satisfied with small  wealth," so that they will be more willing and capable to run  township and town enterprises.    Pu Chaozhu said: The situation is very good and the  opportunity is hard to come by. We must take the opportunity to  speed up the development of township and town enterprises. He  said: As far as the large development opportunity is concerned,  the old pattern of two superpowers' domination of the world was  broken but a new multipolar pattern has not taken shape, peace  and development is the main trend of the world, and we can have  a relatively long period of international peace to develop  ourselves. In our country, the economy is prosperous,  nationalities are united, and our society is stable. This is an  opportunity of joint development shared by the whole country and  the whole province. As the provincial capital city, Kunming has  its own unique opportunity and superiority: First, Kunming is  the central city of Yunnan, with 40 percent of large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises and 70 percent of colleges  and universities located there. In short, Kunming is the  political, economic, scientific and technological, and cultural  center of the whole province, thus creating extremely favorable  conditions for combining urban areas with rural areas in  accelerating the development of township and town enterprises.  This is called the superiority of developing comprehensive  industries in comprehensive cities. Second, there is marked  superiority in the location of the city. Five railways destined  for coastal areas, Beijing, and Vietnam are linked to Kunming,  six main highways in the province start from Kunming, and  Kunming Airport is being built into an international airport.  In short, Kunming has become the hub of communications and the  center of commodity distribution for those who want to enter  Southeast Asia and South Asia from Southwest China. As long as  we orient toward the 1 billion-strong large market in Southeast  Asia and South Asia while relying on the 1 billion-strong large  domestic market, we have very bright prospects of developing an  export-oriented economy. To develop a commodity economy we must  first have a market. Third, cheap labor and low land prices  help attract domestic and foreign investors to run factories in  Kunming. Such opportunities have emerged inside and outside  China, that is, labor-intensive industries are moving to places  with cheap labor and low land prices, which is very advantageous  to the development of textile, clothing, and foodstuff  industries and manufactured goods for daily use in Kunming. Pu  Chaozhu said: What we have is a dynamic and fleeting  opportunity. We must never miss such an opportunity of  development but rather seize it to accelerate our development.    When talking about how to develop township and town  enterprises, Pu Chaozhu said: We must sum up our experiences  and have a clear understanding of the situation on the basis of  accelerating the development of township and town enterprises.  To accelerate our development, we must have a correct train of  thought and guide the development of township and town  enterprises with the thinking of deepening reform and opening up  wider. The concrete practices are as follows:    1. By relying on large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises and having wide connections with scientific research  and technological units, efforts must be made to develop the  joint-stock cooperative system so as to transform township and  town enterprises into joint-stock enterprises with multiple  systems of ownership. Large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises have capital and qualified personnel, scientific  research and technological units in colleges and universities  have knowledge of science and technology and management as well  as quick access to information, and land and surplus labor is  available in township and town enterprises. If the mechanism of  township and town enterprises is vigorous, the combinations of  urban and rural areas, of science and technology with the  economy, and of opening up and development must definitely be  optimized combinations of factors of production. By so doing,  strong productive forces will be formed to advance township and  town enterprises to a new stage of development, which is the  stage of a large scale of export-oriented development at a high  starting point. As far as the joint-stock system is concerned,  persons possessing science and technology can also become  stockholders. We must develop multiple joint-stock enterprises,  which can solve the problem of insufficient funds in developing  township and town enterprises as well as invigorate them. Large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises should diversify their  products and township and town enterprises should be willing to  play a supporting role and implement socialized production on a  large scale so as to benefit all parties.    2. We must develop an export-oriented economy by taking the  market as the guide and orienting towards the two large markets  at home and abroad. To develop township and town enterprises,  we must have the market concept. Kunming has moved from the  rear to the forefront in the process of opening up to the  outside world and is now being built into a central city opening  up to the outside world. Boundary lines throughout the province  exceed 4,000 km and we can use a number of border trade ports.  Since the economy of Yunnan strongly complements with that of  neighboring countries, we have bright prospects of developing an  export-oriented economy. As long as we aim at the two large  markets at home and abroad, change our domestically oriented  economy into an export-oriented one, and make future plans, it  is absolutely possible to advance our economy to a new stage in  one to two years' time.    3. We must closely integrate, with the spirit of reform,  large processing enterprises in urban areas with the  construction of raw material bases in rural areas. Only when we  intensify our reform can we pour new vitality into the  development of township and town enterprises. An important  content of deepening reform is precisely to change the pattern  of production and management, as well as the system of economic  administration and take an integrative path of development,  particularly integrating large processing enterprises in urban  areas with the construction of raw material bases in rural  areas. Without a stable source of raw materials, the processing  industry in urban areas will certainly fluctuate and make bricks  without straw. Hence, processing enterprises in urban areas  must give priority to the work of establishing raw material  bases, and so do township and town enterprises and state-owned  enterprises.</p>

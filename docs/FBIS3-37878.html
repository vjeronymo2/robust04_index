This will be promoted by the  opening of Kazakhstan's diplomatic missions in more European  countries.    This was mentioned during a meeting on Tuesday between  Kazakhstan Vice-President Eric Asanbayev [name and title as  received] and CSCE Secretary-General Wilhelm Hoeynck who arrived  in Almaty for a working visit. The sides agreed that more  effort should be exerted to put a stop to conflicts in Central  Asia, specifically in Tajikistan.    On the same day Wilhelm Hoeynck met with Kazakh Foreign  Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov. It was noted during the  conversation that following a meeting in Rome of foreign  ministers of CSCE participating countries, new sovereign states  in Central Asia, also Kazakhstan, strengthen their relations  with that international organisation and are involved in joint  work with CSCE.    In the Friendship House in the evening, Wilhelm Hoeynck met  with representatives of non-governmental and public  organisations and the media and answered their questions.    The CSCE secretary-general leaves for Bishkek on Wednesday.</p>

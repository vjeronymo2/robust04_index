			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LITTLE SHOP' STILL THE GIDDIEST OF MINOR MUSICALS  </P> <P> Buena Park Civic Theatre's "Little Shop of Horrors" can be strident at times,  and slow-moving at others, but it still is a reasonably diverting treatment to  this giddiest of minor musicals.  </P> <P> You visit "Little Shop" to get dizzy with its cornball rock score and daft  plot, based on the infamous Roger Corman movie of the same name. All we want  are decent, strutting voices, a little character in the characters of Audrey  and Seymour, and a big, hungry mouth for Audrey II, the man-eating plant from  Planet X.  </P> <P> Director Gary Krinke gets by with a cast that, for the most part, is more  competent than accomplished. But it's enough, though barely -- if you like  "Little Shop" (and I always have), there's fun to be had, and Krinke taps into  that fun a fair amount of the time.  </P> <P> Lynda Blais is a rather restrained Audrey, avoiding the kinetic yammering that  has marked other interpretations. But she nonetheless is able to give us an  Audrey that is part adorable Kewpie doll and soulful dits. Her voice, while not  a knockout, is the production's best, although there's not a lot of  competition.  </P> <P> As her soul mate and the young nebbish that discovers (and feeds) Audrey II,  Kevan Quinn's Seymour is pretty standard. He's innocent, insecure and dorky.  Quinn is satisfying, but not remarkable.  </P> <P> The same can be said for most of the rest of the cast, including the voice  behind Audrey II, Roland Holliday Hills. He booms just fine -- yep, we do get  the idea that this is one starving, hostile plant -- but there aren't any  surprises brought to the role. It's about time directors and actors started to  come up with new twists for Audrey II.  </P> <P> 'LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS'  </P> <P> A Buena Park Civic Theatre production of the Howard Ashman/Alan Menken musical.

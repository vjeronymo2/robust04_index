			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> POINTERS GET ANOTHER BIG VICTORY  </P> <P> Point Loma, trailing by two points after a see-saw first half, rallied behind  the passing of Danny White to defeat visiting Dorsey, 36-34, Friday afternoon.  </P> <P> Fresh off an upset victory over then top-ranked Rancho Buena Vista last week,  Point Loma (2-2) made it two in a row in game marred by 17 penalties. Dorsey is  1-2.  </P> <P> "I think we hung in with them," Pointers' Coach Ben Edens said.  </P> <P> Point Loma hung in there until it could put together the big plays it needs to  win.  </P> <P> It got them from Danny White, the county's leading passer, who completed 12 of  19 passes for 226 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> "We knew they were a good team," White said, "and it came down to a few key  plays."  </P> <P> The Pointers made two key plays at the start of the fourth quarter to turn the  game their way. J.J. Stokes caught a 30 yard pass from White to jump ahead  28-22.  </P> <P> On the next play, Cliff Ransom recovered the ball on an onside kick to give  Point Loma another opportunity to score. Brett Callan caught a 48-yard pass  from White to make it 34-22. Callan had six catches for 128 yards and two  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Ahead by 12, Point Loma went for the two-point conversion and got it when White  passed to Callan.  </P> <P> The two-point conversion became critical because Dorsey, trailing 36-28, scored  with five seconds remaining when Kevin Copeland caught an 18-yard pass from  Chris Cook to close the gap to 36-34. Dorsey had to try for two points, but a  failed run gave Point Loma the victory.  </P> <P> Kevin Perreira, one of Point Loma's leading rushers this year, was helped off  the field with an ankle injury 10 minutes into the game.  </P> <P> "We lost a very important ball carrier," Edens said, "but he will be back."  </P> <P> Point Loma came back without him Friday.

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Delegates lectured on the facts of political life THE serious and sober mood of the conference this week has been summed up by the background to the platform: black and grey far outweigh the small splashes of traditional Liberal Democrat yellow. A sense of discipline has been imposed from the top. Instead of basking in the by-election successes of Newbury and Christchurch, and good results in the county council elections, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, lectured representatives yesterday about not missing their opportunity. The appeal to make the most of the chance to turn 'hope into trust . . . support into confidence . . . protest into power' seems to have two targets. The first, and most obvious, is the kind of local campaigning tactics which bring the national party into disrepute. While the accusations of racist tactics in Tower Hamlets did not derail the conference, the consequent insistence by speakers throughout the week that racism would not be tolerated served as a continuing reminder of the level of embarrassment over the issue. The second target is national policy-making. While in some ways the conference has seen a clear shift to the left compared with previous years - for example over a commitment to full employment, increased caution about market mechanisms and a hardening of opposition to rail privatisation - the party has also recognised a need to produce less hostages to fortune. But the most vivid example was yesterday's vote on pensions. By voting down a move to uprate pensions in line with earnings, the party passed what the leadership saw as a political maturity test. Mr Ashdown went out of his way to congratulate delegates, albeit in the somewhat double-edged terms of having made a 'courageous' decision. But there is something eerie in seeing a party whose best prospect at the next general election is to win up to 40 seats of the 650 at Westminster, behaving as though its entire spending programme was about to be costed by Tory Central Office for a campaign starting next week, and to be put into practice the day after that. It may be a reflection of Mr Ashdown's view that the present parliament will not last until the end of its natural life in 1996 or 1997. There are snares ahead even in the coming months. If the party does not do well in the London local elections in May, if it suffers from its pro-Europeanism in the Euro elections next June, or if the next parliamentary by-elections happen to be in seats where Labour would be the obvious beneficiary of an anti-government protest vote, then the bright lights of the political big time may recede and the pleasures of responsibility fade. In the language of growing up that has been a key theme this week: the Liberal Democrats are old enough to drive, but you might still want to wait a while before lending them your car.</p>

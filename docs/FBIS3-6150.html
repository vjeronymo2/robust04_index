Taking part in the ceremony were Mr. Phimpha  Thepkhamheuang, deputy minister of agriculture and forestry, Mr.  Masao Wada, ambassador of Japan to Laos, Mr. Boun-gnang  Volachit, mayor of Vientiane and other high ranking officials.    The project received a grant aid of 2,212 million yens from  the Japanese government and an input of 128 million kip from the  Lao government. The construction of this integrated rural  development project, one of the main national scale development  projects in the country, started in 1991. By the beginning of  this year, it is basically finished.    The main pumping station houses five pumps so far four have  been installed. The facility has a 95,600-metre principal canal  network. Of this 9,415 m is made of concrete. The secondary  canals are over 71,000-m long. There are 915 sluices. Roads  along the canal network are 108,600-m long. In addition, water  reservoirs and drinking water system have been established in  Ban Sai, Ban Na Ke, and Don Noun. A three kilometre  inter-village dirt road and a water control reservoir system  have been built. The latter covers an area of almost six  hectares.    The facilities can irrigate 1,000 ha of arable land in  Saithani District and 200-700 ha in Saisettha District, in all  1,700 ha. For this current dry season, 112 ha can be planted  with second rice crops, in addition to six hectares of land for  vegetable gardening.    The purpose of the establishment of this integrated rural  development project is to provide farmers facilities to plant  two rice crops per year. Along with this, they can engage in  agriculture and livestock activities all year round. It is hoped  that the project can provide food stuff to Vientiane Prefecture  market and step by step the project's products may be exported.  The facilities should allow farmers in the project area to  generate more income, thus their living condition can be  improved. The project also provides water for drinking and makes  rural communities more accessible.</p>

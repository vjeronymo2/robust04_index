			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patricia Winckelmann-Zilliacus: "Labor Minister </F> Irritated Over Charges of Passivity"]    [Text] The goals for government job programs this year is  to end unemployment for a total of 300,000 of the unemployed. In  itself this figure does not contain much that is new, since in  1993 almost as many people were put to work through support  measures or received job training.    Government officials responsible for labor market programs  are angry at being charged with not doing anything to combat  mass unemployment. In connection with providing information on  two new job-creation measures, the [Labor] Ministry took the  opportunity to more generally report on what is being done and  what goals are being striven for in the active job-creation  policy this year.    "I venture to assert that unemployment in March or April  will  start to decline. Unfortunately, we estimate that the  unemployment rate for the entire year will be 19 percent. It  would be important to be able temporarily to end unemployment  for as many as possible. It is a horrifying thought that at the  end of the year we will have 200,000 long-term unemployed. The  primary goal in this year's job creation programs is to end  youth and long-term unemployment for as many as possible," said  Labor Minister Ilkka Kanerva in presenting the Labor Ministry's  goals.    There are currently 56,000 individuals who have been put to  work through some sort of job-creation support. There are 27,000  unemployed people receiving job training. These measures have  time deadlines. Most subsidized jobs are for six months;  training programs are generally four months. The reason for  these time limits is to reach as many as possible. Those with  temporary jobs or in training programs are not counted in the  unemployment statistics. This group usually goes under the  category of "hidden unemployment." This means that Finland  actually has closer to 620,000 unemployed (24.5 percent of the  work force). Sweden, which traditionally has worked very hard on  an active job-creation policy, has an open unemployment of 8  percent. If those who are participating in active measure  programs are included, the Swedish unemployment rate is 14  percent.    "Despite the catastrophically high jobless figures in  December, there are many indicators that the employment  situation is about to slowly turn for the better. Unemployment  lasting durations of less than three months has more or less  stopped increasing. In December 15,600 unemployed got jobs in  the normal labor market. This is 43 percent more than in  December 1992," said Kanerva.    He pointed out that job-creation policy cannot perform  miracles. Above all, it is monetary and fiscal policies that  most effectively can improve employment. His hope is that the  Bank of Finland [Central Bank] will consider the exceptionally  high unemployment when planning strategy dealing with monetary  policy. Interest rates must be further brought down in order to  get activity in the domestic market under way.    Business employment thresholds must made lower. This means  that the indirect wage costs, at least for small businesses,  must be reduced. "Alongside these important economic measures  the Labor Ministry is trying to end unemployment for almost  250,000 persons. From 4 to 5 billion markkas have been earmarked  for job creation in the supplemental budget that will be  presented in February. Next fall we will concentrate on a job  creation program for youth that should provide training places  for 35,000 young people," said Kanerva.    The Labor Ministry estimates that unemployment will begin to  drop by March or April, but it will drop very slowly. Around  December 1995, it is estimated that unemployment will still be  around 15 percent. How the level of long-term unemployment will  be then remains to be seen. Researchers studying unemployment  are entirely in agreement that a long period of high open  joblessness leads to permanent unemployment, which takes a high  toll on society both economically and socially. Denmark, whose  economy for the moment is among the best in Europe, is still  fighting with an unemployment rate of 11 percent. A little over  300,000 Danes have been without jobs for longer or shorter  periods.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Tiny Tim stands in for Pavarotti - Serious Money ACCOUNTANTS, financial services companies and journalists seize upon the Budget with glee every year. It gives them respectively a chance to show off their expertise, an opportunity for a sale and something to write about. The poor consumer is less convinced. He gets swamped with confusing detail, and usually finds himself little better off at the end of it. This year, the hype before the Budget was bigger than ever. According to the media, chancellor Norman Lamont was going to put on a show to win the conservatives the election. The consumer was entitled to expect Pavarotti. He got Tiny Tim. Lamont had much less in tax cuts to give away than expected, and with an election imminent, he had no time to introduce complex legislation. Indeed some of the changes he announced did not make it into the shortened Finance Act which was rushed through Parliament yesterday. Some can be implemented by orders; others will have to wait and may never re-appear. The changes to inheritance tax, which will exempt farmers and many small business owners, will have to await a new Conservative government, if there is one. The IHT threshold will not go up to Pounds 150,000, as he announced, but to Pounds 147,000, pending John Major's return to Number 10. The Business Expansion Scheme now knows its fate, but not the time of its execution. Norman Lamont will kill it off at the end of 1993, Labour probably earlier. At least the change to PEPs has gone through, a move universally seen as a 'good thing'. A full Pounds 6,000 can now be invested in either a unit or investment trust PEP. Plans can now be simpler, cheaper and offer a better spread of risk to investors; indeed the change is so beneficial, one must ask why on earth the government did not introduce it before. But most consumers and investors will judge the Budget by its personal tax proposals. Here the centrepiece was the introduction of the new 20 per cent band of tax on the first Pounds 2,000 of income. This certainly seemed to catch the Labour party on the hop, although it had been astutely predicted by Price Waterhouse (as reported in the Finance &amp; the Family pages three weeks ago). Labour has been forced to vote against the change, and promise to repeal it. That has put the party in the position of opposing a measure that will benefit the lower paid. Any reduction in tax is going to be good news for the low paid, or elderly investors who are surviving on a modest pension and savings. But the new band, which will reduce individual tax bills by Pounds 100 per year, has not exactly provoked nationwide celebrations. Even with the indexation of the single person's allowance (which the Chancellor is virtually obliged to announce), a basic rate taxpayer will only be Pounds 137.50 a year better off. And that is a benefit that will only accrue in 12, and in some cases 52 instalments. It hardly seems enough to 'kick start' the economy. Nor does it look, so far, like the master stroke which will ensure that the Conservatives will win the election. In recent electoral history, governments have very rarely made progress in the course of elections. Given that Labour's lead is so narrow, the probabilities now start to favour a hung parliament. That means more uncertainty for individual investors. However, one aspect of the Budget which might bring a benefit to savers (although not mortgage borrowers) is that the foreign exchange markets were completely unimpressed. The pound still languishes at the bottom of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and that seems likely to rule out a cut in interest rates before the election. If there is a hung Parliament, or a Labour victory, interest rates could even rise in the short term, in order to defend the pound. That could be an opportunity for investors to lock in to temporarily high returns, perhaps via the new National Savings issue in July. Norman Lamont is forecasting a fall in inflation to 3 per cent next year. So if the new National Savings issue is over 10 per cent, a basic rate payer would be getting a net real return of 4.5 per cent, comparable with the index-linked certificates, but with access after a year. Index-linked will still be a good hedge, for those who can wait for five years, since inflation may well rise in the mid-1990s, as the effect of the government's Budget deficit starts to work through. And for higher rate taxpayers, the offer of 8.5 per cent tax-free on savings certificates is still there. Under Labour's tax regime, they will look even more attractive.</p>

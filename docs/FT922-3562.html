			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Farmers bring traffic chaos to Toulouse FARMERS blockaded the southern French city of Toulouse yesterday, stranding thousands of motorists for hours, to protest against the reform of the European Community's farm policy, police said, Reuter reports from Toulouse. Huge traffic jams built up during the day-long protest and spread to the nearby Gers, Tarn and Haute-Garonne departments. Near Paris, thousands of farmers drove tractors up to the gates of the Versailles palace. They also burnt tyres and clashed with riot police outside the government's local headquarters. The Toulouse protesters lifted the blockade after the region's deputies agreed to meet them on Friday and take up their grievances in parliament.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS  </P> <P> At a press conference held Wednesday to announce what they would like to  announce, officials from the Old Globe Theatre, the Leningrad Maly Dramatic  Theatre and the San Diego Soviet Arts Festival office said they hope to stage  the Maly's production of "Brothers and Sisters" as part of the Soviet Arts  Festival in October. First, however, they need to get the event approved by  Soviet authorities and find the money to cover the budget. "Brothers and  Sisters," a seven-hour adaptation of Soviet novelist Fyodor Abramov's World War  II trilogy, was to have had its American premiere as part of the New York  International Festival of the Arts last summer, but was canceled when the  producer failed to come up with the $450,000 needed to mount the production.  Old Globe managing director Tom Hall shrugged off the expense, saying the price  is comparable to that of producing Steven Sondheim's "Into the Woods" two years  ago. The $6-million Soviet Arts Festival budget announced last fall showed  $250,000 set aside for a theater performance. Details about numbers of  performances, as well as the final budget, are still being worked out.  </P></p>

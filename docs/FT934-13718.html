			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Surge at Southwest Airlines bucks trend SOUTHWEST Airlines, virtually the only US airline to be thriving in the industry's gloomy climate, yesterday reported further strong growth with a 63 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 43.9m for the third quarter. However, the company appeared to sound a cautionary note for the fourth quarter's earnings, saying it was too soon to predict how they would compare with the comparable period's 'truly outstanding' result. The share price dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 as investors took profits. The latest results were achieved through a 61 per cent increase in operating income, to Dollars 86.8m, which in turn were produced by a 23 per cent rise in the number of passengers carried. Earnings per share were up from 19 cents to 31 cents. Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, Texas, has built up market share by offering no-frills services at much lower fares than the bigger airlines. Last month it expanded into the east coast market by opening routes from Baltimore to Chicago and Cleveland. Mr Herbert Kelleher, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the quarter to September was the eighth consecutive one in which earnings growth had exceeded 60 per cent. He said load factors in October had so far been higher than in the corresponding period last year.</p>

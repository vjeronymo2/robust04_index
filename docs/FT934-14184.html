			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (8): Race to supply new global services - Outsourcing / The range of services provided by outsourcers is varied and growing. The staple diet includes managed data network services, electronic data interchange facilities, short-dialling options and electronic mail ONE WORD dominates discourse on the growth of international telecoms operators: outsourcing. The growth potential of the market for outsourcing the telecommunications requirements of multinational companies and other large organisations is the single most cited rationale for the international ambitions of the leading telecoms operators. There is little agreement on the size of the market. When AT&amp;T launched its WorldSource initiative in May, it talked of 4,000 to 5,000 'target multinationals'; a month later, at the inauguration of its Dollars 5.3bn partnership with MCI, BT was touting a more conservative 400 to 500. Either way, the numbers are large and the ambitions commensurate. AT&amp;T and BT are best placed to become the foremost 'global' outsourcers. Both have the cash to build and integrate global networks; both have significant footholds in large markets in their own right; and both have the wherewithal to attract the foreign partners necessary to meet the needs of most multinationals. AT&amp;T's international outsourcing venture, 'WorldSource,' is an alliance with Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa and Singapore Telecom. Unitel of Canada, Telstra of Australia and Korea Telecom are set to join soon. The alliance is already in the market for outsourcing contracts embracing the North American and Asia-Pacific regions. AT&amp;T is now trawling for European partners with a view to a European launch next year. Suitors are not lacking. BT got off to a hesitant outsourcing start in the early 1990s with the launch of Syncordia, a US-based venture dedicated to the job. The need for a stronger US base became imperative, and it secured one this year with its alliance with MCI, the largest US long-distance operator after AT&amp;T. The two will spend around Dollars 1bn establishing a joint venture company, based in Washington, to develop the global market. Several regional groupings are in the market, too. The most significant are Unisource, an alliance of the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch PTTs; and Eunetcom, a consortium of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. In addition, most national carriers have outsourcing ventures catering for domestic companies. Cable and Wireless, the UK group, has an international network of its own, so offers a far more than domestic service. The range of services provided by outsourcers is growing - it typically includes managed data network services, electronic data interchange facilities, short-dialling options and electronic mail. Most of the outsourcers are developing software tools to allow virtual private networks to interwork and to support a common set of features such as seven-digit dialling. Total or partial network management is widely on offer, with operators touting to take over complete ownership of private networks. It is not just the familiar US multinationals that are in the market for global outsourcers. BT won a milestone Pounds 400m contract last month with Grupo Santander, Spain's fourth largest financial services group and parent of Banco Santander. The contract gives BT ownership and management of Grupo Santander's data communications network covering 31 Spanish cities, which it will manage, upgrade and use to offer a range of managed data communications services to Spanish companies and other large customers. Governments are also jumping on the bandwagon. Dedicated across much of the world to the virtues of 'hiving off' the management of all but core state responsibilities like the army and prisons (and sometimes even those), governments are putting their own networks on the market. Some are looking seriously at foreign operators, not just their national PTO, to take on the job. Meanwhile, the UK government has just tendered for its national long-distance network, linking government offices. Mercury Communications, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, won the contract. The runner-up was Telstra, the state-owned Australian operator, which has a UK public telecoms operator licence and is working hard to build up its business outside Australia. For Telstra, victory would have been particularly sweet, since BT recently won the contract to run the New South Wales government's contract in Australia. Outsourcing is not a one-way unstoppable train. Last year Shell put its telecoms network out to tender, stipulating that the outsourcer would have to cut its communications costs. It withdrew the tender, reportedly because all the bids came out more expensive than Shell's in-house operation. It is having another go this year. Meanwhile, the European Community has given a gold-plated gift to the outsourcers, in the shape of its refusal to force member-states to open their public 'voice' networks to competition before 1998.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- Today Bulgaria assumed the  chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of  Europe [CE] for the next six months. "Bulgaria's prestige in  Europe and the world will depend on its performance as chair of  the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Ministers,"  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said upon his  departure for Strasbourg.    Addressing the session of the Committee of Ministers,  Foreign  Minister Stanislav Daskalov outlined the main points in the work  of the committee during Bulgaria's chairmanship.    "During the past few years the Council of Europe has proved  capable of meeting the challenges of the new developments on the  continent. Our present time, however, is so dynamic that we are  already facing new realities, requiring our organization to  adapt itself to them and develop still further its ability to  react rapidly and adequately," Mr. Daskalov said.    "The future profile of our organization depends on the  successful and balanced solution of the problem of the  enlargement of the Council of Europe (...) which should continue  without lowering the standards for membership," Mr. Daskalov  said in his address.    "Political dialogue should be deepened and intensified. Not  only in view of enlarging the organization, but also of  stabilizing its achievements and of further reinforcing and  adapting the Council of Europe's actions, including in certain  fields evaded by now. This is the only possible way to enhance  the democratic changes in our societies and to harmonize our  efforts in European unification. In this respect we consider  the increase of the role played by the Committee of Ministers as  the central policy-forming and decision- making body of the  organization to be of crucial importance.    "The complexity of the new tasks to be solved and problems  to  be overcome demands an ever increasing consolidation and  intensification of the coordination between the Council of  Europe and other European institutions involved in the  construction of a democratic security system in Europe. In  particular we consider it important to strengthen the  co-operation with the European Union. Relations with the CSCE  should also be further stimulated," Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov said.    Mr. Daskalov pointed out in his speech that as chairman of  the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe Bulgaria  would make every possible effort to contribute to the common  future of the European Continent and do its best to implement  the decisions of the Vienna summit.    Addressing Secretary General Catherine Lalumiere, Bulgarian  Foreign Minister Daskalov said:    "We appreciate the brilliant way in which you have conducted  the organization during the past five challenging years of its  history -- years which changed its face and its future. We have  witnessed your personal efforts and involvement in these  changes, your devotion to the principles and ideals of the  Council of Europe and of united Europe as a whole. I personally  would like to assure you that in the heart of my country your  name will be associated with Bulgaria's accession to the Council  of Europe." [passage omitted]</p>

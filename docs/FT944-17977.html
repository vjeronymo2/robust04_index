			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (14): New initiatives in South Africa - Regional focus / A rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia As a glance through Johannesburg's leading business newspaper, Business Day, demonstrates, South Africa's days as a trade pariah are well and truly over. The pages are filled with news of new trade conferences, expos from all manner of countries, and a steady stream of high level ministerial visits - including two trips by America's Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown; visits from both British prime minister John Major; and the president of the British Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine - to try and boost international trade links. Reflecting the country's return to favour as a trading partner, there has been a substantial rise in the number of international institutions willing to provide trade finance for South African transactions and of governments giving export credit guarantees. Britain has been at the forefront of these new initiatives, and Mr Major announced a trade guarantee package of over R1bn during his recent visit, a move which makes South Africa one of the biggest markets for the UK's export credit guarantee programme. However, other countries have also been involved, with both Japan and the US announcing new packages and the European Union agreeing to grant South Africa GSP status from next January (although some key goods such as processed fruit and paper products will not be covered under the agreement following French pressure). And given South Africa's excellent payments record, the risks are relatively small. Another particularly interesting development is the rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia. Trade delegations have been arriving from places as diverse as Nigeria, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. As a result, trade with these countries has been growing very rapidly over the past 12 months, albeit off a very low base, and businessmen on both sides are confident that these links will continue to expand. The new interest has been clearly signalled in South Africa's trade figures for the year, and its import bill has been soaring. In the first six months of the year, merchandise imports rose 21 per cent from 1993's levels and in August alone, they rocketed up by 20.8 per cent to a high of R8.07bn for the month. Also contributing to the surge is the desperate need by South African companies to modernise plant and equipment. After having let fixed investment decline to dangerously low levels during the crippling four-year recession that ended last year, many companies are now embarking on long-delayed capital spending, and machinery has accounted for nearly half of all imports. Given that South Africa has a notoriously high propensity to import during times of economic growth, this move may soon send the trade account into deficit. Indeed, the IBCA, the European ratings agency that recently gave South Africa a sub-investment grade rating of BB, cited this is one of the problems with the South African economy. Such an event is made even more likely by the government's declared commitment to start lowering import tariffs in line with the Gatt agreement, a process that began in July with the announcement that duties on motor cars would be reduced. However, despite this, South Africa continues to run a trade surplus, expected to be around R10bn on the year, and although import growth has far outstripped the rise in exports, the country's businessmen are confident that the tide will soon start to turn. South Africa's remains overwhelmingly dependent on mineral exports, particularly gold, but given the fact that the commodity cycle appears to have bottomed out and in light of the continued depreciation of the Rand, the mining industry is expecting a good year in 1995. The government's decision to start restructuring GEIS, South Africa's controversial R2bn a year export incentive scheme, which subsidises companies involved in manufacturing exports, may cause a short-term drop as companies are forced to cope with reduced government aid.

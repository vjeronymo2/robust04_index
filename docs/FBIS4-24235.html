			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paul Barril is back in a tale worthy of science  fiction: The former National Gendarmerie Intervention Unit  commander and former star of the Vincennes Irish saga claims to  be in possession of the black box from the plane in which the  presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed on 6 April. Eric  Jung has just contacted Captain Barril, who accuses the rebels  of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] of having carried out this  attack:    [Begin recording] [Barril] I have not only the black box,  but  also various other items which go with it. I have three reels  from the control tower, I have all the recordings, all the  telexes, all the airport's books, which I went to the spot to  find myself. No doubt you are going to ask me why, but I will  tell you that I have been a specialist in the fight against  terrorism, and that was an attack on two heads of state, which  also killed three Frenchmen, and this attack was planned by a  terrorist group backed by a pseudoterrorist state which is also  responsible for the genocide of the 500,000 Rwandans who have  died in recent times.    [Jung] Here you are referring to the RPF, Paul Barril.    [Barril] Yes, absolutely, and I will give you a piece of  information that is of capital importance to me and to those who  are listening to us: In an attack like that, with two heads of  state and three Frenchmen killed, no proceedings, no inquiry, at  a national level or at an international level, has been launched  by anyone, and this is a flaw in the system of justice, because  there is no international system of justice, and the matter has  not been referred to France, and during the next few days we are  going to lodge several complaints at an international level to  attempt to rattle a little those who planned this attack. Those  who planned it and executed it are responsible for the massacre  of 500,000 innocent people which followed. These are the people  who must be tried, and I have done everything I could: I have  been to the spot, I have been helped by people, I have collated  eyewitness accounts, to point the finger at these people and  bring them to trial so that they can be tried by an  international commission.

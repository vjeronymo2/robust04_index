			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Strike today will ground airline Iberia, Spain's financially crippled airline, will be grounded today as unions stage a 24-strike to protest at a drastic restructuring plan that involves 5,000 redundancies, 20 per cent of the company's labour force, and the break-up of the carrier in order to raise fresh capital through disposals. The stoppage is likely to cause chaos at domestic airports and severely disrupt all air traffic to Spain. Unions rejected calls over the weekend to return to the negotiating table and to reconsider an earlier viability plan in which the management proposed to cut salaries by an average 15 per cent and to shed 2,000 jobs over the next two years. The management said the only alternative to its viability plan was to scale down the airline to a fraction of its present size in order to avert its impending bankruptcy.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WATER WASTE  </P> <P> Did anyone notice the two photos on Page B3 (April 4) of water gushing from  hoses, which were captioned "Stadium Gussied Up for Home Opener?" And on Page  B6 was an editorial "Why Gamble With Our Water," in which we were wisely  advised to make some minor sacrifices to conserve the water supply.  </P> <P> I laughed so hard, I went out and "gussied up" my petunias.  </P> <P> JUNE HUFF  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

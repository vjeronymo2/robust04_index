			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ABSENT HOPE WINS TOP PRIZE  </P> <P> Bob Hope, unable to attend a charity event, bought five raffle tickets at  $1,000 apiece to help out -- and one of them won him the grand prize, including  a $50,000 car.  </P> <P> When host Jimmy Stewart picked Hope's name Sunday, he said, "You're not going  to believe this. It's Bob Hope."  </P> <P> The prize was a luxury BMW, a set of luggage and a trip to Germany.  </P> <P> "Isn't that amazing? I never win a thing," Hope said from his desert home  Monday.  </P> <P> Hope was performing Friday night in Texas and couldn't appear at the Beverly  Hilton Hotel's "An Evening of Elegance." He bought five of the 100 tickets sold  for the benefit for abused and neglected children.  </P></p>

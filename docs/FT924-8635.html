			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cabra delays filing financial statements Cabra Estates, the heavily indebted property company, is delaying the filing of its financial statements for the year to March 31 1992. The Registrar of Companies has approved the move as the accounts cannot be finalised because of the negotiations on debt restructuring and the sale of its two London football grounds. Mr Gordon Young, chairman, told an extraordinary meeting he hoped the talks would end soon and the terms could be put to a further EGM. Cabra owns the grounds of Fulham and of Chelsea, whose chairman, Mr Ken Bates, owns 29.6 per cent of the company.</p>

There was a loss before tax of Pounds 113,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 458,000. Continuing businesses made an operating surplus of Pounds 250,000 (Pounds 342,000) and discontinued activities incurred a loss of Pounds 112,000 (profit Pounds 362,000).

Mr Philip Lovegrove, chairman, said Bart Spices contributed Pounds 55,000 before tax, which was one month as part of the group. Its performance in the current year was well up to expectations and should produce an improved result.

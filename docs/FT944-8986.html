			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Observer: Stinkeroo AXA, the French-based insurance group, wants to expand internationally but may have a problem doing so. The name was originally chosen partly so it would be at the top of any alphabetical list of its sector and partly because it was short, symmetrical and easy to turn into a logo. But in Japan, where the company started operations this summer, AXA apparently means: 'It stinks'. Memorable, anyway.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Special Correspondent Andres Villalonga: "More </F> Promises Than Solutions To Control Third Outbreak of Cholera"]    [Excerpt] Salta--Death and disease continue to ravage this  province, the epicenter of the third outbreak of cholera, where  every day the largest numbers of cholera cases are reported in  Argentina.    Poor neighborhoods and settlements cover large areas where  drinking water and sewage systems are in short supply.    The authorities have said that just a few hours ago another  death was reported in the Lerma Valley, and in the San Martin  and Rivadavia departments the disease continues to spread.    The feeling is that this outbreak will worsen over the  course  of the summer, for even higher temperatures are predicted. There  is no sign of government prevention projects or campaigns, so  more deaths and cases of cholera are expected.  <H5>  Nothing To Be Done </H5>   The deputy governor in charge of internal matters, Ricardo  Gomez Diez, attempted to explain to LA NACION the lack of  projects to put a definitive end to this disease in his  province. "Well, to solve the problem we need over $80 million.  What the national government sends us is not enough, so there is  very little we can do," he said.    He continued: "Even if we had the money the projects would  take a lot of time, and the solutions would come too late; it  will be a long time before cholera goes away. We will have to  get used to the idea that there will be cholera for a while  longer."    When allocating blame, the official said: "We are  responsible, but the national Ministry of Health and Social  Action also shares this responsibility. We have a profound  economic crisis here. We had a shortfall of 16 million pesos and  now we are down to 5 million; last year the national government  gave us 1.2 million pesos in aid, but that is not enough."  [passage omitted]</p>

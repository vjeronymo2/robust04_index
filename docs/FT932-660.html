			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / NIB chief Lindbaek to lead World Bank arm THE World Bank today will announce the appointment of Mr Jannik Lindbaek, head of the Nordic Investment Bank, to lead its private sector development arm, the international Finance Corporation, from January 1 1994. Mr Lindbaek will succeed Sir William Ryrie, who has overseen an extraordinary growth in the IFC's lending and resources since taking on the leadership in 1984. Sir William will retire 'to do other things' from the IFC in December. The Helsinki-based NIB, owned by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, finances projects on commercial terms within the Nordic regions and in 15 developing countries. Like the IFC, it borrows on the international capital markets with a triple AAA credit rating. Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, praised Mr Lindbaek's 'record of accomplishment in both the private and public sectors'. Before moving to the NIB in 1986, Mr Lindbaek was president of Norway's largest insurance company, Store Brand group, and executive vice-president of Vesta insurance group. His record at the NIB parallels the innovation and growth Sir William has achieved at the IFC. He established the Nordic Environmental Finance Corporation to invest in joint ventures in central and eastern Europe and helped initiate the Baltic Investment Programme, administered by the NIB, to boost development of small and medium-sized business in the Baltic. Sir William's tenure at the IFC coincided with a US push for increased private sector development and democratisation of the developing countries throughout Latin America. With US prodding, the IFC secured two capital increases and investment soared from Dollars 400m in fiscal 1984 to Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in 1993. During that period profits rose from Dollars 25m to over Dollars 200m. The IFC is 'financially very strong', Sir William said, but profits this year were cut by the fighting in the former Yugoslavia and by lower US interest rates. The corporation has invested heavily and mostly successfully in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where it has also played a principal advisory role in privatisation activities. Its investments in Latin America are 'another success story', Sir William said, but its African financing activities are his greatest disappointment. The African fund set up in 1988 was originally expected to break even in 1995, but 'the environment has been very difficult'. No profits are expected until after the year 2000. Mr Lindbaek is considered to be, like Sir William, an innovator. Born in Oslo in 1939, he attended the Norwegian School of Business Administration and Economics and was a Fulbright Scholar. He and his family live in Helsinki. Observer, Page 15</p>

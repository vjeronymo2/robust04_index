			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, March 23 (AFP) -- The political editor  of the bi-weekly MORNING NEWS newspaper, Nguon Non, was arrested  Wednesday at the paper's offices on defamation charges, family  and police sources said.    Police arrested Nguon Non -- also a member of co-premier  Prince Norodom Ranariddh's cabinet -- mid-morning at the MORNING  NEWS offices, his son Norin Lakshmi, the newspaper's publication  director told AFP.    A high-ranking police officer, requesting anonymity,  confirmed the arrest, which he said was due to a defamation case.    "Mr. Nguon Non was summoned twice before a tribunal and he  did not respond," he said.    The government would make no comment on the arrest, except  to  say it was studying the incident.    The MORNING NEWS was founded at the beginning of the month,  and has a reported circulation of 30,000.    According to Norin Lakhsmi, who called the arrest an "abuse  of rights," the arrest of his father was linked to recent  articles denouncing official corruption in Cambodia.    Nguon Non's arrest followed the publication last month of  assurances by King Norodom Sihanouk that press rights in  Cambodia would be respected.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (9): A country that is open to world trade  -Poland is far too self-sufficient for its own good IN ITS response to Poland's attempt to reach a new agreement with the European Community, an agreement on which Poland pins its political and its economic future, Brussels has accepted the principle of asymmetry: that, at least in the first phase, it should open its markets to imports from Poland more than Poland to exports from the EC. To its embarrassment, the EC has discovered that meeting the commitment requires substantial liberalisation on its part. The reason is simple. According to Mr Andrzej Olechowski, secretary of state in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Poland has the most liberal trade policies in Europe and among the most liberal in the world. Driven by free-trading conviction and by the opportunities afforded by the possession - at least in 1990 - of an undervalued exchange rate, the Polish government has not only eliminated all quantitative restrictions, but suspended most of its duties at the zero or 5 per cent level in the middle of last year. Tariffs on 57.9 per cent of the country's tariff-lines are now zero, while tariffs on only 36.5 per cent of Poland's tariff-lines are more than 10 per cent. Combined with the move to exchange rate convertibility on current account in January 1990, the Polish market lies open to world trade. EC negotiators find Poland's liberalism not merely embarrassing, but naive. They would prefer Poland to be more protectionist. Yet Poland's liberalism on trade makes excellent sense: it introduces competition into a largely uncompetitive domestic economy; it enhances choice and so improves incentives; and, since a tax on imports is simultaneously a tax on exports, it promotes opening of the economy. With total exports only about 15 per cent of gross national product in 1990, Poland is far too self-sufficient for its own economic good. The dependence on trade is well below that in more populous - and richer - countries, such as France (where it is 22 per cent), not to mention western Germany (33 per cent) or the Netherlands (55 per cent). Poland's ratios of trade to gross national product probably need to double. The combination of liberal trade with a competitive exchange rate will help to bring this about. In 1990 this combination - powerfully assisted by the deep recession (as shown in the 12 per cent decline in real gross domestic product between 1989 and 1990) produced an unexpectedly good trade performance. In convertible currencies, Poland moved from a tiny surplus of Dollars 100m in 1989 to one of Dollars 2.2bn in 1990 and achieved a current account surplus in convertible currencies of Dollars 700m. A surplus would hardly be a sensible objective for a poor country like Poland, least of all if it were the result of a steep decline in imports. Fortunately, that is not what happened. The dollar value of merchandise exports in convertible currencies (on a balance of payments basis) rose by 31 per cent between 1989 and 1990; in constant prices they rose by 32 per cent. Meanwhile, the dollar value of merchandise imports in convertible currencies rose by 3 per cent; in constant prices such imports fell by only 4 per cent. Happily, exports were the key to Polish trade performance. The convertible currency trade balance has not remained positive. Monthly trade balance in convertible currencies turned negative in November 1990, while in the first quarter of 1991 Poland ran a convertible currency merchandise trade deficit of just under Dollars 400m (on a customs cleared basis). This move into deficit is in significant part explained by the need to pay for Soviet oil at world prices and in dollars, from the beginning of 1991. Overall export performance has remained strong: in January 1991 merchandise exports in dollars were 59 per cent higher than in January 1990. None the less, export performance must be threatened by the decline in Poland's competitiveness. The exchange rate has remained fixed at 19,500 zlotys to the dollar since January 1990, even though average monthly wages in the five basic industrial sectors of the state economy rose by 143 per cent between January 1990 and January 1991. Consequently, from their peak of more than 50 per cent of sales at the end of 1989, profits in state enterprises fell to below 20 per cent at the end of 1990. The decline in profitability explains both why export performance is endangered and calls for protection are increasing. For the Polish government a generous agreement with the EC is one of the most important ways of resisting growing protectionist pressures at home. The government wants to intensify the squeeze on state enterprises and wishes to avoid a devaluation; but it finds it increasingly difficult to persist when the EC puts quantitative restrictions on the goods in which Poland has a competitive advantage. At present, complains Mr Dariusz Ledworoski, the minister of foreign economic relations, more than half of Poland's exports to the EC consist of agricultural commodities, textiles and clothing, and steel, all of which are subject to restrictions. The asymmetry, as Poland rightly complains, are all in the EC's favour. How can Poland resist protectionist pressures from its farmers if the EC will not open its markets? Why should it try to resist those pressures seems, unfortunately, to be the EC's crass reply. Helping to keep Poland itself protection-free is just one reason for Poland to obtain as liberal an agreement with the EC as is possible. Poland also needs markets, particularly since trade with the Soviet Union and the post-communist countries of eastern Europe has collapsed. The dollar equivalent of exports to the eastern countries had already fallen by a third between 1988 and 1990 and the region's share in Poland's exports had declined from 41 to 25 per cent. It is now falling further. Following the shift to hard currency payment, Poland paid about Dollars 250m on imports from the Soviet Union (largely oil) in the first two months of 1991, but received a mere Dollars 20m from its exports to that troubled giant, even though the value of the goods shipped was considerably greater. Yet the expectation only last December was that trade with the Soviet Union would be about Dollars 1.5bn each way. Two years ago the Soviet Union took about 30 per cent of Poland's exports. Suddenly, it is taking virtually none, a collapse that threatens as many as 1m jobs. The disaster in trade with the Soviet Union reinforces the shift in the direction of Poland's trade that was already under way. But it also makes changes in western policy towards Poland's exports still more urgent than they were a few months ago. Looking at the collapse to the east and the obstacles to the west, Mr Ledworoski argues that 'if we cannot restructure our industry through exports, we allow it to be murdered'. The Polish government argues, therefore, that at the least Poland needs the EC to treat its imports from Poland no less generously than Poland now treats its imports from the EC.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Wholesale prices come down in US US WHOLESALE prices fell last month, indicating that inflationary pressures are moderating, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.3 per cent in June, the biggest monthly drop in two years. The annual rate of wholesale price inflation fell to 1.4 per cent against 2 per cent in May. The decline in inflationary pressures was led by a 0.9 per cent drop in food prices in June compared with May, and a 0.5 per cent fall in energy prices. However, excluding the volatile food and energy components, the core producer price index fell 0.1 per cent. In May, core producer prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent. If consumer price figures due today are equally encouraging, the Federal Reserve is likely to become more relaxed about the inflation outlook. In May, after a series of unexpectedly large price increases, it shifted to a bias towards raising short-term interest rates. An early rise in rates is not now expected. Analysts said severe flooding in the Midwest was already pushing up some agricultural prices, but the sluggishness of the economic recovery was expected to prevent them feeding through into a broader increase in inflation.</p>

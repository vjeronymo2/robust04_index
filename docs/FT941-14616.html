			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guyana's gold output boosted sharply by new mine Guyana's gold production last year reached 296,940 ounces, almost four times the 1992 level. The increase was the result of output from a new mine which began production a year ago. The Omai mine, which is owned by Cambior Incorporated and Golden Star Resources of Canada and the Guyana government, produced 209,000 ounces in its first year, with traditional miners producing the rest. Gold production in the English-speaking republic in South America is expected to increase this year, with government officials forecasting production of 250,000 ounces from the Omai mine and 100,000 ounces from traditional miners. The mine, a USDollars 152m investment, with open pits over 16 square miles, is expected to yield 1.9m ounces over ten years. Guyana's other major commodities did not fare as well. Bauxite ore production last year fell to 873,000 tonnes, 3.6 per cent less than 1992 production. Officials said that the decline was caused by the flooding of some mines by unexpectedly heavy rains. But they have forecast a better performance in 1994 because of 'administrative improvements' in the industry. Minproc of Australia has been given a contract by the Guyanese government to manage the state-owned bauxite industry. Sugar production fell last year by 4,000 tonnes to 243,000 tonnes, but the country was able to meet in export quota commitments of 165,000 tonnes to the European Union, and 15,000 tonnes to the US the officials said.</p>

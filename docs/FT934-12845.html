			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / A few home truths from Clarke's backyard: Michael Cassell listens to the advice being offered to the chancellor by his Nottinghamshire constituents MR KENNETH CLARKE can dismiss the pre-Budget petitioning of his 'seven wise men'. As for the avalanche of advice from 57 varieties of vested interest - who needs it? But if the chancellor wants a few home truths before Budget day, he knows where to go to have his ear bent: to his own Nottinghamshire constituency of Rushcliffe and to Mr Ray Cook, a 64-year-old retired bank manager rich in anecdotes and homespun philosophy. Like his MP, Mr Cook speaks his mind. 'You couldn't have a better person pulling the cart; he can take the flak. But he must cut interest rates, concentrate on measures to help wealth creation, then take a deep breath and wait for the benefits of the upturn to work through. 'There is no point in imposing extra taxes now and wrecking the recovery just to start paying off the interest on Pounds 50bn worth of debt. The only real way to cut the deficit is to get the economy growing.' Mr Cook has more than a passing interest in the chancellor's performance, given his role as leader of Rushcliffe borough council. The councillor's call for a 'softly softly' Budget - he has known Mr Clarke for 20 years - wins widespread support across the constituency, representing 157 square miles of rich farmland and busy villages which stretch south and east from the Trent Bridge county cricket ground on the edge of Nottingham. Last year its voters gave Mr Clarke a near-21,000 majority. These from the Cuckoo Bush pub in Gotham to the Fish Bar in Ruddington, where locals claim the chancellor has queued for his fix of chips, are telling Mr Clarke to lay off. Rushcliffe - 'all fur coats and Waterford crystal' to its neighbours - has not been as badly savaged by recession as many other areas. White-collar redundancies have helped push up unemployment to about 9 per cent, although it is twice that level in Nottingham. Earlier this year, however, the Cotgrave pit - which a decade ago employed nearly 2,000 people - mined its last coal, and miners have left the area or signed on. But there are some indications that employers in Rushcliffe are again recruiting, that shops are busier and that a housing market which avoided the full horrors of the slump has started to move. Mr Jim Collinson, a member of Rushcliffe's planning team, said: 'Architects have been sitting on their hands for two years but now they are getting lots of inquiries. Development plans are being dusted off.' Recovery, however, remains a fragile affair which the locals believe could easily be smashed by too heavy a hand from the ordinary bloke-turned-chancellor who lives out along the Melton Road. 'He must not meddle. There is an improvement under way but the picture remains very mixed and vulnerable,' said Mr John Moy, finance director of NSK-RHP (Europe), the Japanese-owned bearings manufacturer. The company recently announced that Ruddington is to be home for its European headquarters and sales organisation, a decision which could mean more than 170 new jobs. Mr Moy added: 'We need still lower interest rates to help maintain new levels of investment. Our domestic sales are up but there are big problems in Europe. We need continuity. Mr Clarke must do nothing to upset shaky confidence.' Mr Alec McKee, managing director of the UK arm of John Deere, the US agricultural equipment makers, based in the village of Langar, said: 'Uncertainty is the enemy of investment.' Mr McKee reports a 20 per cent increase in sales this year but remains uncertain about recovery: 'At this stage, any increase in the tax burden, direct or indirect, will be harmful to consumer demand. The less Mr Clarke does in the short term the better.' He said the temporary improvement in capital allowances announced in the last Budget should be maintained, but insists interest rates have fallen far enough. The 'hands off interest rates' campaign is joined by Mr John Wood, a Cotgrave resident, Tory party activist, fabric manufacturer and master of the Worshipful Company of Glovers. Mr Wood, who helped select Mr Clarke for the Rushcliffe seat in 1970, says lower interest rates would not help British companies sell in important European markets where customers are not buying. Outside the post office in Clifton, a neat thatched village, Mrs Audrey Welling, a Tory-voting retired legal clerk, is one of many to round on the chancellor's plans for putting value added tax on heating fuel. She said: 'He will commit suicide. People will remember every time they pay the bill. The government will live to regret it even more than us.'</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle plant locks out workers A E STALEY, the US subsidiary of Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, has locked out workers at its Decatur, Illinois, corn-milling plant, where a contract dispute with about 800 members of the Allied Industrial Workers' Union has been continuing since September. Tate said that management 'has been forced to begin a lockout of hourly employees' after 'environmental problems arising from the union's in-plant strategy'. The company alleged that workers had been putting waste from the process into the drainage system, causing problems for the local sewerage authority. 'That's just an accusation,' retorted the AIW. It claims that, with regular employees working to rule, management failed to maintain environmental standards. The lockout brings to a head a simmering dispute over a new contract at the plant, which the AIW rejects and which management has attempted to impose unilaterally. An earlier lockout at the plant ended within 24 hours, but this time both sides were expecting a long fight. Tate said production was being maintained by salaried staff, although there was speculation that it planned to bring in temporary replacement workers. The union, meanwhile, plans a series of demonstrations, and is renewing calls for a boycott of Tate's Domino brand sugar. The Staley dispute has attracted widespread attention, partly because it is near Peoria, where unions and management at Caterpillar fought a furious labour battle last year. Over the weekend workers formed a chain between Staley and Caterpillar plants.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Christian Sturm report: "Beard and Bald Head"] </F>   [Text] The pictures are slightly blurred. The hand that  guided the video camera must have shaken, probably from  excitement. Through the lens the official of the Federal Office  of Criminal Investigations [BKA] sees RAF [Red Army Faction]  member Birgit Hogefeld. Beside her walks Klaus Steimetz,  liaison man of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.    The film was made on 24 June 1993 at Bad Kleinen railroad  station -- three days before the shoot-out during which RAF  member Wolfgang Grams and GSG-9 man Michael Newrzella were  killed.    The video tape also shows another couple, who were clearly  on  good terms with Hogefeld and Steinmetz.    Only after the failed antiterror operation did the BKA start  a nationwide search for the unknown couple -- exactly at 1850  hours [1650 GMT]. Too late, the two had long disappeared.    Today it is clear that the BKA investigators let slip  through  their fingers two people who are linked with the assassination  of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991.    An internal BKA paper notes soberly: When evaluating the  video tape, the experts discovered that the man might be the  unknown person seen during the attack on Rohwedder.    Some days before the attack a suspect -- 190 cm tall,  bearded, and bald -- was observed spying on Rohwedder's villa in  Duesseldorf from nearby gardens. According to the BKA, this is  the man filmed in Bad Kleinen chatting with Hogefeld and  Steinmetz.    A so-called covert search is currently under way all over  the  country -- so far without the involvement of the media. At the  beginning of March the BKA sent photos of the unknown couple to  all police stations, with a warning in bold print: Pay  particular attention to your own safety!    According to information obtained by FOCUS, another  suspicious couple got in front of the BKA observation group's  hidden camera on 27 June 1993, five hours before the shoot-out  at Bad Kleinen railroad station.    Only later did it become clear who wanted to meet with  Hogefeld and Grams there: RAF member Daniela Klette and  Ernst-Volker Staub, both wanted on an arrest warrant since 1991  for suspected participation in the attacks on Trust Agency chief  Rohwedder and State Secretary Hans Neusel.    What is embarrassing is that the RAF couple noticed the  officials and, as the BKA report says, "took photos of them in  return."</p>

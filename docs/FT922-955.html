			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: Arthritis and efficiency Sir, Arthritis Care is totally in favour of improving efficiency, in or out of hospital, but your article, 'Call for greater hospital efficiency' (June 23), caused many wry smiles here. Most people with arthritis can walk, but only for short distances and with pain. Some of them find that attending hospital out-patient departments can cause more pain and damage to their joints than the treatment they receive alleviates. If Andersen Consulting's research results in a patient with arthritis having shorter journeys from the car park to the out-patients and then to the pharmacy, many of the 10m people with arthritis in the UK will be deeply grateful. R E Gutch, chief executive, Arthritis Care, 18 Stephenson Way, London NW1 2HD</p>

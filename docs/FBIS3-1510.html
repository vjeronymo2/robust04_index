			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela to the ANC Business </F> Summit on 30 March in Johannesburg, read on his behalf at the  summit by ANC economic adviser Trevor Manuel; issued by the  African National Congress on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] Mr. Chairperson, distinguished participants    This summit departs from tradition in more ways than one.    Firstly, in the hustle-bustle of a hard-fought election  campaign, it stands out as a forum for calm, rational debate  about the challenges business that the ANC [African National  Congress] face.    Secondly, we are confident that this summit will serve as a  ray of hope, a spur to major economic players to act with  decision to resolve the complex problems that beset our country.    Since 1990, we have often said that South Africa has entered  a new terrain of debate. In Dakar, Davos, Paris, and on  countless occasions within the country, we sought occasions to  understand one another.    This summit is no different. Today, we are continuing along  the same road in search of meaningful partnership; raising our  discourse from one premised on ideology to one that derives from  a common identification of national needs and goals.    We thank you all for finding the time in your busy schedules  to be here with us. We particularly want to congratulate FINANCE  WEEK for its keen sense of timing and organisational capacity.    During the course of the day, the experts will share with  you  the evolving detailed policy positions of the ANC. Mine is the  relatively easy task of talking in beneral terms.    Important historical moments always have their surprises. I  will try to fit the bill by sharing with you some information  the ANC has not made public. And I trust you will come to my  rescue when I am castigated by constitutional structures of the  ANC.    I deliberately refer to "evolving" details of policy.  Because  we would not have been the movement we are, if we did not temper  our approaches to take account of the views of those we consult.  At the end of this summit, we will summon all the ANC experts  present here to find out how they and the ANC have benefited  from this encounter.    For any organisation to govern it should appreciate the  needs, aspirations and fears of the nation as a whole. For, to  govern means translating varying viewpoints into a harmonious  national effort. We do not pretend that we are capable of  ironing out all differences. The contradictions will always be  there. But we are duty-bound to act in a manner that  demonstrates sensitivity to the needs of society as a whole.    The ANC is confident that South Africa will make it. We have  been part of a historic paradigm shift among forces which were  at each others throats -- in politics and in economics -- to  understand that national consensus is possible.    Over the past year or so, such an emergent consensus has  found expression in many areas: within the national economic  forum, the housing forum, the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council] sub-council on finance, and in the joint missions  abroad. There, we have acted as South Africans first and  foremost, pursuing a common national agenda. And there is no  doubt that, if we get our act together, we will achieve a great  deal for the nation as a whole.    This is of course conditional on one central factor. That  is,  our ability to resolve our political problems in a manner that  our people and the international community can say: there is a  legitimate arrangement to support.    No matter how hard we try to convince potential  international  investors and financiers about the discrepancies between TV  screen images and reality; no matter how loudly we proclaim our  commitment to find lasting solutions; as long as we are not seen  to be acting together on these issues, their doubts will persist.    Every rational person appreciates that our country is on the  verge of fundamental change, the most important expression of  which will be the elections on 26, 27 and 28 April.    The country has successfully negotiated rules of the  transition which will culminate in the drafting of a new  democratic constitution. These rules, encapsulated in the  interim constitution and electoral laws, might have their  defects. But central to these rules are basic principles of  democracy and a constitutionally-guaranteed mechanism for  working together in a government of national unity.    Much has been made of the pet subject of federalism, turning  words upon themselves until they lose all meaning. Most  unfortunately the telegraphic nature of news reports on the  debate the fundamental issue that what we have now is an interim  arrangement is all too often missed.    We have already made numerous adjustments to provincial  powers as a means of accommodating the white extreme right. But,  to the extent that the new constitution will be drafted in a  context of elected structures, it will be much easier to examine  these questions in a more rational manner.    Let me pause to share a secret. In my discussions with our  regions and the provincial candidate premiers, I have found a  persistent leaning towards ensuring that the powers of the  provinces are amplified -- not as a tool for blocking national  programmes, but to facilitate national development closer to  where the people are.    What we are saying is that it is highly irrational to make a  life-and-death issue of the interim constitution. This interim  constitution makes room for the political approaches of the  widest spectrum of parties, including the possibility of a  volkstaat [homeland]. Of course, what it does not do is to  guarantee any political leader or party a status independent of  the will of the electorate.    It would be wrong to compel anyone to take part in elections  if they choose not to do so. But our argument is that even those  who choose to abstain should not seek to undermine this national  consensus by means of violence.    There is a serious danger that by being silent on these  problems, we might be seen by the perpetrators of violence, by  our own people and by the outside world as succumbing to the  ancient dictum that might is right. Especially for the private  sector, it is not helpful to the national economic consensus we  seek, that a perception takes root among the majority, that  while business appears keen to challenge the ANC on issues such  as the double ballot; it fails to speak out when major obstacles  to the transition are created.    The past fortnight has witnessed some of the most dramatic  developments in our political history. There was the uprising in  Bophuthatswana, the events in The ciskei and the revelations in  the Goldstone Commission report.    I do not personally have a penchant for uprisings or  exposes.  I had personally hoped that the Bophuthatswana government would  co-operate with the transitional process and find a respectable  role for itself. The objective of free political activity and  the whole transition in this area could have been attained  without unrest or bloodshed.    Except for local structures which kept in touch with events,  there was no direct ANC participation in the fall of President  Mangope. That is a matter of record. Until the eleventh hour we  had hoped that negotiations and the phenomenal offers we were  making to the Bophuthatswana administration would resolve the  problems. However, our life-line was rejected and the Bop  administration became victim of its own intransigence.    I would want to commend leader of the Freedom Front General  Constand Viljoen for his maturity. We profoundly disagree with  him on the issue of a volkstaat and we shall continue to differ  with him in coming negotiations. But he has had the foresight to  seek a peaceful settlement.    To the ANC, what is at issue is not whether a particular  administrator stays in office for another few days or not. The  question is ensuring free and fair elections.    We remain very apprehensive about the unfolding events in  kwaZulu-Natal. As everywhere else, we would prefer the  administration to accept the people's right to express their  political views either way. An attempt to postpone the elections  or drown them in blood cannot be countenanced. Allowing such an  eventuality would be sending a terribly wrong signal about  ourselves as a leadership and as a country: that might is right.    The ANC will continue seeking the least painful solutions  to the crisis. We are aware of the genuine fears of the Zulu  king and we shall continue seeking a meeting with him to clarify  what we believe is a misunderstanding about his future status  and role.    We do appreciate that the kwaZulu administration is  different. Now this is no secret. The most recent report of the  Goldstone Commission helps to piece together what has been more  or less an enigma to many. If we recall, the motivation of the  security police who engineered Inkatha funding in 1990, was that  the apartheid state could not afford co-operation between  Inkatha and the ANC during the transition. The revelations about  co-operation between generals at SAP [South African Police]  headquarters and this party confirms society's worst fears. This  is what makes the kwaZulu administration different, not the  anthropological analyses that seek to take us to pre-historic  times.    Decisive steps need to be taken without delay. The South  African Government should exercise its jurisdiction to end the  carnage and ensure normal political activity.    We should build a provincial consensus in Natal, a consensus  that includes business, political parties, religious leaders and  others, for a right of choice. If the forces of peace act  together, we might yet be saved from what would be a  mutually-debilitating conflict.    The ANC is convinced that such initiatives are in the  interest of the country in general and our economy in  particular. As politicians, we accept our responsibility to  create the conditions in which the economy can thrive.    The thrust of our programme is to forge the emergent  consensus into a dynamo for a national effort to build a better  life for all.    There are many problems that we have collectively and  variously identified that need resolution in the medium and  long-term. Often, we set each other up for acrimonious exchanges  by the ideological manner in which we identify these problems.    Our country suffers from:     -  an unacceptable under-utilisation of its productive  capacity;    -  an underdeveloped human resource base;    -  a structural dependence on the mining industry;    -  an underdeveloped manufacturing sector which is in no  position  to compete internationally;    -  a skewed agricultural sector that relies in the main on a few  enterprises while the majority are condemned to chronic debt and  landlessness;    -  a sharp urban-rural divide which is bound to explode in even  worse urbanisation crises;    -  an industrial and commercial structure that is top-heavy and  views small and medium-size enterprise with derision.       We could go on and on. The sum-total of it all is the  disparity and attendant socio-political problems. We need to  kick-start the economy in a joint national effort. This should  be within a clear framework with national goals. It should be  people-centred.    This is the premise of the ANC's reconstruction and  development programme: our public works programme, education,  health, housing and other policies.    In the past we have often engaged in what is essentially an  academic debate: what comes first, growth or delivery? But it is  now part of the national consensus that these processes must  proceed together and should in fact complement each other.    It is also part of our common understanding that these  problems cannot be resolved in a shotgun manner: Let everyone  fly in their own direction hoping they will reach some target.    We believe that the state should set the framework allowing  for private, autonomous activity. It has an important role to  create the environment within which business can thrive. It has  an important role to ensure that there is full national  participation in the economy, including the creation of  opportunities for small business. It should direct public  finance towards more investment spending rather than consumption.    The ANC's plan is conscious of the need for macro-economic  balances. We emphasise more efficient utilisation of resources  and thinning down the bureaucracy of apartheid duplications,  closing the gaps for corruption, and ensuring an efficient tax  collection system. In government, effective and open performance  auditing will be the priority.    And to share with you the real secret that even top leaders  of the ANC do not know: minimal as its contribution would be, we  intend to ensure that political leaders themselves set an  example. Going through the salaries and perks current  politicians pocket, leaves a sour taste in the mouth. This  applies to the presidency, ministers and parliamentarians. And I  intend to ask my colleagues in the ANC executive and  parliamentary lists to consider reducing these salaries and  ensuring that everyone pays tax. The time has come that politics  should be seen as a service to the people rather than as a means  to self-enrichment.    The ANC's approach to tax is that we should examine the  system as a whole, foster the rule of law and recognition of  rights and responsibilities. All this has to be conducted within  acceptable macro-economic balances. The aim should be to ensure  increased revenue through growth and efficiency rather than  increasing the tax burden. In particular we do not seek to  increase central government funding above its current level of  25 percent. Government borrowing should not rise above current  levels.    Our proposal for a reconstruction fund should be implemented  in a manner that does not stifle individual business initiative.  Emphasis will be on elements of the reconstruction programme  that can generate funds.    What about a reconstruction levy, prescribed assets and  foreign exchange controls? The ANC does not want to be  prescriptive. Our preference is that, if national consensus on  economic goals and a partnership between business and government  take root, then goverdment laws and policing should become  redundant.    As the ANC, we are committed to creating a macro-environment  for economic growth and to assist business to be competitive  internationally. We will pursue sound monetary policies,  guarantee the independence of the reserve bank and improve South  Africa's credit rating. Our programme sets out broad parameters  which we believe should stimulate the thriving of enterprise and  initiative.    The fundamental question is, how the private sector proposes  to play its role in this national effort? We would strongly  argue that partnership between business and an ANC government  should find expression in a commitment from the private sector  to the country's future. This means investing in the country and  developing its human resources. It means working together in  various sectorial forums to help build the economy and add to  national wealth.    We believe that such a partnership is possible. Especially  if  we both shed the ideological baggage that has so undermined  national debate, and pursue things as they are, not as  interpreted in some manuals.    This should be the message that together we send out to  society. On both sides of the apartheid divide, people wish to  see practical efforts to improve the situation for all South  Africans.    That is why we are concerned about some of the distortions  we  are coming across in the election campaign, aimed at  exaggerating ANC support.    This is a particularly clever and dangerous campaign. The  aim  is to create a hung Parliament and a government unable to  implement reconstruction programmes.    The ANC does not pursue a two-thirds majority as a matter of  principle. We are committed to ensuring that policies are worked  out in consultation with all role players which genuinely seek a  solution to the country's problems.    It makes sound economic and business sense to say that South  Africa needs a decisive government and that governmental  paralysis will naturally result in an unguided drift and  continued economic hardships. We believe that it is in the  interest of business that the reconstruction and development  programme, tempered by our consultations, should be implemented.    I hope that this encounter will bear the kind of results  that  will move us from debate to practical action. There is a common  challenge. Let us work together to find a common solution.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MORE 'SHOCK THERAPY,' GORBACHEV TELLS WORKERS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: HE VISITS AN INDUSTRIAL CITY TO CALM FEARS ABOUT PLANNED ECONOMIC  REFORMS.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, acknowledging that workers' "patience is  at its limit," promised Wednesday that there will be no "shock therapy" to pull  the country out of its economic crisis and that the people will be consulted  before consumer prices are raised.  </P> <P> "Your cries of alarm are reaching us," Gorbachev told angry factory workers in  Sverdlovsk, a major industrial center in the Ural Mountains, where he arrived  on a trip aimed at calming fears about planned economic reforms.  </P> <P> "Some people say that those at the top are planning to raise prices all in one  go, to perform a 'shock therapy,' " he said. "Don't believe it."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who in the face of worker protests over probable price increases and  unemployment is retreating on his earlier determination to push through bolder  economic reforms at a faster pace, said that major changes will be deferred six  to eight months and that there will be extensive discussions before any  decisions are made.  </P> <P> "You have known for a long time what the government has planned," he said, "but  now we have reached a stage when we will begin to submit proposals to you, and  before setting things in motion, we will discuss them with you. So don't  worry."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's comments, televised nationwide, confirmed his decision to refrain,  at least temporarily, from plunging the state-managed Soviet economy quickly  and forcefully into the maelstrom of market forces.  </P> <P> Some of the president's closest advisers had touched off a near-panic with  proposals that the Soviet Union follow Poland into an overnight, forced  transition to a market economy, with resulting price increases, plant closures  and widespread unemployment. Conservatives quickly mobilized resistance to  moves that they fear would bring an end to socialism here.  </P> <P> Thus, what began as a debate over economic reforms, which have overwhelming  popular support, quickly turned into a political struggle over the course of  perestroika, as the program of reform is known.  </P> <P> The country is now in a precarious balance, Gorbachev acknowledged, because of  the uncertainty over the reforms, the impact they will have on everyday life  and how they will reshape the Soviet system.  </P> <P> He said that the Presidential Council had considered government proposals for  this next stage of economic reforms -- a broad sweep of measures that would put  prices on the basis of supply and demand, privatize many state-owned  enterprises, shift workers out of unprofitable industries. But, he said, it  ordered substantial revisions because of the massive social impact of such  changes. These will be reviewed about May 10.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, meeting with workers at a Moscow radio  factory Wednesday, encountered complaints similar to those Gorbachev heard.  </P> <P> "We cannot launch a program that would make the standard of living decline. . .  ," he responded. " . . . We must avoid taking a road that would lead to serious  instability in the economy. Before we move forward, we must look into every  step that we are going to take."  </P> <P> Ryzhkov said he hopes to be able to present a package of economic measures to  the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature, in May, but added that their  implementation and the transition to a "regulated market economy" will come  only in 1991.  </P> <P> The legislation was originally scheduled to be introduced and voted upon this  month, with the first laws coming into effect May 1 and most of the rest on  July 1. Soviet officials said earlier this week that most of the legislation  will not be considered before autumn, thus delaying the program until after the  Communist Party holds a pivotal congress in July.  </P> <P> As he was pelted with questions and complaints, first by Sverdlovsk workers on  the street and factory floor and then by plant officials and trade union  representatives, Gorbachev was clearly embattled in defending his reforms from  the people whom they were supposed to help.  </P> <P> "What we have in mind is a sharp turn . . . and we cannot allow ourselves to  realize this all at once," he said. "We shall do as we promised -- we shall  consult the people. . . ."  </P> <P> Speaking with workers at the giant Uralmash Integrated Works, a  machine-building complex about 900 miles east of Moscow, Gorbachev frankly  acknowledged the critical level of social discontent in the country,  attributing it in part to the mounting economic problems but also to  disappointment in his reform program.  </P> <P> "It can already be seen that people's expectations are at their limit, and  their patience is at its limit," he said.  </P> <P> Uralmash, which was managed by Ryzhkov before he came to Moscow, employs 50,000  people and produces equipment ranging from excavators to oil-drilling rigs to  home appliances. Although it is one of the country's leading enterprises, with  an output valued at more than $1 billion a year, its profits are so low that it  has not been able to modernize and consequently finds itself less and less able  to compete on world markets.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, addressing this problem, said he remains convinced that the Soviet  economy, which is sinking deeper and deeper into a profound recession, must be  transformed quickly through the introduction of the market forces of supply and  demand, entrepreneurial management and new technology.  </P> <P> "This is not the market for the sake of a market, nor technology for the sake  of technology, but changes in the situation for the better -- and faster," he  said.  </P> <P> Sverdlovsk residents have demonstrated over living conditions several times in  recent months. One protest, just before New Year's Eve, was over the shortage  of champagne and vodka, and it led to the ouster of the local Communist Party  leader by party members and his replacement by a more progressive official.  </P> <P> Most of the complaints center around the shortages of food, including rationed  items such as meat, butter and sugar. Uralmash workers asked Gorbachev why  there were no televisions and no refrigerators in local stores, not even the  consumer products that their factory produces.  </P> <P> And a television correspondent noted that although Sverdlovsk ranks second in  the Russian Republic in terms of production, the city of 1.4 million is only  40th or 50th in terms of housing, medical care, education and cultural  facilities.  </P> <P> "Everything that worries you worries me, too," Gorbachev answered. "Many  problems have accumulated. We must resolve them properly, all together. We are  approaching that now, introducing structural changes and including every  enterprise and every person in the economic reforms."  </P> <P> "We, therefore, must act more wisely, and you here must work more wisely.  Otherwise, nothing will come from all this."  </P> <P> As a key center in the Soviet defense industry, Sverdlovsk is generally closed  to foreigners, and correspondents were denied permission to accompany Gorbachev  to the city.  </P></p>

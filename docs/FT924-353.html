			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Lucre strips lustre from Kenyan poll: How bribery mars shift to democracy HUNDREDS of people lined the dusty roads of Kisii district in western Kenya yesterday and stretched out their hands to the convoy of Mr Kenneth Matiba, an opposition presidential candidate in today's general election. As his motorcade sped through the lush hills, with slogans of the FORD-Asili party blaring from loudspeakers, the people shouted: 'Give us money, give us money.' 'Everybody here is only looking for money,' Mr Matiba sighed. 'They've all been bought.' The candidate, making his last campaign swing before polling, was warned to avoid Kisii town where the ruling Kanu party was holding a final rally. Hundreds of youths in T-shirts bearing the portrait of Mr Simeon Nyachae, the local Kanu boss, loitered on the streets looking for Mr Matiba's convoy. Bribing of candidates and voters, intimidation and electoral abuses have already sullied the election in Kenya, Africa's former role model which today becomes the continent's test case for democracy. Almost 8m Kenyans are registered to vote in the first multi-party election for 26 years. Kanu is expected to win the most seats in the 188-member parliament and a run-off for the presidency. Although policies among the main parties do not differ much, ethnic rivalries have undermined the transition to democracy and raised fears about post-election violence and the country's stability. But the outcome has ramifications that go beyond Kenya. Looking on anxiously are western donors and governments, and the Commonwealth. The former, led by the US, helped force President Daniel arap Moi to end one-party rule by freezing aid pending democratic reform and speedier implementation of economic change. For the Commonwealth, represented by 40-strong observer group, the election is the first significant test of the new role it set for itself at the heads of government summit in Harare in October 1991. The summit declaration renewed members' commitment to 'democracy, accountable administration and the rule of law'. It represented 'more than simply words', said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's secretary-general. It was 'both a commitment to action and a set of standards and principles by which the Commonwealth will seek to live'. Should western governments and the Commonwealth observers decide that an election won by Mr Moi is not 'free or fair', aid will not resume, putting further strain on an economy already in crisis. The onlookers do not seem entirely comfortable with their role and responsibilities. The leading western governments appear divided; while colleagues from the US, Germany, Canada, Sweden and Denmark staged a walk-out from a national day parade this month on the grounds that Mr Moi had turned it into a Kanu political rally, the British High Commissioner remained seated. Last week Germany went a step further and withdrew its observer mission on the grounds that the election process was already fatally flawed and its team had encountered government obstruction. At the same time, however, the US has shown signs of backing away from its hard line - possibly influenced by Kenya's role as a reliable rear base for operations in Somalia. The Commonwealth observers, led by former Chief Justice Telford Georges, appears to be hedging its bets. Unlike previous monitoring exercises in Zambia, the Seychelles and Ghana, the group seems unlikely to deliver its assessment until after the result is known. Opposition parties yesterday made fresh allegations of electoral malpractices, including the arrest of 500 supporters in the tense central town of Nakuru. Most opposition leaders have warned of violence if the elections are seen by the electorate to have been rigged by Kanu. Should Kenya's stability be threatened, the blame will fall on the country's leaders. But western governments and observer groups may have to bear some of the responsibility for failing to apply greater pressure on the government earlier in the process, to ensure a free and fair poll.</p>

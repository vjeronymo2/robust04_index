Mwaanga's resignation also comes in the wake of  international  concern over corruption and drug dealing in the Zambian  Government expressed by donors at a consultative group meeting  in Paris last month.    "I want to inform the nation of my solemn decision to stand  down as minister of foreign affairs with immediate effect,"  Mwaanga told a packed press conference at his office, adding  that his decision was as a result of a relentless campaign  fuelled by "people and entities with limitless malice."    "I am not involved in drug trafficking and I am not involved  in corrupt practices or abuse of public office...but it is my  duty to see to it that government position is not compromised,"  he said.    The minister said his decision to step down was aimed at  giving the government a free hand to investigate fully and  thouroughly the allegations levelled against him. "It is my  perception that the government should have unfettered ability to  investigate allegations of drug trafficking, corruption and  misuse of public funds by public officers at whatever levels,"  Mwaanga said.    He became the fourth cabinet minister to voluntarily leave  the two-year-old government of President Frederick Chiluba.    Since ushering in his cabinet after the 1991 multi-party  elections, Chiluba has been under persistent pressure to act on  alleged high level corruption and and drug trafficking in his  government.    Local press reports and opposition figures have alleged that  there are a number of ministers involved in the vice and accused  Chiluba of failing to take action because they bankrolled his  1991 presidential campaign.    Mwaanga, Community Development Minister Nakatindi Wina and  her husband Sikota, who is deputy speaker of the National  Assembly, were detained for months by former president Kenneth  Kaunda for their alleged involvement in mandrax drug trafficking  in 1985. The findings of a special tribunal appointed by Kaunda  to investigate them have not been made public.    Finance Minister Ronald Penza told journalists after the  Paris meeting that donors had withheld 96 million dollars of the  required financial assistance of almost a billion dollars  because of their concern about drug trafficking and corruption  in the Zambian Government. He said the donors described Zambia  as "the Columbia of Africa" and he called on Chiluba to take  action before the next consultative group meeting in March.    Deputy Minister for Economic Planning Dean Mungomba, who  accompanied Penza to Paris, has echoed the finance minister's  views. "Our relations with our cooperating partners will be  strained if serious steps are not taken before March.... We  have dealt with serious problems like inflation and monetary  control, I do not see why drug trafficking cannot be dealt  with," Mungomba said.    Mwaanga said, however, that he will remain a committed  member  of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) although  "the campaign against me has been orchestrated by colleagues in  government who are themselves the very epitome of greed, who  from their first day in government have used every opportunity  to sustain their appetite for material possessions." He  appealed to the other ministers accused of drug dealing to  follow his example.</p>

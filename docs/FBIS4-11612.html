			<p>BFN     [Text] The governments of Colombia and Jamaica signed  several tourism, scientific, and technical cooperation  agreements yesterday. These are the first steps in the new  relations of exchange between the two countries.    On the last day of his three-day visit to Colombia, Jamaican  Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson and Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria also signed a joint statement. In the statement,  the two countries agree to continue developing their relations,  aimed at cultivating new areas of bilateral cooperation.  Patterson then returned to his country.    The two chiefs of state said the agreements establish an  exchange of expertise and information in areas such as  agriculture and language education.    During a news conference, Prime Minister Patterson broached  the crisis of democracy in Cuba. He said he personally has no  expectations about a possible role President Gaviria could play  as OAS secretary general in the Cuban issue. He said such  decisions arise from a consensus among the member nations. He  did say, however, he views the Cuban situation as a priority  issue for the regional organization.    Undoubtedly, Cuba's political system is different. There is  no reason, then, to exclude Cuba from the family of Western  nations," he said. [no opening quotation mark as published] He  added he hopes Cuba will soon become a full OAS member because  any contribution toward defining the Cuban crisis "should come  through cooperation with them and not through their isolation."    Patterson predicted a positive outcome from the current  negotiations between Colombia and the Caribbean Common Market  (Caricom), of which Jamaica is a member. The talks are aimed at  confirming a free trade agreement to be signed in July. He also  announced aeronautics officials from the two countries will meet  in San Andres at the end of May to complete the final details on  an air transportation agreement to promote further development  of bilateral relations.    Although Jamaica did not vote for Gaviria for OAS secretary  general, Patterson expressed both his congratulations to the  Colombian leader and his confidence Gaviria will make "the  changes the new international situation and hemispheric problems  will require from the organization."</p>

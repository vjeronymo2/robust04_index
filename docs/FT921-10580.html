			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Barlow Clowes jury to consider verdicts today THE JURY in the Barlow Clowes fraud trial will retire later today to consider its verdicts. Mr Justice Phillips yesterday told jurors they might have to spend several days before reaching conclusions. The trial, held in a Chancery Lane extension of the Old Bailey in London, has lasted 108 days and heard evidence from 113 witnesses. The Serious Fraud Office has alleged that Mr Peter Clowes and three co-defendants milked the funds of clients who believed their money was being invested in gilt-edged government stock. It is alleged that the money was spent on investments in other private and public companies and on luxurious purchases such as a yacht, an executive jet and a chateau and vineyard in France. Mr Peter Clowes, Mr Guy Cramer, Mr Peter Naylor and Mr Christopher Newman are accused of stealing Pounds 16.9m. Mr Clowes, Mr Naylor and Mr Cramer are jointly charged with conspiring to contravene section 13(1) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, which deals with false statements made to induce people to invest. Mr Clowes alone is accused of eight offences under the sub-section. They deny all the charges.</p>

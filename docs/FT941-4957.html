			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / ITC urged to prevent advert sale monopoly Two leading organisations representing the advertising industry have called for strict regulation of television advertising sales to prevent what are in effect monopolies developing, Raymond Snoddy writes. The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Association of Media Independents have told the Independent Television Commission they would accept one sales point being responsible for up to 25 per cent of all television advertising in the UK - but only with conditions. The ITC is looking at its rules governing the sale of television advertising with the presumption that the maximum threshold will be lifted from 25 per cent of ITV to 25 per cent of all television sales. If that happens the IPA wants to see a prohibition on advertising being sold in a package for two or more competing television services such as regional ITV companies, GMTV, the breakfast service, Channel 4 or the two London ITV stations. The institute also wants to see a ban on any advertising sales points with 25 per cent of the market having shareholdings in, or influence over, a competitor. The media independents want a sales structure 'which is independent, accountable and transparent'. The institute wants any sales organisation with more than 20 per cent of the market to be a separate legal entity with independent directors, and to declare net quarterly revenue to clear criteria.</p>

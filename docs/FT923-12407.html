			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Bosnian factions agree a ceasefire LEADERS of the warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina agreed yesterday to a 14-day ceasefire, including the placement of all heavy weapons and artillery under United Nations supervision. The agreement came as two French soldiers serving with the UN peace force in Croatia were killed in a mine blast near the Adriatic port of Zadar. They were the first UN peace-keeping soldiers to be killed in the Yugoslav conflict. The ceasefire is the first to be firmly linked to a plan for demilitarisation of the former Yugoslav republic under international control. This offers some hope that the truce could hold - unlike previous peace attempts. The ceasefire followed three days of talks by Moslem, Serb and Croat representatives with Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community-sponsored peace conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina, aimed at starting a process towards a lasting constitutional settlement in the ethnically mixed republic. Under the deal, all heavy weapons, including combat aircraft, artillery and rocket launchers, mostly held by the Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army, will be placed under UN supervision. Yesterday the Security Council asked the secretary-general to report on how many more peacekeepers might be needed to fulfil these additional functions. The 15-member body also called on all sides to inform the UN peace-keeping commander immediately about the location and number of heavy weapons to be put under supervision. AP adds from Moscow: Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday froze relations with the rump Yugoslavia and won legislative approval to despatch up to 400 more peacekeeping troops.

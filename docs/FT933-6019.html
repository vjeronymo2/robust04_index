			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan's hopes rise for a second-half rally - Prospects favour equities Taiwan's equity market could be ready for an upturn helped by improved prospects for export-oriented manufacturers and financial companies. Confidence may also revive on political grounds: worries over a possible split in the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party were eased earlier this month. Some analysts believe that the TSE weighted index could again reach the 5,000 level that it hit at the beginning of April this year, although others more cautiously forecast a move to about 4,400. Since April the index has fallen back, before stabilising around the 3,800 to 4,100 area, closing yesterday at 3,923. The market's prospects may also be helped by a recommendation last week by Baring Securities, rating Taiwan as the most attractive of the world's emerging markets, with performance in the short term being assisted by the strength of the dollar. The market's first-quarter rally coincided with the resignation of Mr Hau Pei-tsun as prime minister and his replacement by Mr Lien Chan, who has adopted a more pro-business style of government. However, indications of an economic slowdown emerged in the second quarter, while the start of an economic contraction in mainland China also hurt a number of manufacturing companies exporting to or investing there. As a result, the weighted index fell back, recording a year's low of 3,135.56 on July 7. Earlier hopes for brighter economic prospects in the second half have been dampened by the most recent government forecast, which anticipates a slight decline in growth in the last six months of the year. Nevertheless, the recent depreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against the US dollar has begun to have a positive impact on export orders. 'This factor will boost the performance of export-oriented sectors, such as electronics,' says Mr George Hou, deputy manager of the fund department of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management. He adds that the performance of Taiwanese electronics companies will also be helped by the intense competition raging in the personal computer sector in the US and Japan. 'US and Japanese makers are coming to Taiwan to order low cost but high quality components, or to set up original equipment manufacturing arrangements,' he notes. The most positive development for equities has been the recent decision by the Central Bank of China to relax its usually tight monetary policy in an effort to spur a sluggish economy. Mr Lin Yung-kui, manager of SG Warburg's research department in Taipei, believes that this decision will be 'a very major factor' in boosting the market. The Central Bank of China began to lower interest rates on secured loans from banks to encourage local banks to reduce their own rates. But after major local banks showed a reluctance to make rate reductions, the CBC relaxed selective credit restrictions on August 14. These had been imposed in February 1990 to cool speculation in equities, the property sector and foreign exchange markets at a time when the TSE hit its all-time high of more than 12,000. 'This measure, and lower deposit rates, will make stock market investments more attractive,' says Mr Hou. Taipei is also trying to attract more foreign capital into the local market, mainly through liberalising the regulatory environment. Mr Yu Ping-nan, assistant general manager of CBC's foreign exchange bureau, says the bank, together with the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Commission, decided to introduce several measures to encourage foreign investment in the equity market. Mr Yu says the Ministry of Finance will soon announce a rise in the total quota for investment by foreign securities houses in the stock market from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 5bn. Approved foreign securities investment has already surpassed Dollars 2.1bn. 'Foreign investment is far below the proposed new quota, but the move indicates a positive attitude,' says Mr Huang Shu-shen, vice-president of the international department of National Securities. The CBC also announced recently a rule which allows each foreign investor to invest up to Dollars 100m at a time, instead of having to divide investments in lots of Dollars 50m. The CBC also asked the Ministry of Finance to liberalise rules on the repatriation of capital and earnings. At present, each investor can repatriate earnings or invested capital a year after entry and only once each year. The new draft rules, which may take effect by the end of the year, will allow foreign investors to repatriate earnings or invested capital within three months of entry, and will not place limits on the number of transactions. Mr Lin Yung-kui, manager of SG Warburg's research department in Taipei, is impressed: 'Unless the results of the local elections in late November are very bad for the KMT, political apprehension should be relaxed, producing a strong performance in the last month of the year.'</p>

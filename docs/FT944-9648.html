			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / BT expands trial of video-on-demand British Telecommunications will announce today that it is going ahead with a full commercial trial of its ambitious video-on-demand technology early next year. A first trial involving 60 homes, mainly of BT employees, was a technical success. But because the service was free, little useful information was gained about consumer demand. BT will begin next month recruiting consumers in 2,500 homes in the Colchester and Ipswich areas for commercial trials starting in spring. BT's video-on-demand technology involves sending television pictures in digital form from a database down ordinary telephone lines. The capacity of the line is enough to carry a film and an ordinary voice conversation at the same time. In the Colchester trial the converter boxes needed to turn the digits back into a television picture will probably be supplied free. However, consumers are likely to be charged for the use they make of the service. BT sees video-on-demand providing eventually a large range of services but the initial trials are likely to centre on films.</p>

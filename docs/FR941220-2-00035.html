DPR&hyph;71, DPR&hyph;62, DPR&hyph;23, NPF&hyph;63, issued to the Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (the licensee) for the operation of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2 (Brunswick), H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (Robinson), and Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (Harris). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facilities consist of two boiling water reactors at the Brunswick site in Brunswick County, North Carolina; a pressurized water reactor at the Robinson site in Darlington County, South Carolina; and a pressurized water reactor in Wake County and Chatham County, North Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system of site access control so that photograph identification badges can be taken offsite. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated July 29, 1994, as supplemented December 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would give an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization. Paragraph 1 of 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies that the ``licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Title 10 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Code of Federal Regulations, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  paragraph 73.55(d)(5), specifies that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' Paragraph 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., a contractor) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of the Brunswick and Robinson units is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination badge and keycard (hereafter, these are referred to as the badge). At the Harris unit unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a badge and a separate keycard. The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contract individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plants' physical security plans, neither licensee employees nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badges with them when departing the site. An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed system, individuals who are authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared with the previously stored template to verify authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a Sandia report entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91&hyph;0276 UC&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991) and on the licensee's experience with the current photo identification system, the licensee demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system would provide enhanced site access control. Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would provide for a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into the protected area. The licensee will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plans for the Brunswick, Robinson, and Harris sites will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees and contractors to take their badges offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

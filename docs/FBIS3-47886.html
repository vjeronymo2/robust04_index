			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Tsutomu Namikawa: "Responses to </F> Securities Market Emergencies for Which Secret Incantations Are  Unacceptable"]    [Text] The operating crisis at Cosmo Securities has  generated increased conversational interest in the topic of  securities bankruptcies. Not a few people are of the opinion  that bankruptcy would have been more appropriate than a rescue.  However, at the same time, ever so many fewer argue for setting  in place an infrastructure to eliminate from the market the  impact of a securities firm's going bankrupt. Any argument for  the appropriateness of bankruptcy will never be anything more  than irrational unless policies are put in place to avoid  securities settlement risks along with mechanisms to isolate the  impact of bankruptcies from market trading.  <H3>  The Myth of No Bankruptcies in the Securities Industry  "Compared to a bank, the bankruptcy of a securities company  would have trifling impact." One hears this said again and again  of late. This may be true, if we take into consideration the  degree impact such a bankruptcy would have on the financial  order. However, in reality the issue is not something that can  be written off so easily. </H3>   To begin with, as is the case with financial institutions  and  the funds settlement system, settlements involving securities  transactions (securities settlements) are bolstered by a myth of  no bankruptcies among securities companies. Nevertheless, these  last one or two years the mechanism of funds settlement has been  modified through a process "best called a revolutionary reform  in awareness" (a top-ranking city bank). Specifically, the  change involves the establishment of same day settlements in the  all-bank system which handles funds settlements between banks  for domestic exchange, on-line CD's, etc.    The essence of this is something that determines the actual  goal (conceptually already existing) of not giving rise to  obstacles in the settlement system for participating financial  institutions even should unexpected circumstances arise and it  is certainly correct to label this self-denial of the myth of no  bankruptcies. As a philosophy underpinning the framework of the  settlement system, it is nothing short of a Copernican  revolution.    As for converting to this, securities settlements remain as  before. Bankruptcies of securities companies are not actually  being contemplated. This is despite talk of the business slump  among securities companies.    For example, one person connected with the securities  business said about the actual situation, "In the final  analysis, the securities industry has not rid itself of the idea  that it is a private market."    This is a cold indication of the thinking that, even though  irregularities do at times occur in settlements related to  securities transactions, because they are dealing with their  Kabuto-cho confederates, this somehow can be solved through a  few secret incantations.    The origin of this thinking stems from a total belief in the  myth of no bankruptcies. However, should a securities company  one day go bankrupt in carrying out a large volume of securities  transactions, talk would change. Surely the facile conception of  "What might happen?" would be shaken by a harsh reality.    What is the problem with the current securities settlement  system? The possibility that a chained series of failures might  occur in the system.  <H5>  Had Cosmo Gone Bankrupt </H5>   Faced with an operational crisis, Cosmo Securities avoided  the worst through rescue measures on the part of Daiwa Bank.  Although popular opinion is varied regarding this, more than a  few feel they should have been allowed to go bankrupt.    However, there is another side to this. What would actually  have happened if Cosmo had become technically insolvent? Under  the current securities settlement system the failure of Cosmo  probably would have reverberated through the system and in the  worst case other securities firms could have been drawn into the  same position. Had that happened, the current securities  settlement system could not have quarantined the risk.    Let's try to look this in concrete terms. The Cosmo  Securities operational crisis came to light on 13 August. What  would have been the outcome of the stock and bond trades made by  Cosmo up to the day the company would have entered default?    Stock settlements take place on the fourth day following the  trade. Consequently, assuming that all were business days, Cosmo  would have been unable to meet settlement following the 13th  for transactions made on 10, 11, and 12 August. Thus, the  company would have been unable to pay the proceeds of trades  made in behalf of sellers of stock and could not have fulfilled  its obligations on demand.    Which is to say, because in four-day settlements the  certificates are also transferred on the fourth day, in a manner  of speaking we could say that the flow of funds and certificates  would have come to a halt. However, in terms of risk, being  unable to sell when one wants to sell causes harm and being  unable to purchase when one wants to buy entails losses as well.    This is not all. Strictly speaking, this is tantamount to  default.    This is because securities firms use checks for funds  settlements for some situations. For example, the date when  Cosmo Securities would have had to issue a check as settlement  for a 10 August buy was 13 August, the fourth day. The date when  the bank (the bank having the account of the seller in the  transaction) would have taken delivery of the check, would have  honored it and transferred it into the seller's account would  have been one day later, 14 August. Consequently, although  formally speaking it appears that the funds settlement occurs  the same day as the certificate transfer, in reality the seller  would have received the funds paid by Cosmo Securities the day  after the certificate had been transferred.    Moreover, what we must consider here is the fact that Cosmo  Securities was bankrupt. Assuming that funds remain in the  account of a business that is bankrupt makes no sense. Rather,  it is more realistic to assume that the funds to cover the  amount of the check would not have been in the account.  Consequently, if we understand this fact, the bank on which the  check was drawn would return the check issued between banks in  the funds settlement marked insufficient funds. Consequently,  Cosmo Securities would have been in a stop payment status and in  the end the recipient of the funds would have sustained a loss.    Put another way, settlement would not occur on the fourth  day  following a sale and would not actually happen until the sixth  day, allowing two days for the check to clear, at which time the  trade would fall through. Thus, the settlement risk following  the transfer of the certificate would have continued two days  beyond the settlement date.  <H5>  Are the Emergency Reserve Funds Adequate? </H5>   It is not that this issue of securities settlement risk has  not been debated before now. On the contrary, an international  inquiry was conducted in 1989 into creating an infrastructure  that would avoid settlement risks and a report was issued on the  securities settlement system as it then was. This was the  initiative of the "Group of 30" (G30) leading countries  concerned with securities.    The report made nine recommendations aimed at improving the  securities settlement system. Those applying to Japan were: (1)  netting; and (2) the simultaneous settlement of funds and  securities.    First, (1) netting being a structure for settling the claims  and obligations existing between parties A and B involved in a  transaction. Although netting between two parties (bilateral  netting) is already widely employed in Japan, the problem is  conducting multilateral transactions involving three or more  parties (multilateral netting).    There is no way to put this into practice other than to  establish a settlement agency to function between the parties to  the transaction. Thus, the settlement agency and the company  representative involved in a transaction could draw on an  emergency fund earmarked for settlements where there is  nonpayment of settlement funds. In reality, arrangements would  be made in advance to replenish the fund in anticipation of  payments that would draw down the fund.    Although such a system is widespread among the securities  markets of Europe and the United States, regrettably it has been  introduced into Japan only in the Money Futures Exchange. The  Tokyo Stock Exchange appears to have a function similar to this;  however, the reality is that its fund must be judged unreliable.    The emergency fund of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is  money for losses and indemnification for breach of contract now  totals only a little less than 6 billion yen. This amount is  actually quite paltry were truly large stock transactions to be  involved. Total losses stemming from default on trades is the  "net base." Moreover, such losses are indemnified by this  reserve fund for "occasions when liquidation or full payment of  losses due to nonpayment of debt cannot be made in accordance  with the principle of good will, or with business and other  rules." Consequently, on the surface we cannot easily compare  transaction amounts.    Although we must not lose sight of this point, at the same  time, as we discussed earlier, in the case of stock trades with  settlement on the fourth day, it is unforgivable that there  should be a one day difference between payment and transfer that  could give rise to losses. Is 6 billion yen enough to cover any  losses? There are those within the securities industry who are  saying, "The fund does not in reality suppose the possibility of  bankruptcies" (leading securities firm).    According to the rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the  governing body may decide that the exchange can gather fresh  funds from company representatives in case the emergency fund is  drawn down. However, one must assume that were a major  securities bankruptcy to occur, a focused and unlimited fund  would be required. The burden placed on the company  representative would not be trivial.  <H5>  Government Bond Trading Moving Toward Delivery versus Payment </H5>   Most importantly, a discussion of the fund scope is not the  primary consideration from the viewpoint of alleviating  securities settlement risks. The reason is that this is nothing  more than after-the-fact management once a stop payment occurs.  Instead, the highest priority topic in terms of a risk policy is  "preventing the occurrence of risk through eliminating the time  differential between the two separate settlements of the funds  and the certificates."    The degree of settlement risk is manifested in the  mathematical formula, "the pending settlement amount times the  pending settlement time." Consequently, reducing the amount of  the pending settlement and shortening the pending settlement  time would be effective in lowering the risk occurrence rate. If  transfer of the negotiable securities by the seller and  settlement of the funds by the buyer are accomplished  simultaneously, theoretically the risk drops to zero. Herein is  the reason for the G30's recommending the implementation of  provision (2), simultaneous securities and funds settlements  (popularly called DVP [delivery versus payment]).    Accordingly, if we examine Japan's securities settlement  system, at first glance it appears that simultaneous settlement  is a reality. That is because certificates and funds have to be  liquidated on the same day through a settlement structure that  is the fourth day for stocks and five and 10 days for BB  (broker's broker) settlements involving government bond trades.  However, we discussed earlier that it is not a reality in the  case of stock trades.    For fixed period contracts involving government bond trades  that are handled as broker's broker trades, settlements are made  for a set day double the five days for stock trades. As for the  settlement method, although in general account transfers are  used, in some cases checks are used. In these cases, the buyer's  funds settlement is delivered by check the day before  settlement. For this reason, once the check drawn on the bank  maintaining the company's account is presented to the bank  holding the seller's account, in reality a one-day delay occurs  before the money is actually deposited into the seller's  account. If we consider this in parallel with the transfer of  the certificate, we find that with the buyer delivers a check  one day prior to transfer and that there is still a one-day  delay pending settlement.    Moreover, in terms of account transfers, certificate and  funds settlement times do not coincide at all.    Moreover, this does not suffice as an explanation for  broker's broker transactions. Which is to say, this is because  in these cases the buyer and seller have not made a mutual  contract on the same trade. For example, in the case of Nippon  Sogo Securities, which maintains a representative broker's  broker market and which has a dealer's license, the company can  make trades independently and do settlements standing between  buyer and seller. That is, the seller sells to Nippon Sogo  Securities even as on the other side the buyer buys from them.  Consequently, should it happen one day that the company does not  receive the certificates and furthermore that the funds  settlement is delayed, the stop payment order for the debt falls  to Nippon Sogo Securities. In this sense, as with funds  settlements with domestic exchanges, it must cover the  occurrence directly with the settling parties.    Should we employ forward leaning evaluation of the current  structure as "a structure in which unexpected situations are  quarantined," or, improve the system with the judgment that  "each contract carries risk?" The latter is now the goal being  concretely examined by the involved parties. The basis for this  is the fundamental recognition that, "for not being a rational  system, the market will be shaken by unexpected events. It is  extremely important that unexpected situations which occur for  specific securities firms not reverberate through the market" (a  leading securities firm).    Accordingly, what is currently being put into place is the  move to DVP. The concept is that simultaneous settlements will  take place with funds transfers going through Bank of Japan  (BOJ) current deposit accounts and certificate transfers through  the BOJ network. For government bond bookkeeping, a government  bonds transfer settlement system was introduced in 1980 and  since May 1990 the transfer business has been on-line using the  BOJ network. Regarding certificate transfers there are no real  problems.  <H5>  Driving a Porsche on Farm Paths </H5>   Securities firms and banks that participate in the broker's  broker market and who carry out major trades in government bonds  have current deposit and government bond accounts with the BOJ.  In addition, if market participants who have government bond  accounts but not current deposit accounts could make use of  accounts with "proxy settlement banks," there would be no  problems.    The introduction of a simultaneous settlement system which  ties together both infrastructures concerned with settlements is  planned for this coming March [1994]. Tokyo Stock Exchange  government bond transactions similarly are being made DVP. For  the leading security firms involved in the government bond  market, one-time settlement amounts reach several trillion yen.  To respond to emergencies in this gigantic market, major moves  toward conversion to DVP next year are under way.    Most important, settlement risks inherent in securities  trades despite this do not disappear entirely. As ever, a  pending settlement time for stock trades continues to exist and  in the case of general bonds other than government bonds,  settlements face a tougher situation. Because the emphasis up to  now has been on holding rather than on circulation in the case  of general bonds, it has been difficult to discuss settlement  risks. However, given the importance of a set number of days for  transfers, the present system has serious problems in that "the  completion of the name transfer and the funds settlement do not  at all coincide" (leading securities firm).    As it is, should the circulation of general bonds gain in  frequency, we can anticipate that, "While funds settlement will  go forward, the ownership of the certificate will remain  unclear." A person connected with securities points out that  even now, even if trading is carried from A to E in a short  period, "By abbreviating the transfer bookkeeping procedures  from B to D, there still will be the problem of managing the  transfer of ownership from A directly to E on settlement day."  Accordingly, should a related securities bankruptcy occur, there  will be "utter chaos."    It goes without saying that stipulations for speedy  settlements are needed in order to develop the securities  market. However, what I am talking about is that an  infrastructure that will not present obstacles to settlement  needs to be put in place. One person connected with the  securities industry expressed this metaphorically as follows.    "Are we going to drive a tractor along farm paths or a  Porsche on the autobahn? These are the only options." The  current securities market seems to be driving a Porsche along  farm paths that even now have yet to be properly maintained.</p>

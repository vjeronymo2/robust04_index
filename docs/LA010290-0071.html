			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRICES RISE IN POLAND AS SHIFT TO FREE-MARKET ECONOMY STARTS  </P> <P> Bus fares and gasoline doubled in price and electricity quadrupled Monday under  a radical plan by the non-Communist government to transform Poland's centrally  planned economy to capitalism.  </P> <P> The price of coal, a major source of heat in Polish homes, officially increased  by 600%, the cost of electricity by 400% and the price of heating gas by 400%.  </P> <P> Rail and intercity bus passengers found that ticket prices had gone up an  average of 250%, while the price of municipal bus tickets doubled.  </P> <P> Most gasoline stations were shut for the New Year's holiday. However, those  open were selling regular gasoline for 2,400 zlotys per liter, up from 1,200  zlotys.  </P> <P> Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz acknowledged that there will be hardships  in the coming months. However, he stressed that the increases are needed to  halt Poland's 900% annual inflation and to end the nation's economic decline.  </P> <P> "There are no solutions devoid of risk," the official news agency PAP quoted  him as saying.  </P> <P> The far-reaching plan is intended to supplant the centrally directed economy  run by the Communists during their four-decade rule. But there is concern that  the economic shock will be too much for Poles, who earn an average monthly wage  of 350,000 zlotys ($37).  </P></p>

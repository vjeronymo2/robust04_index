			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Closing loopholes may save up to Pounds 2bn Payments in gold bars, coffee beans and manipulations of profit-related pay formulae are among the choice options of tax avoiders that were killed in the Budget. The chancellor closed a number of loopholes which he estimated would save Pounds 2bn over the next three years. The most significant proposals were: Prevention of any artificial schemes to avoid pay-as-you-earn and National Insurance contributions by paying staff in gold, coffee and other assets. The estimated savings will be Pounds 200m in 1994-95 and a further Pounds 75m in 1995-96. The change will stop such payments for pay-as-you-earn from the time of the Finance Act next year. But the same schemes in use for National Insurance contributions were cancelled from midnight. Tightened regulations on profit-related pay to ensure that relief is concentrated on genuine schemes for employees. The estimated savings will be Pounds 40m in 1993-94 and Pounds 100m in 1994-95. The amendments will increase the upper limit on profits which an employer may disregard in calculating profit-related pay and remove disproportionate status to special schemes favouring particular units within a business. Only permitting indexation of capital gains in the future to extinguish a capital gain, and not to create or increase a capital loss. This is expected to raise Pounds 50m in 1994-95, rising to about Pounds 300m in 1996-97. Preventing companies from being sold in circumstances to ensure that their liabilities cannot be collected, which could save Pounds 100m. Toughening up the conditions for companies that control foreign companies in low tax areas overseas, estimated to save Pounds 50m. Tightening abuses on stamp duty, which should save Pounds 60m in 1994-95. The chancellor also ended a little known tax relief on payments made as a result of extortion paid to criminals. Mr Clarke said: 'The tax avoidance industry is always ingenious, but it is one industry which this government has never helped.'</p>

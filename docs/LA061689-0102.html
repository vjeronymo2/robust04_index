			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Andrew Stevovich's paintings defy categorization and that's always good. The  label of social realism doesn't quite fit his '30s garbed men and women  crowding theaters and cafes. The women look like those straight-nosed,  full-lipped damsels from Pre-Raphaelite art, but Stevovich distorts and  flattens his figures just enough to give everything the doughy, unshadowed look  of folk work. Details are edged with a fine black line that adds a fussy sense  of precision and truth-to-fact, but you soon conclude that his ripe imagination  has choreographed every stilted gaze and gesture. In "The Audience of the Club  Durango" a dozen figures dressed in their post-Depression best are crammed into  a tight agitated composition. Depicted only from the waist up, the sea of white  faces looks furtively aside, their hands tug nervously at clothing, they  whisper or lurk in the background to caress.

Hosokawa offered the apology at a meeting of cabinet  ministers following the day's regular cabinet session, the  officials said.    On Friday, leaders of the coalition parties agreed to  renounce the tax plan Hosokawa announced at an early Thursday  morning news conference. It called for abolishing the 3 percent  consumption tax and instead introducing a new indirect tax on  sales of goods and services.    In a meeting with Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior official of the  alliance between the Japan New Party (JNP) and Sakigake  (Harbinger), Hosokawa expressed the hope that the coalition  parties will discuss the tax reform plan, the officials said.  Hosokawa heads the JNP, while Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura leads Sakigake. Both parties are in the ruling  coalition.</p>

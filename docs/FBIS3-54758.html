A Nonfuturologist's Forecast for  Readers of Our Newspaper"]    [Text] As the New Year approaches, it is customary to make  predictions. This time we will dispense with futurologists,  fortune-tellers, and psychics. No one apart from us can say  what is in store for you, our readers, in the pages of  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in 1994.    As an official organ, the newspaper will continue to keep  you  acquainted with all official documents -- laws, edicts, decrees,  directives, and statutes. In the new year this list will grow.  We plan to print the most important draft legislative acts as  well as departmental instructions, recommendations [ukazaniye],  and clarifications. We will begin prompt publication of  collections of documents in the series entitled "ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA Library" [Biblioteka Rossiyskoy Gazety].    The newspaper will be paying special attention to  privatization. Beginning in January, two special editions will  be published at regular intervals with information on investment  funds and property funds. They will be useful to enterprises,  entrepreneurs, and ordinary share holders, in other words to all  of us. In addition, in the new year ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  subscribers in central regions will receive each week a free  color supplement on special topics. The first will be  "ROSSIYSKAYA NEDVIZHIMOST" [Russian Real Estate].    The editorial office has concluded a contract with the  confederation of consumer societies. Together we will keep  readers informed about commodities (quality and prices),  services (from consumer services to financial services), water  and air, and housing (from construction rights to rental  charges).    There will be another weekly newspaper within the newspaper  wholly dedicated to problems of the economy, business, and  marketing.    Our country is multinational. We often talk about that but  often forget about it, too. As of the new year, ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA will feature ethnic sections on the culture, daily life,  language, and history of the peoples inhabiting Russia.    The newspaper's Saturday edition will be somewhat different.  We can hardly produce a 16-page edition (our financial  potential is not great) but we promise that on Saturdays readers  will find in their newspapers scoops, scandals, crossword  puzzles, and everything else which makes for light reading at  weekends.    These are by no means all our plans. We shall compensate our  subscribers for copies of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA which they did not  receive in the outgoing year by providing free inserts and  supplements.    We congratulate ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers on the New Year!  We wish you all stability, peace, health, and prosperity.</p>

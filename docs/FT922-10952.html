			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: IBM holds talks with clone maker INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, is in talks with Northgate Computer Systems. The talks may lead to IBM taking a stake in the small personal computer manufacturer and to IBM offering Northgate's 'clone' computers as a lower price alternative to its own PC products. Although no firm agreement has yet been reached the talks appear to be the latest move by IBM to bolster its shrinking share of the world PC market. The move follows IBM's agreement to develop advanced PCs with Apple Computers, its arch rival. IBM is seeking deals with 'clone' manufacturers, whose low-priced copies of IBM's designs cost IBM much of its PC market dominance. Clones are functionally and sometimes physically almost indistinguishable from IBM's own designs. But because clone makers have lower fixed costs and are prepared to accept much slimmer profit margins, their products sell for lower prices. With PC prices declining precipitously, IBM is looking for ways to compete directly with priced machines, while at the same time maintaining the premium brand appeal of its own Personal Systems products. IBM sells a clone in south-east Asia through a joint venture company formed last year with Hong Leong Corporation of Singapore. In Europe, IBM is expected to offer PC clones built by an Asian manufacturer through a newly-formed subsidiary that will focus on the low end of the PC market. An investment by IBM in Northgate could represent an opportunity for IBM to offer lower priced products in the US. Northgate, based in Minnesota, manufactures a complete line of high-performance, low-cost clones, including notebook computers, desktop machines and tower configurations. Northgate's sales grew from Dollars 32m in 1988 to Dollars 203m in 1990, but its attempts to expand sales organisation led to losses of Dollars 6.9m in 1990. Since then the company has retrenched, reporting sales of Dollars 167m and profits of Dollars 2.7m in 1991.</p>

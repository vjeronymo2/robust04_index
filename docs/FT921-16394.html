			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine crops washed out A 24-hour downpour over the new year holiday has wreaked havoc in Argentina's agricultural heartland. Mr Marcelo Regunaga, the agriculture secretary, said yesterday that 300,000 hectares (740,000 acres) of farm land in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe were affected by the rainfall and estimated damage at about USDollars 250m. The rain has affected winter crops in the Pampas, principally wheat and barley, which are due to be harvested now. The new year downpour compounded damage caused by heavy rainfall during December. If Mr Regunaga's estimates are borne out, wheat would be the most affected crop. Analysts value this year's crop at Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m. Unusually, independent observers say the government is over-reacting: usually, government officials accuse farmers of exaggerating their problems. Yesterday, analysts warned that it was still too early to estimate the impact of the rainfall and emphasised that the weather over the coming days would be crucial to evaluating the situation. Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an agricultural economist, commented: 'If we have a day of strong sunshine followed by two or three days of dry weather, wheat could easily recover and barley would hardly be affected. It would be risky to hazard a figure on the damage at the moment.' However, officials estimate damage of Dollars 100m in Buenos Aires province from storms earlier in the month. The bad weather caps a year in which Argentina's farmers struggled with rising production costs and falling prices as the government implemented a radical anti-inflation and economic liberalisation programme. However, government officials insist that prices are improving and that production costs will stabilise in 1992.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Shares surge on interest rate hopes: Lower than expected retail sales and inflation fuel expectations of a base rate cut Interest rate fever swept the financial markets yesterday after news of lower than expected retail sales and inflation in December revived hopes of a cut in base rates from 5.5 per cent. Equities soared and closed at new highs, led by shares in medium-sized companies. Frantic buying pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 index up 3.4 per cent and the blue chip FT-SE 100 up 1 per cent. Prices of government gilt-edged stock staged a strong advance of about 1 per cent. Sterling fell, dropping 1 3/4 pfennigs in London, as investors reasoned that yesterday's evidence of a slowing recovery might persuade Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Bank of England to reverse their decision last week to hold interest rates. Retail sales fell in volume by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent last month compared with November. Although the Central Statistical Office said the year-on-year increase, at 4 per cent, was the highest since July, the news surprised the City which had been expecting a more robust rise following reports from some of the bigger retailers of buoyant Christmas sales. Interest rate hopes were further fuelled by yesterday's announcement of the retail prices index for December. Although the 'headline' rate of inflation jumped to 1.9 per cent from 1.4 per cent in November, in part due to Budget tax changes, the rise was less than expected and meant that the headline rate had remained below 2 per cent for a full calendar year for the first time since 1946. An increase to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, added to the City's belief that inflation is under control. However, Treasury ministers gave no encouragement to hopes of lower interest rates yesterday. Mr Clarke said he was satisfied with the recovery, which was steady and strengthening. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, later told BBC radio's World At One programme that the government would set interest rates to deliver stable prices and continued good control of inflation. 'The overwhelming lesson of our own economic history must surely be that if you don't deliver a stable monetary environment here at home, then any attempt to build a sustainable recovery is built on sand,' he said. Today financial markets will have further evidence of a possible slowdown in the pace of recovery to digest. The latest survey of manufacturing and service companies from the British Chambers of Commerce, published overnight, said that growth flattened in the final quarter of last year. It warned that recent employment gains could be reversed. The regional consumer survey by Gallup and Business Strategies, released today, highlighted widespread pessimism among consumers about prospects for their finances this year. It showed that increases in spending are continuing, but with little or no further acceleration. While interest rate hopes were the main spur behind yesterday's market movements, other factors contributed to the surge in equities. Strong options-related buying of medium-sized companies, worth an estimated Pounds 1bn, collided with stock shortages among market makers to push the FT-SE Mid 250 index up 135.5 points to 4,148.8, making yesterday's 38.1 point gain to 3,475.1 in the FT-SE 100 index appear modest.

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: Schiller and a fiery anorak - Theatre There have been two outstanding openings in the London theatre in the last few days apart from the already acclaimed revival of Tom Stoppard's Travesties at the Barbican. One is Schiller's Wallenstein at the Royal Shakespeare Company's much smaller theatre, The Pit. The other is Anorak of Fire, a wonderful one-man show which has arrived at The Arts Theatre non-stop from the Edinburgh Festival. Between them they show the best of the old and the hopes of the new, though naturally we shall take the Schiller first. It would be foolish to pretend that even in this truncated version - down to just over three hours from an original eight - Wallenstein is not at times heavy going, especially at the beginning. It takes a while to acclimatise, to the geography as well as the style. For this is high German seriousness about the passions involved in the thirty years' war. If you make the initial effort, however, you are in for a magnificent experience. To summarise wildly, the main difference between Schiller and Shakespearean tragedy is the absence of comic relief. In Schiller there are no sub-plots, no trips below the stairs. It is intensity throughout. Yet even that is slightly unfair. The full trilogy of Wallenstein contains an opening play, Wallenstein's Camp, which deals with the reactions of the peasants and ordinary soldiers to the war. This has been completely omitted from the adaptation and direction by Tim Albery at The Pit. The surprise is how well the omission works. Apart from a few chairs, practically the only prop is a map of central Europe circa 1633. The map matters, though not in detail, for it shows what a melting pot Europe was. The wars were fought by mercenaries from all over the continent, including offshore islands such as Britain. They could be hired, fired, and could defect. Wallenstein was a minor nobleman and a military genius who inspired loyalty in his troops and whose ambitions eventually clashed with those of the Emperor Ferdinand. He sought to defect to the Protestants and failed. That essentially is what the play is about. Watch, and feel, the passions as it unfolds. Ken Bones, who specialises in austere parts such as Sir Thomas More at the Shaw three years ago, plays the agonising and the pride of Wallenstein to perfection. There is pathos (and some lightening of tone) from Olivia Williams as his daughter, Thekla. Above all, there is some superb playing between Philip Voss as Piccolomini, the officer who betrays Wallenstein, and Toby Stephens as the Piccolomini son whose loyalties are divided. The blank verse translation by Francis Lamport is immaculate - and moving. True, it is not Shakespeare, but nor is it meant to be. *** Anorak of Fire, the first stage work by Stephen Dinsdale, revolves around the unlikely subject of train-spotting, though as James Holmes speaks his lines, you will see that there is more to spotting than trains. Holmes has a lovely shy Yorkshire voice, an engaging walk and face, while Dinsdale has given him some splendidly funny lines. Note the explanations for why spotting is on the increase and why real spotters wear trousers not jeans. On this showing Dinsdale is the most interesting new talent in London theatre since Alan Ayckbourn arrived, also at The Arts, about 30 years ago. Wallenstein is in repertory at The Pit (071) 638 8891. Anorak of Fire is at The Arts until October 2 (071) 836 2132.</p>

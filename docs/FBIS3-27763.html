Some people observe that North Korea is intentionally  delaying negotiations with the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] by considering the beginning time of the exercise.    In the event satisfactory progress is not made in nuclear  inspection negotiations with North Korea, the Team Spirit  exercise will be conducted -- even in the later part of the  year. Yi Kang- tok reports:    [Begin Yi recording] A relevant government official revealed  that if no progress is made in negotiations for solution of the  North Korean nuclear issue, the Team Spirit exercise, which  usually begins around February, may be conducted in autumn this  year.    The official said that no concrete preparation for this  year's Team Spirit have been initiated up to present, unlike  other years. If a decision is made on conducting the exercise,  it can possibly begin with only one month of preparations.  Therefore, the observation that if the ROK and the United States  fail to decide on conducting the Team Spirit by next month, this  year's Team Spirit exercise would be spontaneously canceled is  erroneous.    Some people recently viewed that as the Team Spirit exercise  usually begins at end of February, the exercise will be not  conducted after that period and the reason North Korea is  delaying and not showing sincerity in nuclear inspection  negotiations, is related to the time of conducting the exercise.    The official added that if North Korea is positive toward  resolving the nuclear issue, including acceptance of IAEA  inspections, suspension of the Team Spirit can be announced in  accordance with the agreement between the United States and  North Korea late last year.

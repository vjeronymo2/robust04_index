			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rothschild Bank opens a new account - Ian Rodger examines attempts to end a troubled decade in the family business THE British, French and Swiss Rothschild families who own Zurich-based Rothschild Bank are hoping that an additional SFr150m (Dollars 115.30m) in provisions, plus a new general manager, can bring an end to a very troubled decade at the bank. 'We hope that this is a book that is now closed,' Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of the bank, said yesterday. Sir Evelyn said the latest provisions, which are in addition to the SFr100m announced in July, arose entirely from loans made improperly by the bank to companies associated with the two German-Canadian property financiers, Mr Karsten von Wersebe and Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg. In a statement this week, the bank recalled that 'the individual concerned at the bank' had been arrested. Last month, Mr Jurg Heer, a former senior executive of the Rothschild Bank, was arrested in Zurich for irregularities involving several millions of Swiss francs, according to the Zurich prosecutor. Subsequently, it was confirmed that the bank had also infringed Swiss Banking Commission regulations by lending more than the equivalent of 20 per cent of its capital to companies related to Mr von Wersebe. Rothschild Bank, like many in Switzerland, specialises in managing funds for rich individuals and normally does not engage in lending. If this were the only unseemly incident that the bank had suffered in recent years, no one would be too concerned. But it is, in fact, the third in eight years. The last was in 1990, when Rothschild was retained by the US tobacco group Philip Morris to advise it on its planned acquisition of Jacob Suchard. Prior to news of this takeover being made public, the bank bought some SFr11.8m worth of Suchard shares for its own account through a Panamanian company. Shortly after these purchases came to light, Mr Erwin Brunner, then the bank's general manager, resigned and the bank donated its SFr2.3m in profits from the position to charity. The Swiss authorities investigated the affair but no charges for insider trading were filed. In 1984, the bank made a SFr49.9m loan to Marc Rich, the Zug-based international commodity dealers, secured by a first mortgage on a Rich tanker. The Swiss Banking Commission, upheld by the Swiss Federal Court a year later, decided that the loan was a fiction aimed at protecting the tanker from confiscation by US tax authorities who then had a claim against Mr Marc Rich. As such, the loan contravened Swiss banking law. Even an official of the Swiss Banking Commission, which as a rule does not comment on developments at individual banks, was prompted to observe a few weeks ago that this constituted 'quite a list' of problems. Sources familiar with the bank suggest that its difficulties stem from a low level of supervision during much of the 1980s. This, in turn, reflected tensions in the French and British wings of the Rothschild family. Until 1991, when a Swiss company controlled by the British family raised its stake to 51 per cent, the bank was controlled by the French family represented by the ageing Baron Elie de Rothschild, who was chairman. Baron Elie hired Mr Alfred Hartmann, a former executive of Union Bank of Switzerland and of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, the Basle-based pharmaceutical group, as general manager in 1983. Mr Hartmann, who is still on the Rothschild Bank board, was also a director of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Brunner took over as general manager at the beginning of 1989, but following his resignation two years later a replacement was not found until this week when the appointment of Mr Guy Wais, general manager of Guyerzeller Bank in Zurich, was announced. Sir Evelyn said he could not comment on the past. He pointed out that he took over as chairman in July 1991 and shortly after discovered serious problems. He said no other bank executives would be leaving as a result of the latest irregularities. He acknowledged that the bank had lost 'a very few' customers as a result of the scandal, but said most were loyal and, he hoped, satisfied with the service they were getting. He said Mr Hartmann's continued presence on the board was 'a fair question that has to be dealt with in due course'. The bank's financial position remained sound and it was operating profitably, Sir Evelyn said. When the first SFr100m of provisions were declared, the bank liquidated its SFr63.5m in hidden reserves. Responsibility for the loans involved in the latest SFr150m has been shifted to a private Rothschild family company in Switzerland, leaving shareholders' equity at the SFr204m level declared in the March, 1992 balance sheet.</p>

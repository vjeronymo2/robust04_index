			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The Vietnamese Communist  Party's Central Committee began a 48-hour extraordinary session  Monday to prepare for the party's national conference which  opens Thursday, well-informed Vietnamese sources said.    During the meeting, the party's highest authorities are  expected to discuss Secretary General Do Muoi's political report  and Central Committee personnel changes, the sources said.    Both issues were discussed at the sixth Central Committee  plenum last November and taken up again at the National  Assembly's second annual session in December in Hanoi.    According to an official Vietnamese source, 15 of the 145  Central Committee members will be replaced during the  conference, the first time one has been held between two  Congresses.    Politburo personalities and government officials might also  be replaced, the informed sources said. In addition to the  replacement of political personnel, the task of this  "mini-Congress" is to make a political point of "doi moi" or  renovation, promised since 1987, by discussing the rhythm of  economic reforms and defining the direction to take until the  eighth Congress in 1996.    The 649 delegates who will attend the six-day party  conference include Central Committee members and representatives  of the army, the provinces, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and  organizations such as the Homeland Front, the Women's Union and  labor unions.    Observers say it is unlikely that the regime will slow the  pace of economic reforms. However, some leaders have called for  a slowdown, even a pause, in the economic liberalization process  out of fear that opening the economy to the outside world could  lead to social unrest and political destabilization.    On Monday, the army's daily newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN,  considered close to conservative circles, called for  "maintaining and consolidating political stability" while  reaffirming "the choice of economic reforms along socialist  lines."    "The painful lessons of the Soviet bloc have shown that  social turmoil would lead to a political crisis," the newspaper  said after launching a new warning against "hostile forces" that  seek to "overthrow the socialist regime, sabotage the  modernization work and destroy the party's leading role."    "Political modernization is a very sensitive question that  must be conducted in a progressive and wise manner," the  newspaper said, adding that "it is not absolutely necessary to  sacrifice political interests to benefit economic development."    "We are determined to maintain the party's leading role, and  we will accept neither pluralism nor multi-partyism, the  newspaper stressed, saying that "revolutionary gains can only be  defended by political stability."    Former party members, close to dissident intellectuals, have  recently criticized the single-party system and called for a  change in the Communist Party's leadership.</p>

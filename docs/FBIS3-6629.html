			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Discussion" between Seiichiro Saito, professor at Rikkyo </F> University, and Takanori Mizuno Takanori Mizuno, international  finance critic; place and date not given: "No Time To Spare for  Banks on Verge of Crisis"]    [Excerpts] Viewed from the standpoint of bad-debt  ratio, Japan's banks have already crossed the critical line. It  is even conceivable that some large banks could go bankrupt  during 1994. The question is, what specific ideas should be  formulated for the process of dealing with these bad loans, a  process that can no longer afford a moment's delay?  <H5>  Is a Banking Crisis Already in Progress? </H5>   [Saito] I believe that the biggest hurdle for the Japanese  economy to overcome in the next two years--1994 and 1995--is the  task of normalizing its financial system. What is important in  this connection is to make a sharp distinction between  "normalization" and "stabilization." The Ministry of Finance  [MOF], judging from its known position, would inevitably try to  stabilize the financial system at any cost, but my point is that  the proper order dictates normalization first, followed by  stabilization.    Land prices will probably continue to decline even further  in  the days ahead, and surely there will be some bank failures. To  date, the bankruptcy cases involving Kamaishi Credit  Association, Toyo Credit Association, and Toho Sogo Bank have  had to be dealt with already, but I suspect that there will be  several bankruptcy cases involving much larger financial  institutions. If that should happen, any mistake in handling  would lead to dire consequences; this is why I say that the  ground rules and methodology for the handling of such an  eventuality must be clearly established now before it is too  late. Yet both the Bank of Japan [BOJ] and MOF are doing no  such thing; they are simply hoping for the best.    Some financial institutions are gradually beginning to think  about the question of how to ensure their survival through their  own efforts, but I think they are still a small minority.    [Mizuno] I, for one, believe that the present situation  essentially is a banking crisis.    [Saito] On a par in scale with the previous one known as the  "Showa Depression"?    [Mizuno] I do not intend to make such a comparison in that  the previous one occurred when the financial system as well as  the entire economic system were far less mature than they are  today; I do believe, however, that our current crisis is at  least as bad as, if not more serious than, the banking crisis  the United States had in the second half of the 1980's and  through 1991. I also believe that our current crisis is totally  beyond remedy.    [Saito] For sure the situation is deteriorating.    [Mizuno] The 4 January [1994] issue of the YOMIURI SHIMBUN  reported the bad-debt ratios, figured in percentage of total  outstanding loans, of 11 city banks. If this report is  accurate, the ratios are as follows: 15.5 percent for Hokkaido  Takushoku Bank, 9.2 percent for Daiwa Bank, 8.0 percent for  Sakura Bank, 6.7 percent for Fuji Bank, and 6.3 percent for  Tokai Bank. The average for the 11 banks is 5.9 percent. Five  of the 11 banks have ratios higher than 6 percent.    [Saito] Anything over 6 percent is dangerous.    [Mizuno] At the height of bad-debt ratios among 10 major  banks during the banking crisis in the United States, Citibank  recorded the highest ratio of 5.72 percent in 1990. At that  time, the U.S. banking authorities became nervous about the  possibility of Citibank going bankrupt.    Meanwhile, in the case of Japan, the amount of bad debts  Mitsubishi Bank reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission [SEC] was 1.7 times the amount made public in Japan  in accordance with domestic standards. So, if the total amount  of bad debts being carried by 21 major Japanese banks was  estimated by taking into account the unpublicized portions, the  figure could reach 40 trillion yen.    [Saito] I, too, estimate the figure to be around 40 trillion  yen. If so, it will push the bad-debt ratio up to 10 percent.    [Mizuno] That figure is extremely high when compared to  Citibank's 5.72 percent. In terms of actual amounts, the total  value of bad assets held by all of U.S. banks as of June 1993  was less than 11 trillion yen.    [Saito] Which means that Japanese banks are stuck with  nearly  four times as much bad assets as those held by U.S. banks --  eight times as much if the difference in scale of the two  countries' economies is factored in.    [Mizuno] Even that fact alone is reason enough to warrant  much more serious attention to the current problem of bad assets  being held by Japan's banks.    [Saito] But in the case of Japanese banks, they have a  mind-set that counts on "the authorities" as the last resort.  It is the mentality of believing that the BOJ will come to  their rescue when the chips are down. This belief, which sets  the BOJ apart from the FRB [Federal Reserve Bank] and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] of the United  States, gives them a sense of security.    [Mizuno] In the United States, the disposition of banks' bad  assets is subject to very strict conditions demanded by the  banking authorities.    [Saito] Looking at the current state of Japanese banks, one  finds that the second regional banks (formerly known as "sogo  banks" or "mutual loan and savings banks") in urban areas --  especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the Kinki region, and  the Chukyo region -- have purchased a lot of land at high  prices. It was in the final phase of the bubble economy that  they invested heavily in land speculation projects. In  contrast, credit associations have escaped with relatively fewer  bad loans of this kind. Then there is another problem created  by agricultural sector financial intitutions through their  excessive lending to housing developers.    But there is a slight difference in perception between you,  Mr. Mizuno, and me: that is, my view is that the present  condition is still in the polypoid stage. If left unattended,  however, it will develop into an active cancer, which could very  well spread from second regional banks and agricultural  financial institutions to the three main sectors of banking --  the city bank, the long-term credit bank, and the trust bank.    An incision must be performed quickly before it is too late,  but neither the MOF nor the BOJ has had the experience of  performing major surgical operations in the postwar era. What  they have been doing is limited to minor, inconsequential  procedures. Even that sort of treatment requires complicated  operations. Given their meager surgical skills, however, they  are now lost as to what to do about the case on hand. If  nothing is done about it, I think a cancer is bound to develop.    [Mizuno] I believe a cancer has already developed.  <H5>  The American Experience </H5>   [Saito] In any event, the time for an incision is nearing.  It had better be done within the next one to two years; I  believe a radical treatment is absolutely necessary within the  next two years at the latest.    [Mizuno] But the steps now being contemplated by everyone  concerned in Japan -- the MOF, the banks, and the real estate  industry -- are essentially based on a PKO [ price-keeping  operation] concept, it seems. They are not trying to root out  the ills of asset deflation; rather, their idea is to halt the  progress of asset deflation by means of a PKO measure or to  generate a mini-bubble. I think this is a fundamentally wrong  approach.    A PKO measure was tried for fear of falling stock prices,  but  when it became clear that such a measure was absolutely futile  in the market place, it was called off. In the handling of the  problem of land, too, the Real Estate Resolution Corporation  (RERC), which is already in place, and the idea of using  government funds, which is currently under study, are basically  "land PKO" measures. With this kind of measures, however, the  problem of bad assets cannot be resolved. The situation will  continue on as it is now    In the United States, a similar situation was dealt with by  the following measures: first, the market functions were fully  utilized; second, the administrative authorities wasted no time  in pressuring bank managers to dispose of their bad assets.    With respect to the market functions, the banks in the  United  States sold off their bad assets even at a loss due to  significant decline in real estate prices. In contrast, right  now the banks and the authorities in Japan are afraid of the  falling land prices; as long as such fear rules, they will never  be able to dispose of their land holdings. [passage omitted]    Real estate holdings cannot be made liquid if market  functions are ignored. This is why I believe that the policy  designed to restore land's liquidity currently under  consideration in Japan will never work.    [Saito] The problem requires more than taxation schemes such  as the lowering of the so-called land transfer tax and the  abolishment of the land value tax. The first requisite is to  bring land prices down. But this point is not understood.  Obviously everybody is afraid of losing money.    [Mizuno] I think so, too. In the United States, newspapers  such as THE WALL STREET JOURNAL carry public notices on items  put up for sale by the RTC [Resolution Trust Corp.]. The  notices give a detailed listing of the items for sale as well as  contact instructions. The would-be buyers are also told that if  they do not hear from the RTC within so many days there would be  no deal. This shows how aggressively and undaunted by falling  prices the RTC, despite being a government agency, pushed the  sale of these properties under their receivership. The RTC also  took over the banks that are either bankrupt or carrying  excessive debt, and proceeded to liquidate such banks by selling  off their bad assets.    Another thing is that, in the United States, securities  firms  are playing a share of the role in the liquidation of bank  properties. Incidentally, securities firms are involved in  nearly all aspects of the bank's activity -- product  development, for example.    No one had expected that banks in the United States could  recover so quickly. To tell you the truth, I too had failed in  my writings to predict it; likewise, in the United States,  neither the financial authorities, the private-sector bank  managers, nor even the Wall Street analysts had thought such a  quick recovery was likely.    Unless those in Japan proceed by emulating the U.S. thinking  and approach, nothing will be accomplished except that the  ownership of bad assets will merely change from one hand to  another and to yet another.  <H5>  Avoiding Losses Leads to No Movement </H5>   [Saito] The point is, a move to dispose of bad assets and  thereby to improve the contents of assets holdings necessitates  a cost. Should the fear of this cost make the banks unwilling  to either junk their bad assets or dispose of them at a loss,  there will be no movement.    As you, Mr. Mizuno, just pointed out, in the United States  bad assets were thoroughly written off. As to why Japanese  banks are unable to write off their bad assets, it is because  they are under a variety of regulatory constraints that make  even taxable write-offs, let alone tax-exempt write-offs,  difficult.    Of course from the MOF's standpoint, banks' settlements of  accounts showing red-ink figures would pose problems such as  diminishing national tax revenues; more fundamentally, however,  there is the MOF's realization that allowing the less-troubled  banks to take as much taxable write-offs as they like would  widen the gaps, and thereby upset the horizontal balance,  betweent them and those other banks that are saddled with larger  amounts of bad debts and therefore unable to do the same.  Should this happen, the MOF fears that the latter category of  banks might face credit insecurity. This is what the MOF wants  to avoid. Hence the regulatory constraints that allow all banks  to take only limited amounts of write-offs. Consequently, the  banks are unable to restructure their operations.    My view is that the entire write-off system ought to be  revised in the direction of giving the banks basically a free  hand in writing off their bad assets as long as individual banks  are willing to treat such write-offs as a matter of their own  responsibility and to pay taxes on them.    If the system is so revised, some banks that cannot afford  taxable write-offs are bound to fall into a precarious  situation. Such banks should be dealt with in one of two ways:  either provide them with "withdrawal funds" through some sort of  public agency or devise a mechanism whereby they can be closed  down; in any event, the handling of these banks should be based  primarily on market forces.    These are the kinds of steps implemented in the United  States. There, property -- bad assets -- was sold off  aggressively and was written off; at the same time, personnel  cuts were made and nonperforming divisions and branches were  eliminated. In Japan, however, these things are not being done.    It boils down to this: No pain, no results. It was painful  in the United States, but the very pain was what generated so  much financial funds.    In the United States, 200 commercial banks went bankrupt in  1989; the number of such bankruptcies fell all the way to 42 in  1993. Behind the recovery of such magnitude were the banks' own  efforts to help themselves and government's willingness to take  care of the residual problems arising from the banks' efforts.    [Mizuno] For example, on New Year's Day 1991 in the state of  Rhode Island, the governor ordered the closure of 45 financial  institutions. A few days later, the FDIC took over the Bank of  New England. At that time, as might be expected, there was a  run on the banks of Long Island, among others.    Even so, American depositors were basically calm. They were  calm because of the deposit insurance that protected their  deposit up to $100,000. In Japan, however, the total amount of  funds at the disposal of deposit insurance is only about 600  billion yen.    [Saito] Which means that the funds will not be enough even  to  cover the depositors of just one insolvent second regional bank.  There is another thing: In the United States, the power of  state governments talks.    Be that as it may, in Japan, too, I wonder whether we really  need to worry about a run on deposits. Back in the days of the  Showa financial crisis, the lack of accurate information gave  rumors free rein. Today, however, given the abundance of  information, I am inclined to think any run on deposits will be  nothing more than a temporary thing.    [Mizuno] As soon as people get wind of rumors about their  bank possibly facing a crisis, they transfer their deposits to a  better banks or to postal savings. There is a perception in the  United States that the poor state of Japanese banks is the  reason for the flow of deposits into postal savings.    [Saito] The same perception exists in Japan as well. Office  ladies and the like are frightened and saying they are going to  move their money into postal savings. Of course interest rates,  too, have something to do with their choice.  <H5>  Information Disclosure Needed First </H5>   [Saito] Still, what is needed before making such an incision  is the "karte" [the patient's chart] containing accurate data.  Without it, the surgeon would not know where to make the  incision.    I am a member of an expert committee on the question of  disclosure. The disclosure criteria being discussed at this  committee cover only debts that are either unrecoverable or in  arrears for more than six months; interest payments either  reduced or forgiven are not included. To include even those  items in the criteria is not welcomed especially by regional and  smaller financial institutions. Also not included in the  criteria are loans in arrears for less than six months.    In its reports filed with the SEC, Mitsubishi Bank includes  not only the arrears for longer than 90 days, but also interest  payments either reduced, exempted, or suspended. Properly  speaking, this ought to be the standard to follow for all  disclosures.    Unless the "karte" is maintained with clear, accurate data,  anxiety about the patient's conditions could be fanned  unnecessarily: Is it possibly a cancer? Is the cancer terminal?  Whereas if the charts clearly reflected patient's conditions,  separating sound banks from those beyond cure, I think everyone  will calm down. Furthermore, doing so will clarify the bank's  responsibility toward its shareholders and also identify  potential problems vis-a-vis depositors.    Information disclosure is a matter of course. The Japanese  practice of ignoring it is hard to believe.    [Mizuno] Citicorp, for example, divides the United States  into eight districts for its annual reports, and the annual  report contains a detailed disclosure of the loans it has issued  in each of these districts: the exact amounts of loans and their  intended purposes are classified into office building,  residential building, retail business, hotel, land,  international business, etc. Also included in the disclosure is  the degree of risk assessed for each of these loans in terms of  recovery prospects.    [Saito] In the case of Japan, granted the administrative  agencies and financial institutions themselves are at fault, but  the blame must be shared by depositors, investors, and  shareholders for being soft and less than resolute in their  dealings with banks. They ought to expres their view; they  should say, "Not disclosing information is strange; we will not  put our money in any bank that fails to disclose." I think the  consumer sovereignty is weak. Getting back to the question of  disclosure, in comparison with the three main sectors of banks,  the regional banks and those of lesser categories have become  superficial in the handling of information disclosure. City  banks are disclosing two things: the identity of their loan  customers who have gone bankrupt and their loans in arrears for  more than six months. But regional banks are disclosing only  the identity of their bankrupt loan customers. They both belong  to the same stock market, yet there is unevenness in what  information they disclose.    In dealing with this reality, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, for  example, ought to clearly point out the absurdity of such  unevenness between the two groups, both of whom are financial  institutions of the same ilk. I find it also lamentable that  investors are not complaining about this unevenness.    [Mizuno] A problem of that kind can be corrected even  tomorrow. All it takes would be for the MOF to say, "Do it!"    A review of annual reports by U.S. banks shows that since  about 1983, when the Basel Committee on Banking Supports of the  Bank for International Settlements began studying the idea of  regulating the banks' net worth ratio, U.S. banks have been  using uniform standards for disclosing their primary capital and  total capital. The FRB was behind the adoption of this practice.    When the cumulative debts of the Third World countries  became  a serious problem making investors and depositors uneasy, U.S.  banks were ordered to disclose their loans to those countries.  More recently, when real estate became a problem, U.S. banks  were ordered to disclose the details of their property-related  loans. These are matters that do not even warrant discussions  by any deliberative council.    [Saito] But in Japan they become the subjects of rancorous  debate. Although the recent revision of commercial law has made  it easier for a representative of shareholders to file a  group-action suit, because investors, shareholders, and  depositors lack the awareness as the user of the banking  service, the banks, in collusion with the authorities, tend to  take the "keep them coming but do not keep them informed"  attitude toward their customers.    In this regard, there is room for self-reflection by the  consumer as well. In the United States, it is because  investors, shareholders, and depositors have sharp eyes that the  FRB and the financial authorities inevitably become scrupulous  in righting the wrongs of the banking industry.    [Mizuno] Yet the situation has turned so critical....    [Saito] The thing is, the most difficult problem in  information disclosure is for each financial institution to  figure out the amount of its excessive debts. In the case of  Japan, because there is hardly any movement involving land, it  is quite difficult for a financial institution to figure out the  latent losses posed by its land holdings.    To make such calculation possible, if for nothing else, the  first thing to do is to liberalize taxable write-offs. When  this is done, confident and aggressive banks are likely to move  rapidly to take taxable write-offs. This in turn will give land  the liquidity. Choice pieces of land that are easily sellable  will move first, leading gradually to the formation of land  prices.    Of course there will be some pieces of land which simply  cannot be disposed of. In that event, sooner or later the  government will have to buy them up using financial funds, with  strict conditions attached, and will just have to hold onto them  for a long time.    [Mizuno] In the United States, even bad pieces of property  are being sold.    [Saito] In the United States, there is a high-risk,  high-return market to deal with things like junk bonds.    At any rate, once the steps I have outlined have been taken,  some neutral public agency should make an orderly, accurate  survey of excessive debts being carried by all the banks to be  followed by a decision as to what kind of a surgical operation  is needed.    [Mizuno] I am all for it. In the United States, banks are  clearly ranked on the basis of their net worth ratios. And  those banks excessively in debt are taken over by the  government. I think these steps ought to be taken in Japan, too.    The market reacts on the basis of these findings and  happenings. That's why the price of Citicorp's shares fell all  the way to $7.00 per share when the company was having the worst  times. But it has rallied since then to the more than $30 at  the present. The price of Bank of New England's shares had  plummeted to as low as $1.00 per share just prior to its  bankruptcy.  <H5>  The Easygoing Management of Japan's Banks </H5>   [Mizuno] I believe the managers of Japan's banks lack vigor.  And it is due to nondisclosure of information regarding their  bank's performance.    [Saito] Not only do managers lack vigor, but bank employees  also lack it.. Banks provide great in-house welfare benefits to  employees, but are not eliminating surplus workers. Banks are  not closing down their non-profitable branches; bonuses paid to  bank employees last year were more generous than those paid by  other industries.    [Mizuno] Ignorance about the actual condition of their bank  makes the employees themselves easygoing. This is why I believe  that one of the values of information disclosure lies in the  fact that it tends to make the manager more serious about  managing. It makes the manager serious about the disposition of  bad assets.    In the case of the banks in the United States, Citicorp, for  example, successfully carried out a restructuring plan called  the "Five-Point Plan" in 1991-1992. Meanwhile, Chase Manhattan  Bank announced at the beginning of 1993 a plan to reduce its bad  assets by $2 billion and began selling off its property  holdings. The market reacted very favorably to these moves.    [Saito] Those were bold decisions by the managers.    [Mizuno] In the United States, managers incapable of making  such decisions will lose their jobs. In Japan, however, if you  look at city bank operations from the standpoint of how their  branch offices are doing in attracting deposits, you will find  that many of their branches are not making profits. As a matter  of fact, among those city banks with main offices in the  provinces, there are some that maintain branches in the Tokyo  metropolitan area that are unbelievably unprofitable. Think  about these cases seriously, then the obvious conclusion is that  perhaps it is time for these banks to give up the idea of being  "city" banks. I think they should aggressively sell off their  real estate holdings in the city of Tokyo.    [Saito] City banks are holding many choice pieces of land;  if  they try to sell such land holdings there will be buyers. But  the pieces of land which these banks are now trying to turn over  to the CCPC [Central Committee on Privatization and  Commercialization] are all so odd -- either crooked or inflated  in price -- that no one would be interested in buying them. The  banks are holding onto the better pieces.    But I like to advise these banks to sell the better ones of  their land holdings first instead of holding onto them. Good  pieces of land would be sold if offered at a discount of between  20 percent and 30 percent. Banks are not doing this; instead,  they are asking the government to use public funds to buy their  unsellable pieces of land. Even if the government bought them  using public funds, they would still be useless. My advice  would be, "Don't spend public funds in a strange way."    [Mizuno] Bringing in public funds to subsidize land  purchases  and to rescue banks, even if tried, would not solve either of  the two problems. I am absolutely opposed to the idea of using  public funds to finance the CCPC or to buy up bad assets. It  will not resolve the problem.    [Saito] First of all, a manager must make the hard decision  to restructure his financial institution itself. Next, people  within the institution must become aware of the critical  situation. Information must be disclosed in order to generate  the crisis awareness. Then the government must liberalize  taxable write-offs.    Unless such a restructuring plan based on self-help efforts  is formulated and implemented, eventually the management team  will have to step down. I think everyone who attends the board  meeting ought to resign.  <H5>  A Land Holdings Liquidation Corporation Needed </H5>   [Saito] The question is, what should be the next move after  such self-help efforts? The problem is that bank's bad debts  are not only enormous but also an entaglement of all kinds of  mortgages. In order to untangle them and make them liquid, I am  afraid some sort of "bad assets shelving agency" in the form of  the National Railways' "liquidation corporation" may have to be  created.    As for the funds to finance such an agency, if money from  postal savings, the treasury investment and loan account, or  pension funds were used, it would create a perception that  banks' management failures are being rescued at the people's  expense; I don't think this is a good idea. Instead, the  government should issue a special bond explicitly for this  purpose.    Instread of the interest on the principal so financed, the  banks ought to pay it in proportion to the amounts of their bad  assets that have been set aside. Or, if in the future the  shelving agency can sell off the land it holds and make some  profit, the profit may be used to redeem the government bond.  So, to play this kind of role, I am inclined to think that some  sort of "land holdings liquidation corporation" will have to be  created.    Even then, there will be some banks which, having fallen  excessively into debt, cannot write off their bad assets. For  them, a government agency can underwrite preferred stocks in the  manner of the "reconstruction finance corporation" used in the  United States during the 1930's. In other words, to generate  underwriting capital, a "financial stabilization agency" or a  "stabilization corporation" can be created to issue a so-called  government guaranteed bond. The BOJ will buy the bond. In  effect, it will be an indirect, special financing by the BOJ.    The bright side of such financing is that the preferred  stocks underwritten will yield dividends. Such dividends plus  any profit generated will be required to be put aside in a  reserve as redemption funds to be so used later.    I am afraid that, unless tackled with such a two-phased  scheme, these pieces of land that constitute bad assets cannot  be disposed of. The first phase will require banks' self-help  efforts. It is in the second phase that a "land holdings  liquidation corporation" and a "financial stabilization agency"  backed by a form of special financing through the BOJ are to be  created. If the framework of such scheme is spelled out, I tend  to think that the situation will calm down little by little.    [Mizuno] What is the timing for the creation of these  agencies?    [Saito] Sometime during 1994-1995. And the whole scheme  should be financed with a special government bond for the relief  of the financial system. The United States is spending some  $400 billion for the relief of its S&amp;L industy; the revenue  source for this undertaking is treasury bonds.    [Mizuno] I think the scheme you outlined will not make  headway in turning these pieces of land liquid. The National  Railways' liquidation corporation currently holds long-term  debts worth 2-6 trillion yen; included in such debts are many  pieces of land that cannot be sold even at a discount.    [Saito] They will have to lower prices even further. That's  why I think that the land holdings liquidation corporation in my  scheme will be obliged to hold onto land assets for about 10  years.    [Mizuno] In that event, land assets will not become liquid.    [Saito] But banks have land assets at choice locations. They  ought to sell their branch offices athletic fields and company  houses occupying choice pieces of land, and then have new  buildings built there by contractors. Banks can either rent  parts of such buildings, or they can lease back.    [Mizuno] If you are talking about financing by means of  government bond for a period which is to be expected to last  about 10 years, ultimately the people will end up bearing the  cost.    [Saito] That cannot be helped. Unless such a scheme is  implemented, financial institutions cannot be normalized.    As a price, the beneficiaries of the scheme will be strictly  held to a variety of terms. For instance, the financing may be  through a 10-year government bond, the principal and interest of  which may be payable at the end of the term; however, the  interest will be borne by those financial institutions whose bad  assets have been bought off by the liquidation agency. It may  be decided to schedule the final liquidation for 10 years or  five years into the future, and the loss resulting from the  liquidation will have to be made up for by the financial  institutions, the beneficiaries of the scheme, out of their  profits. As an alternative, the Federation of Bankers  Associations of Japan may bear such losses collectively.    [Mizuno] Under this scheme, will the financial institutions  be the ones to invest in it?    [Saito] Correct.    [Mizuno] It won't work unless provisions are made to allow  general public to invest in it.    [Saito] In Japan, there is no such market in place yet.  Perhaps one may come into being, say, three years hence. Until  then, holding on for a long term is the only answer. We are  talking about a long-term holding agency.    [Mizuno] That will not lead to a solution of the problem. At  present, land cannot be sold even at 50 percent of the purchase  price. Some pieces of land cannot be sold at 40 percent, at 30  percent, or even at 20 percent of the prices paid. But, just  possibly, they may be sold if offered at 10 percent of the  purchase price.    [Saito] You are painting a crash!    [Mizuno] That's what everyone in Japan -- the industrial  sector and fiancial circles alike -- is scared of.  <H5>  "Amakudari" Hampering Bank Reforms </H5>   [Saito] Mr. Mizuno, your views amount to a kind of  "stabilization crisis" theory. It is an argument that  capitalism revives only at the point of a crash.    It is one approach, but if that approach is taken now, the  Japanese economy will fall apart. Right now, the economy has no  stamina due to a long-term recession. The government, too, is  just dawdling, and there is not a chance that the next  administration will prove to be much stronger. A ship without a  helmsman will sink in a bad storm. This is why I think it is  dangerous to try your approach at this time.    Also I see problems with the idea being floated by some  economists of using public funds to make preemptive acquisition  of land for later public use. My question is, what are they  going to do with pieces of land that are completely useless?  Rather than doing such foolish things, the best thing to do is  simply and unequivocally putting them away for a long haul.    [Mizuno] But among the banks' land holdings there are some  that are of considerable utility value.    [Saito] My advice is, sell them!    [Mizuno] But even for them prices will have to be lowered.    [Saito] Lower prices will attract buyers. I should think  that, once write-offs are liberalized, banks will gradually  attempt to sell their land holdings. It is to such banks that,  I say, a helping hand should be extended, enabling them to gain  sufficient funds by means of preferred stocks. I think Sumitomo  Bank, for example, will move promptly to do just that.    [Mizuno] The shape of things as you have outlined will  eventually lead to a definitive idea, I believe. If I am to  find a point of some agreement between us, it is that all the  ideas surfaced in our discussion up to this point should be  molded into something that can work organically....    [Saito] The first step toward that end as a matter of policy  is to have some banks implement these ideas. Jonan Credit  Association, for example, is doing very well in this regard even  now. Take the matter of information disclosure for starters:  Acting on their own and using the procedure which they call  "Jonan formula," they are disclosing everything. Further, they  are even marketing a high-interest deposit product that can  compete against the postal savings. Given that even such a  small financial institution is doing these things, I only hope  bigger banks will follow suit.    There is also another problem in the current situation, and  that is the practice by the MOF and the BOJ of placing their  officials in financial institutions.    [Mizuno] In the United States, the administrative  authorities  make the managers put their signatures on restructuring plans  for their financial institutions. It happened to Bank of  America and to Bank of Boston. After that, if the restructuring  plans are not brought to fruition, the authorities fire the  managers responsible. Never do the authorities resort to the  practice of "amakudari" ["descending from heaven"; placing  former government officials in positions of responsibility at  private companies] in order to keep the pipelines open between  them and the financial institutions.    [Saito] Even under the Japanese Banking Law, the minister of  finance can order suspension of a bank's operation or revocation  of its license. But, because MOF officials have shamelessly  descended on some of the banks where they are holding the  positions of director or president, the minister cannot very  well draw his sword against these banks. The situation facing  the minister is tantamount to the banks having taken former MOF  officials as hostages.    [Mizuno] I wish they would stop it.    [Saito] Another thing: The deposit insurance system is being  abused. Recently funds in that system were used to make a loan  to the troubled Toyo Credit Association and to make a low  interest loan to Iyo Bank. But of course the deposit insurance  is intended to protect deposits. If low-interest loans must be  made to some of these banks, a separate arrangement will have to  be devised. This distinction is being fudged.</p>

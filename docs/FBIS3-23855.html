As a rule, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA does not intervene in  the disputes and conflicts involving colleagues within the  editorial offices. But there are exceptions. We decided to  publish the interview with Valentin Logunov, former editor in  chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA (he calls himself the "organizer of  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" and "one of Boris Yeltsin's associates") for  several reasons. First, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is a budget-financed  organization and this means that it is paid for by the  taxpayers, and if only for that reason its destiny is more than  the private affair of the editorial staff alone. In the second  place, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was drawn in to the extremely fierce  conflict between the two branches of Russian power and did not  emerge from it without losses. In the third place, in the  corridors of the State Duma there are discussions of the need to  return the parliamentary ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to the legislators.    Valentin Logunov is a former USSR people's deputy and a  member of the coordinating council of the Interregional Deputy  Group [IDG] of the Union Congress. At the end of September 1993  he was discharged by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  from the position of editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    [Koltsov] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was shut down twice in three  years. The first time by a decree of the State Committee for the  State of Emergency and the second time--on the basis of  Yeltsin's edict. Why?    [Logunov] You see, from the autumn of 1991 through September  1993 ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA made a marked shift in the sense of  supporting political leaders. And from the standpoint of past  authorities--the State Committee for the State of Emergency--and  present ones--President Yeltsin--it turned out to be a  politically dangerous publication for both.    [Koltsov] You said that the newspaper had made a marked  shift. Does this mean that the editor in chief also recanted his  initial political views?    [Logunov] It is sufficient to leaf through the files of  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to be convinced that this is not true. The  newspaper and I, its editor in chief, never betrayed those  ideals of the IDG. Remember which ideas came from the IDG: power  to the soviets, separation of powers, parliamentarianism, a  multiparty system, freedom of the press and speech...and who  cast off these white robes when they came to power? Was it not  Popov and Yeltsin, the former cochairmen of the IDG? Was it not  Burbulis and Poltoranin, former members of the coordinating  council of the IDG? Time and the actions of these people showed  that the main thing for them was power for its own sake.    Even now I think that the Supreme Soviet, with all of its  shortcomings, was a most influential and responsible political  force, one capable of opposing the antinational policy of the  Yeltsin team. And this political, I repeat, political force was  suppressed by arms, by the army. The Constitution was trampled  upon, dozens of federal laws were grossly violated, and citizens  were killed. After what happened I cursed the days when I  supported and aided Yeltsin. So others have committed the  betrayal.    [Koltsov] You fiercely condemn the Yeltsin team but what is  your attitude toward politics and politicians close to  Khasbulatov?    [Logunov] You apparently want to know mainly my attitude  toward Khasbulatov. In my view he is one of the politicians of  the new wave, after 1990. Apparently his fairly good education,  his analytical mind, and his exceptional ability to work have  had their effect. I am convinced that he could have done a great  deal of good for Russia if the Supreme Soviet had not been  forced into a confrontation. I have already had occasion to  speak about this but I repeat: The irreconcilability and  hostility between the president and the Supreme Soviet was  fanned artificially and those I have already mentioned in our  conversation were especially successful at this. They were  constantly getting the president riled up and agitated. They  deliberately drove the parliament into a right-wing,  "conservative" corner.    Remember how they badgered Khasbulatov. Yeltsin's team, the  press, and television used the same devices and methods that  were used against Yeltsin himself at one time. All this was  loathsome and I am surprised that he could endure such a thing.  I chanced to find him in a depressed condition after a regular  attack. What can you say to a person when buckets of mud have  been slung at him? I said: "Ruslan Imranovich, hang on another  year. In a year Russia will understand who is who." He laughed:  "A year?! What are you talking about!" Approximately a year  later they were shooting at parliament.    Of course Khasbulatov had many shortcomings. It seems to me  that he had a poor sense of people's psychology. He did not  listen enough to others' opinions. He was trusting and  untrusting at the same time, depending on his subjective idea of  a person. Sometimes he admired himself and was restrained in his  assessments of his opponents, which caused him a great deal of  harm. But I am convinced that Russia will need Khasbulatov as a  politician. True, I am not sure that he will want to work at  this after all they have done to him.    [Koltsov] Do you think that the suspension of the  publication  of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA during September and October and your  dismissal from your positions--was all this not done to get back  at you personally?    [Logunov] Well that was probably not the only thing and not  the biggest thing that provoked them to take such measures. You  see, by that time ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA really had become an  influential publication both in Russia and abroad. The newspaper  adequately reflected the Supreme Soviet's position and we  discussed the political situation in the regions in detail and  objectively. And, well, could the authorities who decided to  physically destroy the Russian parliament fail to turn their  gaze to the newspaper of the Supreme Soviet? Look: On 21  September 1993 the famous Edict No. 1400 came out and on 23  September Chernomyrdin signed the decree on ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA,  and on 24 September I was dismissed from my position. What speed!    [Koltsov] They say that they had to force you to leave your  office.    [Logunov] The "assumption of power" of the new editor,  Natalya Polezhayeva, took place in the presence of three or four  armed men. Later I was told that these people were from Mikhail  Poltoranin's guard. I do not know, perhaps things would have  reached the point of the use of force but I left the office of  my own accord. That happened on 5 October, after the White House  was fired upon.    [Koltsov] You probably do not regard with favor the current  editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    [Logunov] This person was promoted by Poltoranin. She told  me  in our first conversation that she could not refuse Mikhail  Poltoranin because she owed him a great deal. It is known that  Poltoranin went through dozens of applications but they all  refused, apparently thinking it unethical to break into a house  that was built by others. It seemed to me that Natalya  Polezhayeva also was experiencing shame; her entire face was  covered with red spots. I even sympathized with her at that time  and said that it was not very gentlemanly of Poltoranin to heap  such moral responsibility upon a woman's shoulders. But later  she obviously overcame her sense of embarrassment and  awkwardness.    [Koltsov] How do you feel about the talk of turning  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA over to the State Duma?    [Logunov] I am convinced that ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers do  not want this. The circulation of newspapers depends to a  certain degree on their political biases. The reader of one  newspaper or another is the person who sees in the newspaper he  selects a corroboration of his own views. We tried to be an  objective newspaper, to present various viewpoints, but at the  same time we resolutely defended parliamentarianism, the unity  of Russia, the priorities of domestic entrepreneurship, and the  spirituality of the nation. It is precisely with these  qualities, in my view, that we attract readers. And suddenly,  all at once, the reader starts getting a different newspaper.  This is like it would be if you paid for one thing in a store  and they slipped you something else. Of course the government  cannot but understand how unceremoniously it has dealt with the  readers but apparently it wants very badly to get its hands on  this tidbit.    The second point is related to the interests and rights of  the journalists of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. About 40 journalists have  left it in three months--for political reasons. They could not  and did not want to change their political convictions. So I  wish to ask the "fathers of Russian democracy": Is this your  democracy when a journalist does not have a chance to perform  his professional duty, to write in his newspaper what he thinks  is true, of that which he is sincerely convinced?    And, finally, the third point: To whom should the newspaper  belong? I am convinced that it should be either the State Duma  or the federal assembly as a whole. The president and government  have adequate mass media where they can present their viewpoint.  The legislator should have the same opportunity. Possibly the  times will come when the mass media really do become  independent, but to talk of this today is a deliberate  deception. We found out about the "independence" of Bragin  television and the pro-presidential newspapers, and we know  quite well who supports them and how.    Also the utmost in hypocrisy are discussions to the effect  that the authorities should not have their own newspapers. When  waging these discussions that same Poltoranin had in mind only  one authority, the one that did not suit him: the legislative.  Now he and people who think as he does have ended up in the Duma  and you can be sure that they will gain control of the mass  media with the same persistence. The formula is simple: Where  Poltoranin is, there too is the power. And it is both funny and  sad at the same time.    I think that returning ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to the legislature  is one of the first tasks that should be resolved by the State  Duma. Then the Duma would be able to communicate with the voters  in plain language. But we must not allow this cause to be joined  by people who have compromised themselves with destructive  qualities, who have manipulated the mass media all these years.</p>

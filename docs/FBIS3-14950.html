			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alla Yaroshinskaya, member of the Presidential </F> Council: "Foros in the Kremlin?"]    [Text] A state of shock is, I am sure, what millions must  have found themselves in when they heard that it was only on the  morning of Saturday 26 February that presidential aide Georgiy  Satarov delivered a letter from President Yeltsin to Speaker  Ivan Rybkin requesting revision of the chamber's amnesty decree.    Expecting precisely such a natural reaction from the  president and his closest aides immediately after the adoption  of the decree, and not receiving it in the two days that  followed, many people decided that very high-level and subtle  politics were involved here. Former USSR President Mikhail  Gorbachev voiced his conjecture directly on television. It  really seemed to many people that the Kremlin simply had to  react, and immediately, to the Duma's amnesty decree, that it  did not have the right in the face of the whole country and the  world to do otherwise. But if it was not reacting or  protesting, that meant that something which we mere mortals were  not privy to was afoot here, but we mere mortals could  nevertheless be sure that we were being looked after and that  everything was all right.    Now it emerges that, while the presidential aide was  conveying the president's letter to the speaker, the general  prosecutor was giving up the prosecutor's "throne of office" and  his deputy was deciding the country's fate.    In other words, there was simply no dark secret about, for  example, Boris Yeltsin's having agreed with Ivan Rybkin and  Viktor Chernomyrdin on some political concessions from them in  exchange for the president's granting of freedom to the heroes  of the civil carnage. It did not and does not exist. What,  then, in that case was there?    The amnesty decree was passed by the Duma on Wednesday 23  February, just before the president's annual address to the  Federal Assembly deputies. On the morning of 24 February I --  as a member of the Presidential Council -- went to the session.  But how surprised I was, then, when the security guards at the  entrance, after carefully examining my pass as a member of the  Presidential Council, refused to let me into the hall....    That morning I was unable to see anyone -- the president,  his  aides, the head of administration. I heard the president's  speech on television at the same time as I saw "on the box" the  very people whom I had very much needed to communicate with  personally. Hearing no direct references in the president's  speech to the amnesty, I thought that there were undoubtedly  decisions of some sort in being of which we were unaware and  that consequently things were as they should be. It was simply  impossible to imagine it otherwise -- that no one was seriously  thinking about this. But I wanted to know for sure whether  things were as they should be or not, particularly as  immediately after the adoption of the decree Aleksandr  Maksimovich Yakovlev, a very experienced lawyer and, what is  more, the president's representative in the Duma, stated in a  television interview that the Duma's decision fell within its  remit. While Aleksey Kazannik also stated immediately after the  president's speech that he would carry out the Duma's decision  as soon as he was in receipt of documents which were not at odds  with the law.    After the president's speech I began trying to contact  Administration Chief Sergey Filatov by phone with the intention  of fixing up a meeting. He has two offices: One in the  Kremlin, close to the president's, and another on Staraya  Ploshchad, closer to the apparatus. At Staraya Ploshchad they  said that he was busy. Somewhat later I was told that  unfortunately he had already left for the Kremlin. At the  Kremlin, however, they said: "He will not be here till Monday."  This strengthened me even further in my conviction that  everything was all right, that everything was consequently as it  should be; after all, the head of administration could not go  away for three days at a time when the Duma amnesty decree would  have to be carried out. No, that could not happen in a normal  country!    The Duma had, after all, by this time already made several  attempts to implement the amnesty decree -- and certainly in a  way designed to empty the cells in Lefortovo. (One  scandal-renowned politician wryly joked while discussing this  topic with me over the telephone:    "They (meaning Yeltsin's team) have emptied Lefortovo for  themselves." Anyone interested in politics presumed quite  justifiably that the administration's numerous experts and  analysts were engaged day and night in studying various courses  of action or -- even better -- potential outflanking maneuvers.    On 24 February I was telephoned by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editor  Natalya Polezhayeva, who was almost in hysterics: State Duma  deputies had been contacting her on the ordinary phone lines and  the special government ones asking why the newspaper had not  published the amnesty decree? "I replied," Polezhayeva said,  "that I did not have the complete package of documents yet.  Someone had reported to Rybkin that the decree would not be  carried in the newspaper the next day, the 25th. Rybkin faxed  me a letter and demanded a written explanation for the Duma. I  faxed to him my explanatory letter to the Duma. But I myself  telephoned Kostikov. He heard me out and said: `What is there  to do, then? It has to be published.' So I carried the whole  `package' of documents in the issue. It was announced on the  "Novosti" program on the evening of 26 February that ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA was publishing the amnesty decree the next day. (People  will know that the decree comes into effect from the moment of  its publication. In other words, the publication gave the spur  to its further implementation -- A.Ya.). Immediately after the  "Novosti" news program, at 2200, I was telephoned at home by  Satarov who asked why the decree was being published. I  explained this to him in plain terms. He became very  down-hearted and said that he and Baburin would now `concoct  something,' draft some kind of letter from the president to  Rybkin. After that call I realized that there was no secret  concerning the amnesty, that they had simply not thought about  anything over there...." I consoled the editor by joking that  she would certaintly be given credit by the Lefortovo prisoners  when they were released.    On the 26th, right up to the release of the whole gang, I  dialed all the important Kremlin numbers. Only secretaries  answered. The secretary of first presidential aide Viktor  Ilyushin said: "He is working elsewhere and won't be here  today."    I told journalists who rang me that the inner circle -- and  they are literally just a few in number -- could actually be  working somewhere at a dacha, as is usual with our country's  political establishment. But I had no other, "dacha" telephone  numbers available to me. I still did not believe that  everything could be simply so primitive -- that no one was  actually making any calculations, undertaking anything, or  apparently intended doing so. AND IF YOU, PRESIDENTIAL AIDE  GEORGIY SATAROV, HAD NOT BY CHANCE HEARD ON THE OSTANKINO  CHANNEL THAT THE DUMA AMNESTY DECREE WOULD BE PUBLISHED IN  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, THERE WOULD SIMPLY NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN THE  BELATED LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO IVAN RYBKIN ON THE MORNING  OF 26 FEBRUARY!    The president's letter, which was written after the  "Novosti"  program, on the night of 25-26 February and which was designed  to show everyone the concern felt by the authorities at this  senseless act, explains, at least to me, a very important thing  which is just as dangerous as the amnesty act adopted by the  deputies, namely that the supreme authorities were -- we will  learn some time whether by accident or design -- in a complete  information vacuum. Just as during those memorable days in  October, everyone had, as it were, disappeared and was getting  on with work and other concerns at "different venues." Only  this time the role of Gaydar in providing the danger signals,  danger signals above all for the authorities, was taken on by  television announcers. But, alas, this time when they heard  about the act amnestying those whom they had opposed in October  1993 Russians STAYED AT HOME. Only the Red opposition was  attending rallies. THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE RALLY PROTESTING  AGAINST THE DUMA DECISION OR SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER.    Certain nonimportunate questions occur to me in this regard  which I would like to ask those whom I was unable to reach by  telephone in the Kremlin for a whole week.    First, I would very much like to know the name of the bright  guy who proposed to Yeltsin and persuaded him that it was  extremely necessary for the president to head off Volfovich's  [Zhirinovskiy] amnesty idea and himself sumbit such a  legislative initiative to the Duma. Who is this benefactor of  ours? Did the whole legion of experts, analysts, and political  scientists in the Kremlin and on Staraya Ploshchad really not  realize that the Duma would certainly exploit the proposal to  add their own paragraph -- about a political amnesty? But if  that was so and the proponent of the idea was very anxious about  the 20,000 people "inside," why did he not consider that option  and warn the president? Let us suppose that he did consider it  and issued a warning, but the president decided to initiate the  amnesty just the same. Why, then, did the president's men (and  new president's men now) not consider and propose in good time a  dozen options to meet this expected event? After all, the Duma  had persistently approached this point during several divisions  but had lacked the votes. Even Volfovich and his team could not  produce a result. (None other than Sergey Shakhray, deputy and  minister who was appointed a member of the Security Council by  the president himself two weeks ago, helped here, as we know.  Greatly concerned about reconciliation and harmony in society,  he came to everyone's aid at the crucial moment with his Party  of Russian Unity and Accord, stating during a TV interview  immediately after the president's speech that the political  forces which voted for the amnesty must assume responsibility  for the future exemplary behavior of those who had stepped out  of line, and modestly keeping silent about his own role in this  story).    Not only were the president's moves not planned even one  step ahead, but the state mass media proved unprepared for such  a scenario; TASS political observer Tamara Zamyatina described  in detail on Sunday's "Itogi" program how they were simply  unable to get anything intelligible out of anyone behind the  Kremlin wall. Only nonstate television in the "Itogi" program  gave a complete picture of the mood in the Kremlin and at  Lefortovo both at the moment of release and afterward. Only  after the event did state television shamefacedly show scraps of  documentary footage of October 1993, complete with the calls to  seize the Kremlin, City Hall, and Ostankino.    The president has a very large number of people around him.  They can no longer fit into the Kremlin. But for the umpteenth  time he has found himself hostage to them alone, with his fate  balanced on a knife edge.    But the juggernaut rolls on. A month ago we met with the  president and spoke about the poverty-stricken state of the  press in our state. During our 30-minute conversation he  summoned aides and apparatus staff by telephone five times, even  giving them instructions on these questions. Subsequently I  wrote official notes to him and his aides several times with  proposals regarding what needs to be done to avoid further  confrontation with journalists. Alas, everything keeps flowing  and nothing changes.    But while General Barannikov was getting his things ready to  leave, a colleague of his, also a KGB general, who had looked  after Barannikov's public relations, was getting ready to assume  the sensitive leadership of the press in the capacity of first  deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Press. That is  something, colleagues! It is a long time since we have been run  from there. But the time has come, and the documents have  already been submitted to the government for confirmation .    These are the questions which I would like answered both as  a  member of the Presidential Council and as an ordinary citizen  who is not indifferent to either the fate of the country or,  naturally, the fate of my own children.</p>

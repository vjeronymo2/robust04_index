			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : CHACONAS, CABLE'S KING OF TACK, BRINGS 'MR. PETE' TO THE MASSES  </P> <P> Peter Chaconas started his television career on a dare from friends.  </P> <P> Paying $35 per half-hour show, Chaconas signed up for the minimum nine-show run  on Century Cable's public access channel in 1987, and launched "Take a Break  With Mr. Pete." The Mr. Pete persona has gained wider exposure ever since, with  appearances by Roseanne Barr and Steve Allen highlighting the cable program.  Mr. Pete covered the Emmy awards show for a San Francisco TV station and the  Zsa Zsa Gabor trial for Pat Sajak's defunct late-night talk show.  </P> <P> Chaconas' first broadcast television program, "The Late Mr. Pete Show," airs  Sunday nights at 11:30 on KTLA-TV Channel 5. The show, which runs for three  more weeks, is a testing ground for Chaconas' goal of national syndication. The  first attempt to sell it will happen early next year at the National Assn. of  Television Program Executives' syndication marketplace in New Orleans. For  Chaconas, the operative word in his public access career has been tacky.  </P> <P> "The old shows are really incredibly tacky, which public access television is,"  he said. "It's just total tack. I just proclaimed myself the king of public  access television, the king of all this tack."  </P> <P> The KTLA shows, although slicker and free of the mistakes that made for "half  the fun" of the public access shows, are consciously offbeat. The set is a  garish mix of orange and checkerboard black-and-white, the house band plays  zydeco music, and Mr. Pete wears a plaid dinner jacket, sunglasses and a bolo  tie with his mustachioed face on it.  </P> <P> Keeping to his pledge of being nothing more than a regular guy on television,  he announces his address on the air and plugs the Authentic Cafe, where he  still works as a waiter.  </P> <P> "I get recognized all over town these days, and people tell me they feel I'm  going to be famous," he says. "I get that all the time; it's a weird thing to  have strangers say that. And it's a weird thing to be able to say about  yourself." PHIL WEST  </P></p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese selling pushes copper to 5 1/2 -year lows COPPER PRICES plunged on the London Metal Exchange yesterday to the lowest level for 5 1/2 years in US dollar terms as the Chinese liquidated more of their holdings. Copper for delivery in three months dropped to Dollars 1,830 a tonne at one point, Dollars 76 down from Monday's close, before an afternoon rally on the New York Commodity Exchange helped it recover to close in London at Dollars 1,870. Traders suggested copper might fall by another Dollars 200 a tonne in the short term. Chart-followers also said that no substantial technical support for the price could be expected above 75 cents to 80 cents a lb, (Dollars 1,650 to Dollars 1,750 a tonne). However, these prices were unlikely to spark serious output cuts, analysts said, particularly as the US producers, usually the first to react to low prices, had undertaken substantial hedging operations. Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, pointed out that Phelps Dodge, biggest US copper producer, had 'put' options on 475m lb - or 60 per cent of its outstanding production for this year - at 95 cents a lb; Cyprus Minerals had options on 620m lb (90 per cent of its 1993 output) at 94 cents; and Magma Copper had options on 511m lb at 95 cents - all this year's production. Analysts pointed out that copper was much later than other metals in being caught in the cold wind of world recession. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, points out in his latest Metals Report that, stimulated by high prices, western world copper output reached a record 8.92m tonnes last year and 'looks set to at least match that level in 1993'.  -----------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS       (As at Monday's close)  ----------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium  +10,500 to 1,767,325 Copper      +3,100 to   372,700 Lead        +1,750 to   249,725 Nickel        +222 to    88,908 Zinc        +4,825 to   614,175 Tin           +160 to    19,810  -----------------------------------</p>

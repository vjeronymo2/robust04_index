			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Russian reform secures Dollars 1.5bn loan from IMF THE International Monetary Fund yesterday approved a new Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan to Russia after extracting further market reforms from the Russian authorities. The money was approved by the IMF board yesterday evening after Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director, complained earlier this month that the government and central bank were not doing enough to implement a statement of intent promising further reform. Since then Moscow has produced a series of measures to promote reform which IMF loans, such as this first half of a so-called systemic transformation facility, are intended to support. An IMF statement said the second half of the facility, which sets weaker conditions than the Fund's traditional standby agreements, would be made available to Russia provided progress continued to be made in implementing anti-inflationary economic policies. Russia has aimed to conclude a standby agreement, releasing a further Dollars 3bn, by October 1. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical finance minister who sees outside pressure as a tool to help him overcome domestic resistance to painful reforms, yesterday presented to parliament a revised budget adjusted to inflation, and introducing new taxes to increase revenues. The revised budget proposes a budget deficit of 10.4 per cent of gross domestic product as opposed to 12.2 per cent in the initial budget. The new taxes include a 7 per cent levy on enterprise revenues to raise subsidy money for coal and agriculture, an increase in oil excises from 18 to 30 per cent, and unspecified excise on gas. On Tuesday the central bank increased the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks from 120 to 140 per cent. This brings it, as one western official put it, within striking distance of achieving a promise that by mid-July this rate will not be more than 7 percentage points lower than an ill-defined market rate. When the statement of intent was signed, the latter was just 150 per cent, despite annual inflation of more than 1,000 per cent. Mr Fyodorov has apparently stuck to limits he set for credit expansion in the second quarter of this year. From today he has liberalised coal prices, as part of promises to the Fund to remove existing price controls by the end of this year. Although parliament is expected today to give the government permission to proceed with spending in the third quarter, it is expected to refuse to approve the overall budget. Having rejected the earlier budget, it is now demanding details on how the government plans to spend money to support the country's ailing enterprises. But the government has so far failed to produce a long-promised industrial policy, partly because of internal divisions on what this should consist of.</p>

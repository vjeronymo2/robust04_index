			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Actor Timothy Bottoms, arrested last week on suspicion of threatening a  motorist with a gun while driving in Ventura, says he did not wave the gun as  accused, but merely had it on the passenger seat. The gun's shaft was unloaded,  but bullets were in a console nearby, which according to a new law is  tantamount to the gun being loaded. "I am guilty of definitely having the  bullets within reach of the weapon," he said in a telephone interview. "And  there was a weapon in my car. Those are the facts . . . but . . . I did not  touch the pistol. I didn't do anything wrong except not be aware of the new  law." Bottoms, 37, allegedly brandished a .22-caliber pistol after he and the  driver of a pickup became involved in an altercation due to "discourteous or  possibly unsafe driving," a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. The actor  was arrested about 15 minutes later heading north on the freeway toward Santa  Barbara after the other driver, Frank Harwood, 38, called police from his car  phone. Bottoms, released on $5,000 bail, is being investigated for brandishing  a firearm on a roadway, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor.  ALEENE MacMINN and CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

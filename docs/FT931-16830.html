			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Bosnia protagonists seek to dodge the blame BOSNIAN Moslems and Serbs were yesterday jockeying for positions in the negotiations on a solution of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina which would enable them to blame each other for any breakdown. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem president, who has come under heavy pressure from Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the two international mediators chairing the conference, to accept a plan for the territorial division of the country into 10 largely autonomous provinces, yesterday succeeded in shifting the emphasis on proposals which the Bosnian Serbs find difficult to accept. The spotlight suddenly switched from the proposed new provincial boundaries, some of which the Moslems want to modify, to constitutional and military proposals which Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, rejected, at least in the first instance. Helped by the pressure which the co-chairmen were suddenly putting on Mr Karadzic, who only yesterday appeared to be cast in a much more conciliatory role than the Bosnian Moslems, Mr Izetbegovic yesterday clearly laid down his minimum two conditions for an agreement. The conference would fail if the Bosnian Serbs did not accept the Vance-Owen constitutional proposals under which Bosnia-Hercegovina would become an independent sovereign state, based on democratic principles and a division of the country into self-governing provinces. His government would also refuse to sign any agreement which did not specifically include the placing of all heavy weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovina, such as tanks, artillery and missiles, under effective United Nations control. Both demands were supported by the Bosnian Croats, Mr Izetbegovic claimed. Mr Izetbegovic, who hardly referred to the boundary alterations which his delegation had demanded so persistently at the weekend to the co-chairmen's provincial map, made it clear that, in the event of a breakdown in the negotiations, his country was prepared to continue its combat against the Bosnian Serbs. Even in the absence of international military intervention, 'we have a lot of our boys ready to fight for our freedom and the survival of the Bosnia-Hercegovina people,' he said. That does not mean that Mr Izetbegovic has suddenly dropped his demands for territorial adjustments, set out on an alternative map which the Bosnian Moslems have issued. But disputes over the boundaries affect only three of the ten proposed provinces and the Bosnian Serbs and Croats have already said that compromise deals are possible. Whether Mr Karadzic was prepared to compromise on constitutional and military matters remained an open question. The co-chairmen's proposal for the creation of an independent and sovereign Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose constituent provinces would not have the right to forge any international relations of their own, directly contradicts the Bosnian Serbs' demand for the creation of their own separate state. Such 'a state within a state' could eventually link up with the Serbian motherland, they firmly believe. On the military issue, the Bosnian Serbs are clearly loth to withdraw their heavy weapons from their present positions and to place them under international control. All the warring factions are acutely conscious of what they stand to gain or lose in international support if they are held responsible for a failure of the current negotiations. If the Bosnian Moslems succeed in their tactics of pinning the blame on their Serb adversaries, the likelihood of international action to enforce the air exclusion zone over Bosnia will have increased substantially. If, however, the Bosnian Moslems are seen as the main stumbling block to an agreement, as they were during the first two days of the conference, they will stand a much smaller chance of persuading the international community to come to their military aid.</p>

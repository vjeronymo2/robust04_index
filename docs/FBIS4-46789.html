			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Andreyeva: "Are the Centrists Raising </F> a Wave?"]    [Text] Lvov--The Lvov preelection association New  Wave is registered as a permanently active public organization.  There is reason to suppose that this is not just a regional  event.    First of all, the New Wave leaders, and they are People's  Deputies Mykhaylo Kostyv, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskyv, and  the young politician Igor Grynyv, who is well-known from the  parliament of the last convocation, are perhaps not persons of a  regional scale. And it seems that the question concerns a  tendency. If you will permit me a small pun--a wave rises, when  the foam subsides...    I do not know what the diplomaed political scientists will  say, but it seems to me: The phenomenon matured at a logical  time. Only high tones could be heard and two colors could be  viewed in a period when totalitarian walls and bars were being  pulled down and at the time of yet another fermentation of  ideas, intellects, and speeches. It was necessary later at least  to go through a rudimentary restructuring of political forces.  And also to experience a certain disappointment in the existing  organizations and parties. This is what affects factors that in  a positive way influence the possibility of the emergence of  fruitful work of regional or global associations of  reform-minded centrist-democrats. Of course, there is also the  negative factor--red and blue-yellow "Sharikov's" who are ready  "to divide everything" and to jail those over and over whom they  do not hang, are growing like mushrooms on the threshold of the  key posts of a society that is rolling into the abyss. Thus,  everything occurs at the conjunction of a paradox: A  catastrophic economy and a stagnating state structure  persistently require the intervention of those who are capable  of making anything that is real and civilized. And the very same  aforementioned troubles do not let the centrists expand: The  people are not inclined either to mature to a sensible choice,  nor to trust anyone, and, indeed, not much time is allotted...    The Lvov New Wave was born during the recent preelection  campaign and with the purpose of participating in it. Not bound  by party limits and the "long-playing" obligations that  intimidated the intelligentsia from time immemorial, it was able  to assemble not only a fair circle of candidates for parliament,  but also rather good company around the candidates, if it can be  expressed this way. Intellectual, young, and pragmatic. As our  newspaper has already written, the result of the elections,  proceeding from the fact that the association could not use the  halo of past feats and did not tickle the sensitive centers of  the lovers of rallies, can be called not bad. Here is something  else that is interesting: No one was cursed as much, and no one  was fought against as hard by all possible kinds of extremists.  Stepan Khmara, for example, being already elected, dropped all  of his affairs and traveled all around the district of a  candidate from New Wave who was not familiar to him, desperately  agitating against him. The candidate, by the way, was elected.    Just before the local elections, visitors began to come to  New Wave frequently: Many potential candidates wanted to  associate their preelection fate specifically with this  association. There is this feature--among the New Wave nominees  to the city council today, there are members of the URP  [Ukrainian Republican Party], the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists], and the SOU [Ukrainian Officers Union]. Both this  and other facts indicate: In the Galicia region, the "seismic  waves," as the group is sometimes referred to teasingly, have  come into their own under the political sun. And in doing this,  they got rid of the adjective "electoral" before the word  "association." The talk turned to a new social movement. Let us  put it this way, there was nothing unusual in the proclamation  documents and speeches at the first conference. It was rather  transparently stated that the New Wave considers itself one of  the components of a future democratic center (read--party). But,  not being a party, at this stage it calls on the unity and  cooperation of all who share the key postulates: the formation  of a Ukrainian national state, orientation of Ukraine on  integration in Europe, and the formation of a civil society and  a rule-of-law state. It should be added that on economic  questions the New Wave supports a market economy, orienting  itself on Viktor Pynzenyk's program.    What are we dealing with this time? With yet another  fragmentation of the national-democratic movement, or actually,  with absorption, and does this means a uniting of healthy  forces? The "eggheads" traditionally lost to the Bolsheviks from  the aspect of the mass character and organization of basic  cells. Today, branches of the Lvov New Wave are appearing in the  rayon centers; moreover, this process is really coming from  below and not from above. Will it come to a halt after the local  elections, or will it continue? Incidentally, it is exactly the  local elections that can become a trampoline, but they can, just  the opposite, bury the new movement. The fact is that the  "'Piemonte' of the national renewal" (probably no one in all  Galicia can pronounce these words any longer today without  irony) cannot brag about economic successes. In the event that  the New Wave and its allies receive a sufficient number of seats  to the local organs of authority, Viktor Pynzenyk, and other  prominent economists, promise to implement a regional program of  reforms here with the involvement of the best forces. If the  seats are present and there are no positive accomplishments,  even because of global or national reasons, the disappointment  will be fierce. A final resolution of the "East-West" problem  was not within the capability of either Rukh [Ukrainian People's  Movement for Perestroyka], or URP. The new centrist  organizations seem to have the grounds for becoming a  consolidating factor: Standing on indisputable positions of  independence and statehood, they do not regard wide trousers, or  even language, of paramount importance. This plus has an  opposite side--it is for this reason that this kind of a  movement will become the object of a tough struggle on the part  of extremists in both the West and in the East. But how will the  fraternal organizations behave? Will Rukh and URP like the fact  that, figuratively speaking, a new little horse is entering the  field, nipping at the general electorate?    As always, there are more questions than answers at the  moment of birth. It is unlikely that astrologists will help.  Mykhaylo Kostyv, of course, was joking: New Wave received its  registration certificate on St. George's day. And George, as is  well-known, is a dragon-slayer. Shall we end on this optimistic  note?</p>

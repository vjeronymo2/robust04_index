			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Pension funds Regardless of the compensation scheme eventually recommended by the Goode committee, a minimum solvency requirement for pension funds is sure to follow. The limited compensation scheme proposed by the National Association of Pension Funds yesterday does not actually require underpinning by a solvency standard. But a safety net which also covered poorly-managed pension funds most certainly would. The NAPF is not alone in conceding that a solvency standard is overdue. The danger is this could be a double-edged sword. Solvency tests which assume the pension fund continues to operate are hardly adequate. Measures based on the fund's ability to cover benefits in the event of winding up are closer to the mark. For example, Professor Goode might demand - as actuaries traditionally have - that pension funds can cover minimum benefits if there is a winding up by buying annuities. But should the cost of annuities rise - as it has since 1990 because of the parlous state of the insurance industry - pension fund managers would have to change investment policy. That might mean buying bonds to safeguard capital at the expense of long-term performance. Alternative tests might be a better bet, such as one which demands assets are available to protect minimum benefits if members switch to personal pensions in the event of winding up. But any guarantee of solvency will carry a price. The challenge is to find a measure which safeguards minimum standards without putting potential benefits at risk.</p>

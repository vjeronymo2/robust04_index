			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / SPD says constitution will have to be changed: Stormy debate in Germany over Maastricht IMPORTANT changes must be made in the German constitution before the Maastricht treaty on European union can be ratified by the two houses of the German parliament. That is the formal position of both the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), and of a majority of the German Lander (states) ruled by SPD governments, which yesterday proposed a series of changes to be made. Their move throws a new spanner into the works of the increasingly confused and stormy German debate over the European Community although it is a move which is ostensibly dedicated to ever greater European integration. The constitutional changes now demanded include a precise definition of future European union, or a United States of Europe, which would be subject to strong democratic control  - such as more powers for the European Parliament  - federalism, the rule of law, and the German concept of a 'social state.' The SPD says any future transfer of sovereignty to the EC must be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, and the Bundesrat, the upper house representing the states. The party and SPD states also insist that both houses of parliament be given the right to 'evaluate and approve' the final move of European monetary union from stage two to stage three, the creation of a single currency and central bank. That would appear to amount to almost the same as the 'opt out' clause negotiated by the British government in the Maastricht treaty. They also want it written into the constitution that both houses of parliament must be fully involved in the drafting of future government policy towards the EC, wherever that might affect the federal powers of the German states. An early move in that direction is likely to be an insistence that they help formulate the government position on the Delors-2 plan for additional EC finances later this year. The move was condemned yesterday by Mrs Renate Hellwig, the Christian Democrat (CDU) chairman of the EC committee of the Bundestag, as 'absolute madness'. 'We are making ourselves incapable of legal functioning,' she said. 'And we are giving a terrible example to the rest of the Community.' The SPD demands  - although specifically described as 'not preconditions'  - were presented yesterday by Mrs Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul, EC spokesman for the SPD in the Bundestag, as a formal and joint decision of the SPD national executive, the parliamentary group, and the governments of the SPD states. They have been tabled just a week before Chancellor Helmut Kohl has a meeting with the premiers of all 16 German states, in an attempt to agree on an acceptable constitutional underpinning for the ratification of Maastricht. Approval both by the states, and the SPD, is necessary before ratification, because the Maastricht treaty already requires minor constitutional amendments to allow voting rights for all EC citizens in local elections, and to allow the introduction of a European central bank. They therefore have the power to block the whole process. In addition to the demand for greater parliamentary and federal control over future transfers of sovereignty to the EC, the SPD wants to widen the voting right in local elections to include all foreigners resident for an extended period in Germany  - a move certain to be resisted by the CDU and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Mr Gunter Verheugen, the SPD representative on the parliament's constitutional committee, said the proposals 'create a completely new political situation in relation to the ratification of Maastricht. We want to make it impossible that the German constitution will be negated by actions at the European level.' Mrs Wieczoreck-Zeul said that meant an insistence on 'democracy, federalism, the rule of law and the social state'  - existing German constitutional principles which might be over-ruled if other EC member states were prepared to created a 'centralised, bureaucratic Europe.' The whole aim was to ensure the transfer of adequate democratic powers to the European Parliament, and to prevent the dilution of true federalism. The SPD initiative has left Mr Kohl's CDU in some embarrassment, because there are still clear divisions within the party on how far it should also insist on moves to strengthen European political as well as monetary union. Officials now fear that the chances of a ratification bill being approved at the end of next week's talks are extremely slim, making it unlikely that such a bill could be pushed through the cabinet by the end of May, or presented to parliament before the end of June, when the summer recess begins. Thus the entire ratification process could be put off to the autumn, in spite of the stated commitment of all political parties to complete it as swiftly as possible.</p>

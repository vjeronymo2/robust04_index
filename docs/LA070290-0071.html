			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GANG-PREVENTION AGENCY SHOT DOWN BY LACK OF FUNDS  </P> <P> In a year when Orange County's gang violence has escalated to a record level,  one of the county's most respected gang prevention programs has gone out of  business.  </P> <P> Lack of money forced the 15-year-old Turning Point Family Services Inc. to  close its doors last week after the agency had spent 3 1/2 years battling gang  problems in central Orange County.  </P> <P> Turning Point had maintained a number of programs to help families and children  -- among them the Amparo Youth Shelter in Garden Grove for troubled and runaway  children and teen-agers and an alcohol and drug abuse counseling service.  </P> <P> These will survive by being absorbed by other agencies. But Turning Point's  well respected gang counseling service will not.  </P> <P> The program provided low-cost individual and group counseling of gang members  who had been referred by police and probation officials or by residents of  gang-plagued communities.  </P> <P> "They were really the only game in town for us for that type of service," said  Colleene Hodges, supervisor of the county Probation Department's gang violence  suppression unit.  </P> <P> Gus Frias, manager of the county Department of Education's Operation Safe  Schools program, agreed.  </P> <P> "We are very limited in terms of our resources here at the department and any  help that we could get from them was very welcome. What they did in terms of  working with schools will be missed."  </P> <P> The Orange County Youth and Family Services will take over Amparo Youth Shelter  and will re-create Turning Point's alcohol and drug abuse counseling program in  a new location with a fraction of the staff and funding.  </P> <P> But gang counseling, unique to Turning Point, will cease.  </P> <P> "I've never known another agency I could refer to that did counseling for gang  kids," said counselor Jim Head as he reflected on the program last week in his  bare office.  </P> <P> "It's just really sad, depressing, there's all these emotions that come from  seeing something you've worked on all these years go down the drain," Head  said. "I'm not a pessimist. . . . I'm sure somebody will come up with a  program, but right now it kind of leaves a void."  </P> <P> Michelle Castillo, 19, was one of the program's success stories. Three and a  half years ago, she was in juvenile hall, a gang member and heavy drug user.  </P> <P> Working with Head taught her about positive options and helped her turn her  life around, she said. Last week, Castillo graduated from high school and she  plans to begin college in the fall. She will study psychology with hopes of  becoming a gang counselor herself.  </P> <P> "I think it's stupid," Castillo said of Turning Point's demise. "A lot of  people I knew went to Turning Point and they helped them, too. They need that  place."  </P> <P> Head said that private counseling is too expensive for most youths in gangs.  </P> <P> "You have to have insurance," Head said. "Very few people are wealthy enough to  pay for counseling and we're talking about a population that is at the poverty  level."  </P> <P> Although Head is out of a job along with more than 30 other Turning Point  employees, he said his main concern is the youths.  </P> <P> "We were doing a little bit more to eradicate the gang problem," he said. "You  can't do too much when it comes to this problem because it's pretty monumental.  . . . There's a lot of kids getting killed and I hate it when I pick up the  paper and read about some 16-year-old getting blown away in L.A. or Orange  County or wherever."  </P> <P> Turning Point leaders approached Orange County Youth and Family Services about  the possibility of a merger early this year.  </P> <P> The idea seemed ideal: Turning Point had plenty of programs and not enough  funding. Orange County Youth and Family Services, a nonprofit agency that has  operated "halfway houses" for 15 years, was financially healthy and trying to  expand its programs.  </P> <P> But attorneys advised that a merger would bring Turning Point's liabilities --  its debt and programs that were losing money -- as well as its assets, said  Kevin Meehan, director of Orange County Youth and Family Services. So a  decision was made by both groups in May to dissolve Turning Point and absorb  some of its programs into the other agency.  </P> <P> "It's not a shutdown of (Turning Point)," said Dennis Catron, president of  Turning Point's board of directors. "It's just a change of name." Meanwhile,  Tony Borbon, the widely respected director of Turning Point's gang prevention  program, has signed on with CSP (Community Service Program) where he will work  to create a new gang program.  </P></p>

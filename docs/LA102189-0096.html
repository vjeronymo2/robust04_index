			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN BURGLED MOTHER'S HOUSE, JURY FINDS  </P> <P> A 27-year-old Lancaster man with a history of drug use was convicted Friday of  residential burglary for breaking into his mother's house and stealing  valuables while she was on vacation.  </P> <P> John Kuykendall faces a maximum sentence of 16 years in state prison because he  has three prior felony convictions, including a burglary, a robbery and grand  theft, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert B. Foltz Jr.  </P> <P> Foltz said Kuykendall turned to crime to support his drug habit.  </P> <P> During the four-day jury trial in San Fernando Superior Court, Kuykendall's  mother, Joyce Zimmerman, testified that when she returned from a weekend trip  to visit her daughter, she found her house ransacked. Such valuables as two  entertainment centers, a Cabbage Patch doll collection, clocks, radios,  silverware, jewelry and money were gone.  </P> <P> In the house, she found a pair of thongs belonging to her son and an old pair  of his shoes were gone, Foltz said.  </P> <P> Two young boys who live across the street from Zimmerman testified that they  watched Kuykendall take items out of the house and put them in the back of a  truck, Foltz said.  </P> <P> None of the stolen items have been recovered.  </P> <P> Kuykendall, who had been released from state prison only a month before the  burglary, did not present a defense.  </P> <P> Sentencing is scheduled Nov. 15.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ryder gives spin-off terms Ryder System, the Florida-based transportation company, announced terms for the spin-off of its aviation business, creating a new company with assets of around Dollars 1bn and sales in 1992 of Dollars 1.2bn. The completion of the divestment plan, first announced in June, pushed the company's shares company up Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 1/4 yesterday. Shareholders in Ryder will be given one share in the new company, Aviall, for each four Ryder shares they already own in a tax-free distribution beginning on December 14. The move will enable both Aviall and the continuing Ryder business to concentrate on their respective businesses. Aviall, which made net profits last year of Dollars 20m out of the group's total of Dollars 118m, claims to be the world's largest independent aviation repair and parts distribution company.</p>

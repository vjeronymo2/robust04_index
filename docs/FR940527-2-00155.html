This change was reported in a Rule 24 certificate filed on January 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By order dated December 20, 1991 (HCAR No. 25437), NFG was authorized to: (i) Acquire all of the authorized shares of common stock of Resources for $3.5 million in cash; (ii) acquire through Resources, a 50% interest in a partnership (``Partnership''), named Citizens National Gas Company, with Citizens Gas Supply Corporation (``Citizens Gas'') for $1.5 million in cash; (iii) include Resources in the NFG system money pool (``Money Pool'') for a maximum of $10 million; and (iv) make available to the Partnership, through Resources, through December 31, 1991, one or more loans aggregating up to $10 million. It was stated that the $10 million would be used by the Partnership for investment in ``any and all physical assets, and any and all associated contracts and property interest attendant thereto, for use in connection with gathering, transportation, distribution or marketing of natural gas which it would consider taking for itself, and which is consistent with, or is a natural and reasonable extension of, its business'' (``Marketing-Related Investments'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the quarter ended September 30, 1993, Resources and Citizens National Gas Company completed the sale of substantially all of the Partnership assets. Thereafter, the Partnership was wound up and dissolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources now proposes to use its existing authorization to borrow up to $15 million from the Money Pool in order to make investments in Marketing-Related Investments. (Resources presently has the authority, by order dated December 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25964), to borrow, through December 31, 1995, up to $15 million from the Money Pool). It is stated that the majority of these Marketing-Related Investments will be the purchase of gas reserves, gas pipelines and appurtenant property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources also proposed to acquire Leidy Hub's investment in Metscan, Inc. (``Metscan''). Leidy presently owns 7.31% of Metscan's common stock, 9.83% of the Metscan Class A Preferred Stock and 1.07% of the Class B Preferred, or about 5.52% of the actual and potential equity investment in Metscan, and Leidy's total investment in Metscan is $1,261,000. All Leidy's interest in Metscan will be transferred to Resources at book value. It is stated that Metscan developed a low cost and efficient electronic automatic meter reading device (``AMD'') that provides an economical and efficient method of reading residential natural gas utility meters. The AMD is a microprocessor that is affixed to a gas meter and accumulates and stores information regarding natural gas usage by a customer and transmits it by telephone line to a computer. This information is then available for billing purposes. It is stated that the Metscan system provides the following benefits. (i) it improves meter reading efficiency, as accurate readings can be received electronically, (ii) it enhances meter security and theft detection, because actual consumption data is phoned in monthly (or possibly daily) and the AMD has a tamper alarm, and (iii) it enhances consumption monitoring by providing daily consumption data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources also seeks authorization to: (i) Accept assignment from Leidy Hub of an agreement dated October 1, 1993, between Enerop and Perfection Corporation, unaffiliated manufacturing company with its principal place of business in Madison, Ohio (``Perfection Agreement''); and, (ii) undertake the obligations and rights under the Perfection Agreement, including_(a) the obligation to make an investment in the aggregate amount of $610,000, and (b) the right to receive a royalty (``Royalty'') of 3% of the net revenue from the sales of polyethylene ball valves (``Valves'') for polyethylene fuel gas piping systems (``Perfection Valve Development Program''). The Perfection Agreement covers three separate valve research and development programs: (i) the 11/4 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; Program, (ii) the 2 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; Program, and (iii) the 3&hyph;4&hyph;6 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; Program. Enerop invested $125,000 in the 11/4 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; Program and $85,000 in the 2 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; Program. These programs have been rolled up into the Perfection Agreement along with the new 3&hyph;4&hyph;6 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; Program. It is anticipated that the Valves will be marketed and sold throughout the United States with a significant percentage of such sales occurring within National's system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Arts: The Constant Wife - Theatre Somerset Maugham's The Constant Wife had an unfortunate first night in London in 1927. The theatre management messed up the ticket sales, put the rope barrier separating the the pit from the stalls in the wrong place and, as the curtain was about to go up, the audience was quarrelling loudly about who should be sitting where. The house manager was obliged to appeal for calm. That may have unnerved the players, including Fay Compton in the wonderful part of Constance. At the end she thanked the 'civil members' of the audience for their behaviour, only to be greeted by cat-calls. It may also have unnerved the critics. The play was not well received and ran for only 70 performances. Earlier it had fared much better in the US. Constance was Ethel Barrymore, an actress with a tendency to forget her lines. 'Darling,' she told Maugham after the first night, 'I've ruined your play, but don't worry, it'll run for two years.' She wasn't far out. So it is good to have a British revival now. Constance, here played by Fiona Fullerton, remains as sparkling a part as ever, though perhaps less surprising in the 1990s. Happily enough married to a high-earning Harley Street surgeon who has a girl-friend on the side, Constance (constant to what and to whom?) realises that a woman, too, can break bounds provided that she has economic freedom. Thus she goes into interior decorating with a female business friend and makes money on her own. The demonstration of financial independence and the fact that a woman can behave just like a man stuns her husband. Some writers about Maugham say that this was very radical at the time and too much for an English audience to accept. I wonder. Feminist independence, toughness and wit had already surfaced in the plays of Shaw, Granville Barker and Githa Sowerby, let alone Shakespeare. The particular distinction of The Constant Wife lies in its ambiguity. The play suggests that there was a turning point when women could go into business. Constance was not unduly out of sorts with a husband whom she knew to be errant, even when her family thought that she was ignorant. She knew that she was provided for and had a good lawyer in the event of a mishap. She may have gone into business, and into an affair with an old admirer, just to teach her husband a lesson. At the end we are not quite sure whether she will come back to her husband or whether the husband will learn the lesson. The answer to the first question is probably yes; the answer to the second is doubtful. Indeed one of the delights of the piece is that practically every line is full of irony and double meaning. After a slowish start, Ms Fullerton plays Constance with mounting dominance. She catches both the period nature of the play and its modernity. There are other stars. Terence Wilton as the surgeon shows how boorishly insensitive an otherwise accomplished Englishman can be. Nigel Davenport has a marvellous bit part as the injured, not quite pukka husband who makes his money in the City. Sheila Allen plays the mother with the deliberate recognition that in the mid-1920s you could not have quite the authority of Lady Bracknell. It is not a perfect play, but it is immensely worth seeing. Directed by Peter James under the banner of Pericles Productions, it is at Richmond this week before moving on to Barnstaple, Canterbury and other venues. At Richmond there is a novel piece of sponsorship. The Petersham Hotel is sponsoring the entire Richmond autumn season and the theatre has picked up matching funds from the government's Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Wolseley Tasteless jokes about the quality of French plumbing are as misplaced these days as smug sermons on the superiority of British drinking water. In any case, Wolseley's decision yesterday to splash out Pounds 95m for France's leading specialist distributor of plumbing supplies is part of a more ambitious strategy to tackle the European market. One could easily quibble about the timing of the initiative so close to January 1 1993, were it not for the way Wolseley spent the 1980s leapfrogging its competitors to establish itself in the United States. Earnings per share last year were admittedly pegged back below 1987 levels. But then, the housing recession on both sides of the Atlantic has been severe, and Wolseley's balance sheet has come through unscathed. Capturing Brossette, moreover, looks to have been worth the wait. Apart from providing new opportunities to negotiate bulk discounts from common suppliers, plus a platform for expansion east and south, the scope to squeeze extra costs out of even a well-run French family business ought to be considerable. Perhaps in the interests of an entente cordiale, Wolseley's chairman, Mr Jeremy Lancaster, is coy on this point. But while margins are unlikely ever to match what the company has obtained in the UK, the current level of just under 4 per cent should in time be pushed nearer 6. Without the benefit of Brossette's full financial record,the company's assurance that the acquisition will not dilute earnings has to be taken on trust. Wolseley, however, has not been given to extravagant promises in the past. Moreover, even though they have outperformed handsomely through the bad times, the shares still look a better bet than those beleaguered players in the sector which have slashed overheads just to survive. The mere 3 per cent discount needed to get the placing away yesterday demonstrates the size of the fan club.</p>

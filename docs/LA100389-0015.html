			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Grant Tinker, whose winning ways have soured somewhat since he left the  chairmanship of NBC three years ago, took another blow Monday when former  "Entertainment Tonight" producer Jim Bellows sued Tinker's GTG East  Productions, Inc. for $1.8 million in the Southern District federal court of  New York. The breach of contract action accuses the Tinker-Gannett television  operation, best known for its syndicated "USA Today" newsmagazine, of failing  to honor Bellows' contract to develop a new half-hour celebrity-centered  program tentatively titled "Star Tracks." According to Bellows' attorney,  Michael Zweig, a pilot for the new program, cast in the "Entertainment Tonight"  mold, is still being developed by GTG under the new name of "Celebrity" but  without Bellows.

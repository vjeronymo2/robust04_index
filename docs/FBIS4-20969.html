He claimed that this was proven by the arrest, early this  morning, of Manuel Zamudio Gonzalez, a member of the force, in  the settlement of Tizayuca. He was carrying 700 kg of marijuana  on a pickup truck, intending to sell it in the northern part of  the country. The attorney general noted: "We shall be very  watchful to ensure that the maximum penalty is imposed on him."    He made the preceding statement at a press conference, after  a work meeting with Governor Jesus Murillo Karam, at the  Government Palace. There they agreed to undertake joint security  action in the state, doing whatever is necessary to combat crime  permanently.    In this regard, the attorney general announced that a group  of workers from the department headed by him would publish,  within a week, the plan to be implemented in order to achieve  results and provide greater tranquillity to Hidalgo residents.    However, he emphasized that Hidalgo is among the states with  the lowest crime rates in the entire country; adding that, even  in the case of drug smuggling, it has one of the lowest  incidences.

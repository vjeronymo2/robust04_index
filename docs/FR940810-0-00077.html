			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One related issue is whether to require respirator use for employees when changing filters or bags from vacuums. OSHA proposed that they not be required when changing HEPA filters, noting that filter changes occurred infrequently, recorded fiber levels during changes were not excessive, and other requirements triggered by respirator use, such as medical examinations and fit testing procedures, did not appear to confer any significant benefit to employees. One participant, Mr. Clayton, who initially disagreed with OSHA's proposal not to require respirators for filter changes, clarified that the ancillary requirements for a respirator program, ``would scare everybody away from wanting to do it *&blank;*&blank;* and would be a rather heavy burden for most employers'' (Tr. 1931). Mr. Clayton pointed out that exposure potential existed not only during filter changes, but during vacuum bag changes as well. He further pointed out that although HEPA filter changes were infrequent, bags ``could be changed as often as every three to five weeks by a shop'' (Id at 1929). Mr. Clayton described two systems of ensuring that bag changing does not expose employees to asbestos containing dust. Under one system the bag is collected under negative pressure; under the other the bag is made from non-woven material and is ``virtually undestructible.'' OSHA has concluded that so long as filters and vacuum bags are changed using work practices to minimize rupture and spillage, exposure from that activity will be de minimis, and respirator use is not required to protect employees. Accordingly, additional work practices relating to filter changes, when a vacuum is used, are included in the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is allowing another method to be used in shops in which brake work comprises only a minor portion of the workload, and thus where employee exposure is infrequent and minimal. For those shops in which brake work is infrequent, OSHA has determined to allow the use of a wet method of control as a ``preferred'' method. Therefore, in facilities in which no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches, or some combination totaling 5, are repaired each week, the mechanic/technician may control potential asbestos exposure through the use of a pump sprayer (bottle) containing water or amended water to wet down the drum or clutch housing before it is removed and to control fiber release during subsequent activities. The mechanic may use other implements to deliver the water such as a garden hose; however, the resulting waste water generated must be caught and properly disposed of without allowing it to dry on any surfaces. OSHA anticipates that the use of a spray bottle will be adequate to control the dust without generating a large volume of waste water, however any waste water generated must be disposed of properly. OSHA applied a qualitative analysis using its risk management expertise in making the decision that allows less effective controls for facilities that do 5 or fewer brake and 5 or fewer clutch repair jobs per week. Relevant factors were the magnitude of the risk of asbestos caused disease estimated in the 1986 risk assessment at levels of exposure in vehicle repair facilities, the duration of exposure, and the practicality of using controls in the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In describing the usual work practices of mechanics performing brake jobs, Mr. Swartz of Midas Corporation reported that it was occasionally necessary for the mechanic/technician to dislodge a ``frozen'' brake drum; this was usually performed by striking it with a hammer (Ex. 1&hyph;176). When performed within an enclosure under negative pressure, this operation would be unlikely to expose the worker to asbestos fibers; however, when using the other methods it is essential that the exterior of the drum, especially around the seams, be thoroughly wetted to minimize fiber release. OSHA concurs and thus will require that before attempts are made to dislodge a ``frozen'' brake drum, the drum must be thoroughly wetted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments were received which dealt with minor alterations in wording which would render the requirements clearer and more specific and some of these have been incorporated into the language of Appendix F (Appendix L in the shipyard employment standard). Several participants noted that additional activities, such as inspection and disassembly of brakes could also result in exposure and should be included. Mr. Swartz explained that brakes are frequently checked to determine whether they are defective and this involves removal of the drums and results in potential exposure to asbestos-containing dust (Tr. 1843). OSHA agrees that these activities should be covered by the rule and has included them in the language of the final rule. Therefore the following activities will be listed and will require implementation of the provisions of the mandatory appendix F (appendix L in the shipyard employment standard): clutch and brake inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

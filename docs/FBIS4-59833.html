			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq has once again protested to the United Nations  against U.S. aircraft continuing to violate Iraq's airspace for  purposes of provocation and surveillance.    In a memorandum he sent to the UN Secretary General  yesterday, Iraq's permanent UN representative said these  aircraft violated Iraq's airspace and carried out 377 hostile  air sorties from 1-10 May.    Iraq's permanent UN representative requested that the  memorandum be distributed as a Security Council document.</p>

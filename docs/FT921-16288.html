			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / An obsession with security KGB by Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky Sceptre Pounds 10.99, 847 pages INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CENTRE by Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 238 pages CHRISTOPHER Andrew is a Cambridge historian who has made a reputation writing about intelligence operations: Oleg Gordievsky is a former KGB officer who, it would appear, was turned by SIS in 1974, defected to Britain in 1985, and has since furnished material both to the Office and Andrew on his former masters' whys and wherefores. One result of collaboration between Andrew and Gordievsky is KGB, a history of the Soviet Union rather than clandestine operations, which is a solid, reliable piece of work. Instructions From The Centre is a slighter thing altogether, heavily dependent on what Gordievsky chooses to reveal or can recall (the sparse source notes are an indication of this factor), diverting in its details but not particularly valuable as a contribution to knowledge of our times. We are, as it were, offered roast beef followed by fruit salad. The former is a bit tough, but provides substantial nourishment; the latter can be consumed in a few mouthfuls, leaving a vague sense of dissatisfaction. In setting out to describe and analyse the 74 years between the 1917 revolutions and the attempted coup against Gorbachev of last August the authors have clearly in mind the undoubted fact that huge, repressively cruel and all-embracing armies of state security have been a central feature of Russian history since at least the 16th century. Until the 1917 revolutions such armies operated mainly within Russia. Since 1917 they have also attempted to operate on an international scale, reflecting not only the Leninist belief in 'world revolution' but the endemic and well-founded conviction that Russia's European neighbours have threatened Soviet communism, not merely opposed it. The authors describe this specifically Russian fear of encirclement in these words: 'Lenin's Manichean vision of a world divided between bourgeois darkness and Bolshevik light.' KGB is, therefore, enlightening in revealing in great and well-documented detail how the combination of repression at home and espionage abroad fostered and bred a peculiarly vicious brand of suspicion about individual and national motives and actions. This psychotic condition, in Stalin's day, matched his own neurotic obsession about real or supposed enemies within and without. KGB is important, if not wholly original, in showing how this wicked dictator was so dominated by his neurosis that when, in early 1941, it became clear from 'sure sources' that Hitler was about to turn east, he could not bring himself to believe intelligence from Churchill, Stafford Cripps, Richard Sorge - and his own espionage and security subordinates in Moscow. Admittedly, the NKVD and GRU were not particularly effective at acquiring intelligence overseas, because the requirement to do so on a professional basis jarred with subversive activities, in particular the attempt to penetrate western governing establishments. Andrew and Gordievsky have little specifically new to say about 'the Cambridge Light Blue Five' but do remind us, in discussing this NKVD attempt to get inside the British 'upper ten thousand' in the 1930s, how absurd it was for Moscow to suppose that a clutch of disaffected young men represented the sources of power. Comparison with Ribbentrop's and Hitler's delusions about 'the Cliveden set' comes irresistibly to mind. When we come to the post-Stalinist era - and so, it might be remembered, to the worst decade of the Cold War, which only ended when Khruschev was defeated during the Cuba missile crisis in October 1962 - the narrative tempo slackens somewhat. The Soviet empire, by the early 1960s, was running out of steam: the onset and course of the Cuba missile crisis are described clearly. Narration of Oleg Penkowsky's role, although arguably marred by revealing more detail than a stringent sense of security might warrant, is put in the right historical perspective. The Soviet Union was such a ramshackle affair technologically that its capacity either to wage modern war or run an industrial society should, by the west in general, have seriously been doubted. Unfortunately, it has taken nearly 30 years for these realities to become apparent to us all. Oleg Gordievsky commenced his service in the KGB during immediate aftermath of Khruschev's defeat. Although apparently possessing a clear grasp of 'historical forces', the papers comprising Instructions From The Centre are so much concerned with minutae that one is forced into the impression that Gordievsky quickly lost interest in intelligence operations as an element of State policy, defecting to Britain, all other reasons apart, to escape from the deadening burden of a system which, whilst remaining brutal, had become amazingly inefficient. Certainly the most revealing example of a system out of touch with reality is a report, presumably filched from the KGB Registry, purporting to establish the case for using one corner of the Brompton Oratory as a dead letter box. The report makes curious reading to anyone familiar either with the Oratory - as the compiler of the report clearly was not - or the function of dead letter boxes. One can only hope that they order these things better in Moscow today.</p>

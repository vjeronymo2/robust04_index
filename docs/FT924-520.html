			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / US orders for durable goods fall by 1.9% US durable goods orders fell 1.9 per cent between October and November, more than expected, official figures showed yesterday. The fall followed a 4.6 per cent rise between September and October and mainly reflected weakness in the defence and civilian aircraft sectors. Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose 0.3 per cent. Figures for personal incomes and consumption were also weaker than expected. Personal incomes rose 0.2 per cent last month against 1.1 per cent in October. Personal consumption grew 0.3 per cent in real terms against 0.6 per cent in October. Changes in farmers' subsidies distorted figures. Excluding distortions, incomes rose 0.8 per cent last month. Fourth-quarter consumption spending is expected to be above third-quarter levels.</p>

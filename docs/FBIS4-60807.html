			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned that Yuriy  Shcherbak, Ukraine's ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary to Israel, arrived in Ukraine's capital today.  According to information from competent sources, this visit is  an unplanned one and its purpose is to clarify two issues: The  postponement of the date of the visit by Shim'on Peres, Israel's  foreign affairs minister, which had been planned for 4-5 May,  and clarification of the situation with the Jewish "Sochnut"  agency.    This agency was set up in 1929 as the executive body of the  World Zionist Organization, which represents Jews of the land of  Israel at talks with the British authorities, foreign  governments, and international organizations. Today, this is  the main link uniting Israel with Jews of the diaspora. In  Ukraine, "Sochnut" implements several educational programs, in  accordance with which children from our state have the  opportunity to study directly in Israel. Because several  students expressed a wish not to return home, Ukraine's Ministry  of Justice issued a note of protest.    "The idea of the Israeli state is based on the repatriation  of Jews from the diaspora, Tzvi Magen, Israel's ambassador to  Ukraine, reported. We cannot refuse a single person of Jewish  descent citizenship of our country. At the same time, Ukrainian  legislation envisages the freedom to choose one's place of  residence for each person. There are no problems with Sochnut.  There are nuances there." By nuances Israeli diplomacy  understands the uncoordinated legislation of both states in  certain issues, particularly educational ones. Apropos of this,  Vasyl Onopenko, Ukraine's minister of justice, met a group of  Israeli lawyers today, headed by Hayim Klugman, director general  of Israel's Justice Ministry. Tzvi Magen and Yuriy Shcherbak  also met today. Israel's ambassador to Ukraine reported that  the visit by Shim'on Peres, Israel's minister of foreign  affairs, which interalia was to have resolved the "Sochnut"  situation, had been postponed to approximately the middle of  June. "This does not signify misunderstandings between Ukraine  and Israel, but is only a result of the excessively speedy  signing of peace with the Palestinians, which cannot take place  without the minister of foreign affairs."    According to information from Tzvi Magen, a visit to Ukraine  by Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's prime minister, who visited Moscow a  week ago, is also planned for the summer.</p>

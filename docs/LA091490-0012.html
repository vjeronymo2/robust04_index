			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDS WIN ON HOMER BY LARKIN  </P> <P> Barry Larkin couldn't get down a bunt, so he picked up the Cincinnati Reds  instead.  </P> <P> Larkin fouled off two bunts, then hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning  Thursday night to give the Reds a 7-5 victory over the Houston Astros.  </P> <P> The victory increased the Reds' lead in the National League West to 6 1/2 games  over the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, with the Dodgers starting a  three-game series tonight in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> "I don't know why I couldn't get the bunt down," Larkin said. "It's something I  practice every day. When you're hitting second and there's a man on first,  you've got to be able to get the bunt down.  </P> <P> "I didn't think (Manager Lou Piniella) was going to take the bunt off, but he  did. After I hit it, it starting hooking a little bit. I was around first base  and I gave (first base coach Tony Perez) a high-five, but I still didn't know  if it had gone out."  </P> <P> Rob Dibble (7-3) pitched the ninth for the victory.  </P> <P> Eric Davis hit a three-run homer in the seventh, giving the Reds a 5-5 tie.  </P> <P> The Astros hit a season-high four home runs. Glenn Davis hit his 22nd, a  two-run shot to give Houston a 5-2 lead in the top of the seventh.  </P> <P> Eric Yelding, pitcher Bill Gullickson and Ken Caminiti also hit home runs for  the Astros.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pension opt-outs soaring MANY companies affected by the recession have, unofficially, stopped contributing to their pension schemes. But this problem can be hidden from scheme members and stay beyond the reach of watchdogs. When selling group pension schemes to company directors, insurance companies commonly emphasise the flexibility allowed over payment of contributions. 'It's all part of the sales patter, particularly in money purchase schemes,' said one pension sales executive this week. 'You control the costs, you have flexibility. If profits are down next year, it doesn't matter - skip a year.' This message had been put into practice often during the recession, he added, with the result that up to two years' worth of pensions contributions could have been missed before the insurance company took any effective action. 'When a company gets into difficulties, pension contributions can be a good source of additional cash flow,' said Mike Hayhurst, product development manager at Save &amp; Prosper. 'It might be a short-term thing and the contributions turn up (eventually).' Hayhurst said that to avoid problems of this kind getting worse Save &amp; Prosper now shut down any pension scheme where contributions have gone unpaid for three months, and told scheme members. S&amp;P has also recently negotiated a change of practice with the Occupational Pensions Board, which monitors the adequacy of pension scheme resources. 'We feel the OPB really does not have any teeth,' said Hayhurst, explaining that the board's only sanction was to withdraw the certificate allowing a scheme to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). Now, instead of simply reporting to the OPB that a company pension scheme had gone into arrears on its contributions, and leaving matters to seep through the usual channels, Save &amp; Prosper made a direct request for removal of the contracting-out certificate. 'At that point, members' rights in Serps are at least restored,' Hayhurst added. Meanwhile, 60 members of the CTU Limited pension scheme, some past pension age, have experienced the perils of the normal procedures. More than 2 1/2 years after their company went out of business, they have no firm news of their pensions. The CTU scheme was set up in 1988, to be operated through Eagle Star. CTU fell Pounds 60,000 short in its pension contributions in 1988, and missed a further Pounds 170,000 in 1990. None of this was known to members at the time. Eagle Star says it reported the missed contributions to the OPB several times but the board did not withdraw CTU's contracting-out certificate until after the company had gone into receivership in June 1991. Independent Trustee Services Ltd, which was appointed as independent trustee by the receivers at the start of 1992, has been involved almost ever since. Director Chris Martin described it this week as a Catch 22 situation. 'The OPB has been asking us to state that the assets of the scheme are sufficient to cover the guaranteed minimum pensions,' he said. 'We have told them we can't do that because we suspect they are not. They say that if we can't give that assurance, then we can't wind up the scheme.' It also meant the trustees could not switch the scheme's assets out of Eagle Star's unitised fund and into cash or gilts. Martin said the OPB finally had agreed to accept a statement from an actuary that the assets would be sufficient to pay the premiums to get the members back into the state scheme. But he pointed out that this all might change if a successful claim could be made on the Department of Employment for up to one year's worth of missed contributions. This claim would have to be made with the help of the Official Receiver, with whom negotiations are in progress. But Martin warned: 'That is a long way from getting a claim processed.'</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Sears to spin off insurance subsidiary to shareholders Sears Roebuck, the US retailing giant, is to distribute its 80.1 per cent stake in Allstate, its insurance subsidiary, to its shareholders in one of the largest US corporate spin-offs, valued at more than Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.2bn). The move completes a two-year restructuring that has changed the Chicago-based group from a diversified merchandising and financial services conglomerate back to being a pure retailer, which is how it began. The latest move has been prompted in part by the big losses inflicted on Allstate by recent natural disasters in the US, said Mr Edward Brennan, Sears' chairman. The insurer estimates its losses from January's Californian earthquake at Dollars 1.3bn, while Hurricane Andrew in 1992 cost it Dollars 2.7bn. The sharp swings in Allstate's earnings have added to pressure from shareholders for the group to be divided, allowing the retailing and insurance businesses to be valued individually. Sears also said that Mr Brennan, aged 60, who has been chairman since 1986, is to retire when the Allstate spin-off is complete. The restructuring was started reluctantly by Mr Brennan under pressure from shareholder activists. Sears plans to distribute its remaining 360m shares in Allstate, the US's second-biggest car and homes insurer as well as a leading life insurance company, in a tax-free distribution to shareholders in mid-1995. Sears sold an initial 19 per cent of the insurer's Allstate's shares in a public flotation last year. It founded the insurance company in 1931 to sell car insurance through Sears' catalogues and stores. The move closely resembles the disposal last year of Sears' stockbroking and credit card business, Dean Witter Discover. After floating 20 per cent of the shares, the remainder were spun off to Sears' shareholders. Sears said it was also consider ing selling its commercial property arm, Homart, next year. The business had 1993 revenues of Dollars 234m and losses from continuing operations of Dollars 11.4m. Yesterday's announcements lifted Sears' share price by Dollars 2 3/4 , to Dollars 51 3/8 , while Allstate dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 1/8 . Last year, Allstate contributed Dollars 1.2bn to the Sears group's Dollars 1.7bn of earnings. But Allstate's profits have been shattered by Dollars 1.3bn in customer claims for earthquake losses this year, resulting in Dollars 845m in after-tax charges. Its net income for the first nine months of 1994 was Dollars 320.7m, or 71 cents a share, down sharply from last year's Dollars 1bn or Dollars 2.42 a share. The company intends the aggregate dividends paid by Allstate and Sears after the spin-off to equal Sears' current annual dividend of Dollars 1.60. Lex, Page 18 Allstate shaken, Page 25</p>

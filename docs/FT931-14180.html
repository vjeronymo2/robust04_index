			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Lee urges Singaporeans to spread their wings: The island state is urged to recapture the entrepreneurial spirit ACCORDING to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is the most comfortable country in Asia. But Singapore's former prime minister is not boasting - he is worried. 'That's our problem,' says Mr Lee. 'Too comfortable, no one wants to go abroad . . . we have got to shake Singaporeans up, make them adventurous, or we will be losers.' Having outgrown its small domestic base Singapore has no alternative but to invest more overseas, says Mr Lee. When Mr Lee, now a senior minister, talks, Singapore listens. Singaporeans are busy discovering a world outside their island republic. A day hardly goes by without an announcement of another overseas investment project. 'China fever' has gripped boardrooms. Mr Zhu Zhen-yuan of the Chinese embassy in Singapore says Singapore's investments in China in the first six months of 1992 totalled Dollars 494m (Pounds 325m) against a total of Dollars 896m for the entire 1979-91 period. 'I believe Singapore's total investment commitment in 1992 will exceed the total commitment of the past 13 years,' says Mr Zhu. Singapore's businessmen are busy in Vietnam. The island state is Vietnam's leading trading partner with total two-way trade of more than Dollars 530m in the first six months of 1992. Both Vietnam and China are tapping Singapore's expertise in infrastructure development. Several million Singapore dollars have been invested in hotel, shipyard and telecommunications projects in Vietnam. Singapore's large state companies, which still have a big influence on the domestic economy, are linking up with the private sector as part of a 'Singapore Inc' approach to winning China projects. The Shanghai authorities are discussing a SDollars 430m (Pounds 168m) airport project and the formation of a special economic zone with the Singaporeans. But it is Fujian province, further to the south, that is attracting most interest from Singapore. Fujian is the home of the Hokkien chinese dialect group, the dominant group in Singapore. Mr Oei Hong Leong, a Singapore businessman with strong links to the Chinese community in Indonesia, has taken control of more than 60 former state-owned enterprises in Fujian. Late last year two of Singapore's biggest state companies, Singapore Technologies and Jurong Environmental Engineering, entered into a partnership with Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the Chinese-Indonesian tycoon, to develop a 5,000 hectare industrial park in Fujian. The estimated cost of the first phase of the project is SDollars 300m. The same Singapore-Liem partnership has already successfully developed an industrial park on Batam, an Indonesian island about 20km south of Singapore. To encourage greater investment overseas, the government is providing low interest loans for various projects. Singapore's Trade Development Board has promised to help businessmen identify overseas investment opportunities. Singaporean schools are being set up abroad to encourage families to go overseas. This more outward looking, aggressive approach to business is slowly being adopted by Singapore's cash rich banks. Traditionally viewed as conservative stay-at-home institutions, Singapore's four main banks - Overseas-Chinese, DBS, United Overseas Bank and Overseas Union Bank - are now big lenders in the region and are pushing for more international loan syndication business. Singapore's banks have now surpassed Hong Kong as Thailand's main lender. While Hong Kong still has the lion's share of China loan business, Singapore banks are starting to edge into that market. Total offshore borrowings arranged by Singapore banks rose by 30 per cent in the first half of 1992 to more than Dollars 4bn. Singapore's 2.8m people are sitting on a mountain of savings. Savings now stand at 47 per cent of GDP. The country's foreign exchange reserves are officially reported to be nearly Dollars 40bn but are generally believed to be much higher. While investments have been made in manufacturing enterprises in Malaysia and to a lesser extent in Indonesia, the main part of Singapore's reserves have in the past been invested in stocks, shares, bonds and real estate - the latter principally in Australia. Other investments - by state companies in technology ventures in Silicon Valley - have not been so successful. According to Mr Lee the thrust of Singapore investment policy must change. Singapore must become more like South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong which have internationalised and made far flung investments in manufacturing and other projects. But Singapore has a lot of catching up to do. Hong Kong entrepreneurs have been investing heavily in China for years. The Taiwanese, despite restrictions on doing business with China, have been quietly investing millions of dollars. The South Koreans are working on projects all over the world, some under very tough conditions. Investors in Batam, almost within sight of Singapore, say it is very difficult to coax Singapore managers to the island. 'Even when we get them here, they want to rush back at the slightest opportunity,' says an electronics plant manager. Mr Lee says Singaporeans have no choice but to become more outward looking - more willing to take risks, not so afraid of failure. The irony, say many Singaporeans, is that Mr Lee himself is largely to blame for fostering attitudes he now criticises. Mr Lee's critics argue that by building up an over-regulated, carefully controlled society, with an economy dominated by state companies, the entrepreneur has been squeezed out of the Singaporean. 'For years he (Lee) told us how wonderful Singapore was and how dangerous and terrible everywhere else was in comparison,' says a Singapore trader. 'He bred a sort of xenophobia. He can't expect people who have grown up with those ideas to suddenly be packing their bags and wandering off to the outposts of China or Mongolia.'</p>

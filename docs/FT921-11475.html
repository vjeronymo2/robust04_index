			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Namibia woos mine investors NAMIBIAN authorities are preparing what they hope will be an attractive mining code for investors, a senior government official said, reports Reuter from Windhoek. Mr Leake Hangala, the mines and energy permanent secretary, said the government was drafting mining legislation, a mining tax policy and a labour code to promote mining and energy exploration. He added that he hoped the legislation would be enacted during the current session of the national assembly. Only two days ago the South African company Revere Resources announced it intended to develop a major copper mine in Namibia. Mr Hangala described this development as exciting. The company said it planned to spend about R280m (Pounds 48m) developing the Haib porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit, where reserves of 1.5bn tonnes of ore have been identified north of the Orange River border. The mine is expected to begin initial production before the end of the year.</p>

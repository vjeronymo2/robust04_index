			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC starts debate on trade weapons today THE EC will today begin a painful and potentially divisive internal debate on the use of trade weapons, such as anti-dumping duties, quotas and safeguard clauses, in the single market. Foreign and trade ministers meeting in Luxembourg will for the first time discuss controversial plans which would give the European Commission greater power to push through 'commercial defence measures'. Some Brussels lawyers believe the result could be the most significant trade policy revision since the anti-dumping rule was adopted in 1968. The plan's aim is simple: to streamline how the Commission and European Court deal with trade complaints. But it has become linked to the wider question of how to lift quotas imposed on non-EC countries by individual member states. The network of quotas must be scrapped, or harmonised, if the single market is to work properly after January 1 1993. The issue could set trade liberals such as Britain and Germany against their southern counterparts, such as Spain and Italy, worried that free circulation of goods after 1992 might disarm EC trade policy. 'It's going to be a tough debate,' one official said yesterday. The Commission proposal follows a plea from the European Court of Justice, overloaded with trade complaints. The court wants such complaints handled by the lower Court of First Instance. Brussels says such a move could add to time taken for imposing defensive trade measures. Its proposal would give the Commission more initiative by letting opponents block a Commission proposal only if they could muster a qualified majority against it. Now, duties can be blocked by a minority of countries. 'This isn't about increasing the Commission's powers, it's about overcoming deadlocks in the trade policy area,' a Brussels official said. Today's discussion is unlikely to be conclusive, as member states are deadlocked over the proposal.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTIAGO: A MERE HOUR FROM THE SLOPES  </P> <P> For first-time travelers to South America, Santiago, wedged between desert and  mountain in a valley dotted with vineyards, is like a dip in a lukewarm pool --  refreshing but not shocking. This is a soothing city, affordable and easy to  get around in. And Chilean hospitality, renowned across the continent, lives up  to its reputation.  </P> <P> U.S. skiers trying out any of Chile's best known slopes are less than 90  minutes from its urban delights. People are friendly and casual, shopping  bargains abound, meals are accompanied by some of the continent's finest wine,  and cultural attractions are many in the native land of two Nobel prize-winning  poets, Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral.  </P> <P> Most people visit Santiago during its warm months from December to March. But  the intense summer heat -- hovering in the 90s for days -- is too warm for some  visitors and sends even residents fleeing into its many parks and pedestrian  malls. Temperatures in the winter months, June through September, can drop to  near freezing at night and daytime drizzle is common, but travelers with  slickers or overcoats can explore the city comfortably.  </P> <P> "The advantage of Chile in the winter is that there are a lot of activities. .  . ballet, theater, opera, just about anything you can imagine in a developed  cultural center," said Marilyn Pugh, tour manager for LanChile Airlines.  </P> <P> Santiago's main square, the Plaza de Armas, is where the city was founded 449  years ago by ragged Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia. The plaza was used  for public floggings and hangings in colonial days, but now it's inhabited by  shoeshine boys, vagrants, strolling couples and youngsters kicking soccer  balls.  </P> <P> The square is bordered by Sanitago's fourth cathedral -- earthquakes and fires  destroyed the first three on the site -- with its religious art museum, the  pink post office building used as Chile's first presidential palace and the  National Historical Museum, whose documents, furnishings and paintings trace  the country's struggle for independence.  </P> <P> Tucked under the arches off the plaza is popular Chez Henry, a three-in-one  stop with a delicatessan-wine shop, restaurant and nightclub. The deli clerks  offer good advice on Chilean wines and the restaurant, crowded around the  clock, specializes in Italian pastas and such Chilean dishes as pastel de  choclo, a rich corn and meat casserole.  </P> <P> Two blocks away on Merced Street is an art collection that links Chile with its  most unusual possession -- Easter Island, 2,300 miles away in the Pacific  Ocean. The Merced Church museum has wood carvings, ceramics and other artifacts  from this volcanic island, whose famous huge stone statues, called moai, have  fascinated archaeologists ever since they were discovered. (One moai has been  transported to the grassy promenade of Avenida Libertador O'Higgins.)  </P> <P> The church museum also offers a crash course in Latin America's violently  graphic, colonial religious art, including bloody statues covered by crystal  bell jars. The bell jars, survivors of an ocean journey from Europe and  Santiago's frequent earthquakes, originally displayed erotic objects -- which  religious Santiaguinos, as city residents are known, replaced with Christian  images.  </P> <P> Downtown Santiago is cut by two pedestrian malls where bankers in dark suits  and window shoppers with children in tow cross paths. The malls, Paseo Ahumada  and Paseo Huerfanos, are lined with banks, currency exchange offices, travel  agencies, airlines, shoe stores (great buys on leather), boutiques and pastry  shops.  </P> <P> On Ahumada, the pungent smell of coffee is a tantalizing sign that Cafe Haiti  or Cafe Caribe -- the city's trendiest daytime stops -- are near. Chile  produces no coffee, making the real stuff a luxury. What most restaurants serve  is instant Nescafe. At these stand-up counters, thick strong coffee is served  by women outfitted in exotic jungle prints. Executives hash out business deals  over cafe con leche (coffee with milk).  </P> <P> Ahumada's landmark is Falabella, Santiago's biggest department store, just two  blocks from the Plaza de la Libertad, or Liberty Square. The plaza, sided by  the imposing Palacio de la Moneda, has become a symbol of modern Chile's  darkest days.  </P> <P> Built as the Spanish royal mint and decried for its size and exorbitant cost,  the austere structure serves as Chile's equivalent of the White House.  </P> <P> In 1973, during the democratic country's only military coup, President Salvador  Allende was killed inside La Moneda by military forces under Gen. Augusto  Pinochet.  </P> <P> When foreign journalists entered La Moneda earlier this year, for the first  time in 16 years, they saw the bunker built secretly during Pinochet's reign.  Now, with the military dictatorship gone and President Patricio Alywin  installed by democratic vote, the carbine-carrying police are no longer  intimidating. Chile's economy is stable and there is a relatively low crime  rate.  </P> <P> To the side of La Moneda is the Carrera Hotel, headquarters for journalists who  covered the coup and still one of Santiago's most elegant hotels.  </P> <P> From the Carrera's front door -- or the plaza itself -- visitors can watch the  midday changing of the guard at La Moneda. Circling the plaza are a number of  international banks, the signposts of a country that has consistently boasted  foreign investment while its neighbors fought roller coaster fluctuations in  inflation, prices and salaries.  </P> <P> The best site for an overview of the city is the Cerro San Cristobal, a hilltop  park crowned by a massive statue of the Virgin Mary, her arms outstretched over  Santiago. When the smog (which exceeded pollution levels of Los Angeles and  Mexico City in 1989) is light, one can see the city -- the Andes peaks to the  east and the slopes of the coastal mountains to the west.  </P> <P> Cerro San Cristobal's park, with a zoo, botanical gardens, two swimming pools,  picnic grounds and hiking paths is one of South America's finest. It can be  reached by car, cab or funicular railway. Once in the park, a skylift takes  visitors up the 1,145-foot hill to the Enoteca.  </P> <P> A whitewashed neocolonial building tucked behind a grove of palm trees, the  Enoteca houses a wine museum, wine-tasting salon and is one of the city's best  restaurants.  </P> <P> At dinner, there's a show of traditional Chilean music and dance. Enoteca  manager, Max Rodriguez, speaks English and is happy to suggest world-class  wines to accompany meals or to take home. The best-known labels are Concha y  Toro, Cousino Macul, Santa Carolina and Undurraga. The finest reserves come  from the Maipo valley just outside Santiago.  </P> <P> At the base of Cerro San Cristobal is Bellavista, the city's Bohemian district  where artists, writers and poets huddle together over inexpensive seafood meals  and musicians share bottles of wine, conversing in the smoky bistros dotting  the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Bellavista is almost clogged with shops specializing in the copper and lapis  lazuli items for which Chile is famous. The bright blue gemstones are  incorporated into everything from necklaces to silverware. More lapis lazuli is  found a few blocks east in the government-run CEMA store at Avenida Portugal  351 in the Providencia neighborhood.  </P> <P> Set up to sell the handicrafts of young mothers, the nationwide CEMA stores  offer Chile's biggest and best variety of handiwork.  </P> <P> Once a rural area, Providencia is a posh shopping district named for the  Sisters of Providence and the huge adobe convent they opened in 1853. This is  the stomping ground of Santiago's rich, a neighborhood of exclusive boutiques,  intimate European-style hotels, chic restaurants and Mercedes-Benzes --  although the latter spend more time in their carports now, thanks to a strict  new anti-pollution law that imposes a revolving ban on cars one day a week,  depending on the final numbers on their license plates.  </P> <P> Many of these wealthy residents are the descendants of Chile's wine and mine  magnates. A microcosm view of that opulence is seen at Palacio Cousino, a  neoclassical mansion built in 1878 as a private home where visiting royalty  could stay while in Santiago.  </P> <P> Although a fire sparked by a short circuit botched plans for British Queen  Elizabeth's overnight stay there in 1968, the home's guest roster includes  Golda Meir, Charles de Gaulle and Indira Gandhi  </P> <P> Palacio Cousino is a marvel of gilt-edged mirrors, parquet floors, stunning  paintings, porcelain, furniture and draperies brought from Europe more than a  century ago to grace its rooms. And rooms there are: tearoom, arms room, winter  garden (a greenhouse salon kept steamy by hot water pipes running beneath its  Italian tile floor) and a billiard room now used as a gallery for work by  Chilean artists.  </P> <P> But the best art is at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in the wooded Parque  Forestal beside the Mapocho River. The National Fine Arts Museum joins the  Museum of Popular American Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art in the  recently renovated Palacio, a building that cleverly employs natural light in  galleries featuring Chilean works, modern art from a number of countries and  first-rate traveling shows.  </P> <P> Each August, the museum displays designs by Chilean architects that inevitably  spark lively public debate. Architects are highly respected in Chile, and their  works so exalted that homes in moneyed areas bear their architect's name on  exterior plaques.  </P> <P> City maps, English-language brochures and tour information in Santiago are  available at the Chilean National Tourist Office, Avenida Providencia 1550,  phone 698-2151.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Chala from Chisinau: "There Is the Law </F> on Borders. There Is No Border Itself"]    [Text] The Moldovan Parliament approved the Law on State  Borders, the absence of which had given rise to complaints on  the part of border guards for almost two years. Lately, the  Moldovan-Romanian border has increasingly become a corridor  through which narcotics and weapons are smuggled into Western  Europe and which residents of Southeast Asia and various  criminals have been trying to cross in search of a better life.    Due to the absence of legal norms the border has, in fact,  remained "transparent," and trespassers were, in the worst case,  deported from the [Moldovan] Republic -- to Ukraine or to  Russia. Soon, they were again detained at the same place, and  the circular movement continued.    Moldova borders upon two states -- Romania and Ukraine.  However, whereas the Moldovan-Romanian border is clearly  defined, because it used to be the state border in the former  USSR, in the case of Ukraine it remained, until recently, just  an administrative border. Although the law approved by the  parliament attached an official status to it, no clear-cut  demarcation line has been drawn. An intergovernmental  Moldovan-Ukrainian commission is presently defining it.  However, according to parliamentary speaker P. Luchinschi, this  issue requires time.    Deputies of the Popular Front faction drew the parliament's  attention to the problem of the "Danube Triangle" -- 800  borderline meters along the Danube near the town of Reni.  Moldova counts upon this triangle, planning to build a port  there and ensure exit to the Black Sea for itself. According to  the Moldovan minister of security, this question is being  discussed at a corresponding interstate level.</p>

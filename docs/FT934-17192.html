			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Germans and Spanish jostle to keep VW jobs SIGNS of tension between the Volkswagen management and its largest shareholder, the Lower Saxony government, emerged yesterday as confusion grew over the future of VW's Spanish subsidiary, Seat. Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democrat prime minister of Lower Saxony, where most VW production is based, made plain that his main preoccupation was the protection of jobs and factories in his constituency. He issued a statement yesterday after Spanish union leaders proclaimed on German television that the threat of closure hanging over Seat's Zona Franca factory in Barcelona, which employs 10,500, had been lifted. Jubilant Spanish broadcasters quoted the officials as saying they were 'enormously satisfied' by talks with senior Volkswagen group executives in Wolfsburg. Volkswagen officials were markedly more circumspect, cautioning that the crisis at Seat, heading for a DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this year, was to be 'investigated'. A formal statement issued after the talks said only that the Seat management and worker representatives would examine ways of securing the future of Seat, 'especially in the light of the critical situation' at Zona Franca. Efforts would be made to reach a joint solution for the future of the works, it added. Mr Schroder, a member of the VW supervisory board which hires and fires executives, is considered likely to resist any significant back-tracking on rationalisation plans for Spain. If VW, which is heading for a loss this year, cannot make considerable savings elsewhere, then the board may have to step up its hitherto modest programme of job cuts in Germany. Volkswagen employs more than 110,000 in Germany, almost half in its home base in Wolfsburg. 'The security of jobs and production sites in Lower Saxony and the well-being of the whole group are the primary concerns of state government policy,' Mr Schroder said. He added that he did not want to be involved in negotiations on restructuring Seat. Decisions affecting the subsidiary were exclusively a matter for management, he said. And he responded coolly to proposals from Spain that he should meet political leaders from Seat's home region, Catalonia. He did not exclude talks, he said, but any discussion would have to be held in the presence of Volkswagen executives, he said. Yesterday's events were prompted by a mid-week clash after which Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, Seat chairman, resigned when his proposals for restructuring Seat were rejected as 'insufficient' and 'too soft' by the VW group board. Negotiations will continue next week, when Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, will meet national and regional officials in Spain.</p>

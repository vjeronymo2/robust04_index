			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POWER-SHY MANILA ON 4-DAY WORK WEEK  </P> <P> Government offices and about 300 private companies went on a forced holiday  today at the start of a four-day work week program to conserve energy in the  capital, which has been hit by the worst power shortage in two decades.  </P> <P> The four-day work week will be in effect for five weeks and was designed by  businessmen who objected to having periodic blackouts throughout the week.  </P> <P> By taking a holiday on Mondays, the offices were assured by the National Power  Corp. of uninterrupted power supply for the rest of the week.  </P> <P> Although only government offices and 309 private buildings are covered by the  program, activities in most commercial establishments, including five-star  hotels, ground to a halt as four-hour power shutdowns took effect in the midst  of a prolonged dry spell.  </P> <P> Filipinos left without air conditioners or electric fans grumbled about the  sweltering heat, and President Corazon Aquino was criticized for failing to  anticipate power shortages.  </P> <P> Aquino mothballed the 620-megawatt Westinghouse nuclear plant on Bataan  province across Manila Bay for safety reasons after she attained power in 1986.  Officials said it would cost several billion dollars to meet safety  requirements and start operations at the plant, which has never been used.  </P> <P> Power officials said that they made recommendations on how to compensate for  the closure of the $2.1-billion nuclear plant but that Aquino did not act on  them.  </P> <P> Observers fear the power shortage -- the worst since an energy crisis in the  1970s -- will affect the nation's economic performance this year and scare away  foreign investors.  </P></p>

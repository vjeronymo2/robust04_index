			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Salomon in red on 'disappointing trading results' SALOMON, the US securities house reeling from a bond trading scandal, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 29m, due to disappointing securities trading results and a one-time charge at its oil subsidiary, Phibro Energy. The figures contrasted with the strong profits increasingly reported by many Wall Street businesses, but were in line with a warning the firm gave in January, when it said it expected to report a Dollars 30m loss. The final sum produced a loss of 41 cents a share and compared with a loss of Dollars 15m, or 28 cents, a year ago. Salomon Brothers, the firm's securities house, made pre-tax profits of only Dollars 27m in the quarter, against a Dollars 90m loss a year ago. The company said the 'disappointing results' in each quarter were attributable 'primarily to lower revenues from trading activities'. Wall Street analysts said the figures appeared to reflect in part the continuing impact of last year's Treasury market scandal, which forced Salomon to shed Dollars 50bn in assets and led to the temporary loss of some leading clients. The firm is also going through a restructuring which has led to significant redundancies and the poaching of leading analysts and traders by rivals. Salomon declined to elaborate on the securities trading figures, although it has often stressed the volatile nature of its quarterly figures. For the full year Salomon Brothers reported pre-tax income of Dollars 1bn, up from Dollars 416m, with profitable trading results across all leading products. The increase was due mainly to strong revenues from arbitrage and derivatives and fixed income securities trading. Salomon reported net income of Dollars 507m, or Dollars 3.90, up from Dollars 303m, or Dollars 2.08, in 1990, after taking a Dollars 200m third-quarter charge to cover potential costs from the Treasury scandal. In 1990 it reported Dollars 323m of special charges. Its Phibro Energy unit recorded a fourth-quarter pre-tax loss of Dollars 60m, against profits of Dollars 62m. For the full year it lost Dollars 34m, compared with 1990 earnings of Dollars 492m.</p>

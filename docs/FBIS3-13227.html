			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Claude Lorieux </F> in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] [Lorieux] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  telephoned you on 8 March evening. Why?    ['Arafat] To discuss the message which I had sent him  through his special envoy Jacques Neriya whom I received in  Cairo on Monday. I reaffirmed the measures which need to be  taken to ensure the Palestinian people's security and  tranquility in the Israeli-occupied territories.    [Lorieux] In other words, you are putting forward  preconditions for the resumption of the peace negotiations....    ['Arafat] We are not talking about preconditions but about  the precise implementation of the agreement reached on 13  September in Washington by the Palestinians and the Israelis.  Take the Jewish settlements within the city of Hebron. They  are illegal. Moreover, eight ministers of the Rabin government  are asking that their occupants be removed. I am not asking for  them to be destroyed, but moved.    [Lorieux] Why are these settlements situated in the heart of  the city more illegal than Qiryat Arb'a, which is growing up  outside the gates of Hebron?    ['Arafat] The 13 September agreement makes provision for the  issue of Jewish settlements (Qiryat Arba', for instance) to be  discussed later. The text states: "As soon as possible and no  later than the beginning of the third year" following the  agreement. "As soon as possible" because we think, like the  Israelis, that it is a burning issue. But, can you understand  it? Although Qiryat Arba' is three-fourths empty, why on earth  are the settlers coming and installing themselves in the city?  Why are they coming and confiscating Palestinian houses?    [Lorieux] Have you convinced Mr. Rabin?    ['Arafat] Our reference is the Declaration of Principles  signed in Washington on 13 September. There can only be one  authority: Israeli today and Palestinian when we are in Gaza and  Jericho. The Israeli Army is therefore responsible for the  security of the settlers. However, the settlers have become  another power. A separate, armed, and dangerous power.    [Lorieux] That is your analysis. But I repeat my question:  Did you convince the Israeli prime minister on Tuesday evening?    ['Arafat] No. It was a discussion. He gave his viewpoint,  I gave mine. I spoke in particular about the establishment of  an international presence in the occupied territories. The  Declaration of Principles mentions this possibility. It is very  important that this international presence should be rapidly  established to ensure the protection of our people. We are not  making new demands. We are just asking for the Declaration of  Principles to be honestly implemented. Throughout the seven  months of negotiations which have followed the Washington  agreements, the Israelis have insisted on one issue: the  security of the settlers. However, it seems that the Jewish  settlements are time bombs. This is particularly glaring  because those responsible for the Hebron tragedy are not only  settlers but some units of the Israeli Army. The Israeli Army  opened fire to protect the retreat of the Israeli settlers and,  as we have since learned, it also opened fire on the faithful  who were trying to flee the mosque. Outside, facing the  entrance, soldiers killed eight people and wounded 24. The  Israeli commission of inquiry itself admits that there was  negligence. How is this possible? That mosque is under the  sole protection of the Israeli Army.    [Lorieux] It is constantly being announced that the UN  Security Council will adopt a resolution on the 25 February  massacre. This text should not only condemn the killing but  also define the measures to be taken to prevent new incidents.    ['Arafat] We hope that the U.S. representative will vote in  favor of it. But 13 days have already passed. You can imagine  what that means: 13 days after that horrible massacre. And, as  I speak to you, nothing has yet been done.    [Lorieux] Is the Security Council's inability to act the  only obstacle to the resumption of the negotiations interrupted  after the massacre?    ['Arafat] It is one of the obstacles. Let us not forget  that many UN resolutions have remained a dead letter. We are  determined to ensure that the ones adopted on Hebron are  actually implemented.    [Lorieux] You are likely to have to wait for the  completion of negotiations not only on the principle but on the  methods of establishing an international presence in the  occupied territories. The organization, composition, and  deployment of that presence will have to be defined...    ['Arafat] Let us make things clear. I want to be sure that  the Security Council's decision will change the situation on the  ground. It is my right to demand it. It is also the right of  my people who want to see the situation changing in practice.  They have been waiting for seven months.    [Lorieux] When you talk of an international presence, are  you thinking of an armed presence?    ['Arafat] Allow me to ask you a question. Who will protect  this international force? The armed Jewish settlers?    [Lorieux] You mean that the members of this force will have  to ensure their own protection...    ['Arafat] Yes. It is for them to protect themselves. I am  not asking them to have tanks. I am simply asking that they do  not constitute an additional responsibility for we Palestinians.  They will have to be active and play their role.    [Lorieux] Where should they be deployed? In Gaza-Jericho  which is due to come under Palestinian authority on 13 April?  Or in the whole of the West Bank, which is to remain under  Israeli occupation until the election of the "Palestinian  authority" in July?    ['Arafat] The first group should go to Hebron to provide the  Palestinian population with the protection decided by the  Security Council. This is urgent. We must be aware of our  people's anger, and that of the Arab people, the Muslim people,  the Christian people in the world, the international community.  I have even received messages of condolence signed by Jewish  organizations.    [Lorieux] A consensus had still not been found in the UN  Security Council 13 days after Hebron. Particularly because the  Americans are refusing to allow the Council's resolution to be  applied to the occupied territories "including Jerusalem?" Do  you know why?    ['Arafat] Ask the Americans! The Security Council is not  working on a draft resolution presented by the Palestinians, the  Arabs, or the nonaligned countries, but on a text presented by  the U.S. Administration. This U.S. text refers to resolution  799 which relates to the fourth Geneva convention which is  applicable to all the occupied territories "including  Jerusalem." The Americans' refusal conflicts with their initial  position.    [Lorieux] Is it therefore a change of attitude by  Washington?    ['Arafat] That is what it seems to be.    [Lorieux] Bill Clinton came to the presidency with the most  pro-Israeli team that the White House had seen for a long time.  The President, on contact with the real situation, seemed to  change. But, since the Hebron massacre, do you think that the  U.S. attitude has taken a step backward?    ['Arafat] We will have to wait and see. This massacre is a  turning-point. Like the Sarajevo market massacre. The Hebron  massacre was planned and organized by Israeli Army units and by  armed settlers. It is something like the Secret Army  Organization -- illegal organization supporting French rule of  Algeria formed during Algerian war. We must therefore wait  until the whole U.S. reaction is revealed at all levels and not  just in the Security Council. We will have to gauge their  participation in the international force. We are not asking for  the moon. We are asking for the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles of 13 September which makes provision  for an international presence. Will the United States be up to  the responsibilities which it has shouldered since the signing  of this Declaration of Principles at the White House? That is  the whole question.    [Lorieux] Russia thinks that the Hebron shooting has  "completely scuttled the negotiation process." It has therefore  just proposed the "convening of a second Madrid conference."  What do you think of this idea?    ['Arafat] It is a good idea.    [Lorieux] Is the process launched in Madrid in October 1991  so bogged down that something else should be tried?    ['Arafat] No, it should be freshened up and reactivated.    [Lorieux] When you received me in October before your visit  to France, you told me: "If Rabin makes a promise, he keeps his  word." Can you confirm your judgment today?    ['Arafat] I stick to the situation and the facts. Our  people are waiting for the decisions to be implemented in the  field. Slogans are not enough.    [Lorieux] Some Palestinians burned your picture in refugee  camps in Jordan and Lebanon. What is your reaction?    ['Arafat] These autos-da-fe are the work of secret services.  I know who is behind them. I do not have the impression that  the Palestinians are angry with me.    [Lorieux] Over the months, and especially since Hebron, you  have come under growing criticism. Even within the PLO....    ['Arafat] My comrades have the right to criticize me. It is  their right to ask me to listen to them more. Seven months  after the 13 September agreement, nothing has changed in the  daily lives of the Palestinians in the territories.    [Lorieux] Have you convinced Mr. Rabin and Mr. Clinton that  it is necessary to go into action, as you put it?    ['Arafat] I hope so. Otherwise, the scenario changes.  Peace is not just something the Palestinians need. The  Israelis, Americans, and Europeans need it, too. If this  agreement is not implemented, the Near East will enter into a  period of confusion and Balkanization.    [Lorieux] The Israelis are in less of a hurry than you.  That was obvious during your last meeting with Mr. Peres in  Cairo a month ago.    ['Arafat] In Cairo, I was very accommodating. I wanted to  give the peace process a last chance. But I stress that it was  a last chance. If the Declaration of Principles is not  implemented precisely and honestly, I will be entitled to  explain to my people how that came about. They are waiting for  me to do so. I will not deceive my people. Its patience is  limited.    [Lorieux] Have you set a deadline?    ['Arafat] Yes, 12 April is the deadline. It is the day  fixed in the Declaration of Principles for the completion of the  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. In one month's time!    [Lorieux] If that deadline is not honored, what will you do?  Will you close shop?    ['Arafat] If nothing was done, that would mean that the  Israeli Government had decided not to respect our agreements!  It is not my responsibility which is at stake in this affair.  It is the responsibility of the international community and, in  particular, the U.S. and Russian joint sponsors of the peace  process, particularly President Clinton.    [Lorieux] Last Sunday, the Palestinian Islamic  fundamentalist movement Hamas issued an ultimatum to the Jewish  settlers: Move before 15 March or watch out! Do you agree with  that?    ['Arafat] You have to understand our people's despair.    [Lorieux] Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv last  Saturday against the Hebron massacre.    ['Arafat] By that they showed that a high proportion of  Israeli society is against the settlers' crime, against the  policy of settlements, and against the fanatical groups which  are simply time bombs. This section of the population is  opposed to any delay in the implementation of the 13 September  Declaration of Principles.    [Lorieux] It is in this terribly tense climate that Francois  Leotard is making a visit to Israel. He met with one of your  aides in Paris last week. What is your view of the French  defense minister's visit?    ['Arafat] I have no opinion to express on France's foreign  policy. I just think that it would have been preferable to  postpone that visit, especially since it is a visit by the  defense minister and he will have discussions with the Israeli  Army. This visit is likely to be seen by the Israelis, and  especially by the fanatical groups, as a favorable signal.</p>

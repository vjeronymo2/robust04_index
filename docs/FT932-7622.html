			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ferraris profit boost and Pounds 2m rights FERRARIS, the medical equipment and specialist engineering group, formerly known as Stainless Metalcraft, yesterday moved to strengthen its financial base with a two-for-three rights issue to raise Pounds 1.95m and said it is applying for its shares to be admitted to the official list. The group also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 251,000 for the six months to last February, compared with Pounds 77,000 in the same period of 1991/92. Turnover rose to Pounds 5.43m against Pounds 4.83m. Ferraris returned to profit in the year to last August, after two years of losses. The rights issue is priced at 55p a share, a discount of 12p to its overnight price. It has been underwritten by Singer &amp; Friedlander in Birmingham and brokers are Peel, Hunt. Proceeds of the rights will be used to buy the freehold of its main operating site at Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, as well as the outstanding minority interest in its US subsidiary and reduce gearing. Between 1989 and 1991, when Ferraris reorganised its business, moving out of general engineering, gearing rose from 70 to 154 per cent and last year was 98 per cent. After the rights issue it will fall to under 20 per cent and said Mr Ken Baker, the chairman, 'we plan to keep it that way for the future.' He described the fund-raising as 'tidying up the garden,' a financial reorganisation to complement the operational reorganisation. One element of this has been to widen the shareholder base. The directors and the Childs family, holders of the largest block of shares, are renouncing their rights entitlement so that their combined holdings will decline from 40 per cent to under 24 per cent of the equity. Based on earnings per share of 2.4p, against 0.7p in the comparable half, shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 0.75p a share. In 1991/92 they received no interim, but a final of 1p.</p>

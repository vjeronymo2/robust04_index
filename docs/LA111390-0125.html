			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY TO STUDY MORE CAR-POOL INCENTIVES  </P> <P> In the wake of a state agency's veto of the city's smog-reduction package, the  City Council will discuss additional incentives at its afternoon study session  today.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District requires Newport Beach, like  other Orange County cities, to offer city employees incentives to car-pool and  use public transportation in an effort to reduce traffic congestion and air  pollution.  </P> <P> The plan that the city originally submitted to the AQMD included establishing a  bicycle loan program, preferential parking for car poolers and on-site transit  subsidies.  </P> <P> However, in a letter rejecting the proposed package, AQMD Transportation  Program Director Sarah Siwek said that the incentives listed by the city would  not be sufficient to reach the goals mandated by state law.  </P> <P> City officials must look into such additional measures as financial incentives  for car pooling, alternate work weeks and parking fees for single-occupancy  cars, the letter reads. If the city does not modify its plan, it could face  fines and criminal penalties.  </P> <P> One possibility that the council will consider is paying employees who car-pool  with two or more people an extra $30 a month. Those who car-pool with one other  person would receive $15 extra per month.  </P></p>

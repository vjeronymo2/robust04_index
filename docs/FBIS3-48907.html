			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Sali Berisha with foreign and </F> domestic correspondents in Tirana on 30 December -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Xhevdet Shehu] Xhevdet  Shehu. Mr. President, after the departure of [the Italian  humanitarian operation known as] Pelican, there were rumors that  our relations with Italy were deteriorating. Is this true? I  would like to ask another question, if I may: For some time  now, the events of the Democratic Prosperity Party in Macedonia  have attracted the attention of the Albanian public and have  been commented on in various ways. The newspaper RILINDJA of  Kosova wrote yesterday about a distinction in your attitude and  that of Mr. Rugova regarding this party. What exactly is your  opinion?    [Berisha] [passage omitted] Regarding the rumors that our  relations with Italy have deteriorated, I consider them to be  completely false. Our relations with Italy are of a friendly  nature. Italy is a country that has helped Albania, and I am  convinced that the Albanians are and will be grateful to the  Italian people for the noble assistance they have rendered to  Albania. We should keep one thing in mind though: Friendship  and speed are two different things. When establishing a  friendship, it is important to base it on a solid and strong  foundation. We are determined to develop and maintain friendly  relations with Italy and the Italian people. As for Pelican, it  left because its mission was over. I think the Pelican  operation felt the greatest pleasure of all of us. After  performing its large humanitarian mission, Pelican saw that the  friendly country, with which it was related, had reached its  required level of efficiency. [passage omitted]    Therefore, Pelican finished its mission and left. There is  no room for a shadow, and it did not leave any trace of one.  Pelican came as a humanitarian mission and left after honestly  performing its work.    There is no distinction between Rugova and Tirana regarding  the assessments and attitudes toward developments in Macedonia's  main political force. Our ideas and concessions are identical.    [Ndrek Gjini, ATA] Ndrek Gjini of ATA. How do you feel  about the attacks from the left? [passage omitted]    [Berisha] If you are referring to the press, I can openly  say that I do not like it if I am attacked by the press.  [passage omitted]    The press is a very important institution of freedom and  democracy. If the press abuses its freedom, do not think that  it goes without being judged. There is a judge for the press,  and the most powerful judge for the press is the public.  [passage omitted]    [Edi Paloka, RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE] Edi Paloka of RILINDJA  DEMOKRATIKE. In the extremist leftist circles, a new idea is  circulating about early elections. The idea is that PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], who won the elections in  Greece, wants to overthrow the Meksi government. What do you  think about this?    [Berisha] This is a constant idea in the minds of some  leftist leaders. In another meeting with you, I reiterated that  this idea is being expressed by one of the main exponents of the  Albanian left that we would like to hold elections on 23 March.  This formula clearly shows their extraordinary zest for power  and a conversion of power into an aim. This expresses old  careerist ambitions and a non-adaption to the loss of power. As  for the relation to and victory of this or that party, I think  that they are completely... [changes thought] First, every  victory of a party is determined by votes from the people. I am  sure that with Mr. Papandreou's government, we will develop  normal and friendly relations. Albania has been and will remain  outside ideological friendships.    [Unidentified correspondent] How do you assess the results  of Ibrahim Rugova in France, and what role do you think Albanian  policy has played in this framework? Do you think that the  Zhirinovskiy phenomenon is spreading in East Europe as it is  presented or is it part of a temporary phenomenon in the Soviet  crisis?    [Berisha] I have always greeted and continue to greet the  invitation that the French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe,  forwarded to Mr. Rugova. I consider as very important the  establishment of a dialogue between the legitimate  representatives of the people of Kosova with the EC member  countries and the EC main countries, as well as with other  countries. I think that the French Government, the government  of Mr. Balladur, has already given new dimensions to the problem  of Albanians in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkan crisis.    Concerning Zhirinovskiy, this phenomenon is as invented as  it is dangerous and as mystic as it is real. In my opinion,  Yeltsin won in the last elections. Through the Russian  Constitution, President Yeltsin was able to mark a historic  victory for the Russian people. The Russian political scene,  however, has historically had its mystic aspects. [words  indistinct] Thus, even Zhirinovskiy in this [words indistinct]  is a mystic phenomenon in politics or rather [words indistinct]  in a posttotalitarian society. What exactly does he represent?  He represents the displacement from one extreme to another of a  large psychology or rather a large mass of people with a  totalitarian psychology -- that is, a mass of people who,  unfortunately, have been embodied with and are still not  liberated from the totalitarian psychology. They were  transferred from supporters of, let us say, the left-wing  extreme into supporters of the right-wing extreme.    Despite the present results, I think that Zhirinovskiy is  and  should be a strong political signal for the West. This farmer  is seeking more powerful support from the democratic forces. To  be honest, the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon has more of an emphasis  in Russia than in another country because in every kind of  situation, rich or not, Russia is a very powerful factor, not  only in Europe but worldwide. Russia is a large country that  plays a great role. It cannot be judged simply on whether it  produced wheat this year or not. Thus, the development of  democracy in Russia is extremely important for Europe, as well  as the world.    Is it possible that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon could be  repeated in Eastern Europe? It could be repeated but not in a  Russian context. If we were to analyze or take the moment  [words indistinct] from the left to the right of a mass of  people who are still preserving the totalitarian psychology,  this is justifiable because the totalitarian society in Russia  was the oldest in Europe; it was 70 years old. That is why the  liberation from the totalitarian psychology is more slow. In  this aspect, I do not think that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon  will gain any strength, not even in Russia. The gradual  liberation of people from the totalitarian psychology will cause  Zhirinovskiy to rely on them. This phenomenon will not develop  in other European countries. It can appear, but it will not  develop.    [Pellumb Baci, Deutsche Welle] Pellumb Baci of DEUTSCHE  WELLE. Mr. President [words indistinct] you are insisting that  the embargo against Serbia is essential. On the contrary,  several Western political circles have asked that the embargo be  lifted, almost to the point of completely abolishing it. What  are the real chances of both attitudes, and what will be the  consequences if the embargo is abolished? [passage omitted]    [Berisha] We are insisting that the embargo against Serbia  be maintained in order to prevent the conflict from spreading to  the Balkans. The truth is that the embargo is, perhaps, the  only Security Council resolution to be carried out, not exactly  in full but in approximately full efficiency. For all analysts,  there is no doubt that this embargo plays a role in weakening  Belgrade's aggressive potential. To reward Milosevic by  abolishing the embargo and asking him to give back the occupied  territories would, in my opinion, create the precedence of  occupying other territories and setting up another chain of  rewards and compromises that could be dangerous for the Balkans  and Europe. The embargo was inflicted as a result of Belgrade's  aggressive policy. It was not an expression of revenge by a  country against Serbia or the Serbian people. It was a  punishment for the aggressive policy that the Serbian leadership  followed in the Balkans.    What are the chances? It is difficult to determine what the  chances are. However, the danger and the consequences of  abolishing the embargo could be very serious. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] As BBC reported, Mr. Papandreou  greeted Albanians on the New Year. How do you feel about this?  The second question concerns foreign investments. How is the  present situation and what are the prospects?    [Berisha] In response to the first question, although it is  a news [word indistinct] a wish from a friendly country or a  country with which we should develop friendly relations is  always welcomed. Of course, there is no doubt that we have had  our problems, but the neighboring countries and all other  countries are important for us.    We will be loyal to the principle of reciprocity in our  policies. This is and will be the main principle of our foreign  policy. We are offering honest cooperation and sincere  relations to our neighbors. This is a confident road of  cooperation with Albania or enhancing cooperation with Albania.  Every other attempt will only fail. All those who, through  other forms or methods, tried to condition or impose their ideas  on Albania have made and are still making mistakes and have  failed and still continue to fail. Albania has been and will be  open. On the basis of this principle, it will establish  relations with all countries and will consider as a friend the  one who is interested in a sincere friendship. It will know to  be neutral toward the one who wishes to be neutral, and it will  know to disgust everyone that will try to disgust her. Thus, in  our relations with neighbors and far-away countries, the main  principle will be that of reciprocity. We offer honest  cooperation to the others and we ask the same thing from them.    As for foreign investments, I think that this extremely  important knot is heading toward a solution. There were  difficulties concerning the legislative, psychological, and  regional orders. On this occasion, I am appealing once again to  Albanians to demonstrate that friendly potential they have in  their soul to foreign investors. We should keep in mind that  forming partnerships with foreigners is a very important when it  comes to accelerating the country's development. In this  respect, we will further improve our legislation next month.  The Law on Foreign Investments is among the best, and  parliament recently passed two very important amendments -- the  price of land, and I hope parliament will approve the sale of  land, and the price of agricultural land.    Finally, a great possibility for investments will be the  application of securities and the creation of markets. They  will grant the opportunity to Albanians to become partners and  participate in these processes, either in creating joint  ventures with them or buying the enterprises. Thus, the  creation of securities and their application will bring about a  powerful stimulus in attracting foreign investments, because  foreign investors definitely prefer the individual more than the  state. This is quite normal. The private individual in Albania  has had many limited opportunities. The securities will  increase these opportunities by a certain percentage. Thus,  this year cannot end with forecasts; the successes are much  better than can be imagined. We have $200 million worth of  investment. In fact, we have already signed contracts for next  year, which can possibly double this amount in ore industry and  other fields.    [Unidentified correspondent] [passage omitted] What  concrete successes has Albania achieved this year in domestic  and foreign fields? What main goals do you plan to achieve next  year in domestic and foreign policy?    [Berisha] Regarding Albania's concrete successes this year,  I can summarize them and say that politically, Albania has made  confident steps toward its integration in international  institutions and countries of Europe and toward a further  affinity with other countries, including your country [as heard]  as well. The visit of your foreign minister is a remarkable  event and has rendered an indisputable contribution and in the  new relations we plan to establish with your big country. I can  say that there were great achievements in the legislative field  as well. The greatest of all is undoubtedly the Charter on  Human Rights and Freedoms. It is a monument of the right in  European standards. Of the same importance are laws on foreign  investments, banks, privatization, the status of persecutees and  prisoners, and a series of other institutions. Another  achievement is the increase of production. I think that this  marks a great success for Albania.    Considering next year, we hope to wisely use the impetus of  freedom. Albania is experiencing a moment of impetus, and this  should be used as wisely and rationally as possible. Thus, next  year, we hope to achieve good results concerning the large-scale  privatization of medium and large enterprises. Privatization  marked new achievements last year and this year. Out of 600  enterprises, more than 500 have been privatized. The land is  privatized as are the houses. However, the use of securities  will grant great possibilities to the enterprises privatized on  a large scale. I consider this to be the most important problem  next year.    Of course, the opening and integration of Albania in Europe  and the international community is and remains another constant  goal of ours. I have stressed over and over that Albania will  strictly adhere to the principal of reciprocity.    The solution of the Balkan crisis and national question is  another priority of our foreign policy. In this framework, I  think that 1992 marked another level concerning the issue of  Albanians in the former Yugoslavia and the Albanian national  question. Europe is finally convinced that the problem of  Kosova is an international question. Thus, it is necessary that  Albanian political forces and the Albanian Government be more  active and more energetic in their dialogues with international  community governments in explaining the truth that was darkened  by history and half a century of Greater Serbian propaganda. At  the same time, while solving this problem, it is necessary for  Albania to remain loyal to the agreements it has signed and show  that it is a serious constructive partner. The acceptance of  Albania's stabilizing role in the Balkans is undoubtedly the one  proof that Albanians carry more weight in the dialogue with the  international community in solving these problems.

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Warburg wins Railtrack mandate SG Warburg has beaten other investment banks including Morgan Stanley, the bank with which it planned to merge until last week, in the competition to advise the UK government on the privatisation of Railtrack. The government is to announce shortly that it has appointed Warburg as adviser and global co-ordinator of the share sale. The sale is expected to value Railtrack, which runs British Rail's track, signalling and stations, at up to Pounds 5bn. The government is expected to sell between 51 per cent and 100 per cent of Railtrack in a public offering in spring 1996. The company's assets include 10,200 miles of railway track, 2,500 stations, and 9,000 bridges and viaducts. Bankers said the task of privatising Railtrack was extremely complex because of the age and nature of its assets. The mandate was likely to put at risk the reputation of the adviser, but bolster it if completed successfully. Warburg beat a joint bid by Morgan Stanley and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, and bids from Kleinwort Benson, and groups led by Schroders and Samuel Montagu. The banks on the shortlist made presentations on Friday. Samuel Montagu has given strategic advice to the government on Railtrack until now. The firm said it would continue to provide some high-level strategic advice on the government's rail privatisation programme. The BZW-Morgan Stanley alliance is part of a trend toward joint bids for important privatisation mandates. BZW and Kleinwort Benson joined forces to gain the role of adviser on privatisation of the power generating companies. The Department of Transport nor Warburg would not confirm the appointment yesterday, but banks involved in the bidding said they had been told that Warburg had won. The department said an announcement would be made soon. The appointment will give Warburg, which was adviser and global co-ordinator on the last two British Telecom share sales, a boost amid speculation that the merger collapse has distracted it and helped rivals to win business. Executives are thought to be particularly pleased that they beat a combined approach from BZW and Morgan Stanley, because it means the government has accepted the view that Warburg has sufficient distribution strength in the US. US firms have competed strongly for European privatisation mandates because of US distribution strength. But a smaller slice of Railtrack equity is expected to be sold in the US than the 20 per cent of the third BT sale. Morgan Stanley has won, or been only narrowly beaten in several privatisation 'beauty contests' between banks since appointing Mr Francis Maude, a former financial secretary in the government, to head its privatisation unit. It was last week appointed to advise the government on its golden share in the National Grid, a success which it cited as testament to its European business. This came under scrutiny during negotiations on a merger with Warburg. Sale faces court test, Page 7</p>

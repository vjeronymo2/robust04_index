			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Harassment To Hamper Free, Fair Election--"The harassment  and  intimidation of National Party [NP] and Democratic Party  supporters in townships across the country poses perhaps the  biggest threat to a free and fair election," writes Kaizer  Nyatsumba in his "One in Your Eye" column on page 12 of  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 31 January. "The ANC  [African National Congress]--now seen by many as a  government-in-waiting--has a deep interest in a free and fair  election." When the ANC obtains its "landslide victory many  psephologists believe it is heading for, its opponents must not  be able to challenge the outcome of the election on the grounds  that they could not reach certain parts of the country during  their campaigning because of intimidation."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Election `Show Business' Begins--National Party leader and  state president, F.W. de Klerk, "has taken the bull by the horns  and is ringing bells as he goes into black areas to tell them  that the National Party has changed," notes a page-10 editorial  in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 31 January. Mandela also  took "a colourful train ride from Johannesburg station to Nasrec  to launch the ANC's election manifesto." SOWETAN warns the  public to be careful of this "show business" and more so when  supporters' employers "bus them to rallies and buy them lunch  and party hats." Voters should "demand" that all political  parties "put their cards on the table on real concerns --  housing, jobs and schools, and most importantly, how to achieve  peace." "The ANC has led the way with its manifesto. This and  other manifestos must be studied carefully before important,  historical decisions are made."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   `Alarm Bells' Over ANC Martials at Polling Booths -- "The  type of intimidation President F.W. de Klerk had to contend with  on his election campaign of the Transvaal this weekend,  especially from ANC ranks, raises the urgent question of whether  a free and fair election is really possible in South Africa at  this stage," begins a page-22 editorial in Afrikaans in  Johannesburg RAPPORT on 30 January. "Earlier this week the ANC  announced that it wants to deploy approximately 40,000 so-called  peace martials, in ANC uniforms, at polling booths. This alone  should set alarm bells ringing for all those who fear  intimidation and confrontation on voting day." "Murder and  mayhem has reached such alarming proportions that several black  townships, housing millions of voters, is completely out of  bounds to certain political parties." "If the state president  with all his security finds it difficult to reach the voters,  what will the fate be of candidates and organizers who have to  embark on door to door campaigning as the election draws  nearer." "After so many years Mr. Nelson Mandela has not yet  succeeded in stopping his supporters from committing acts of  violence." "How many non-ANC supporters will dare to make their  way through rows of ANC `peacekeepers' to vote at the polls. It  is obvious that the election cannot be postponed, but opponents  of the ANC should guard against being forced to `get the  election behind them, no matter how it proceeds.'"  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   ANC Supporters at Polling Booths Not  Acceptable--Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 27 January cautions in a page-10  editorial: "The ANC's plan to deploy about 40,000 of its  so-called peace keepers in ANC uniforms near polling booths on  election day `to see to it that the routes are open' is a recipe  for intimidation and confrontation. If the ANC expects people  to swallow its lame excuse about the deployment of these people,  they are mistaken. Ask any victim of intimidation what a simple  sideways glance can mean once the order has gone out from the  `comrades' about what blacks can or cannot do." "This plan is  nothing but a transparent and calculated strategy to try to  intimidate people against exercising their democratic right on  polling day. It makes no sense to deploy masses of people in  party colors for a task which under normal circumstances must be  done by the police and traffic police." "Rather, the ANC should  do what the National Party is doing, and that is to promise firm  action against any supporters guilty of intimidation or other  methods which can interfere with a free and fair elction. Let  polling day be a day of free choice for all voters, otherwise  the credibility of the election result will be called into  question. Should that hapen, we will face the prospect of the  bloody Angolan path."    Editorial Laments Choice of Peacekeeping Force Head --  Another editorial on page 10 of BEELD says: "Every action of  the National Peacekeeping Force in maintaining peace to ensure a  free election will be watched with eagle eyes. One of the  prerequisites for success is that the force remain impartial.  The composition of the force is aimed at this. So it is a pity  that someone whose name appears on the ANC's list of candidates  in the forthcoming election has been appointed to command the  force. We accept that Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana's military  background makes him a suitabmake it difficult to maintain the  impartial image of the peace force. Since last year Brig.  Ramushwana has been in the news for refusing to pay back 580,000  rands allegedly paid to him incorrectly from the Venda pension  fund. Brig. Ramushwana's appointle appointment. However, his  high political profile, including his position as chief minister  of Venda, will ment was probably the result of a compromise, but  he does not appear to be the correct choice for such a sensitive  position. The peace force needs to be cedible both in  conception and birth."</p>

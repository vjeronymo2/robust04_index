			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Czeslaw Rychlewski: "Reprivatization--Difficult </F> Comebacks"]    [Text] Every government of the Third Polish Republic  avoided implementing reprivatization by saying it had other,  more important issues with which to deal. Naturally, there was  just one reason: They wanted to prevent stirring up social moods  against the backdrop of possible conflicts between the former  owners and the new users, and also given the issue of burdens on  the budget.    A draft reprivatization law prepared by the Ownership  Transformations Ministry headed by Janusz Lewandowski, in  cooperation with the Consultative Council for Reprivatization,  was the one that was the most likely candidate for being  submitted to a vote in the Sejm. Council Chairman Krzysztof  Laszkiewicz says: "A year ago, we reached a consensus. The  draft law was designed in a way that would prevent placing a  burden on the budget and that would prevent taking anything out  of anybody's pocket. Out of its 80 provisions, as many as 19  related to the protection of third parties, which means they  were intended to prevent possible conflicts. Besides, the law  treated all former owners in the same way."  <H5>  Chances and Nuances </H5>   The draft law, the final stages of which were interrupted by  the parliament's dissolution, provided for three forms of  returning property that had been nationalized in the period of  the Polish People's Republic [PRL]: return of property in its  natural form, return in the form of substitute property, and  return in the form of reprivatization coupons for which one  could acquire shares in companies subject to privatization, as  well as immovable property owned by the State Treasury, such as  apartments.    So former owners faced the prospect of regaining as much of  the property that had been taken away by the PRL as possible.  Both those who were deprived of property in violation of the  law in effect in the PRL and those who fell victim to legally  implemented nationalization measures were supposed to be treated  on equal footing. So it is no wonder that, when Suchocka's  government was heading for a fall, the Union of Real Politics  approached the reprivatization issue as a bargaining chip in the  no-confidence vote. The party's offer--to support the  government in return for a speedy vote on the reprivatization  law--was rejected, and rumor has it that the offer did not even  reach all those concerned (a certain moral authority, Lech  Prochno-Wroblewski says, assured that the law was blocked).    The law in this shape and form, which is satisfactory to  former owners, raised the doubts of both politicians and the  public. The Catholic right wing raised the point that the  property had often been acquired in a manner that could not be  described as completely honest. The left wing, on the other  hand, was trying to use the argument that, after several  decades, workers have a right to regard themselves as owners of  the enterprises in which they had invested their labor.  Journalists reminded everyone that, in the PRL period, losses  were suffered not just by owners of factories or of real estate  holdings, but also by many ordinary citizens who were illegally  arrested, deprived of educational opportunities, or denied  passports, just to name a few injustices. If all of them  decided to demand that the Third Republic compensate them for  losses suffered, the state's finances would face the danger of  disaster.    Members of the Consultative Council for Reprivatization,  however, argued that a return of property to its owners is the  simplest form of reinstating a capitalist ownership structure  that would not be excessively expensive for the state.  Returning property in its natural form would apply mainly to  small enterprises that currently are often being neglected or  that have been devastated. The return of the owners was  supposed to reinstate economic efficiency to enterprises. It  was also argued that the same type of outcome should result from  taking over substitution property, of which there is plenty in  Poland and for which no owner can be found in many cases, even  for a symbolic 1 zloty. Opponents, on the other hand, argued  that there are no such guarantees because the former owners  currently have no money, which means that they have no resources  with which to invest, while possible heirs often have no idea of  business dealings. Examples of enterprises going bankrupt  shortly after their former owners were reinstated were cited.   <H5>    A Change of Course </H5>   The draft law, which had not seen a vote because of the  parliament's dissolution, returned to the Second Term Sejm in a  slightly modified version and as an initiative coming from 79  Sejm deputies. Members of associations grouping former owners  say they had had reason to believe that the government would  support this version of the law. But what really happened was  that there occurred a change of course a month ago. As a  result, according to Tadeusz Koss, a spokesman for the president  of the Polish Union of Real Estate Owners, the current  worker/peasant government legitimized the nationalization that  another worker/peasant government had implemented before.    The decision to prepare a governmental draft law was made at  a session of the Council of Ministers in April. The chief of  the Ownership Transformations Ministry was given just a few  weeks in which to come up with the draft. It is known right now  that the draft differs substantially from the Sejm deputies'  draft, to the disadvantage of former owners.    First of all, claims are to be limited to cases of violation  of the legal system in effect in the PRL in the 1944-58 period.  The draft provides for reimbursement in the form of  reprivatization coupons, but not up to the full amount of the  value of the property concerned. Only owners of illegally  nationalized property worth up to 1 billion zlotys would receive  their equivalents in the form of coupons. With regard to the  remaining owners, a regression scale will be applied. The  possibility of returning some property in its natural form,  which was suggested during last week's session of the Council of  Ministers' Economic Committee, has not been settled yet. This  would apply first of all to small enterprises loosely tied to  the agricultural sector.    According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw  Kaczmarek, the government, while working on the alternative  draft, had to take into account the effects of the  reprivatization law on the budget and also had to see to it that  the legal provisions do not cause new grievances. Similar  solutions, Kaczmarek stated, were adopted in other postsocialist  countries, such as Hungary. Both draft laws will be debated by  the Sejm in late May/early June. There is no doubt in the minds  of the former owners that the governmental draft law will obtain  a majority.  <H5>  The State as the Accused </H5>   The Council of Ministers' decision raised an enormous  commotion among former owners. Very strong words were voiced in  assessments of the governmental draft. Krzysztof Laszkiewicz  pointed out that the law in its new form will deprive of their  rights those who were able to execute their claims based on the  Code of Administrative Procedure. Up to now, courts have  recognized applications for reimbursements worth a total of 690  billion zlotys, and these amounts have not been paid out by the  budget. Those whose property was taken away from them in  violation of the legal system do not need the law at all.    According to Lech Prochno-Wroblewski, the draft law prepared  by the government is of a partial nature and therefore will  settle nothing and nobody will benefit. He also warns that the  500,000 former owners will, from now on, unanimously act to the  right wing's advantage because they convinced themselves that  heirs to robbers will not give anything back.    On the other hand, Miroslaw Szypowski, chairman of the  Polish  Union of Real Estate Owners, says that applications will be sent  out en masse to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva, to  debate the rights of former owners whose property interests  suffered. The committee's task is to guard the observance of  ownership rights, based on the UN Charter that Poland has  signed. Says Szypowski: "Verdicts may result in adjudication of  many trillions of zlotys, and the Polish state will be the  accused."</p>

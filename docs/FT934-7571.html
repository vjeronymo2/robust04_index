			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: DTI given powers to abolish 'red tape' - De-regulation MR JOHN MAJOR said yesterday the government would 'sweep away red tape' by repealing legislation in the biggest package of de-regulation since the fifties. The de-regulation bill will give sweeping powers to the Department of Trade and Industry to abolish hundreds of regulations without having to refer to parliament. Labour yesterday criticised the government for trying to extend the power of the executive by seeking to repeal existing instruments without specifying in advance the legislation covered. It also fears that the government will try to use a so-called Henry VIII clause - allowing ministers to repeal primary legislation by order. The clause gets its name by providing dictatorial powers similar to those of the Tudor king. Charter 88, the constitutional pressure group, said contemplation of the Henry VIII clause 'heralded an elective tyranny' and warned of a new authoritarianism in government. Mr Stephen Alembritis of the Federation of Small Businesses said the far-reaching powers were the key to giving momentum to the de-regulation process. He said: 'The de-regulation bill has been a long time coming, but its inclusion in the speech reflects the priority the prime minister has given to the initiative.' Consumer organisations warned, however, that cutting red tape could sweep away laws which protect health and safety, enforce standards across industries and provide essential information for consumers. 'If ministers can do things virtually by decree,' said Mr Phillip Cullum of the Consumers' Association, 'there will be a temptation to act without consulting all interested parties.' Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, urged the government to ensure that its de-regulation initiative continued beyond the bill by taking other steps such as simplifying the valued added tax system and strengthening the machinery for deregulation. 'One bill cannot put right the accumulated mistakes of decades and even centuries of legislation,' he warned. He also called for abolition of the statutory audit requirement for small firms. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, told union members in Newcastle yesterday: 'Safety laws and regulations are not red tape or burdens on business, they are the hallmark of civilisation and contribute to high quality businesses.' Seven business task forces are reviewing all regulations in everything from health and safety rules, which label some common household products as dangerous substances, to the regulations setting standards for outside recreation. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the bill would lead to an accumulation of changes and a significant cost reduction to business. The bill will also include measures to remove obstacles to market-testing of civil service work and contracting out in local government. These will make it easier for ministers and local authorities to delegate powers to contractors where that is barred by legislation.</p>

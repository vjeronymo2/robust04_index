			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Pakistan will rejoin the British Commonwealth within the next three months, 17  years after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's father took the country out of the  group, Pakistan's ambassador to London said. Shaharyar Khan said the  Commonwealth secretary general, Shridath Ramphal, told Bhutto during talks in  London that there is unanimous agreement within the group that Pakistan should  rejoin. Pakistan is expected to take up the issue before the Commonwealth  summit in Malaysia in October. "Except for the formalities, we are members,"  Khan said. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, broke with the Commonwealth in  1972 after leading members recognized the breakaway state of Bangladesh,  formerly East Pakistan.  </P></p>

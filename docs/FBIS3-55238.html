			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Comments by Petr Bryhadzin, deputy chairman of the Party of </F> People's Accord Council, edited by Tatstsyana Lazowskaya: "The  Legislature -- Mirror of Society"]    [Text] The results of the elections in Russia were not  unexpected. We could foresee that slogans of Zhirinovskiy's  party would be approved by poor people who comprise the majority  of the Russian population -- some 70 percent. By the way, such  populist ideas will always attract simple people even if they  are pronounced by the devil itself. "Russia's Choice," however,  has not received the votes it could receive because the  elections had not been organized properly. In my opinion, they  were let down by their self-assurance of being the only  candidates to the new power organs. As for me, the situation in  Russia is not tragical at all: The legislature's membership  perfectly demonstrates the situation in the state. It is  evident that the counterbalance of forces in the Russian Duma  will spark heated debates. Meanwhile, the Russian president,  who is authorized with great powers, will not allow the  opposition forces to show their actual force. In addition, the  State Duma will hardly affect the state policy of the Yeltsin  team.    At the same time, we should not underestimate the elections  in Russia. It is symbolic that Russian super-radicals received  the majority of seats in the legislature. We should remember  that such things could happen in Belarus as well. It seems  likely that independent candidates of the Zhirinovskiy type --  at least four in number -- will appear. The victory of the  Zhirinovskiy party will cause a chain reaction. This fact  should be considered during the election campaign in Belarus.    As for the Party of People's Accord, we have got some  electoral experience. We have nominated First Deputy Foreign  Minister Tarazevich to the Belarusian Supreme Soviet in the  Zhodino electoral district. However, the elections failed due  to the fact that only 46 percent of the voters participated in  them. In my opinion, a 50 percent voting limit should be  annulled otherwise elections will never be held.    I cannot assess the report presented by People's Deputy  Lukashenko. Indeed, corruption is eating our society from top  to bottom. The facts revealed by Lukashenko were not surprising  neither for politicians, nor for law enforcement officers who  provided the deputy with this information. To my mind, Eduard  Shirkovskiy, chairman of the Belarusian Committee for State  Security, or the State Office of the Prosecutor, or at least the  Supreme Soviet Control Chamber should have reported on this  issue. Furthermore, in order to account for the accusations, the  officials whose names are mentioned in this report should have  secured access to these facts before they were brought to the  Supreme Soviet deputies. We should learn to behave in a  civilized manner.    I do not oppose the activities of this legislative  commission. This commission should investigate the moral-ethical  side of the issue, and coordinate its work with the activities  of law enforcement bodies. Only law enforcement officers can  assess and make conclusions on the issue.</p>

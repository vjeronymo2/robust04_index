			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> SAFETY OF TRACK IS QUESTIONED AFTER MANY BREAKDOWNS  </P> <P> Sunday morning, before the Yellow Ribbon Invitational at Santa Anita, Neil  Papiano, one of the owners of Baldomero, was advised by a high-profile  California breeder not to run the 5-year-old mare.  </P> <P> "He thought there were problems with the track," said Papiano, who declined to  identify the breeder.  </P> <P> Trainer Bill Shoemaker ran Baldomero in the $400,000 stake, and it was the last  race of her life. On the clubhouse turn, the Irish-bred's left foreleg snapped.  Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye pulled her up, and minutes later, with the leg  hopelessly shattered, a veterinarian gave Baldomero a lethal injection.  </P> <P> Baldomero, who at Del Mar had given Shoemaker his first stakes victory as a  trainer, was insured for $300,000, but her owners would gladly give up the  money if they could have her back to run again.  </P> <P> "I couldn't go out there (when Baldomero was injured)," said Ted Goldberg, one  of Papiano's partners in ownership of the horse. "Both sesamoids were gone, and  the cannon bone was showing through the skin. It must have been horrible."  </P> <P> There were so many breakdowns during the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita that  about halfway through the 27-day season, which ended Monday, several owners  asked their trainers to use caution in running their horses.  </P> <P> Reluctant Guest, an Eclipse Award candidate, also suffered a leg injury in the  Yellow Ribbon and probably won't race again until next spring. In Monday's  Burke Handicap, Great Communicator, winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes in  1988, was destroyed after breaking down.  </P> <P> Trainer Charlie Whittingham twice scratched horses from grass races during the  final Oak Tree weekend, not running She's a V.P. in the California Cup Distaff  and keeping Live The Dream out of the Burke. Live The Dream is being saved for  the fall season at Hollywood Park, where he has shown a preference for the  turf.  </P> <P> Whittingham, who was at the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park Oct. 27 when Go For  Wand and two other stakes horses had to be destroyed, said racing has had  enough negative publicity lately and preferred not to comment about the  problems at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Exact figures on the number of breakdowns during morning training hours and  afternoon racing at the meeting were not available Tuesday. On one Sunday,  however, three horses broke down in races on the main track and had to be  destroyed, and in the Volante Handicap on grass the same day, Mehmetori  suffered a tendon injury that might end his career.  </P> <P> "That was a day," said Ray Baran, who was the track veterinarian for the Oak  Tree meeting. "Besides those four, we wound up putting more horses on the vets'  list (making them ineligible to run because of soreness) than on any day I can  ever remember."  </P> <P> Cliff Goodrich, president of Santa Anita, was out of town Tuesday and could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "We've run a lot of races over this track, but I think it's in fine condition,"  said Ray Rogers, executive vice president of the Oak Tree Racing Assn. "We've  taken every possible precaution to make the track safe. We tested both surfaces  for resilience every day of the meeting."  </P> <P> A year ago, Santa Anita spent about $3 million to rebuild its oft-maligned  grass course. Included was the installation of a mesh material called Netlon,  which was designed to reduce the number of divots. Before this year's Oak Tree  season, Santa Anita spent another $1.8 million to rebuild the hillside section  of the grass course.  </P> <P> Track and world records immediately started falling. Even lesser horses seem  capable of running exceptional times. On Oct. 13, in an allowance race,  Shirkee, a 5-year-old Shoemaker-trained gelding, ran the approximately 6 1/2  furlongs down the hill in 1:11 4/5, equaling a record that was set 20 years  ago.  </P> <P> Is the course so fast that it imperils safety?  </P> <P> "What Santa Anita has done with its turf course was very creative, but it was  not the thing to do," said one owner who declined to be identified. "The grass  is in horrible condition. It's harder than the main track. It's like concrete."  </P> <P> Trainer Doug Peterson was surprised by the appearance of the Santa Anita grass  course. "It's showing wear and tear," he said. "And this is after a meeting  that hasn't been that long."  </P> <P> Race tracks have always been easy targets for criticism. Belmont Park is under  fire, not necessarily because of Go For Wand's breakdown in the Breeders' Cup,  but because of all the other injuries there this season.  </P> <P> When the Breeders' Cup was held at Gulfstream Park in 1989, some trainers,  dissatisfied with the inconsistency of the main track's surface, shipped their  horses to nearby Hialeah for prerace workouts.  </P> <P> The deaths of Go For Wand, Great Communicator and others have provided a sorry  climax to a year in which Sunday Silence, the horse of the year; Easy Goer, and  Criminal Type were retired because of leg problems.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's the tracks, I think it's year-round racing," said Charlie  Rose, assistant trainer of Plenty of Grace, the 56-1 upset winner of the Yellow  Ribbon. "It used to be that a trainer had the time to turn out horses for two  or three months before bringing them back. Horses might not run as many races  as they used to, but they're sure in training a lot longer. Now a rest for a  horse amounts to what we call 'light training,' which still isn't as beneficial  as turning a horse out."  </P></p>

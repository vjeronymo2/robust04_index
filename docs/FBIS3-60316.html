They  undertake to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases, but  fail to call for a CO2/energy tax as a tool to reach that goal.  The EC environment ministers did agree, however, that in five  years' time no more than half of the packaging waste should end  up on the garbage dump. By then at least one-quarter of the  garbage should be recycled.    The "UN Framework Agreement on Climate Change" was solemnly  signed in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The signing parties  committed themselves to stabilize the emission of gases causing  the greenhouse effect. On a previous occasion, the EC member  states had already agreed to stabilize this emission on the 1990  level by the year 2000. Several countries, including Belgium,  had committed themselves to reduce the CO2 emission by the turn  of the century. In a common statement, six member states (the  Benelux countries, Germany, Denmark, and Italy) had opted for  the implementation of a CO2/energy tax as a tool to meet their  commitments. They had linked the ratification of the Rio  Convention to a go-ahead for the European environment tax.    Yesterday, this linkage was dropped after all. It was merely  agreed that a whole range of additional tools must be created,  and that the talks on the Commission's proposal regarding the  implementation of a European CO2/energy tax must be concluded by  the end of 1994. At present, some 40 countries have ratified  the Rio climate convention. The treaty will become effective as  soon as 50 countries have ratified it.    The EC environment ministers also reached an agreement on  the  management of packaging waste. Five years after the directive  has come into effect, the member states must valorize at least  50 and at the most 65 percent of their packaging waste. Between  25 and 40 percent of the latter must be recycled. Countries  such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark might aim at  higher recycling criteria, providing they do not disturb the  single market and do not jeopardize the directive's  implementation in other EC member states. So Germany is no  longer entitled to merely dump its waste in neighboring  countries. The waste directive must now return to the European  Parliament for a second reading, and must then be resubmitted to  the ministers for approval.</p>

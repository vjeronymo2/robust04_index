			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 3 (AFP) -- France and the United States  agreed Tuesday [3 May] on the urgent need to organize a  ministerial meeting on Bosnia due to the recent spread of  fighting, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher agreed on the move during a telephone  conversation Tuesday morning, he said, giving no details of  where or when such a meeting might take place.    He said an urgent meeting is needed in particular because of  the increased threat of conflict outside the six UN-designated  safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina.    "The prevention of new slippages...necessitates the  deployment on the ground of new protection forces outside the  security zones established by the UN Security Council."    He said a switch from "respecting Security Council  resolutions to Atlantic Alliance decisions" was required, in an  apparent reference to the possibility of using force.    Concern has been focussed in recent days on the Brcko  corridor in northeastern Bosnia, where Serbs are trying to widen  their supply route between Serbia and northwest Bosnia.    Duque said there was "a worrying concentration of troops  from  both sides" in the region, adding that talks were continuing on  a possible increase in peacekeeping forces, in particular around  Brcko.    Military analysts predict that Brcko, in a five-kilometre  (three-mile) bottleneck in supply-lines from Serbia to Serb  areas in northwestern Bosnia, will be the next target of Serb  offensive.</p>

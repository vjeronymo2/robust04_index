The drug was found packed in several  hundred parcels tin-veiled [as received], inscripted in Italian  language, and buried in the garden.    The police discovered also under the kitchen floor of a home  in another village in the Maramures County a Dutch made vacuum  packing machine suspected to be employed in drugs packing.    While continuing investigations in this area at the  north-western border of Romania, the police uncovered an entire  ring of drugs smugglers. Some other inhabitants of the same  county are suspected to be involved in trafficking a great deal  of hashish coming from Lebanon to Constanta, Romanian port at  the Black Sea. After a short leg to the packing machine, the  hashish was being sent to the Netherlands, crossing the Romanian  border in trucks loaded with apples and wine. Over 5 tonnes of  hashish are believed to have been conveyed to the Netherlands in  three trucks. The investigation continues with some of the  suspects placed under arrest.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Surveyors' orders point to upturn Further evidence that construction activity is on the brink of recovery emerged yesterday with the publication of a survey of industry order books. This showed that order books of quantity surveyors fell 10 per cent last year although the rate of decline slowed considerably during the final three months. Much of the work done by quantity surveyors occurs early in the building process and so provides a good guide to future construction orders. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which carried out the survey, said the industry was suffering from overcapacity. This was likely to cause further job losses 'as it continues to adjust to lower workload levels', said Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at quantity surveyors EC Harris and construction spokesman for the institution. He added: 'Intense competition for work combined with rising material costs will add further pressure to building firms over the next six to nine months.' The institution said the workload of surveyors fell 3 per cent in the final quarter of last year compared with the previous three months.

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT, REJECTION OF SALE PROPOSAL MARK BATTLE FOR HOLLYWOOD PARK  </P> <P> The battle for control of Hollywood Park was active on two fronts Wednesday:  </P> <P>  -- The track's realty board rejected a proposal by the operating company to  put the track up for sale.  </P> <P>  -- Earlier in the day, the operating company filed a lawsuit against three of  the track's largest shareholders, accusing them of conspiring to take over  control.  </P> <P> The realty company's rejection of the sale proposal, by a 7-0 vote, was not  surprising, because Warren Williamson, chairman of realty, had questioned the  timing of a sale in an interview last week, and because the realty board  appears to be controlled by R.D. Hubbard, catalyst in the attempt to unseat  Marje Everett as Hollywood Park's chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Hollywood Park Realty controls the 347-acre Inglewood site where the track is  located, and leases it to the Hollywood Park Operating Co.  </P> <P> The operating company's lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court's  Central District of California, names as defendants Hubbard, Tom Gamel and  Harry Ornest. The suit charges that they violated numerous federal laws and  acted together to take control of the track. BILL CHRISTINE  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Trafford Park jobs expansion MORE than 9,500 jobs have been created in Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, in the past five years according to a census of the companies there by the park's development corporation. Trafford Park, Europe's first industrial estate, now houses 1,188 companies, an increase of 460 since 1987. The companies employ 34,492 people - 34 per cent up on the 24,950 of five years ago. The corporation was set up by the government in 1987 to reverse the area's decline. The development corporation has so far invested nearly Pounds 88m of public funds. This works out at about Pounds 9,200 for each extra job, but the private sector has contributed more than six times as much. Some of the jobs have resulted from businesses relocating to north-west England, but 47 per cent of the new companies are either new businesses or branches of companies based elsewhere. There was a 98 per cent response to the survey, so the figures are the most accurate yet to show the effect of a development corporation on the area it is trying to regenerate. Engineering was the biggest sector, with 48 per cent of manufacturing employees. Only 18 per cent of the companies are exporters, but 84 per cent trade directly with others in Trafford Park, suggesting a developing infrastructure of component suppliers. Most companies are relatively small, with 56 per cent employing fewer than 10 people each and 80 per cent having turnover of less than Pounds 10m.</p>

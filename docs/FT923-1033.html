			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Parliament Debates the Economy: Lamont outlines post-crisis agenda DOMESTIC monetary policy will be guided by a range of traditional indicators pending sterling's return to the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons last night. The chancellor said that the existing annual target of between 0 and 4 per cent for narrow money growth would be retained. Other reference points would include broad money, asset prices and the exchange rate itself. The government would also 'continue' with its policy of fully funding the public-sector borrowing requirement. Mr Lamont promised 'shortly' to set out the precise policy guidelines that the government would be pursuing in the wake of the disintegration of its original strategy. In a fighting speech designed to re-establish his authority before a packed Commons, Mr Lamont sought to stress that this week's cut in interest rates did not signify that the government was going soft in the fight against inflation. On the eve of today's meeting of the recently established public expenditure committee at which options for hitting the government's Pounds 244.5bn 1993-94 spending target will be discussed, the chancellor also emphasised that the struggle to impose tight public spending controls would be maintained. The main difference between the two leading political parties lay in Labour's 'addiction to public spending,' he said, in a passage which was particularly well received on the government backbenches. Flanked by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, his Treasury lieutenant, Mr Lamont laid out three conditions which had to be met before sterling could resume its ERM membership. These comprised: the easing of 'current tensions' in the markets; a 'proper' review of 'the whole way the ERM works, including intervention rules, co-operation procedures and obligations placed on those countries at the top and bottom of their permitted bands; and convergence of the British and German economies so that they were 'more in step'. It was essential that Germany was able to reduce interest rates to levels 'more compatible with sustained, non-inflationary growth', he said. In a lengthy attempt to justify his decisions of the past two weeks, the chancellor concluded that he had 'not heard of anything that might have been done or handled differently and produced a different outcome'. To widespread opposition derision, he laid much blame for the speculative turmoil which derailed sterling at the door of Britain's European partners, saying that remarks made by Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, had 'triggered the final irresistible assault' on the pound. The French referendum, he said, had 'given speculators a fixed date against which they could speculate'. The 'unique' event of German reunification had been 'the root cause of the current turbulence.' Concluding with a vitriolic attack on Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, he said his opposite number's idea of long-term strategy was 'thinking up the week's sound-bite a week in advance'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 3 May (INA) -- Sa'd Qasim Hammudi,  secretary general of the Popular Forces Conference [PFC], has  left Baghdad for Rabat to participate in the meetings of the  follow-up and coordination committee of the democratic and  revolutionary dialogue forum, and the seminar on the phenomenon  of terrorism and violence in the Arab world, due to begin there  tomorrow, [4 May].    Sa'd Qasim Hammudi noted that the seminar will discuss the  new world situation, the current Arab situation, human rights,  and the phenomenon of terrorism and violence throughout history.    He said that he has prepared a comprehensive study on  terrorism and the hegemony the United States is exercising on  Iraq, the Arab nation, and the world peoples on the pretext of  the new world order. The study also deals with the comprehensive  embargo that has been imposed on the Iraqi people for more than  44 months.    He added that he will hold meetings and contacts with the  Arab delegations participating in the seminar and the  coordination committee meetings, as well as with Moroccan  popular organizations and parties to explain to them the latest  developments in Iraq's relationship with the UN Security  Council, and the importance of mobilizing all pan-Arab resources  to support Iraq and lift the unjust embargo clamped on its lofty  people.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The spokesman for the chairman of the State Duma,  Dmitriy Biryukov, has said that the appeal by Former Vice  President Aleksandr Rutskoy, made at the opposition rally at  Lubyanka Square on May 9, in which he promised to mark the 50th  anniversary of the victory over fascist Germany by "victory over  the present regime", does not correspond to the "sentiments of  millions of Russians who celebrated the May 9th holiday as a day  of national accord". This is said in the Biryukov's statement  sent to the media.    The spokesman is sure that under the difficult social and  political situation in the country, "one cannot but recollect  the promises given by those who were amnestied by the decision  of the State Duma [no closing quotation mark as received].    He said that some statements made on Victory Day "indicate  that some people forgot their promises."    Biryukov said that the amnesty was not an unconditional  action permitting further statements and actions.    He believes that public statements which could lead to a  violation of the balance in relations between the authorities  and the country's groupings should attract the attention of the  Russian Prosecutor's Office.</p>

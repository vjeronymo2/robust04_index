About 10 of its MP's [member of  parliament] are on the final candidate list of General Constand  Viljoen's Freedom Front. Earlier today CP leader Dr. Ferdie  Hartzenberg said any member who made himself available as a  candidate for the election would automatically lose his CP  membership. Veronica van der Westhuizen reports:    [Begin recording] [Van der Westhuizen] The Freedom Front did  not want to disclose the names of the CP candidates and said it  would do so tomorrow. This move led to a split in the  Conservative Party. One of the suspended CP members, Dr. Pieter  Mulder, said he was very disappointed by the move.    [Mulder] We are really sorry that it happened this way. We  had an agreement yesterday that it was possible to have a double  strategy for people that want to take part in election to prove  the support for self-determination and the other part, and that  we can dab it together and that it would be put on Friday to our  head committees like that, and suddenly there was a change in  plan on the CP side and they just said we are not in the party  anymore.    [Van der Westhuizen] There were no major changes on the  amended National Party lists. Earlier, it was expected that  prominent Inkatha Freedom Party members would be included, also  the African National Congress had no major changes. The future  of the Northwest Christian Democratic Party, of which former  President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana is the leader, is  hanging in the balance. President Mangope said he could not meet  with his parliament to discuss participation in the election.  [end recording]</p>

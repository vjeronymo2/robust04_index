			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Panel censures Fayeds over House of Fraser purchase THE FAYED brothers were publicly censured yesterday by the Takeover Panel for a breach of the Takeover Code during the 1985 acquisition of the House of Fraser stores group, which includes Harrods. The panel said statements made by the Fayeds during the takeover about their business interests and income-generating capacity may have created a misleading impression contrary to general principle 12 of the Code. This requires statements sent to shareholders during the course of a bid to be treated with the highest standards of care and accuracy. The panel made no ruling as to whether the statements were intentionally misleading. The Pounds 615m takeover has been the focus of a long running legal battle between the Fayeds and Mr Tiny Rowland's trading conglomerate Lonrho. Mr Paul Spicer, a director of Lonrho, said last night the panel report was all right as far as it went. 'It's useful to have another authority other than the DTI inspectors say that they misrepresented the truth. That's the right conclusion, but it's a bit weak and so long after the event.' House of Fraser dismissed as 'a minor matter' the public censuring of the Fayeds 7 1/2 years to the day after completion of the takeover. A spokesman said the Fayeds did not accept the panel's verdict as it was based on the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report on the affair, the findings of which were being challenged by the Fayeds before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Fayeds claimed that the statements complained of were merely descriptions of their current business interests and that no inference could be drawn from them as to the source of their wealth or the origin of the funds used to buy the stores group. The panel disagreed. It concluded that references in the initial public statement in November 1984 to the Fayeds' 'wide-spread international interests', when juxtaposed with the view that the acquisition of 29.9 per cent of House of Fraser was 'a logical step in the continuing evolution of these worldwide businesses', implied that the Pounds 138m investment had been financed from the family's worldwide businesses. The panel cleared Kleinwort Benson, the Fayeds' financial advisers at the time, of any breach of the code.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Two Kinds of Time" column by Jonathan Mirsky: "White </F> Paper Is Plain Propaganda"]    [Text] Imagine your average Legco member -- like most of  us averagely decent, averagely cowardly -- with a corner of his  or her heart in which he or she wants to do the right thing.    China, meanwhile, is huffing and puffing that it will blow  Legco down in 1997.    Last Thursday, our modest hero heard Sir Percy Cradock say  on  TV that "Legco had signed its own death warrant" when it  approved the first tranche of Chris Patten's bill.    Was this person, not to mention the umbrella mender and the  cobbler in Sai Kung, really convinced by last week's White Paper  on the 17 Anglo-British negotiations sessions? The British must  hope so: they printed 140,000 copies in Chinese and 60,000 in  English. But the White Paper is only convincing if, as a British  official suggested last week, you take it on faith.    Suppose you are not a devout believer in Britain, often  referred to here as "the two-headed snake"? Suppose you want to  believe that Britain negotiated sincerely and that Beijing's men  stonewalled, but suppose also that you need proof before you  would be willing to enrage Beijing by voting for the rest of the  Patten plan on July 6? There is no evidence in the White Paper;  it is, frankly, a piece of propaganda. This does not mean it is  a lie; it is like the statement of a lawyer who, though he must  not commit perjury, is not required to make the best case for  the other side.    British and Hong Kong officials seem insulted by the  suggestion that the White Paper as it stands is no more to be  relied on than the 10,000-word article that appeared in the  PEOPLE'S DAILY on January 7, which gave China's side of the  collapse of negotiations.    "You mean you think we're the same as the Chinese?" an  incredulous official asked last week when I observed that I  could not "believe" the White Paper. I meant of course "believe  in".    When asked to supply documentation (there exists, afterall,  a  nearly 1,000-page stenographic record of the 17 sessions), the  official said: "But these are confidential diplomatic  documents," -- as if publishing the White Paper has not already  blown the roof off diplomatic niceties.    We don't need the full 1,000 pages. But where the White  Paper makes its most telling charges of Chinese shiftiness or  reneging, our confidence would be boosted by verbatim quotes  showing which Chinese diplomat said what, when he said it, and  when he said the opposite.    Of course, some would say such quotes had been invented. But  most people would not doubt such evidence, unless the Chinese  produced their own and different stenographic record.    If that happened, it would only confirm what the White Paper  and the PEOPLE'S DAILY accounts already indicate -- that (as  some British officials here now concede "in retrospect") there  never was any common ground between the two sides, just a chasm  between different goals and beliefs, which could be spanned only  by flimsy bridges like agreement on lowering the voting age.    Showing extracts from the actual record would expose this  chasm, which is far more important than proving bad faith. The  bad faith, if it exists, is primarily a result of the chasm.  What also hinders understanding is the way the government  managed "to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory" (as one  official put it) after the Legco vote last week.    By Thursday, many Hong Kong journalists -- including those  from the non-Communist Chinese press -- were expressing  scepticism about the White Paper. Those who asked for more  documentation were treated as troublemakers or eccentrics.    The official Hong Kong government press conference on Friday  reminded some of us who have attended similar events in Beijing  that 1997 is only three years away.    Chinese officials commonly preface their reply to a  difficult  follow-up question by saying "It is well known to all that..."  and then repeating their earlier statements.    Last week in Hong Kong, senior officials -- some wearing the  same scornful looks on their faces one recalls from Beijing --  also deflected questions by dismissing them as "speculation" or  with curt instructions to "Read the Letters Patent".    This last came when the officials were asked under what  circumstances Patten and Parliament could refuse to ratify  Legco's vote in July, as Patten hinted last week he might, in  some circumstances, regretfully have to do. What we were told  was that it was "up to the people of Hong Kong", or, again,  "Read the Letters Patent". Is this how the government plans to  respond to Legco members who need to know what might happen if  the council, for example, attempted to pass any of Beijing's  proposals.    What came out last Friday should indeed worry the average  Legco member.    He is pincered between Beijing's promise of revenge and the  threat that Patten and Parliament may reject any bill that does  not meet their purposes.    Appealed to for clarification, a Government House source  sighed. "Oh God, the answer is so simple -- the Governor is the  Queen of Hong Kong."</p>

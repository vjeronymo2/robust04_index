			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: A rival stock exchange - Diary of a Private Investor In a a 1950s TV western series The Cisco Kid, the Kid and his partner, Pancho, 'fought for justice' in New Mexico. Another Cisco is currently fighting for justice but this time for small companies in the UK. The City Group for Smaller Companies has chosen 'Cisco' as its abbreviated name. The group includes stockbrokers, venture capitalists, merchant bankers, and others who believe that a new exchange should be created to trade in the shares of small companies. This new exchange could be run by the London Stock Exchange or by an independent organisation. Will there be a shoot-out in the City? The London Stock Exchange has already announced its intention to close the Unlisted Securities Market 'following an extensive review which concluded that the market's distinct identity had been eroded since 1990 by convergence in the regulations and cost of joining the Official List and the USM.' It is investigating a possible replacement for the USM and has commissioned a market research survey, the results of which should be known in March. Meanwhile, Cisco is looking into ways of organising and financing an independent, smaller companies exchange. It too, expects to produce its findings in March. As a private investor, I would like to see a strong, independent rival to the London Stock Exchange. But I feels it would be a mistake to saddle it with a name such as 'The Enterprise Market'. This seems to be the choice adopted by both parties investigating the need for it. To me, such a name implies that the market will be solely aimed at new enterprises carrying much more risk than other companies. It makes it seem like a junior market from which companies would feel they have to graduate to a full listing. If the new market is used by private investors as very high risk - or, even worse, as a dumping ground for shares which institutional investors might otherwise have difficulty in getting rid of - then it will have no hope of emulating the US-based Nasdaq. Founded in 1971 to cater for small companies, Nasdaq has rapidly grown to become the world's second largest stock market in terms of volumes traded. Companies such as Intel, Apple and Microsoft, which all started on Nasdaq, have not felt the need to 'graduate' to Wall Street. Nasdaq is recognised as a fully-fledged exchange. Indeed, more overseas companies list their American Depository Receipts on Nasdaq than on any other US exchange. When Nasdaq started, it was able to offer something different: fast and efficient electronic share dealing. A new exchange in the UK would not have such a unique selling point because the London Stock Exchange took advantage of Big Bang to follow Nasdaq's example. What, then, could a new UK exchange offer to make it attractive to investors and ensure its financial viability? It could charge much lower fees to companies seeking a stock market listing but it would still need to ensure that not too many crooks found their way in. It would have to organise a proper regulatory system. A new exchange could have much longer trading hours than the London Stock Market. But one of the most attractive selling points could be in settlement systems. With the traumas of Taurus and Crest and having to cope with all manner of vested interests, the London Stock Exchange suffers in ways which ought not to afflict a completely new exchange. All companies quoted on the new market should use a depository system whereby a company - vetted and monitored by the Bank of England - would hold share and bond certificates on behalf of the beneficial owners. The shares would not be registered in 'marking name' (nominees) but in the actual names of the investors concerned. Any investor who wanted a share certificate could get one printed out free by the depository company. The new exchange (and the depository company) should offer much better compensation schemes than are currently available from existing organisations. This would demonstrate to investors that the new market was fully aware of its obligations to provide an honest and efficient service - since automatic compensation would be paid, not only for any losses due to fraud, but also as a result of any hiccups in the system - in much the same way as many utility companies now make payments if they fail to achieve certain specified time targets. New legislation should be introduced to give the new exchange a kick-start. There are a number of companies which are reluctant to gain a full stock market quotation because of the tax situation of current shareholders. The same rules regarding inheritance tax relief and roll-over relief on unquoted and certain other companies should be extended to cover companies quoted on the new exchange. It also seems unfair that a company with a limited track record can come to a market in a blaze of publicity and promote the offer price for its shares while a company that already has a market listing (and a good track record) is unable to advertise that its shares are a bargain at current prices. Companies quoted on the new exchange should be allowed, within reasonable restrictions, to promote their own shares. The new market should also adopt a very high profile and engage in all manner of educational and promotional activities - from direct mail shots to TV advertisements to promote its activities and encourage people to invest in the companies traded on the exchange. The new exchange might then not only improve the current lack of liquidity in the small companies sector but stand a reasonable chance of further expansion and giving investors the opportunity to benefit from the results of genuine competition.</p>

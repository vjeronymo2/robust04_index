			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Tariffs creeping back in Poland THE way Poland's foreign trade policies are formed and implemented has become much more transparent since the return of democratic government in 1989. But former lobbying and decision-making patterns have 'survived to the detriment of efficiency' in state-owned enterprises and banks, according to a report by the Gatt secretariat. Economic and political reforms have been accompanied by substantial trade liberalisation and a reorientation of foreign trade from the former Soviet trade bloc, Comecon, to western markets, especially in the EC. Since August 1991, however, the Polish authorities, faced with the unexpectedly high social costs of transition to a market economy and doubts about the sustainability of reforms, re-introduced protection by eliminating most tariff suspensions, introducing new duties and widening import licensing. The government is also considering an import levy system to protect agriculture, the report says. 'The question must be asked whether the move towards more protection should be interpreted as long-term or as a temporary shift to give breathing space for some sectors.' The report describes the EC association agreement, signed last March, as a 'turning point' which could provide a stable point of orientation in Poland's 'long and difficult transformation process'. But the impact of the 10-year accord is a matter of concern. It says liberalisation is slowest or most limited in sectors such as textiles and clothing, steel and agriculture where Poland seems to have a comparative advantage. It also notes that, conversely, the agreement means 'EC exporters can easily take advantage of reductions in much higher Polish tariffs'.</p>

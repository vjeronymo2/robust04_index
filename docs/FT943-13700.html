			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Finmeccanica - Other companies The Italian state-controlled engineering and defence group today launches what amounts to a partial privatisation of the company, through a L1,700bn (Dollars 1.1bn) rights issue. The issue - priced at L2,100 a share - will reduce the stake of IRI, the state holding company, from 85 per cent to less than 60 per cent. The proceeds will be used to reduce debts and help pay for the acquisition of formerly state-owned defence interests.</p>

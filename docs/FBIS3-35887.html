			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 31, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas told reporters Monday [31 January] that he  will use all of his constitutional rights to preserve a stabile  government and parliament until the very end of their term.    The president said he was surprised by attempts of the  six-seat Social Democratic faction to oust the government.    Brazauskas said the social democrats are either trying to  gain popularity or to clear the way for other political forces.  In his view, the Social Democratic Party can hardly expect  wider representation in government structures.    Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the parliament's rightist  opposition, said the initiative can be discussed only when the  social democrats will show how many members of the ruling  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP] faction have signed  under a petition demanding to take a no confidence vote in the  government. "Otherwise, these are only senseless games or  attempts to score political points," Landsbergis said at a press  conference Monday.    The opposition leader said "the replacement of one LDLP  government by a different LDLP government" would be an advantage  only to the party in power, which, possibly uses the social  democrats for the purpose.    Landsbergis said the ruling party would get an opportunity  to  say that nothing should be expected from a new government for at  least six months. This would be a new possibility for the LDLP  to defend itself against criticism, he said.    Last week, the social democrats proposed to take a no  confidence vote in the government and urged other political  forces to back their initiative.</p>

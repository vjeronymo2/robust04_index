			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Doubts in City will ease, says MacGregor INITIAL DOUBTS in the City about the effectiveness of the Budget will be dispelled as the general election campaign gathers momentum, Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, said yesterday. Replying to taunts from the Labour benches that the City had given the Budget the 'thumbs down,' he said: 'Like all good things people come to appreciate them better the more they study them.' MPs approved the Finance Bill embodying the key Budget proposals after Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs failed in a last-ditch attempt to block the introduction of a 20p lower-rate income tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The relevant clause was approved by a government majority of 182 (325 - 143) and, with the parliamentary guillotine used to curtail debate, the bill was rushed through all stages in just over two hours. The Lords will formally approve the bill on Monday before parliament is dissolved. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, argued that the action taken to restrict debate on the bill reflected the government's desperation 'to get its bribe on the statute book'. He claimed that the City's verdict on the Budget showed that the launch of the Conservative election campaign had stalled. To Labour cheers Mr Cunningham said: 'The rocket motor has simply fizzled out like a damp squib'. He said Labour MPs were opposed to the 20p lower rate band because they believed any money available 'in these desperately difficult financial circumstances' should go into investment. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, recalled that Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, had advocated a lower rate income tax band as recently as last month. By opposing the 20p band, he said, Labour MPs were sacrificing their aims on the 'altar of a false and superficial commitment to fiscal probity'. Mr Mellor confirmed that if the government secured a renewed mandate a second finance bill running to 75 pages of legislation would be introduced to implement the reduction in inheritance tax and the other outstanding Budget proposals. His assertion that a 'lot less' than 800 additional staff would be needed to administer the 20p rate band was strongly disputed from the opposition benches. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Treasury affairs, said the additional staff needed would make it 'the greatest job-creation element in the Budget'. He said the chancellor's proposals amounted to a 'political gamble' which offered no hope of getting Britain out of recession. The Budget and You, Weekend FT Page II</p>

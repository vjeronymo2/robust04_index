			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Life in the raw - Television Tuesdays are now bringing two more helpings of television fiction: Medics from ITV at 9.00 and, the moment that finishes at 10.00, Resnick from BBC1. The first is a series set in (perhaps you should sit down) . . . a hospital] The second - do you have a tight hold on your hat?  - is about a police detective. Where do television people find these astounding ideas? Medics was launched last year and concentrated on the private lives of a crowd of randy young doctors. Now it stars Tom Baker as a surgeon, an 'unorthodox' surgeon, naturally, who operates to music and delivers that manic grin over his theatre mask - enough to knock out any patient without benefit of anaesthetic. Charlie Resnick is, we are assured, 'an unconventional police detective'. This means he lives on gherkin and mustard sandwiches, listens to jazz and sees ghosts. There is nothing strikingly bad about either series, indeed Resnick may prove rather good. But if you want engrossing fiction you can get it from books, cinema, radio and theatre, as well as television, and the material in the older mass media is often impressive. But when it comes to non-fiction of a certain sort - showing the world we live in  - television has the edge, whether in current affairs or documentary programmes. Although much can be achieved by books, magazines and newspapers, using print and photographs - particularly if a predominantly abstract treatment is desired with more analysis than illustration - television is nearly always superior when it is a question of showing the public what is happening in some particular sphere. However, it is important that the programme makers know exactly what they are trying to do and which techniques they are going to use and, even more crucial, that they tell us. Astonishingly often, they fail in all of this and, worse, pick the wrong technique in the first place. Last week's Cutting Edge on Channel 4 was a classic example. The makers wanted to show what goes on at Summerhill, the school started 70 years ago by AS Neill, who maintained that children were naturally good, not naturally bad; it took adults to teach children to lie. Everyone, whether child or adult, has an equal vote in making the rules, and lessons are voluntary. The trouble with the programme was that, being a 'fly on the wall' study, it found no means of conveying the sort of information which most viewers consider essential. Was this a private school? If so, what were the fees? Why were so many of the children American or Japanese? Is 90 per cent of school time really occupied by union-style meetings dominated by the show-offs, or was that simply what most interested the film makers? How many children are there? What are their ages? How many staff? How many of the children take exams? Which ones? What is the success rate? The advantages of verite techniques are greatly over-rated and involve much hypocrisy, since the makers shape the end-product by their editing decisions as surely as any conventional programme-maker does. Meanwhile they relinquish the advantages of reporter, script, graphics, voice-over, and so on. 'Summerhill at 70' was a particularly striking example. Still, the irony is that reactions to the programme have been restricted almost entirely to anger about a boy with a machete, seen chasing and killing a rabbit which, it seems, was suffering from myxomatosis. The programme's one considerable achievement was in showing how the libertarian nature of Summerhill illustrates that the child is indeed father of the man, how the desire to hunt and kill animals, whether rabbits, fish, or foxes, all begins in childhood; how the possession of weapons and their use in threats and for domination are not peculiar to the Saddam Husseins or Margaret Thatchers of this world but also start in childhood. Yet what was the main reaction to the programme? Shock and outrage - what a disgraceful school where boys can kill ickle bunny-wunnies. Last week's QED also raised more questions than it answered. First, what does the return of the badly burned Simon Weston to the Falkland Islands, and his meeting with the pilot who led the attack on the Galahad, have to do with popular science, which we are told is QED's subject? And who financed the trip? No doubt many servicemen over the years have had a yen to meet their former enemies, but few would spend thousands of pounds to do it. It would be one thing for Weston to move heaven and earth to return to Argentina and find the man responsible for his wounds (however questionable, as both were acting under orders and Weston would doubtless have inflicted similar damage if he could) and for television to follow along behind. It is something else entirely if it was the bright idea of some broadcaster who fixed it all up, paid for it, and then filmed it. Of course viewers are not told that sort of thing. Worst of all, however, was a 95-minute 'documentary' called 'My Crasy Life' in BBC2's Fine Cut series, yet another programme about Los Angeles street gangs. As so often, we were told nothing about the attitudes, aims, or techniques of the programme-makers, and the whole thing conveyed a distinctly odd feeling. It was not merely that the slang and pronunciation left most of us in need of subtitles, it was something more profound. The 'rap' sessions did not look spontaneous but as though they had been semi-professionally produced, and events such as the stealing of the wallet from the white teenager felt staged. Reference to the press release brings enlightenment: the programme was 'scripted, edited, lit, acted and directed along fictional lines', the producers 'threw away the rule book, giving the gang members access to the film making process', it was 'primarily constructed from re-enacted scenes', the makers decided to shoot in a 'cool style' which allowed 'respect to the gangster'. As that last quotation suggests, it is becoming dangerously fashionable for makers of programmes, fiction and non-fiction, to indicate that they are unable to tell right from wrong. That aside, there is nothing so dreadful about the producers' techniques providing the viewers are told, but of course they were not. So, contrary to the claim above, are there no good non-fiction programmes these days? There are, of course, though current affairs series are at present dominated to an absurd degree by the election campaign. There was, however, one excellent documentary last week which proved that there are new subjects under the sun and that conventional methods can still be extraordinarily effective. 'The Story Of Elisabeth Nietzsche' in BBC2's Timewatch slot told the astonishing tale of how, a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche's sister started a racially-pure colony in the depths of the Paraguayan jungle. The descendants are still there today and the programme made good use of a visit. Tonight the second in this pair of programmes promises to explore Elisabeth Nietzsche's influence on Mussolini and Hitler, using material made available recently by the collapse of East Germany. In the end it is not technique that matters so much in non-fiction programmes, but the dedication of the programme maker, ironclad integrity, and above all a willingness to come clean with the viewer.</p>

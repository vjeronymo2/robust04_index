			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Investment may be cut 7% in 1993 WEST German companies will reduce capital investment by a real 7 per cent in 1993 following a 6 per cent cut this year, according to the Ifo economics research institute in Munich. Industry, which originally planned a small increase in spending for this year, has progressively cut budgets as business conditions have deteriorated, the institute said. The investment boom of the last few years greatly increased industrial capacity, and the current slowdown in spending was more a result of this development than general economic conditions. Despite the economies, made mostly by the smaller companies among the 2,400 surveyed, total investment this year is expected to be almost DM100bn. Only 35 per cent of the sample planned to spend more in 1993.</p>

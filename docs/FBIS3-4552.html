Meeting at a resort hotel in the Frankfurt suburb of  Kronberg, G- 7 finance ministers and central bankers reaffirmed  their support for aid to Moscow and for its economic reform  efforts, while belittling Tokyo's attempts to curb its huge  trade surplus.    Touting President Boris Yeltsin's efforts to tame inflation  and privatize the behemoth Russian economy, and flush with their  diplomatic moves to end the siege of Sarajevo, the Moscow  visitors sought a seat at the global economic table from the G-7.    They were not disappointed.    The tone was signaled by a statement from the meeting's  chairman, Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany, a country  with close ties to the former Soviet Union. The conference  closed with the G-7 agreeing to fully implement its  comprehensive 43 billion dollar Russian aid plans, according to  the statement.    But Japan, with the world's second biggest economy -- and  the  only trade surplus among the G-7 -- was told to do more to boost  domestic demand and reduce its swollen current account  imbalance, while not even getting a strong call for currency  market stability.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii headed to Germany to  reexplain Japan's recent 15 trillion yen pump-priming package,  with its 6 trillion yen in tax cuts. He and bank of Japan  Governor Yasushi Mieno sought reaffirmation that the G-7 frowns  on the currency gyrations that again sent the yen soaring  against the dollar this month after Japan-U.S. Trade talks  foundered.    The G-7 welcomed Moscow's assurances of continued reform,  reaffirmed the group's commitment to full implementation of  support measures agreed to in Tokyo in April and July, urged  Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to agree  quickly on a loan accord and expressed a willingness to support  a substantial new Russian debt rescheduling.    Japan apparently got little overt help from its G-7  partners,  which also include Britain, Canada, France and Italy. Also in  Frankfurt were representatives from Moscow and the European  Union.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Tokyo should "put  in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen  domestic demand, reduce its large trade surplus and open its  markets"    The chairman's statement lacks the reaffirmation that Japan  sought of the G-7's formulaic call for exchange rates to reflect  economic fundamentals and against erratic currency movements.    Bentsen said currency issues got little attention at the G-7  meeting or in his preceding talks with Fujii.    The yen surged after fruitless trade talks between President  Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington  on February 11 as currency dealers anticipated pressure from  U.S. authorities for a higher yen, which hobbles Japan's  export-reliant economy and theoretically blunts its trade  surplus by pricing Japanese exports out of foreign markets.    U.S. officials have denied any intention to toy with the  foreign exchange market, but the G-7 skirted exchange rate  comments and focused more blandly on general cooperation.    Still, Fujii fell back on what he called the G-7's "long  history of taking appropriate measures on rapid movements in  currency rates with monetary authorities contacting each other."  He told a press conference that Waigel "emphasized the  continuation of this process."    Central banker Mieno, who has repeatedly said that no clear  signs of a Japanese economic recovery have appeared, said global  improvements since the last G-7 meeting in September will have  "favorable effects on Japan." But Japan's economic stimulus  steps, already labeled skimpy by Washington, received less than  warm praise Saturday from the IMF, which said the package will  have limited effect on Tokyo's current account surplus.    AP-Dow Jones said Managing Director Michel Camdessus  presented an IMF report predicting that the surplus will dip to  130.3 billion dollars this year from 131.4 billion dollars in  1993, but then rise to 131.1 billion dollars in 1995, 140.9  billion dollars in 1996 and ease to 140.0 billion dollars in  1997.    The report suggests that Japan's black ink with the world  would differ little from those expectations, even without the  15.25 trillion yen pump-primer, AP-DJ said.    Some 5.4 trillion yen of the stimulus package -- such as  land  purchases for public works projects and housing and  small-enterprise loans -- will not directly spur the economy,  the IMF report says.    It says the package will nudge Japan's economy above what  would have been no real growth this year but have minimal impact  after that, with 1995 growth of 2.3 percent next year with or  without the package.    Indeed, without the package, the report charges, Japan's  1996  growth would have been 0.6 percentage point more than the  predicted 4.0 percent, while 1997 will see 5.0 percent growth  either way.    Concerns also surfaced at the G-7 meeting over lack of  Russian progress in stabilizing its economy, with the finance  leaders urging Moscow to act to curb its fiscal deficit and  inflation and promote credit creation.</p>

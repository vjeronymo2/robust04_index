			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL LABELS  </P> <P> Philip Dunne's excellent column "Pinning Down Political Labels" (Editorial  Page, July 29) pointed out the semantic absurdities going about these days.  Preposterous people, such as James Watt, are being described by equally  preposterous -- and tortured -- phrases, "radical conservative," for one.  </P> <P> A solution to this, it seems to me, would be the revival of a word which seems  to have vanished, without a trace, from the American political vocabulary,  namely: reactionary. It is not an epithet. It is a simple, direct, description  of a political viewpoint. Its return to our language would spare us the  absurdities and euphemisms which now irritate us.  </P> <P> Calling James Watt, Jesse Helms, and others too numerous to mention,  "conservatives" (no matter how you qualify the word) is about as accurate as  calling Hitler a troublemaker.  </P> <P> ELLIOTT REID  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

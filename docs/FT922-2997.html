			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: Glamour in the sun COTE D'AZUR: INVENTING THE FRENCH RIVIERA by Mary Blume Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 14.95, 208 pages 'A SUNNY Place for Shady People' was Somerset Maugham's definition of the French Riviera. When Vita Sackville-West, dressed as a man, eloped there with Violet Trefusis, she said her lover was the Mediterranean, while her husband, Harold Nicholson, was Kent. For nearly two centuries British travellers have fled our claustrophobic, cold, repressed island to invent glamorous new lives for themselves in the south. What sparked this love affair, and why does it continue today? Mary Blume's book is a cultural snapshot with an unusual focus on mainstream social history. Fast trains, free love, a new middle class and changing medical opinion all played their part in the Cote d'Azur myth. When Smollett visited Nice in 1763, his journey took 15 days and cost Pounds 120. It did not deter bronchitic Britons, who settled in droves in the early 19th century and paid the local jobless to build the Promenade des Anglais, as much to pre-empt revolutionary unrest as to accommodate the English habit of walking by the sea. From 1860, Nice was Europe's fastest growing city and the first based on a tourist economy. Cannes' star rose later, after Lord Brougham was detained there in quarantine and built an Italianate villa to pass the time. But in 1850 Monaco was still the poorest state in Europe when Francois Blanc, of the casino in Bad Homburg, set up his gambling chips, with the Pope as a major stockholder. It was all too reckless and French and naughty for the English, who formed a society for the abolition of Monte Carlo Casino. But gambling, says Ms Blume, epitomised the desire for timeless escape that enticed foreigners to the Mediterranean. 'What does one come to Monte Carlo for, if not to lose?' asked La Belle Orfeo, courtesan-lover of Edward VII and Czar Nicholas II, when she died destitute after her gambling sprees. Cannes immortalised her with the twin cupolas of the Carlton Hotel, said to be modelled on her breasts. Mary Blumes's history hovers between the academic approach of, say, John Pemble's The Mediterranean Passion and a gossipy travelogue closer in style to Peter Mayle. Pemble stopped at the Edwardian travellers; Blume continues with the story of the Train Bleu and the 1920s sun worshippers who initiated the first summer seasons - the aristocracy had always avoided high summer. The Blue Train, its interconnecting cabins scandalously inviting midnight liaisons on the way south, was known as the train of paradise. It made the Riviera more accessible and popular and inspired the Diaghilev Ballet, while its bright young passengers inspired Fitzgerald's characters Dick and Nicole Driver. 'Do you like it here?' they are asked in the Riviera in Tender is the Night. 'They have to,' a friend replies. 'They invented it.' In the same way, Mary Blume's hybrid of a book sustains the myth it analyses with elegance and verve.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan guerrilla activities monitored through 19  May.    Ranchers who for years have been paying "war taxes" to the  guerrillas have turned down a proposal by Defense Minister Mario  Enriquez to arm their workers to defend themselves against the  rebels. Arturo Guirola Batres, president of the Coordinating  Committee for Agricultural, Financial, Commercial, and  Industrial Associations, said the farmers appreciate the  proposal but feel they must reject it because it would mean  creating an army in addition to the regular one.

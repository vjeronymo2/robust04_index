			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLYSTYRENE INDUSTRY SAYS IT IS IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS, BUT NOT EVERYONE  AGREES  </P> <P> Thank you for Michael Parrish's article, "Polystyrene Foam Just Wants a Little  Respect From Environmentalists" (Nov. 11).  </P> <P> I'm sure your article on the other side of the issue will have a great impact  on the public's perception of the "styrene problem."  </P> <P> Our industry is working hard to improve the unfair image projected by some  environmental groups by reducing processing emissions, improved recycling  centers and promotion of the benefits of plastics use. We are improving the  American standard of living.  </P> <P> NORMAN G. LITZ  </P> <P> The writer is chairman of the Western Polystyrene division of the Society of  the Plastic Industry Inc. in Long Beach.  </P> <P> </P></p>

The students have demanded the professors resume  classes and suspend the 15-day-old strike.    Carlos Mazariegos, faculty secretary, has told ACAN-EFE the  200 students have agreed to call off the measure after the  professors concurred to hold an assembly to analyze the  situation.    The Medical Students Association detained the professors  last  night, local time, while they were holding an assembly at the  university. The professors have not taught classes for 15 days  in support of the doctors who are on strike nationwide in demand  of a salary increase.    This labor conflict coincides with the framework of the  partial work stoppages and strikes staged by thousands of  government workers as of four weeks ago in demand of an up to  40-percent salary increase.    The students had announced they would release the professors  once they made a commitment to resume teaching, in exchange for  student support in their public demonstrations for a better  salary.    Mazariegos has said both groups would participate in an  assembly called for by Faculty Dean Jafeth Cabrera during which  the resumption of classes next week will be analyzed.</p>

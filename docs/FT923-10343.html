			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Switchgear joint venture goes ahead A JOINT venture between Gooding, the privately owned Welsh electronics group, and Sanken Electric, the Japanese manufacturer of switchgear and transformers, is to go ahead after being delayed for two years. Gooding Sanken, in which the Welsh company has a 51 per cent stake, is to build the Pounds 2.5m second phase of a development at Abercynon in the Cynon Valley north of Cardiff, one of south Wales's unemployment blackspots. The plant will employ up to 500 workers when fully operational and production will begin next February. The intention is to replace imports from the Far East. Gooding Sanken already has a plant further up the valley in Aberdare employing 220 people making switchgear and transformers for the European market. Mr Alf Gooding, chairman of Gooding group, which employs 1,400 people in electronics factories around Cardiff, said the project 'had been delayed because of the impact of the recession' but added: 'Further delay and a failure to invest now would jeopardise the company's ability to satisfy the prospective increase in demand a year or so hence.' The Welsh Office and Welsh Development Agency have given financial assistance.</p>

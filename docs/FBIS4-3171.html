			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng said today that his visit to Uzbekistan will serve to  "further the mutual understanding, friendship and mutually  beneficial cooperation in all fields" between China and  Uzbekistan.    Li expressed the belief in a written statement released here  this afternoon upon his arrival for a three-day official visit  to Uzbekistan, the first leg of his five-Asian-nation tour. The  tour will also take him to Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan  and Mongolia.    Li said he was delighted to start his tour of Central Asia  from the ancient city of Tashkent.    The people of China and Uzbekistan have a traditional  friendship, which dates back to the times of the "silk-road", Li  said.    He recalled that Uzbek President Islam Karimov's visit to  China in 1992 "opened a new chapter" in bilateral friendly  relations, and gave a strong momentum to an in-depth and overall  growth of such ties.    China attaches importance to its relations with Uzbekistan,  respects the choice of its people, and sincerely hopes for a  lasting, stable and friendly relationship with the country based  on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, he said.    During the visit, Li will hold talks with Uzbek leaders on  bilateral relations and regional and international issues of  mutual concern.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Pounds 1.7bn of tax written off The amount of tax written off by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise has mounted steeply during the recession, according to the National Audit Office. The Inland Revenue wrote off Pounds 1.7bn last year, almost double the figure for 1991. More than three-quarters of the total is accounted for by insolvency. Customs &amp; Excise wrote off Pounds 825m of value added tax and customs duties as either remitted or irrecoverable last year, up from Pounds 553m in 1991. Most of this is also because of insolvency.</p>

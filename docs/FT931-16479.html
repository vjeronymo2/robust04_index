			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking hits the FT-SE leaders SENIOR fund managers yesterday took a closer look at the generous valuation levels built up on the UK stock market over Christmas and decided the time had come to take profits. They first showed their hands in the stock index sector and a heavy fall in the March contract on the FT-SE Index soon accelerated the setback in the underlying equities. An early gain of 7.8, taking the Footsie to a new trading peak of 2,869.3, was rapidly replaced by a loss which ranged to more than 31 points at the day's low. The final reading of 2,833.6 left the index down 27.9 on the session. Profit-taking focused on the leading stocks, and the second tier issues were slow to react to the change in market sentiment. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 13.8 up at a new peak of 2,910.2, but the day's gain had been halved by the end of the session. The diversion between the two indices appeared to reflect separate pressures from domestic and international factors. In the UK, early reports on consumer spending over Christmas have been favourable, and received further encouragement yesterday from Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer. Darker clouds, however, have appeared overseas, where hopes that this week's pressures on the French franc might spur a cut in German interest rates must await tomorrow's meeting at the Bundesbank. However, the London stock market had been bracing itself for a correction after its powerful advance during the Christmas period. UK equities, and in particular the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, were perceived as 'overbought on almost any technical criteria', said Mr Richard Kersley at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull also saw UK share valuations of around 17 times historic earnings as expensive against other global markets, and pointed out that problems facing UK equities could include tax increases in the chancellor's March budget. Determined selling of the March Footsie future set the pace for the fall in share prices, but the blaze was fanned by a revival of the rights issue worries already in the market before Christmas. Traders refused to be impressed by suggestions that Unilever or some other blue chip planned a rights issue, but believed a smaller name might attempt a fund-raising. Losses across the range of the blue chip issues were emphasised by weakness in dollar stocks, behind the US currency. A sharp rise in Seaq-reported trading volume to 769.1m shares from Monday's 606.6m indicated a return to more normal trading levels. More significantly, Stock Exchange data showed that Monday's retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.01bn. Equity volume has remained relatively high over the holiday period and now appears to be establishing itself at the Pounds 1bn-plus daily levels recorded since sterling's withdrawal from the ERM network. Strategists suggested that, in the near term, the direction of the stock market is likely to be driven by developments in stock index futures, the instrument often used by fund managers to change an underlying stance in equities. Share prices are expected to open cautiously this morning and to await their cue from the futures.</p>

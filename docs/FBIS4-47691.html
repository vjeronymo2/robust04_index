			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein May 1 SAPA -- With the African National  Congress looking set for a major victory in the [Orange] Free  State, the party's regional premiership candidate said it was  clear many whites had disregarded colour and voted ANC. "The  Orange Free State defied racial boundaries," said Patrick Terror  Lekota said on Sunday [1 May] night. This, and some black  support for formerly white parties, showed that voters in the  Free State had made decisions based on issues and not race, he  said.    This was not the view of NP [National Party] Free State  leader Kobie Coetsee, who said he was disappointed that voters  in SA's [South Africa's] first non-racial election had clearly  cast votes according to "the notion of colour".    Latest provisional figures from the Independent Electoral  Commission (IEC) on Sunday evening put the ANC well ahead with  65.9 per cent of votes polled, with the NP on 13.4 per cent.  The Democratic Party had 7.6 per cent and the Freedom Front 7.2  per cent. However, unofficial figures obtained from reliable  electoral sources, but not yet released by the IEC, indicated a  landslide ANC victory with over 80 per cent of the vote. IEC  officials said they expected a complete provisional result for  the Free State by midday on Monday.    A senior NP Free State official said the NP was disappointed  with its results and had expected to do better, especially in  the northern Free State goldfields where it concentrated its  campaign.    Reaction to the apparent ANC victory was muted in the  Bloemfontein city centre and surrounding townships on Sunday,  with residents appearing to go about their normal business. In  Freedom Square squatter camp, Jackson Mahope, 25, was watching a  soccer match Sunday afternoon and said he did not need to follow  the election results too closely. "I know who won," he said with  confidence.    Mr Lekota said many Free State whites had concentrated on  party politics and found in the ANC a program that suited them.  This would give the region a big advantage and should be  encouraged. The image of the Free State as a peaceful and  stable region should be maintained as the best way to empower  its new leadership to attract investment that was frightened  away from violence in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging].    Mr Lekota was upbeat about the region's potential for growth  and said the ANC planned to urgently begin an intensive  education programme and give immediate attention to housing. He  urged ANC supporters to behave with discipline and calm and not  to loot or cause chaos in townships and city centres when they  celebrated the final poll results. "Lets celebrate and have  champagne bottles popping, but we must respect the rights now  enshrined in the interim constitution." He appealed to police  to watch out for troublemakers and not to allow the situation to  run out of control.    The poll results indicated that the Freedom Front [FF] had  reasonable support in the Free State, Mr Lekota said, which  meant the rightwing poll boycott had failed. The FF had not,  however, got as much support as it thought it had and did not  get enough votes for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland].    The ANC was concerned that its opposition should make a  reasonable showing in the election, Mr Lekota said, so a proper  government of national unity could be formed. If not, he would  suggest the new government should insist on close consultations  with other parties when making decisions.</p>

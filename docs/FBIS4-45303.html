			<p>BFN     [Text] Narcotic drugs pose a serious threat to mankind at  present. The use of and the trafficking in drugs have become  widespread, thus causing extremely adverse effects on many  countries around the world. Therefore, the issue of narcotic  drugs has now become a problem which must be tackled by all  countries.    The above-mentioned statement was made by Souban  Salitthilat,  deputy foreign affairs minister and chairman of the Lao National  Committee for the Control and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs, at  the opening of a meeting to launch an overall plan for  controlling and suppressing narcotic drugs until the year 2000.  The meeting was held in Vientiane early this week and attended  by drug control and suppression representatives from ten  northern provinces. In his statement, Souban Salitthilat also  said: To achieve better results in suppressing narcotic drugs,  cooperation and coordination must be earnestly established  between the drug producing and using countries. If the user  countries only blame the producer countries, mutual suspicion  will be further deepened and cooperation will become designed  for unilateral interests only. The minister stressed that Laos  is ready to cooperate with all countries and international  organizations in solving this problem with its own ability and  on the basis of mutual respect for each other's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and mutual benefit.    The chairman of the Lao National Committee for the Control  and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs stressed that on the basis of  the aforementioned principle, the Lao Government, with  cooperation from the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, has mapped  out an overall plan on suppressing narcotic drugs until the year  2000. This plan spells out urgent requirements, strategy, and  policy for practical implementation. The plan consists of 16  projects, requiring a budget of U.S. $35 million to implement.  The long-term objectives of the plan are aimed at gradually  reducing the planting of poppy crops, doing away with the  planting of marijuana for commercial purposes, decreasing and  controlling the needs [of consumption] of narcotic drug users,  suppressing drug trafficking and production as well as any  illegal acts committed in violation of narcotics suppression  laws, controlling any legal activity on the use of drugs, and  providing convenience and cooperation to the international  organizations.    The Lao Government has paid close attention to enforcing our  narcotics suppression laws to suppress trafficking by  establishing a narcotics control and suppression organization  staffed with more than 20 police officers to carry out drug  suppression drives in cooperation with local police, Customs,  and postal authorities.    The Lao National Committee for the Control and Suppression  of  Narcotic Drugs was formed in 1990 under the chairmanship of  Souban and is composed of members from various state agencies,  namely the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the  Customs Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,  the Public Health Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Education  Ministry, and the Prime Minister's Office.</p>

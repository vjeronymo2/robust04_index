			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The pursuit of the millennium The appointment of nine millennium commissioners to help the UK celebrate the year 2000 has not exactly caught the nation's attention. The man or woman on the Clapham omnibus would have great difficulty in saying what they were for, let alone naming any one of them. Yet these nine commissioners will be responsible for spending almost Pounds 2bn of public money over the next seven years. The manner of their choosing and the way in which they propose to discharge their task reflect much that is tired about British public life. First, their choosing. They have, in the time-honoured way, been appointed by the crown on the recommendation of the prime minister. Like the membership of a royal commission, they have been selected to represent as many interests as possible. The Cabinet Office list of the great and the good has been raided once again. There is a Scot whose father is the largest landowner in Britain. Mr Simon Jenkins, the distinguished journalist of Welsh extraction, will guard the interests of Wales. From Northern Ireland, there is a businessman who was Olympic bobsleigh gold medallist in 1964. A property developer represents the north of England. There are two women (one from an ethnic minority) and a businessman-cum-quangocrat nominated by the leader of the opposition. The team is completed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary who chairs the commission. No visionaries These are not the visionaries who might bring original insights to the celebration of the millennium. Yet they will spend a fifth of the proceeds of the new national lottery, predicted to total about Pounds 9bn over seven years. With more than Pounds 250m a year at their disposal, the commission will enter the FT Top 40 quangos at around 22nd place. Like thousands of other government nominees on quangos who dispose of more than a fifth of public expenditure, the commissioners will be accountable only to Whitehall. The procedures they are to adopt for deciding how to spend these considerable sums conveys an uncomfortable sense of ennui. The commission will consult the wider world through a series of regional meetings with 'opinion-formers'. The composition of those groups can only be guessed at. But it is unlikely that they will produce the surge of popular enthusiasm that would generate proposals capable of leaving a mark on history or inspiring national renewal. Worthy projects Already there is a queue of worthy projects building up for a share of the funds. In London, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the South Bank Centre and the Tate Gallery are all looking for substantial sums. A South Kensington consortium including the Royal Albert Hall, the museums and Imperial College, is competing for money to turn this well-heeled London district into an arts and education centre. Outside the capital, there are proposals for a Gallery of Scottish Art, a sports arena in Manchester and an opera house for Cardiff. Such projects should be ruled out if only because they are already eligible for a share of the other four-fifths of the lottery proceeds - to be divided between the arts, sport, charities and the national heritage. The millennium fund should be used for something more exciting, to make a mark on the national consciousness. The money could be used to create a scheme to give every young person an opportunity to live in another European country for a month. Or, following Keynes's suggestion, part of it might be buried in the ground for people to find through hard work. But the decision should not be made by such a narrow group of individuals. The commissioners should conduct polls, surveys and other exercises to search out new ideas. If the nation will be riveted to its sofas for the weekly national lottery draw on television, the occasion could be used to present and debate more ambitious ideas. Viewers in their tens of thousands already use their telephones to vote in TV talent contests and to decide which celebrity should be dipped in a gunge-tank on prime time variety shows. No less is needed in celebrating this unique opportunity.</p>

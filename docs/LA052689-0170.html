			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOPPING: SOMETIMES USED IS BETTER THAN NEW  </P> <P> To the adage "never pay full price" should be added this commandment: "Buy used  whenever possible." But where can you buy good stuff cheap?  </P> <P> Some of the most dependable spots for used merchandise are the county's 10  thrift shops run by local Assistance Leagues. Donated primarily by members, the  used clothing, furnishings, toys and sports equipment are sold at rock-bottom  prices, with the money used for Assistance League charities such as day care,  dental programs, homemaking services and scholarships.  </P> <P> Scouring the clothes racks at any thrift store is like strolling down the  Memory Lane of fashion trends, where bell bottoms, granny gowns and disco-era  polyester shirts struggle for a second chance. But among the passe discards are  hidden treasures -- the timeless but forsaken trinkets that keep their rescuers  coming back for more. And every bargain hunter is hoping to hit the jackpot.  </P> <P> Each store has its own tale of how some extraordinary donations caused a flurry  of excitement. Like the time a Santa Ana Assistance League member donated a  bundle of St. John Knits dresses, which when new sell for several hundred  dollars each, and even the volunteers couldn't resist them. They were quickly  scarfed up at $75 each. Or the time in Newport Beach when a 14-foot Laser  sailboat with a trailer swiftly fetched $350.  </P> <P> But most of the merchandise is slightly used clothing and household goods.  </P> <P> According to guidelines of the National Assistance League, which oversees all  the local Assistance League shops, each store has to return more than 50% of  its income to the community.  </P> <P> "Most of the stores return far more than that," says Pat Spears, a National  Assistance League spokeswoman. "Many return about 75% or 80% to the community."  </P> <P> Each shop is staffed entirely by volunteers, who take turns manning the cash  register, maintaining the store, laundering the clothes and pricing the  donations, which vary from community to community. Each store also caters to a  slightly different crowd.  </P> <P> Jeanne Mengos, chairman of the Assistance League of Santa Ana Thrift Shop, says  her store caters to the low-income residents of the First and Flower streets  neighborhood. Here clothing, especially shoes at $1 a pair, and bric-a-brac  sell fast.  </P> <P> "First they want to clothe their children," says Mengos. "Then they want to  brighten their homes. I come in with a box of bric-a-brac and it disappears."  </P> <P> Shoppers at the Newport Beach Assistance League Thrift Shop on 32nd Street are  looking for something a little different, according to its chairman, Aileen  Schrader. The most popular items here are furniture and work outfits.  </P> <P> Schrader tells of the man who needed clothes for a job interview. Volunteers  brought out a Neiman Marcus suit in his size, and matched him up with shirt,  tie and shoes.  </P> <P> "A few weeks later he came back in and told us he got the job," she adds. "This  is the kind of thing that makes us so happy because it shows that what we do  makes a difference."  </P> <P> Schrader adds that furniture is a hot commodity at her Balboa Peninsula store  because rentals are plentiful in the area and residents are looking for  inexpensive ways to furnish apartments.  </P> <P> Volunteers say many of their customers are regulars. In Santa Ana, there is the  woman who buys several pairs of shoes nearly every day and is thought to be  selling them at swap meets. In Tustin, an elderly man methodically checks the  jewelry counter daily, only occasionally buying a bauble or two.  </P> <P> "You see the same people every day because it's like the neighborhood  department store," says Mengos of the Santa Ana store.  </P> <P> A look at four local Assistance League thrift shops in the past week turned up  the following merchandise:  </P> <P> At the Santa Ana store were men's hockey skates (size 10) for $5, new-looking  wet suits for $7, bowling ball and bag for $8.50 and a waffle baker for $6.  Cookie tins sold for 5 cents each, silk scarfs for 50 cents each and leather  gloves for $1. A new mailbox cost $8 and a blue I. Magnin women's robe (size  5-6) went for $3.50.  </P> <P> At Tustin's thrift shop were a never-used car radio for $5, Liz Claiborne jeans  for $3 and a navy L.L. Bean knit dress for $1.50. Most of the men's suits cost  $12, and ties go for 10 cents each.  </P> <P> In Orange, a new-looking pair of men's suede shoes (size 12) cost $10, a beige  leather Cherokee handbag cost $4, a Liz Claiborne shirt (medium) cost $8 and a  women's Benetton shirt (medium) cost $5.  </P> <P> In Newport Beach were a Nordstrom sweater vest for $2, ladies sun dresses for  $5, a woman's Stanley Blacker cotton suit (size 4) for $12, and a two-piece Liz  Claiborne knit dress for $8. The shop also had wedding dresses ($37.50 and up),  an exercise cycle ($40), oil paintings ($15 and up) and a good selection of  furniture and toys.  </P> <P> The county's largest Assistance League thrift shops are those in Santa Ana and  Newport Beach, according to the National Assistance League. Of the four shops  visited, the Newport Beach store had the most variety and best quality. It also  was the only store that had a large selection of furniture.  </P> <P> "We get lots of young families who are setting up housekeeping, and we're the  first place they visit," says a Newport Beach volunteer. "These days, it's hard  enough to be able to afford the rent, let alone the furnishings."  </P> <P> ASSISTANCE LEAGUE THRIFT SHOPS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> Address: 1341 W.

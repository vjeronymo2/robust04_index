			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: PhoneLink shares rise following deal with IBM SHARES IN PhoneLink rose 14p to 241p on news that the computing services company had signed a five-year marketing agreement with IBM's UK subsidiary. The agreement will enable IBM to market and promote PhoneLink's Tel-Me software in the UK. Tel-Me is software which makes it easier to extract specific information from a computer database compared with current technologies. PhoneLink joined the USM in May, placing 8.9m shares at 155p. The IBM deal had been outlined in the prospectus. Under its terms, IBM will promote and market Tel-Me to its customers, design and build a special personal computer to be marketed as the Tel-Me terminal, and load the software on all its production PCs manufactured in the UK. Mr Trevor Burke, PhoneLink's chief executive, said yesterday that from October selected customers would be testing the final version of Tel-Me in preparation for the commercial launch, expected to take place in the first quarter of 1994.</p>

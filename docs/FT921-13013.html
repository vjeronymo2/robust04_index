			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Greenalls Greenalls' decision to enfranchise Pounds 470m worth of its equity is a useful blow for UK shareholder democracy. The reason for relinquishing family control is simple enough; the company wants to tap the equity market. But it is also significant that Greenalls had already broken with its origins by getting out of brewing. Along with retailing, the brewing industry is one of the last bastions of the non-voting share. Even from a management viewpoint, non-voting equity is a two-edged instrument. In protecting against takeover, it may perhaps allow a long-term view of investment. The kind of company which needs protecting, though, is likely to bear out the stock market dictum that a long-term investment is a short-term investment gone wrong. More importantly, companies with non-voting equity are faced with the choice of living strictly within their means or accepting the risk of high gearing. A company such as GUS, which has chosen the former route, has proved a correspondingly stodgy performer. Whitbread, whose gearing is creeping upward as a result of its heavy investment programme, may have to succumb to democracy in the long run. Both companies might reflect on the fact that Greenalls' non-voting stock went up yesterday by just 1p to 398p. This is partly technical, since the exercise involves a 7 per cent dilution of the non-voting shares to compensate the voting shares for loss of influence. That apart, the market is partly bracing itself for a cash call to finance expansion, partly reflecting that Greenalls is not in any case an obvious takeover candidate. The reason is encouraging - that having freed itself from the toils of history, Greenalls can now stand on its own feet.</p>

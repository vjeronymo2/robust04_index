The National Pension Council made the recommendations in a  report to Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, the officials  said.    The council suggested that the age at which employees  qualify  for the welfare pension be gradually raised to 65 from the year  2001.    The ministry plans to submit bills on revision of the  pension  system to the current regular Diet session in mid-March for  approval, they said.    One in four people in Japan will be 65 or over by early next  century. A government survey found that nearly 70 percent of  people want to work beyond the age of 60.</p>

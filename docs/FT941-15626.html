			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Exporter hope on changing insurance European Union exporters are optimistic about their chances of forcing amendments to plans to harmonise insurance regimes governing medium- and long-term export credit, following a meeting with the European Commission. But Commission officials warned yesterday that it would be difficult at this late stage to change the minds of national governments. Member states' experts have been working on recommendations for two-and-a-half years, with the aim of eliminating distortions to trade caused by differences between export credit insurance regimes. The Commission is poised to absorb their work into a draft proposal, which would eventually be returned to EU members for formal approval. A delegation of exporters, led by Mr Keith Johnson, chairman of the British Exporters' Association, met Commission officials on Wednesday. He said yesterday that it was 'a very, very positive meeting'.</p>

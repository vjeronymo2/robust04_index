			<p>Direct-Injection   Diesel Engine   <F P=102> 94FE0402E Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Jan 94 p  2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0402E </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Yanmar Diesel Engine Co.'s direct-injection diesel  engine passed the emissions criterion of the California  Atmospheric Resources Bureau (CARB) and was approved by CARB.  The engine keeps emissions down below the CARB standard because  it has a smaller-diameter injection nozzle and improves the  manner in which air is mixed with fuel. It is the first time in  the world that a direct-injection diesel engine, in which fuel  is directly injected into the cylinder, received approval.    The engine that passed the CARB criterion was the company's  six-horsepower L70A engine, which is an improved version of the  small, air-cooled L-A series diesel engines (3.5 - 10  horsepower) that first appeared on the market in 1990. Starting  with the L-A series engines, by June, Yanmar plans to get  approval for its upright water-cooled diesel engines and  mass-produce those that meet the emissions standards.    Small, general-purpose engines with less than 25 horsepower  and engines for landscaping work will be subject to CARB's first  set of regulations, which will go into effect in January 1995.  After two years Yanmar aims to change all of its diesel engines  that are subject to the regulations. The company will also  tackle more development to deal with the even stricter second  set of regulations CARB plans to put into effect in 1999.</p>

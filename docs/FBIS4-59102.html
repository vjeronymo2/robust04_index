			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary; from the "Issues and Events" </F> feature]    [Text] While the forces of unity and democracy pursue their  military operations against the units following the orders of  the forces of apostasy and secession within the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP], which have rebelled against the constitutional  legitimacy, more officers and soldiers who have been misled  continue to join the ranks of their brothers in the brigades  defending unity and constitutional legitimacy.    Citizens in all governorates of the republic were happy to  meet the officers and soldiers who joined the forces of  legitimacy, as well as those who have given themselves up to  these forces, which are heroically and faithfully waging the  battles of honor to protect unity and defend constitutional  legitimacy.    It goes without saying that the sons of our people are  confident and certain that the end of the gang of apostasy and  secession is close. While we say this, we expect the citizens  in Aden not only to help the forces of unity, which are on the  verge of entering Aden, but to prevent the gang of apostasy and  secession from escaping and to arrest it so that it will receive  the punishment it deserves.    We urge the citizens in Aden to arrest the gang of apostasy  and secession, which has sowed corruption and exterminated  defenseless people and from whose repression and injustice  thousands have suffered over many decades, because we are  confident that the inhabitants of Aden yearn for salvation from  those who have transformed their lives into an inferno of  misery, forcing the people into deprivation and poverty. We do  not doubt for one moment that the unionists within the YSP, who  have experienced persecution and oppression at the hands of a  handful whose code of conduct consists of physical liquidation  of those who protest or criticize, will also seriously  participate in pursuing the gang of apostasy and corruption, and  will exert the utmost effort to arrest them, given that this is  a national duty dictated by genuine citizenship, and the  affiliation to the Arab and Muslim Yemeni people who are  committed to unity and democracy, and whose sons are bound  together by the strongest bonds since early history.    We thank God for the successes of the Armed Forces defending  unity and we wish them success in their military operations to  bring down the strongholds of the units taking orders from the  gang of apostasy and secession. We also express appreciation to  the officers and soldiers who continue to join the ranks of  their brothers who defend unity and constitutional legitimacy  for their concern to stand where the people want them to stand.  National duty dictates that they carry arms for the sake of  unity, to protect democracy, and impose the respect of  constitutional legitimacy.    All the citizens in Aden, whose outskirts have been reached  by the forces defending unity and constitutional legitimacy, are  dutybound to prevent the escape of the gang of apostasy and  secession, which has rebelled against constitutional legitimacy  and which has ignited an all-out war to drown the sons of the  one homeland in blood and to sow destruction and death in all  its parts. But God has frustrated their hopes. This gang has  only a few hours left before it faces the shameful fate it  deserves.</p>

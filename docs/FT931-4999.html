			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Kim steps up fight against corruption MR KIM YOUNG-SAM, the South Korean president, yesterday replaced three of his newly-appointed ministers for alleged corrupt practices, while he reshuffled the top military echelon as part of his political reform programme. The appointments were the latest in a series of actions Mr Kim, a former opposition leader, has taken in his first 10 days in office to fight corruption and remove the last vestiges of the country's authoritarian past. Mr Kim, who had promised to install a clean government, ousted three of his ministers and the new mayor of Seoul, a presidential appointee, for alleged unethical activities, such as illegal land transactions, after they were exposed by the media. The cabinet members who were appointed yesterday included Mr Kim Doo-hee, the prosecutor general, as justice minister, Ms Song Jeong-sook, a newspaper editorial writer, as minister of health and social affairs, and Mr Koh Byung-woo, chairman of the Korea Stock Exchange, as construction minister. A presidential spokesman claimed that conservative opponents of Mr Kim had leaked details of the alleged wrongdoing by the ousted cabinet ministers in an attempt to embarrass the new administration and stop the president's reform programme. Mr Kim has angered officials linked to the former military dictatorship and the previous administration of President Roh Tae-woo by appointing political reformers to the cabinet and senior positions within the ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP), while purging hardliners from the military and the national security agency. Yesterday's shake-up of the military included the replacement of Gen Kim Jin-young as the army chief of staff and Lt Gen Suh Wan-soo as the head of the defence security command, the top military intelligence agency. The two army generals were said to be closely affiliated with Mr Chun Doo-hwan, who staged a military coup in 1979 and ruled as president until 1987. The new president last week ordered the dismissal of 200 officials from the national security planning agency in a bid to curb the power of the agency, which played a prominent role in suppressing domestic dissent during the military dictatorship. Mr Kim has surprised Koreans by the aggressiveness he has shown in imposing his authority on the government and appointing his own followers to key positions despite his weak position within the DLP, which he only joined in 1990 after three decades in opposition. The new president has won wide public support for his reform programme, enjoying an approval rating of 70 per cent. His popularity has been boosted by such symbolic acts as removing security barriers around the presidential Blue House and National Assembly.</p>

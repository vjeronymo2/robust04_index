			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Lenny Kravitz - Brixton Lenny Kravitz, a one man encyclopaedia of pop, wowed them at the Academy on Saturday. This whisp of American black charisma does something so obvious that you wonder where he has been all these years. He recreates the guitar rock of the seventies, but with an up-front commitment drawn from the caring nineties. So he is Hendrix and the Jacksons one minute; and a preacher man ('Thank God for the music, not me') the next. The impact is greatest when he sings as if his life depends upon it, and rips off all those guitar riffs long left undisturbed in the vault. When he talks, in a surprisingly cultivated 'please love me' accent, the honey is laid on a bit thick. He even leads on Bob Marley's mother to show off his 'keep the faith' credentials. It makes for a totally absorbing show. I enjoyed the raunchier songs, like 'More than anything in this world', where he deals with safe pop platitudes about 'lurve', better than the communal chant of 'Let love rule', but personality cannot come in small doses. Kravitz, backed by a red blooded West Coast bands, was a revelation; catch him.</p>

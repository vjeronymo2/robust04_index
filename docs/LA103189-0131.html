			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> YOUTH SYMPHONY OPENS 25TH ANNIVERSARY SEASON  </P> <P> No boring speeches, no appeals for money, just fine music-making. With one of  its alumni as soloist, the American Youth Symphony opened its silver  anniversary season Sunday evening with a splendidly delivered Tchaikovsky  program at Royce Hall.  </P> <P> Frank Almond, who is 25 himself, brought confidence, dynamism and superb  control to the Violin Concerto. Though his playing proved more notable for  sweetness of tone than for definition and clarity, the former Juilliard student  exhibited both technical mastery of and emotional involvement.  </P> <P> The former Youth Symphony concertmaster (1983), while taking a fairly  conventional interpretive stance, certainly breathed feeling and drama into the  familiar work, and delivered myriad nuances eloquently. The orchestra matched  him in accuracy and sensitivity.  </P> <P> The Fifth Symphony served as an exciting avenue for the young musicians to show  their mettle, and for conductor Mehli Mehta to demonstrate once again how  successfully -- following the inevitable annual personnel changes -- he can  mold 100 individuals into a unified ensemble.  </P> <P> He carefully regulated balances and dynamics, allowing details to emerge  clearly and the dramatic flow of each movement to unfold logically. His strings  sounded full and vibrant, woodwinds especially expressive, and brass remarkably  vital and heroic.  </P> <P> The program opened with the Fantasy-Overture, "Romeo and Juliet," in a reading  full of passion. Again, kudos to this year's clear, precise and energized brass  section.TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

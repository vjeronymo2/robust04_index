			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUC JUDGE PROPOSES OVERHAUL OF RULES GOVERNING PHONE RATES  </P> <P> In a move opposed by business and consumer groups, a California Public  Utilities Commission administrative law judge Thursday recommended a major  overhaul in the way the telephone industry is regulated in California.  </P> <P> The recommendations, which are expected to be formally adopted with minor  modifications in the fall, would link future telephone rate changes by Pacific  Bell and General Telephone of California to the inflation rate and grant the  companies greater cost-cutting incentives and pricing flexibility.  </P> <P> Consumer and business groups representing telephone users criticized the  general thrust of the decision by Administrative Law Judge Charlotte L. Ford,  but declined to comment in detail before reviewing the 350-page judgement. "We  don't think any of these changes are necessary," said Audrie Krause, executive  director of the consumer advocacy group Toward Utility Rate Normalization  (TURN). "These recommendations don't benefit residential customers."  </P> <P> Over the past several years, local telephone rates have fallen steadily, and  groups representing telephone users say capping rates is thus of little benefit  to consumers and could ultimately result in higher costs. "I want to make  certain there are guarantees and safeguards in place," said State Senator  Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Large businesses that are heavy users of telecommunications services also  oppose changes in the current regime, and fear they will be forced -- through  the rates charged for special business services -- to shoulder the costs of  continued telephone network modernization.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell Executive Vice President Gary McBee lauded the judge's  "recognition of the need for change," and said that although the decision  differed substantially from a plan Pacific Bell had proposed, it "seems like an  acceptable way" to reach the company's goals.  </P> <P> GTE, in a prepared statement, called the proposed ruling "a positive step  towards streamlining the regulatory process and allowing telephone utilities to  be more competitive."  </P> <P> The judge's decision follows nearly two years of debate over how to reform the  complicated process by which telephone rates are regulated in the state. It  aims to establish so-called incentive regulation and limits all future  telephone rate increases to the rate of inflation minus a 4% "productivity  factor," eliminating the need for the telephone companies to justify all  changes through rigorous rate cases. If inflation in 1990 is 5%, the maximum  phone rate increase would be 1%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approval Expected  </P> <P> In return, Pacific Bell and GTE would be able to earn up to a 12.75% rate of  return on investment. Beyond that level, they could keep 50% of any profits,  with the balance refunded to customers.  </P> <P> Although the judge's decision is only a recommendation, Commission President G.  Mitchell Wilk called it a "balanced proposal that goes in the right direction  and benefits the infrastructure of the California economy." The full commission  is expected to approve the proposal with minor modifications following the  three-week comment period, and the new plan would go into effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> In California and elsewhere, telephone rates have traditionally been regulated  on the basis of the telephone company's profits, or rate-of-return. Thus,  Pacific Bell and GTE were allowed to charge whatever rates would allow them to  earn a fixed return on investment, typically between 11% and 12%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price Caps for AT&amp;T  </P> <P> Since the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and the  introduction of competition for many telecommunications services, however, the  telephone companies have maintained that such a system is inappropriate because  it gives them no incentives to improve productivity and requires time-consuming  regulatory approvals for all price changes and investment decisions.  </P> <P> At the national level, the Federal Communications Commission has already  abandoned rate-of-return regulation of AT&amp;T's long-distance business in  favor of so-called price caps, under which the company agrees to hold basic  long-distance rates stable in return for flexibility on investment and pricing  decisions.  </P></p>

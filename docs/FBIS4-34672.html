			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Ernesto Zedillo,  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) presidential candidate,  described foreign observers' participation in the upcoming  elections in Mexico as a "major step forward."    "This is the first time our electoral legislation has  recognized this type of participant. I believe this is a major  step forward," Zedillo, a 42-year-old economist who has a  doctorate degree from Yale University, said during an interview  with the Mexican newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO.    The "foreign visitors" category was incorporated this year  into legislation that allows, together with an invitation to the  United Nations, international observers to issue a technical  report on the Mexican electoral process.    Zedillo said this measure, together with new electoral  provisions, "fosters better conditions so that anyone who is  interested may witness that the Mexican elections will be an  example of legality and democratic commitment."    Approximately 45 million Mexicans carrying their electoral  card with their photograph will be called to the polls to elect  a new president and renew part of Congress on 21 August.    Zedillo also said there is no party in Mexico with the  organizational capability, structure, militancy, and social  involvement as the PRI, which has uninterruptedly governed the  country since 1929.    The presidential candidate said "Mexico is a consubstantial  part of Latin America," and that is an irreplaceable and  invaluable condition of its geographic location and the  civilization to which Mexicans belong.    "A fundamental idea that must guide Mexican politics toward  Latin America is to promote a greater cooperation toward two of  our geopolitical borders --Central America and the Caribbean."    "It is fundamental for us that cooperation prevail in that  region" so as "to maintain and improve the different mechanisms  for consultation and consensus, including the Group of Three,  the Rio Group, and the Ibero-American Conference," he added.    "It is also important to decidedly continue the promotion of  regional integration and foster the expansion and consolidation  of opportunities for free trade and economic complementariness,  as we have done with Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, and  Venezuela," he added.    Zedillo, one of the nine presidential candidates, added he  will promote an "ambitious program of reform that will provide a  tax framework that will be competitive at the international  level," if he wins.    He also said he would stimulate competition through a  greater  opening of the financial sector and promote greater deregulation  in order to expand the variety of financial services and  expedite more businessmen's access to the debt and capital  market.    In addition to Zedillo, other top contenders for the  Presidency include Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the  conservative National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of  the Party of the Democratic Revolution.</p>

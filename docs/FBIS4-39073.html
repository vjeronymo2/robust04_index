			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- We consider that  the visit of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel will not  discourage the normalization of the situation in the Southern  regions, Valeriu Senic, leader of the parliamentary bloc of  socialists, declared to BASA. Senic mentioned that the Turkish  president has manifested his best intentions, underlining his  support for the integrity and sovereignty of Moldova. In  Senic's opinion, all the assertions Demirel has made will be  treated only as an impulse toward mutual understanding. At the  same time Senic mentioned that the deputies had already received  the project of special juridical status for the Southern regions  and the Socialist Unity faction supports it. We do not consider  that the visit of the Turkish delegation will in any way  influence the adoption of this status for President Demirel  arrived after the status had already been defined stated Senic.</p>

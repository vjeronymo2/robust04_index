Sixty-six springs, summers, autumns, and winters. Sixty-six  years of wind and rain. Why is the People's Liberation Army,  which has undergone various hardships and difficulties, always  full of vigor and vitality? When you meet these crack troops  you will sense their uniquely brilliant spirit. This spirit is  the true color [ben se 2609 5331] of the old Red Army men and  the fine traditions of our Armed Forces. It is precisely  because they possess this spirit that our armed forces can  overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles and can always  march forward courageously.  <H3>  How Can Our Armed Forces Always Be Invincible in Times of  Peace? One Thing in the Basic Experience Is: Maintaining the  Fine Traditions. </H3>   Peaceful cities. Warm and fragrant rural areas. The country  is prosperous and at peace and the people live in happiness.  Peace is the hope of the people. Did not numerous martyrs give  up their lives precisely for peace today? Peace is not easy to  come by and should be treasured.    To the Armed Forces, peace is also a kind of test. Troops  can be defeated in wars and they can also be defeated in a  peaceful environment.    In the past century, the Eight Banners Troops of the Qing  Dynasty were once "as powerful as a thunderbolt and moved as  speedily as the wind." However, in times of peace, they went  downhill. Their former agility and bravery were replaced by  boastfulness and weakness. Crack troops became people who  indulged in playing with caged birds.    Lessons should be drawn from history. How should our armed  forces guard against corruption and degeneration under new  historical conditions? An important question which has a  bearing on the existence and survival and the rise and success  of our armed forces is put before the leadership of the Military  Commission.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has concerned himself very much with  the building of our armed forces. On many occasions he  earnestly asked the armed forces to carry forward the fine  traditions and to maintain the natural color of the old Red Army  men. On the eve of the 14th CPC National Congress, he again  expressed this hope to the Armed Forces.    It is true that the fine traditions of our Armed Forces,  which give expression to the unique style and features of the  People's Army, are the quintessence of the history of our Armed  Forces. With such traditions, our Armed Forces were able to  stand against powerful enemies in the years of war and to resist  the "sugar-coated bullets" after they were garrisoned in cities  and towns. Today, our Armed Forces can still depend on their  fine traditions to stand the test in a peaceful environment and  to always establish themselves in an unassailable position.    The CPC Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, have attached  great importance to this exhortation by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.  Comrade Jiang Zemin generalized the fine traditions of our  Armed Forces into 10 aspects and made systematic and profound  expositions. He asked the whole Army to raise the education on  fine traditions to a height in keeping with our times and to put  it in a strategic position. After that, Comrades Liu Huaqing  and Zhang Zhen also wrote the important article entitled:  "Carrying Forward the Fine Traditions Is an Important Question  of a Strategic Nature in the Building of Our Army in the New  Situation." Immediately afterward, the General Political  Department complied and issued some teaching materials entitled:  "Carry Forward the Fine Traditions, Maintain the True Color of  the Old Red Army."    As a result, the education on fine traditions has become a  common practice throughout the Army. A powerful spiritual  motive force has thus been added to the strong and healthy body  of our Armed Forces, making them even more vigorous.  <H3>  New Times, New Tasks--Only by Integrating the Fine  Traditions With the Spirit of the Times Can They Add Radiance to  One Another and Shine With Dazzling Splendor. </H3>   The world is in a historical period of great changes. The  reform, opening up, and economic construction in our country are  entering a new stage of development. We are living in such  times.    New times, new tasks. Are fine traditions still useful at  present? Fine traditions are faced with new challenges. Fine  traditions can have great vitality only if the spirit of the  times is added to them. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has advocated the  "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" among the whole party and  the entire Armed Forces. Comrade Jiang Zemin has also put  forward the 64- character pioneering spirit. Fine traditions  have been given a new connotation of the times and the spirit of  the times has been infused into the quintessence of fine  traditions. The organic integration of the two has produced a  tremendous propelling force in the building of our Armed Forces.    The first indication is: Leading bodies at all levels have  become stronger and more effective in improving the party's work  style and in promoting clean administration. Leading cadres at  all levels have enthusiastically responded to the call of the  Central Military Commission leadership, gradually understood the  contents of the 10 aspects of the fine traditions of our Armed  Forces, proceeded from upholding the party's absolute leadership  over the Armed Forces and, upholding the goal of wholeheartedly  serving the people, earnestly tried to solve existing problems  in the use of cadres, the use of power, the building of clean  administration, and the leadership work style, and  conscientiously undergone the tests involving "power, money, and  beautiful women."    The second indication is: Grass-roots officers and soldiers  have gradually established a correct outlook on life and a sense  of value and the cohesive force of the Armed Forces has  apparently increased. When "contrast between the Army and  various localities" was a hot topic of discussion among the  people, and some officers and soldiers had some doubts about the  value of life, the education of fine traditions showed its  unique might. The education on the outlook on life and the  sense of value has been conducted throughout the Army in a  lively and down-to-earth manner. Being faced with the  achievements of revolutionary martyrs, the officers and solders  have gradually tended to acquire a balance between individual  interests and the interests of the revolution, conscientiously  engaged in hard work, become willing to make contribution and  sacrifice, and energetically made contributions to the  modernization of our Armed Forces.    The third indication is: The fulfillment of various tasks  centering around military training has been enhanced and  fighting capacity has markedly increased. The aim of the  education on traditions is to increase the fighting capacity.  All units of the Armed Forces have made efforts to enable the  education on traditions to permeate various tasks centering  around military training and to foster in the Armed Forces the  revolutionary spirit of bearing hardships, doing hard work,  fearing no difficulties, and a willingness to shed blood and  make sacrifices. One all-powerful unit after another has left  its barracks to temper itself in the vast open country, high  mountains, thick forests, blue skies, boundless oceans, deserts,  and snowy plains.  <H3>  Fine Traditions Are Not Genetic Factors and Are Not  Automatically Inherited. The Valuable Thing Regarding  Traditions Lies in "Passing On." </H3> The number of old comrades who have participated in war has  become smaller and smaller. How can the fine traditions of our  Armed Forces be passed on and carried forward from generation to  generation? A comrade with much foresight made this wonderful  remark: Fine traditions are not genetic factors in nature and  are not automatically inherited. The valuable thing regarding  traditions lies in "passing on." "Passing on" has become a  figurative term in carrying forward fine traditions throughout  the Army.    Earnestly practice what one preaches -- "passing on."  Answering the call of the Central Military Commission  leadership, large numbers of old comrades who are still working  or who have retired have come to give lectures on, and pass on,  the traditions to young officers and soldiers of the Armed  Forces. This is the most convincing education on traditions and  is also the most effective way to pass on experience, give help,  and set an example. This is a kind of gratifying natural  replacement: The fine traditions of our Armed Forces, like  relay batons, are being passed on from the hands of the old  comrades into the hands of officers and soldiers of the new  generation.    "Passing on" through exerting a subtle influence on others.  An outstanding characteristic in the education on traditions is  to make use of visible and tangible rich historical material,  concrete historical remains, and important cultural relics so  that the officers and soldiers will be imperceptibly influenced  by what they constantly see and hear and benefit by them.  Because of this, all units of the Armed Forces have seriously  grasped the construction of hardware for the education on  traditions. One book after another has been written to be used  as teaching material, one military history exhibition hall after  another has been built, and one room of honor after another has  been renovated in companies. This visible work has created an  invisible atmosphere so that the fine traditions of our Armed  Forces are found at all time and everywhere. They are like  spring rains at night, silently moistening the hearts of the  cadres and fighters and exerting a subtle influence on them.    Constantly "passing on." What should be stressed in the  education on traditions is to carry it out constantly. Many  units have combined such education with routine work, carried  out such education in good time in view of tendentious problems,  and taken advantage of major festive activities to carry out  such education. In each barracks, people can see that officers  and soldiers often read books on fine traditions, sing songs  about fine traditions, tell stories about fine traditions, and  watch films and teleplays on fine traditions. Such incessant  instillation has enabled the officers and soldiers to constantly  deepen their understanding of fine traditions and to turn these  traditions into conscious actions.    Let the tree of fine traditions of our Armed Forces remain  green forever.</p>

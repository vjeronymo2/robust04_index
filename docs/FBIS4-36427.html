			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "An Islamic Party Takes Up Arms </F> Against the Salvation Front"]    [Text] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Some members of the Algerian  Transitional National Council members are trying to collect  signatures on a petition calling for the release of the Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] leaders and an end to the state of  emergency. The deputies trying to promote the petition say that  the aim is to "support dialogue and national reconciliation."  AL-HAYAH has learned that the party most opposed to that  petition is the Islamic "Jihad and Unity Front" which is  represented in the National Council by Nouari Bousnan (aged 41)  and Kerghali Saeed (40). Sources close to that front have told  AL-HAYAH that its leader has formed an armed battalion for  combating "terrorism" (the word used by the authorities to  describe the Salvation Front) in the province of El Bouira (120  km east of the capital), active in Rabta mountains and in  Boufadil [as transliterated] in the hills of the Kadiria  District. The same sources confirm that the security forces  have reinforced that battalion with some soldiers and that the  initial results of the combing operations "have been  encouraging." According to Algerian observers, this is the  first time an Islamic party has participated in military  operations alongside the Algerian security forces.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Arts: The lure of classical Italy - William Weaver on an exhibition touring the US When the American painter Benjamin West first saw the Apollo Belvedere during a visit to Rome in 1759, he exclaimed: 'How like a Mohawk warrior.' What did he mean? His likening that supremely elegant classic figure, clad only in a decorative cape, to an equally naked James Fenimore Cooperhero wearing war-paint and feathers, showed a very 18th-century concept of nobility and a profoundly literary attitude towards native Americans. But the reaction also shows the long association between American artists and Italy. That relationship, is explored in a carefully selected exhibition first shown at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, The Lure of Italy, American Artists and The Italian Experience 1760-1914 (it moves on to Cleveland and Houston). West, later to settle in London, is represented by several works, including a portrait of his wife and their oldest son, called Raphael, and as a further homage to the Renaissance artist, West imitated the pose of the Madonna della seggiola - a picture often copied by visiting painters to satisfy requests from art-loving customers back home. West studied other classical works in Rome, among them the Ara Pocis, whose ritual procession is echoed in his neo-classical composition, Agrippina Landing at Brindisium with the Ashes of Germanicus, painted after the artist left Italy and settled in England. His powerful patron the Archbishop of York, who had commissioned the picture, then presented it to the King, who also became a patron of West's. Foreign travellers in those days tended to give Florence short shrift while concentrating on Rome, Naples and its nearby Pompeii and Herculaneum. Italy represented classical civilisation and even in portraits, like the 1775 John Singleton Copley double portrayal of the wealthy Carolina merchant Ralph Izard and his wife, there are numerous references to Roman and Greek culture: an urn, a column, the Colosseum in the distance and, in the middle ground, the 1st century AD group of Orestes and Electra. As the 19th century began, a taste for landscape developed; and Lake Nemi, the Alban hills, the campagna with the arches of a solitary Roman aqueduct became standard ingredients of often large paintings. The tone was even more arcadian in the works of Thomas Cole and George Inness, major exponents of the Hudson River school, ready to abandon the untamed nature of wild America for Italian landscape rich in literary resonances. One of the most revealing curiosities of the exhibition is a canvas painted by three men (George Healy, Frederic Church and Jarvis McEntee) in 1871, entitled 'Arch of Titus'. The arch, framing the colosseum, is certainly the protagonist of the picture, but it also depicts two contemporary groups; one, in the right foreground, comprises the three artists; in the other shows an elderly, white-bearded man strolling with a blond young girl. They are the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his daughter Edith. Though Longfellow had unkind things to say about Italy he was a devoted scholar of Italian culture and a thoughtful translator of Dante. Appreciation of American 19th century sculpture has lagged behind studies of the painting of the period; but this exhibition devotes considerable space to the works of Horatio Greenough (a Canova-like, idealised George Washington), Thomas Crawford, William Wertmore Story, Harriet Hosmer and Randolph Rogers. Some Americans lived in Italy while remaining indifferent to modern Italy; but others shared in the turmoil and excitement of the Risorgimento years. There are occasional reflections of 19th century reality among the works to be seen: Albert Bierstadt's genre scene at the Portico d'Ottavio fish-market has a Fellinian vivacity, and Martin Johnson Heade's 'Roman Newsboys', showing two urchins against a wall with Risorgimento graffiti, is perhaps an indirect tribute to the brief Roman republic of 1848-49 , which allowed a free press and the publication of Don Pirione, the satirical sheet that the boys are selling. By the end of the century, the capital of expatriate artists had moved to Venice, where American hostesses fought over Henry James and Robert Browning, where Whistler visited briefly, as did the neo-impressionist Maurice Prendergast. The Italian-born, cosmopolitan John Singer Sargent paid long visits to Venice, as he did to Rome. The Whistlers and Sargents in this show are particularly appealing. Prepared bu Boston curator Theodore Stebbins, also responsible for the fine catalogue, The Lure of Italy opens at the Cleveland Museum in February, and in May it goes to Houston for six weeks.</p>

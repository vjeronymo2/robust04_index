			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (9): Archetypical Lyonnais - A former prime minister of France leads a crusade THE PORTLY Mr Raymond Barre, the voluble 68-year-old economics professor who has been an MP for Lyon for the past 15 years and is a former prime minister of France, is on a crusade. He is leading the campaign for the former capital of Roman Gaul to be chosen as the site for the future European Central Bank. Mr Barre is a tireless ambassador, arguing the city's cause in London, Brussels and even in front of an audience of sceptical and suspicious German bankers in Frankfurt, seat of the German Bundesbank and the most heavyweight rival for the honour. The final decision is likely to be made by European Community governments, some time after the final ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union, possible in the second half of this year, Mr Barre believes. Thanks to his efforts, Lyon has waged a much more visible campaign for the honour than other candidates such as Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Strasbourg, Luxembourg - or even Frankfurt itself. In this, Mr Barre's crusade has the discreet support of the French government, aware that attempts to attract the bank to Strasbourg, the main rival French site, is very unlikely to succeed because of the presence there of the European Parliament. The egg-headed Mr Barre looks and talks like an archetypical Lyonnais, jovial and fond of the good things of life. Yet like many French politicians his real roots are well outside his local power base; he was born in the Indian Ocean island of Reunion and he is married to a Hungarian. 'To have the bank here will be good for Lyon, for the internal balance of France and for the balance of power in Europe,' he says, taking a brief rest in his Lyon headquarters during his weekly whistle-stop tour of his inner city consituency. 'Whether we succeed or fail, there will be an advantage in it for Lyon because it will be better known internationally.' Lyon's natural claim, he says, rests on its 500-year history as a banking centre, good road, rail and air links to northern Italy and Spain and western Germany, and its position at the geographical and cultural divide between north and south Europe. He points to other international bodies which have chosen Lyon for their base for similar reasons - Interpol, the international police organisation, and Euronews, the European television news service which, symbolically, started broadcasting from Lyon at the dawn of the single European market on January 1, 1993. But why should Lyon have a claim rather than Paris? 'I have long been preoccupied by the concentration of activity in Paris. Other cities now need to become, if not as an important centre of activity as Paris, at least a balance. Lyon is, after all, the capital of the French provinces,' says Mr Barre - quoting Albert Thibaudet, the early 20th century literary critic. He uses a similar argument to justify Lyon's claim for the bank against other non-French candidates. 'All the centres of EC decision-making tend to be concentrated in northern Europe. Since the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal - economies with great potential - the south has acquired a new importance. Lyon is exactly between north and south, and belongs to both at the same time,' he says. Its close political and business links with Barcelona, Milan and the powerful German region of Baden Wurttemberg reinforce this claim. Mr Barre is far too decent a man to knock the competition, but he argues, nevertheless, that Lyon has important advantages over rival sites. Frankfurt, home to the Bundesbank, poses an obvious political problem; there would be a concentration of monetary power in German hands. Apart from that, Mr Barre sees Amsterdam as the nearest competitor, because of its banking industry and agreeable quality of life. However, the Dutch city suffers from the disadvantage of a northern position, which runs against the claim that the Euro-bank site should be at the centre of gravity of the EC's political map. Some would say that Lyon's campaign is a long shot, given the uncertainty hanging over monetary union - and, therefore, the need for a European central bank in the wake of the recent upheavals in the European Monetary System. Mr Barre is undismayed. He is among those who believe it quite possible that seven or eight European countries - Germany, Benelux, France Spain and Italy - may switch to a single European currency towards the end of the decade, leaving the rest to join the core of the new system later. Whether Mr Barre's campaign succeeds or fails, it does underline a change in French attitudes - the slight shift of power from Paris to the provinces over the past 10 years. 'I am a great partisan of decentralisation,' says Mr Barre. 'But it is not enough to create regions with powers when so much of the administration remains concentrated in Paris.'</p>

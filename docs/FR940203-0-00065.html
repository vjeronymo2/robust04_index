			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For acoustic harassment, based upon the best available information, pinnipeds and odontocetes are unlikely to be subjected to acoustic harassment due to the very low frequency and extreme brevity of the sound associated with detonations. For mysticetes, the range for the 160 dB re 1 uPa (the level above which avoidance behavior is believed to occur) increases from 86,000 ft (14.2 nm) at a water depth of 50 ft (15 m) to 121,520 ft (20 nm) at a depth of 1,000 ft (305 m). Therefore, while some mysticete cetaceans may be acoustically harassed if at these depths, it is unlikely that any impacts will accrue to the coastal zone of the SCB because of the distance from the detonation site, the shallow depths of the coastal zone and the masking effect of ambient noise ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , surf, wind, rain and/or distant shipping and other industrial activity noises).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area 1 and Area 2, while artificial, were used only for estimating the abundance of marine mammals within the test area. Refer to the EA and/or the Navy application for additional description of the methodology used in determining abundance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned because there was no method indicated that would assess the extent and/or severity of acoustic (and other) injury incurred by marine mammals in the test area. The commenter states that these types of injury would be very difficult to assess from aerial or shipboard reconnaissance. For many of the mammals that would be affected, acoustic injury could have a profound impact on their ability to navigate and on their ability to interact with other animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the possibility that acoustic injury could have significant impact, the commenter believes that there should be a more comprehensive plan for assessing the extent of acoustic injury and its impact on marine life as a result of this project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While generally agreeing with the comment, NMFS disagrees that a more comprehensive plan is necessary. Three types of injuries have been identified for marine mammals from ship shock trials. These are: (1) Lung injuries; (2) gastro intestinal injuries; and (3) eardrum (rupture) injuries. As determining the type and extent of these injuries would require capturing and either sacrificing the animal or subjecting the animal to long-term captive observation, and as both of these are unacceptable to NMFS unless the animal requires euthanization or immediate veterinary care, the Navy and NMFS will utilize less intrusive methods for determining incidental takes, including, but not necessarily limited to, photo-identifying ``injured'' marine mammals, and necropsies on stranded and other dead marine mammals to determine the probable cause of death and its relationship if any, to the trial. However, because even minimal eardrum injury is not expected to occur beyond 9,400 ft (1.5 nm), few marine mammals are expected to be impacted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters were concerned that the post-test surveys would not be able to detect all marine mammals (and fish) that are killed or seriously injured during ship shock trials, because animals might sink and not rise immediately to the surface. One commenter suggested post-detonation surveys continue for up to 1 week after the trial to search for these animals and to assess oceanographic current patterns to determine search effort. One commenter recommended that monitoring should be conducted over the long-term to document whether there is a chronic effect from the ship shock trials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS agrees with these concerns, noting that a ship shock trial is a series of one to six (usually four) charges set off approximately one week apart. Therefore, a project and its monitoring program are likely to continue for up to six weeks between the first and last detonations. As explained in detail in the application (refer particularly to Figure 31), post-detonation surveys will begin approximately 30 minutes after each detonation. The survey effort will be repeated for each scheduled test until the shock trial is completed. The 48-hour advance pre-detonation marine mammal search survey will also serve as a final post-test follow-up survey for the previous test. A post-trial follow-up survey will be conducted approximately 1 week after the last test of the shock trial. In addition, the Marine Animal Recovery Team (MART) will be required to make every effort to document and examine those injured or dead marine mammals (if any) that are moved outside the test area by currents subsequent to a detonation. Finally, NMFS will monitor the stranding records for evidence that the ship shock trials are having more than a negligible impact on the marine mammal species and stocks in the SCB. The monitoring requirements for marine mammals will be specified in the LOA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Preelection Appeal of the Forming Socialist Party Bloc of </F> Moldova and the Unity Movement for Equality of Rights]    [Text] On entering the preelection campaign, we,  representatives of the forming bloc, deem it necessary to  proclaim the principles of our political position. In the course  of the preelection campaign we will not deceive voters with  fairy tales about "democratic capitalism," the myths about  miracles of a market economy, radical reforms, or the  wonder-working possibilities offered by "doctrines of European  social-democracy" and triumphant entry into Europe through  Romania. All this is beyond the field of real possibilities  available in present-day Moldova, it is no more than just  piquant imagination or simply political smoke and mirrors.    We appeal to the historical memory, historical experience,  and historical wisdom of the people of Moldova who were placed  by hostile political forces in a very difficult socioeconomic  position, in a situation calling for selection of the forms and  content of the future social order.    Society can function effectively only on a basis of common  values. Their loss, eradication, or weakening always signals the  downfall of statehood, destruction of society and its  disintegration. That is why representatives of our bloc, having  acquired the trust of voters, shall do everything possible in  order to realize the main, triune task.  <H5>  First </H5>   Preserve and develop historically formed common values of  our  society--peace and harmony among nationalities, territorial  integrity, fraternal cooperation between people of various  nationalities, national, public ownership of land and natural  resources, principal branches of industry and agricultural  production, and wisely centralized management of the national  economic complex, as well as mutual cooperation with all  fraternal republics of the former USSR.    The Moldovan language is the most important common value and  everything possible must be done for its voluntary assimilation  by all citizens of Moldova. Bilingualism, particularly in the  cities, with widespread utilization of the Russian language,  which is spoken by virtually all persons living in Moldova, is  no less of a common value.    The worker, the person engaged in socially useful labor in  spheres of material and spiritual production and the very sphere  of labor itself definitely remain a common value. Thoughtless  and hasty reforms in that sphere on the basis of neocapitalist  ideas would be a crime.    The history of Moldova, including its Soviet period, which  is  characterized by tumultuous historically unprecedented tempos of  socioeconomic development and creation of industrial and  agricultural complexes, development of its science, and  educational and public health systems as well as culture, is and  will continue to be an undiminished common value.  <H5>  Second </H5>   Restore and develop those common values that were forfeited  in an unsubstantiated manner and primarily ones such as full  universal employment with no unemployment which is so demeaning  to human dignity, which now has not been known by entire  generations of workers, guaranteed employment for all graduates  of schools, trade schools, and secondary and higher educational  establishments, mandatory and effective social protection of  pensioners, children, young people, families with many children,  and invalids, free education and medical services, legal  protection, a state program of housing construction and  provision of housing, representation of all social groups in  legislative organs at all levels, public control of executive  power, and election of judges in people's courts and people's  assessors.    It is necessary to restore the youth policy which existed  for  many years, a system of public organizations for children and  youth supported by the state and labor collectives, which posses  exceptional historical experience in public education of the  growing generation.    Unfortunately common values that were lost in many aspects  include the most important one--that of equal rights. All  citizens of the republic must enjoy an equal status in all  vitally important situations, in all spheres of life regulated  by law.    Representatives of our future bloc do not want restoration  of  features inherent in nomenclature totalitarianism. They will  strive only for the restoration of social justice and will not  permit rejection of a single one of the social achievements  accumulated by workers over the years of struggle for their  rights.  <H5>  Third </H5>   Promote in every possible way the creation of new common  values affecting long-range development of society as well as  consolidation of traditional and evolving forms of social  interaction. This consists of a mixed economy with state control  of its commanding summits in the implementation and interaction  of state, municipal, collective, shareholder, leasing, private  and other forms of ownership; their protection against  manipulation by antisocial forces and the bureaucracy; free  privatization of housing; creation of an ecologically  comfortable living and production environment; a common search  for a new meaning of life; ideological and political variety;  priority of individual freedom without the nationalization of  the spirit and a dictatorship of the majority; search for new  forms of state building and collective responsibility for the  future; creation of a social base for new forms of domestic  socially significant entrepreneurship; establishment of a new  level of economic and geopolitical consciousness of the people  making the process of sovereignization of Moldova irreversible.    We invite all those who support the established political  task to unify their efforts under a slogan expressing the  quintessential basis of contemporary social values of our  society: "Civil harmony, national equality, social justice."    [Signed]Republic Council of the Socialist Party of Moldova.    Executive Committee of the Unity Movement    Chisinau, 22 November 1993</p>

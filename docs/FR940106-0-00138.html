			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 210-day period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The WESD, commenting on &sect;617.15(b)(2), argues that it would be a contradiction for the Department to retain the present 210-day requirement for requesting training in order to qualify for additional weeks of TRA rather than applying a movable eligibility period as used for TRA payments. The NJDL and the MESC also commented that the 210-day period should begin with the individual's most recent qualifying separation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees with these comments, and &sect;617.15(b) is revised accordingly in the final rule. This change has already been implemented through Change 2 to GAL 7&hyph;88 and reiterated in GAL 15&hyph;90, both of which were also previously published as notices in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This change is effective for decisions made on or after August 23, 1988, when the movable eligibility period took effect. However, as this change was not included in the proposed rule, a 30-day comment period is provided in this final rule. (See the explanation above in item C.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scheduled breaks in training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The UAW, commenting on &sect;617.15(d)(1), pointed out that amended section 233(f) provides that a worker shall be treated as participating in training during a week which falls in a break of 14 days or less, if the worker was participating in training before the break and ``the break is provided under such training program.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The UAW points out that the proposed rule adds the requirement that the break be ``provided in the published schedule of the training program.'' While ``publication'' might ease administration, there are some individualized training programs which do not have published schedules. Therefore, the UAW recommended that ``previously established'' schedule as an alternative formulation which would permit workers in less academic settings to continue to receive TRA as Congress intended, but prevent nonparticipating workers from arguing they were merely ``on break.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department does not believe such a narrow reading need be given to the word ``published,'' but has clarified the regulations by modifying &sect;617.15(d)(1) to add after the ``published schedule'' the words ``or previously established schedule'' and by adding that the break may be indicated in the training program approved for the individual. The intent is to ensure that ``breaks'' in training during which TRA payments may continue are not limited to regularly scheduled breaks established by the training provider before the program begins but also include all other periods of time elapsing between courses or phases of the approved training program. Therefore, the changes made in this final rule with respect to this matter go beyond the comments received, and, as explained in item F. above, a new clause (2) is added to &sect;617.15(d) to define a scheduled break in training as including scheduled breaks within or between courses, terms, quarters, semesters, and academic years, whether or not such breaks are scheduled by the training provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Before and after break.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PDLI commented that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.15(d)(1)(i) requires, in addition to other requirements, that the worker be participating in training immediately prior to the break and resume participation immediately after the break ends. The PDLI recommends that this provision might be stated better by changing the final regulation to participating in training for the week claimed prior to the beginning of the break and resuming participation for the week claimed at the end of the break.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes the commenter's suggestion would introduce some ambiguity in the wording of the regulations. However, &sect;617.15(d)(1) is revised to reflect the change announced in GAL 15&hyph;90, and set forth in Section E.3.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Payments of TRA During Breaks in Training <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90. Section 233(f) provides for the payment of basic and additional TRA ``during any week which is part of a break in training'' provided certain conditions are met. The conditions are spelled out in &sect;617.15(d)(1), clauses (i) through (iii). In addition, as a condition of TRA eligibility during the break, &sect;617.15(d)(1) is amended to restate the requirement that the worker shall be required to participate in training after the break ends. This will assure that the purpose of Section 233(f) is carried out. Section 617.15(d)(1) accordingly is modified by removing the ``resume participation'' condition from clause (i) and restating it in clause (iii), with emphasis upon ``immediate'' resumption of participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>
